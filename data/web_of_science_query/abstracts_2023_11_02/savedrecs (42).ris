TI  - Family doctors to connect <i>global concerns</i> due to climate change with <i>local actions</i>: State-of-the art and some proposals
T2  - WORLD MEDICAL & HEALTH POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change (CC) is the most challenging environmental health (EH) concern. Air pollution is closely linked to CC. However, many CC-health-related conditions (i.e., allergic diseases, asthma, hypertension, fluid and electrolyte disorders, child and adult obesity, type 2 diabetes, vector-borne diseases) are not usually counted, either because they do not cause death or require hospital admission/emergency triage. They are the vast majority of health care seeking generally treated by family doctors (FDs) and family pediatricians (FPs). FDs/FPs are often not aware of CC-health-impacts. Their potential role in tackling such a global challenge through their local influence on individual and collective attitudes and policies is not considered. Proper FD training could fill these gaps, raise awareness of their role, and implement EH FDs/FPs-based surveillance networks to collect, analyze, interpret, and report EH data to inform EH-related Policy. FDs and FPs, organized in sentinel physicians' networks, could play a key role in advising policy-makers at the local and regional level in designing interventions adapted to climate-related issues. Such experiences are rare worldwide and not well known. We will describe and discuss them in detail to share successful local examples.

TI  - Extending the Arctic sea ice freeboard and sea level record with the Sentinel-3 radar altimeters
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In February 2016 and April 2018 the European Space Agency launched the Sentinel-3A and 3B satellites respectively, as part of the European Commission's multi-satellite Copernicus Programme. Here we process Sentinel-3A waveform data to estimate Arctic sea level anomaly and radar freeboard from November 2017 to April 2018. We compare our results to those from the CryoSat-2 satellite, and find an intermission bias on sea-level anomaly of 2 cm. We also find a mean radar freeboard difference of 1 cm, which we attribute to the use of empirical retrackers to retrieve lead and floe elevations. Ahead of Sentinel-3B waveform data being made available, we use orbit files to estimate the improvement in sampling resolution afforded by the addition of Sentinel-3A and 3B data to the CryoSat-2 dataset. By combining data from the three satellites, grid resolution or time-sampling can be almost tripled compared with using CryoSat-2 data alone. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Benefits of the Open-Loop Tracking Command (OLTC): Extending conventional nadir altimetry to inland waters monitoring
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past 25 years, radar altimeters have been designed and operated primarily for ocean observation. However, over the past decade there has been a growing interest for altimetry measurements over inland waters. Studying lakes, reservoirs and rivers water level is of prime importance for the hydrology community to assess the Earth's global resources of fresh water.Satellite altimetry is key to providing such global and continuous datasets of water surface height. Indeed, much progress has been made in altimeters capability to acquire quality measurements over inland waters.In this paper we present an overview of major technical evolutions of the tracking function of altimeters, from Jason-2/POS3 and SARAL/AltiKa to Jason-3/POS3B and Sentinel-3/SRAL and the improvements brought by the Open-Loop Tracking Command (OLTC) to extend the altimeter observation domain to inland waters. The OLTC is an on-board feature used to set the altimeter waveforms reception window, containing a priori elevation information built from a dedicated database of hydrological targets. This paper focuses on the use of OLTC for acquiring reliable water signal rather than discussing the accuracy of the retrieved height, which constitutes a further step in the altimeter data processing chain.We show how Jason-3 and Sentinel-3 altimetry missions are currently able to observe and monitor about 70,000 hydrological targets over the globe and how it is contributing in building a global dataset of inland waters level, in preparation for future missions such as Sentinel-6 and the Surface Water Ocean Topography mission (SWOT).

TI  - Application of fluorescein combined with methylene blue in sentinel lymph node biopsy of breast cancer
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for axillary lymph node staging in early breast cancer has been widely recognized. The combination of radio-colloids and dye method is the best method recognized. The reagents and equipment required in the process of the combined method are complex and expensive, so there are certain restrictions in the use of primary medical institutions. As a new tracer, fluorescent tracer technology has attracted much attention. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of fluorescein for SLNB in breast cancer. In this study, a total of 123 patients with breast cancer were divided into group A (n=67) and group B (n=56). The efficacy of Indocyanine green (ICG) combined with methylene blue (group A) and fluorescein combined with methylene blue (group B) in SLNB of breast cancer was compared, complications were observed at the same time. No local or systemic reactions were observed in the two groups. In group A, Sentinel lymph nodes of breast cancer were detected in 63 patients, with a detection rate of 94.0% (63/67), a false-negative rate of 7.5% (4/53). In group B, Sentinel lymph nodes of breast cancer were detected in 52 patients, with a detection rate of 92.9% (52/56), a false-negative rate of 7.5% (3/40). There was no significant difference in biopsy results between the two groups. This prospective clinical study suggests that SLNB using fluorescein and ultraviolet LED light is feasible in breast cancer patients. No adverse reactions were observed in this study, but larger studies are needed to properly assess the adverse reaction rate.

TI  - Loco-regional therapy and the risk of breast cancer-related lymphedema: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Background This meta-analysis was designed to assess the association between two loco-regional therapies, regional nodal irradiation (RNI) and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and breast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL). Methods We searched PubMed, Science Direct, Embase, and BMJ databases for clinical studies published between January 1, 2010 and January 1, 2020, which assessed risk factors and incidence/prevalence of BCRL. Two investigators independently selected articles to extract relative data and calculate corresponding exact binomial 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In total, 93 articles were reviewed, from which 19 studies were selected. The extracted data were pooled using a random-effects mixed model. Results The incidence of lymphedema in the selected studies ranged from 3% to 36.7%, with a pooled incidence of 14.29% (95% CI 13.79-14.79). The summary odds ratio/risk ratio (OR/RR) of ALND vs. no-ALND was 3.67 (95% CI 2.25-5.98) with a heterogeneity (I-2) of 81% (P < 0.00001). After excluding the studies with an abnormally high risk of lymphedema from self-reporting, the summary hazard ratio (HR) was 2.99 (95% CI 2.44-3.66) with no heterogeneity (I-2 = 0%, P = 0.83). The summary OR/RR of patients with vs. without radiotherapy (RT) was 1.82 (95% CI 0.92-3.59), but the RR of RT to breast/chest vs. both axillary and supraclavicular areas was 2.66 (95% CI 0.73-9.70). Conclusion Regional nodal irradiation has a significantly higher risk for developing lymphedema than irradiation of the breast/chest wall. Axillary dissection and axillary RT have a similar risk for early-onset of breast cancer-related lymphoedema, although the risk trends higher for axillary dissection.

TI  - Fiducial reference systems for time and coordinates in satellite altimetry
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Time is the fundamental measurement in satellite altimetry and the key parameter in building and keeping up a long-term, consistent, and reliable record for monitoring changes in sea level. Over the years, different time scales, although interconnected, have been used in altimetry and also in satellite positioning. This sometimes leads to inexplicit descriptions and ambiguous use of time and orbit coordinates as well as of their transformations between various reference and measuring systems.Altimetry satellites, like Sentinel-3, CryoSat-2, Jason-3, HY-2A/-2B, IceSat-2, etc., observe and practically realize ranges by measuring time differences between the transmission and reception of an electromagnetic wave (either radar or laser at present). Similar principles apply for global navigation satellite systems and for their terrestrial reference systems upon which altimetry is linked and tied together. Yet, the "meter" of any terrestrial reference systems is also defined by time.This work seeks to establish a standard reference system for "time" and "coordinates" in an effort to reach uniform and absolute standardization for satellite altimetry. It describes various errors generated from differences, discontinuities and interactions in time, frequency, range, time tagging, and reference coordinate frames. A new approach, called "fiducial reference measurements for altimetry", is here given to examine ways to connect errors with metrology standards in order to improve the estimation of uncertainty budgets in ocean and water level observation by altimetry. Finally, the geocentric inertial reference system and the international atomic time are proposed in this paper for satellite altimetry observations and products. (C) 2020 COSPAR.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy guideline concordance in melanoma: Analysis of the National Cancer Database
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: This study investigated the impact of treating facility type on guideline-concordant sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) management in T1a* (defined as a Breslow depth <0.76mm without ulceration or mitoses) and T2/T3 melanoma.Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study utilizing the National Cancer Database from 2012 to 2016.Results: Our cohort included 109,432 patients. For T1a* melanomas, 85% of patients received guideline-concordant SLNB management at community and academic facilities versus 75% of patients at integrated network facilities (p < .001). Over 83% of patients with T2/T3 melanoma treated at an academic facility received guideline-concordant SLNB management versus 77% treated at a community facility (p < .001). Adjusting for demographic and clinical factors, integrated (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 0.54), and comprehensive community (aOR = 0.74) facilities were less likely to provide guideline-concordant SLNB management in patients with T1a* melanoma compared to academic facilities. Community facilities (aOR = 0.72) were less likely to provide guideline-concordant SLNB management in patients with T2/T3 melanoma compared to academic facilities.Conclusion: Academic facilities provide the highest rate of guideline-concordant sentinel lymph node management. Comparatively, community programs may underutilize SLNB in T2/T3 disease, while integrated and comprehensive community facilities may over-utilize SLNB in T1a* disease.

TI  - Neuroinflammation preceding primary central nervous system-Case and literature review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare and aggressive form of extra-nodal nonHodgkin's lymphoma. Corticosteroids cause transient regression of PCNSL at the radiological and histological level. A growing number of case reports describe histologically confirmed neuroinflammation (sentinel lesions) heralding the development of PCNSL. We present two further cases of sentinel lesions contextualised by a review of past literature. Our aims are to collate existing knowledge on sentinel lesions in PCNSL and explore their pathophysiological significance. Two cases were identified (n = 2) from a cohort of 104 patients with PCNSL referred to a tertiary neurosurgery centre. A literature search identified previously reported cases (n = 14). Median age was 57.5 (range; 26-72); pre-biopsy corticosteroid administration was reported in 50% of cases (n = 8); mean time between biopsies was 10 months (range; 3-60). Common MRI features were homogenous enhancement (10;71.4%) and T2-hyperintensity (11;100%). Histochemical analysis of sentinel lesion biopsy revealed inflammatory CD3/4/5/8-positive T-cells (14; 100%), demyelination (13; 81.3%), rare/scattered CD20-postive B-cells (11;78.6%) and CD68-positive macrophages (10;71.4%). Repeat biopsy confirmed PCNSL in all cases. Waxing and waning CNS inflammation has been identified in 16 patients ultimately diagnosed with PCNSL. Neuro-specialists should be aware of this atypical presentation and maintain a high index of suspicion for lymphoma despite histopathology negative for lymphoma when clinical or radiological features indicate PCNSL.

TI  - A coastal mean sea surface with associated errors in Norway based on new-generation altimetry
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal mean sea surface (MSS) has applications within oceanography as well as geodesy. Together with a geoid model, it forms an important component for geodetic mapping of ocean surface currents that are in geostrophic balance. Furthermore, it forms a bridge between open ocean MSS and in situ measurements of mean sea level at or close to land, it contributes to the mapping of the geoid and the marine gravity field, and it is essential for connecting tidal nautical chart datums to physical height systems or global geodetic reference frames.In this study, we determine a coastal MSS with an associated error field for Norway. The MSS is solely based on new-generation altimetry data, i.e., SAR(In) data from Sentinel-3A and CryoSat-2, as well as Ka-band data from SARAL/AltiKa. The data sets partly overlap in time and cover the time period from 2010 to 2017 inclusive. We have chosen these altimeters because they represent evolutions of conventional altimetry, with reduced footprint sizes as a main benefit. This is especially advantageous in the coastal zone, as a smaller footprint reduces the probability of radar pulses being contaminated by energy backscattered from land areas.The satellite missions were harmonized by applying inter-mission biases determined in a regional crossover analysis. Furthermore, in a zone closer to land than 25 km, we have replaced the global ocean tide model with a regional ocean tide model provided by the Norwegian Mapping Authority (NMA). We use an optimal interpolation technique to determine a coastal MSS grid and discuss it in context of the estimated error field.We assess our coastal MSS by comparison to state-of-the-art MSS products along three sections perpendicular to the coast, as well as ellipsoidal mean sea level as observed by an array of permanent tide gauges within the study area. In addition, we assess a higher-resolution version of our MSS in the NMA testbed for vertical datums, by comparison with temporary tide gauges. We find that the coastal MSS outperforms the global MSS models directly at the coast, with standard deviations of differences of similar to 8 cm to the tide gauges, compared to 14-22 cm, obtained with the global MSS models. All MSS models largely agree along three sections perpendicular to the coast, with standard deviations of differences of 2-4 cm. The higher-resolution version of the coastal MSS performs similarly to the coastal MSS in comparison with the temporary tide gauges (standard deviation of differences of similar to 8 cm), but its formal error field also quantifies large uncertainties at the coast and in the fjords, mainly due to the lack of altimetry observations. A trustworthy error field is decisive for the combination of altimetry with other sea-level observations. (C) 2019 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Improved agricultural Water management in data-scarce semi-arid watersheds: Value of integrating remotely sensed leaf area index in hydrological modeling
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In watersheds located in semi-arid regions, vegetation dynamics, evapotranspiration (ET), and associated water and energy balances collectively play a major role in controlling hydrological regimes and crop yield. As such, it is challenging to predict the complex hydrological processes and biophysical dynamics. This challenge increases in areas with limited data availability. The key objective of this study was to evaluate the direct integration of re-motely sensed Leaf Area Index (LAI) data into a hydrological model to improve streamflow, ET, and crop yield es-timates. We also demonstrated how an improved model integrated with remotely sensed LAI data can inform water managers by predicting water productivity (WP) under different irrigation schemes. We took agricultural-dominated San Joaquin Watershed in California, United States, as our testbed and integrated the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 500-m resolution 4-day total LAI data into the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model. Results showed that, compared to conventional SWAT model that relies on semi-empirical equations and user inputs for simulating biophysical processes, direct LAI integra-tion into SWAT model (SWAT-LAI) notably captured the actual vegetation dynamics and improved ET and crop yield estimations. The WP simulated by the improved SWAT-LAI model for almond and grape yields varied within a range from 0.363 to 3.81 kg/m(3) and 0.32 to 4.76 kg/m(3) across different irrigation applications. The out-comes of this study showed that deficit irrigation application could be a viable option in water stressed regions, since it can save a substantial amount of irrigation water and maintain the higher water productivity required for both almond and grape yield production. This study shows an evidence of how remotely sensed data integrated into hydrological models can serve as a decision support tool by providing quantitative information on crop water use and crop production.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Backscatter Assimilation Using Support Vector Regression or the Water Cloud Model at European Soil Moisture Sites
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 backscatter observations were assimilated into the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) using an ensemble Kalman filter. As a forward operator, which is required to simulate backscatter from soil moisture and leaf area index (LAI), we evaluated both the traditional water cloud model (WCM) and the support vector regression (SVR). With SVR, a closer fit between backscatter observations and simulations was achieved. The impact on the correlation between modeled and in situ soil moisture measurements was similar when assimilating the Sentinel data using WCM (Delta R = +0.037) or SVR (Delta R = +0.025).

TI  - The prognostic role of the pre-treatment neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and tumor depth of invasion (DOI) in early-stage squamous cell carcinomas of the oral tongue
T2  - ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY-HEIDELBERG
M3  - Review
AB  - The appropriate surgical management of early-stage oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) remains a debated topic. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of the pre-treatment neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and tumor depth of invasion (DOI) in predicting the presence of occult neck metastases in early-stage OTSCC. A retrospective analysis of patients affected by early-stage (cT1-T2 cN0) OTSCC who were submitted to elective neck dissection (END) was performed. Tumors were classified retrospectively according to the 8th TNM classification, the DOI was assessed on the pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging, and the pre-treatment NLR was calculated for each patient. A logistic regression model to estimate the probability pi (x) of cervical metastases by studying the NLR and DOI was carried out. Next, the correlation between the two variables, the NLR and DOI, was preliminarily studied. A cohort of 110 patients was analyzed (mean age, 62 years old; male to female ratio 1.2:1). The patients were staged as cT1 in 53 cases and cT2 in 57 cases. A DOI greater than 5.4 mm and a NLR greater than 2.93 are associated with an increased risk of presenting occult cervical metastases. Furthermore, the variables NLR and DOI are linearly associated with a positive correlation, proved by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient rho of 0.64, with a unitary increase in the DOI of 1 mm directly associated with an increase of 0.47 in the NLR. The DOI and NLR can be effectively used to predict the occurrence of occult neck metastasis and therefore to plan an END in early-stage OTSCC.

TI  - Modeling Conditions Appropriate for Wildfire in South East China - A Machine Learning Approach
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire is one of the most common natural hazards in the world. Fire risk estimation for the purposes of risk reduction is an important aspect in disaster studies around the world. The aim of this research was to develop a machine learning workflow process for South East China to monitor fire risks over a large region by learning from a grid file database containing a time series of several of the important environmental parameters largely extracted from remote sensing data products, and highlight areas as fire risk or non-fire risk over a couple of weeks in the future. The study employed fire threshold and the transductive PU learning method to identify reliable non-fire/negative training samples from the grid file database using fire/positive training samples, labeled using the MODIS MCD14ML fire location product. Different models were trained for the three natural vegetation land covers, namely evergreen broadleaf forest, mixed forest, and woody savannas in the study area. On the test dataset, the three models exhibited high sensitivity (>80%) by identifying the majority of fires in the test dataset for all land covers. The use of the reliable negatives identified though the fire threshold and PU learning process resulted in low precision and accuracy. During the model verification process, the model for the mixed forest land cover performed the best with 70% of verification fires falling within the classified fire zone. It was found that the better representation of mixed forest in the training samples made this model perform more reliably as compared to others. Improving the individual models constructed for different land covers and combining them can provide fire classification for a larger region. There is room to improve the spatial precision of fire cell classification. Introducing finer scale features that have higher correlation with fire activity and exhibit high spatial variability seems a viable way forward.

TI  - The 'wickedness' of governing land subsidence: Policy perspectives from urban Southeast Asia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drawing on Jakarta, Metro Manila and Singapore as case studies, we explore the paradox of slow political action in addressing subsiding land, particularly along high-density urban coastlines with empirical insights from coastal geography, geodesy analysis, geology, and urban planning. In framing land subsidence as a classic 'wicked' policy problem, and also as a hybrid geological and anthropogenic phenomenon that is unevenly experienced across urban contexts, the paper uses a three-step analysis. First, satellite-derived InSAR maps are integrated with Sentinel-1A data in order to reveal the socio-temporal variability of subsidence rates which in turn pose challenges in uniformly applying regulatory action. Second, a multi-sectoral mapping of diverse policies and practices spanning urban water supply, groundwater extraction, land use zoning, building codes, tenurial security, and land reclamation reveal the extent to which the broader coastal governance landscape remains fragmented and incongruous, particularly in arresting a multi-dimensional phenomenon such as subsidence. Finally, in reference to distinct coastal identities of each city-the 'Sinking Capital' (Jakarta), 'Fortress Singapore', and the 'Disaster Capital' (Manila) the paper illustrates how land subsidence is portrayed across the three metropolises in markedly similar ways: as a reversible, quasi-natural, and/or a highly individualized problem.

TI  - Potentials and limitations of Sentinel-3 for river discharge assessment
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of rivers is not the primary objective of the Sentinel-3 mission. The first satellite of the constellation was launched in February 2016 and so far no study has investigated the joint use of altimeter, near-infrared and thermal sensors for discharge estimation. Nevertheless, similar sensors onboard other platforms have showed their ability to estimate river discharge also in scarcely gauged areas. The advantage of altimetry lies in the observation of water surface elevation, which can be proficiently used in approaches based on rat-ing curve, empirical formulae or hydraulic modeling. Even though their use is limited, near-infrared sensors are successfully used to detect the variability of river discharge thanks to their high capacity to discriminate water from land. Thermal sensors are nearly com-pletely unused, but the unique study that uses the difference in temperature of the river water between day and night for the estimation of water level, encourages its use for river discharge assessment as well. To improve the estimation of river discharge and foster studies that are aimed at monitoring ungauged rivers, the combination of the sensors is considered a viable path. The aim of this manuscript is to review these studies to show the limitations and the potentials of each sensor onboard the Sentinel-3 satellite and to investigate the added value of using these three sensors co-located on the same platform for river discharge monitoring.

TI  - Advanced multichannel submersible probe for autonomous high-resolution <i>in situ</i> monitoring of the cycling of the potentially bioavailable fraction of a range of trace metals
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We report here on the development and application of a submersible, compact, low power consumption, integrated multichannel trace metal sensing probe (TracMetal). This probe is unique in that it allows high-resolution, simultaneous in-situ measurements of the potentially bioavailable (so-called dynamic) fraction of Hg(II), As(III), Cd(II), Pb(II), Cu(II), Zn(II). The TracMetal incorporates nanostructured Au-plated and Hg-plated gel-integrated microelectrode arrays. In addition to be selective to the fraction of metal potentially bioavailable, they offer protection against fouling and ill-controlled convective interferences. Sensitivities in the low pM for Hg(II) and sub-nM for the other target trace metals is achieved with precision <= 12%. The TracMetal is capable of autonomous operation during deployment, with routines for repetitive measurements (1-2 h 1), data storage and management, data computer visualization, and wireless data transfer. The system was successfully applied in the Arcachon Bay, to study the temporal variation of the dynamic fraction of the trace metals targeted. The in situ autonomous TracMetal measurements were combined with in situ measurements of the master biophysicochemical parameters and sample collection for complementary measurements of the dissolved metal concentrations, organic matter concentrations and proxy for biological activities. The integration of all data revealed that various biotic and abiotic processes control the temporal variation of the dynamic fractions of the target metals (Medyn). The difference in the percentage of the dynamic forms of the metals studied and the shortterm processes influencing their variation highlight the TracMetal potentiality as metal bioavailabilityassessment sentinel to achieve comprehensive environmental monitoring of dynamic aquatic systems.

TI  - From the archives of MD Anderson Cancer Center: Concurrent BCR-ABL1 and CRLF2 rearrangements in B-lymphoblast phase of chronic myeloid leukemia
T2  - ANNALS OF DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), also known as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, results in BCR-ABL1 fusion residing on the derivative chromosome 22. This translocation is characteristic of chronic myeloid leukemia, but also can occur in a substantial subset of B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cases. Ph-like B-ALL has a gene expression profile similar to that of BCR-ABL1 positive/Ph-positive B-ALL, but by definition Ph-like B-ALL does not have the sentinel BCR-ABL1 or the Ph chromosome. About half of Ph-like B-ALL cases carry CRLF2 rearrangements. Rare cases of de novo B-ALL with co-occurrence of BCR-ABL1 and CRLF2 rearrangements have been described. To our knowledge, this is the first report of concurrent BCR-ABL1 and CRLF2 rearrangements in blast phase of chronic myeloid leukemia. In this patient, CRLF2 rearrangement was acquired at the time of disease progression to B-lymphoblast phase of chronic myeloid leukemia. We also review the literature and discuss the distinct clinicopathologic, and genomic characteristics of CRLF2 rearranged B-ALL.

TI  - Water level status of Indian reservoirs: A synoptic view from altimeter observations
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the part of India is already under water-stressed condition. In this regard, the continuous monitoring of the water levels (WL) and storage capacity of reservoirs, lakes, and rivers is very important for the estimation and utilization of water resources effectively. The long term ground observed WL of many of the water bodies is not easily available, which may be very critical for proper water resources management. Satellite radar altimetry is the remote sensing technique, which is being used to study sea surface height for the last three decades. The advancement in radar technology with time has provided the opportunity to exploit the technique to retrieve the WL of inland water bodies. In the current study, an attempt has been made to generate long term time series on WL of around 29 geometrically complicated inland water bodies in India. These water bodies are mainly large reservoirs namely Ban Sagar, Balimela, Bargi, Bhakra, Gandhi Sagar, Hasdeo, Indravati, Jalaput, Kadana, Kolab, Mahi Bajaj, Maithon, Massanjore, Pong, Ramganga, Ranapratap Sagar, Rihand, Sardar Sarovar, Shivaji Sagar, Tilaiya, Ujjani, and Ukai. The WL of these water bodies was retrieved for around two decades using the European Remote-Sensing Satellite - 2 (ERS-2), ENVISAT Radar Altimeter - 2 (ENVISAT RA-2), and Saral-AltiKa altimeters data through Ice-1 retracking algorithm. Further, an attempt has also been made to estimate the WL of gauged/ungauged lakes namely Mansarovar, Pangong, Chilika, Bhopal, and Rann of Kutch over which Saral-AltiKa pass was there. As after July 2016, the SARAL-AltiKa is operating in the drifting orbit, systematic repeated observation of WL data of all reservoirs was not possible. The data of drifted tracks of Saral-AltiKa were tested for WL estimation of Ban Sagar reservoir. As the ERS-2, ENVISAT RA-2 and Saral-AltiKa all were having almost the same passing tracks, a long term WL series of these lakes could be generated from 1997 to 2016. However, at present only Sentinel - 3 is in orbit, the continuous altimeter based WL monitoring of some of these reservoirs (Gandhi Sagar, Nathsagar, Ranapratap, Ujjani, and Ukai) was attempted through Sentinel-3A satellite data from 2016 to 2018. The accuracy of the retrieved WL was than validated against the observed WL. In most of the reservoirs, a systematic bias was found due to the different characteristics and geoid height of each reservoir. The coefficient of determination, R-2, value for a majority of reser-voirs was as good as 0.9. In the case of ERS-2, the values of R-2 varied for 0.44-0.97 with root mean square error (RMSE) in the range of 0.63-2.72 m. These statistics improved with the ENVISAT RA-2 data analysis, the R-2 value reached more than 0.90 for around 11 reservoirs. The highest, 0.99, for Hasdeo and Shivaji Sagar Reservoirs with RMSE of 0.44 and 0.56, respectively. Further, the accuracy improved with the analysis of Saral-AltiKa data. The R-2 was always more than 0.9 for each reservoir and the lowest RMSE reduced to 0.03. Therefore, it can be said that the accuracy and consistency of WL retrieval through satellite altimetry has improved with time. Furthermore, the altimeter based retrieved WL may be used in hydrological studies and can contribute to better water resources management. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - vNOTES Hysterectomy with Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping for Endometrial Cancer: Description of Technique and Perioperative Outcomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Objective: To explore the technique and clinical value of transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) in hysterectomy and sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping for endometrial cancer by comparing its perioperative outcomes with those of laparoscopic staging.Design: Retrospective cohort study.Setting: Department of gynecology at a tertiary medical center.Patients: All women diagnosed with endometrial cancer who underwent minimally invasive surgery at our center between August 2017 and May 2020.Interventions: Both vNOTES and laparoscopic approaches were used for hysterectomy and SLN mapping. The success of SLN detection as well as perioperative outcomes were subsequently analyzed.Measurements and Main Results: This study included 74 patients; 23 patients underwent vNOTES surgery, whereas 51 underwent standard laparoscopic surgery. The total successful SLN detection was 95.7% in the vNOTES group and 92.2% in the laparoscopy group (p >.05), whereas the bilateral success rates were 87.0% and 90.2%, respectively. No difference in SLN detection was observed between the 2 groups in terms of the side-specific mapping efficacy quotient (91.3% vs 91.2%, p = .47). The number of harvested SLNs, operative time, estimated blood loss, and intraoperative complications in the 2 groups were similar. One (4.3%) postoperative complication occurred in the vNOTES group vs 4 (7.9%) in the laparoscopy group (p = .029), and the median postoperative hospital stay was 3 days vs 4 days (p = .003).Conclusion: This study suggests that the vNOTES procedure is feasible, with a potentially decreased postoperative hospital stay, faster recovery, and better cosmetic results. However, prospective research is needed to validate its broader clinical application. (C) 2021 AAGL. All rights reserved.

TI  - Development of a chimeric odour blend for attracting gravid malaria vectors
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundOdour-based tools targeting gravid malaria vectors may complement existing intervention strategies. Anopheles arabiensis are attracted to, and stimulated to oviposit by, natural and synthetic odours of wild and domesticated grasses associated with mosquito breeding sites. While such synthetic odour lures may be used for vector control, these may have limited efficacy when placed in direct competition with the natural source. In this study, workflows developed for plant-feeding pests was used to design and evaluate a chimeric odour blend based on shared attractive compounds found in domesticated grass odours.MethodsVariants of a synthetic odour blend, composed of shared bioactive compounds previously identified in domesticated grasses, was evaluated sequentially in a two-choice olfactometer to identify a ratio-optimized attractive blend for malaria vectors. During this process, blends with ratios that were significantly more attractive than the previously identified synthetic rice blend were compared to determine which was most attractive in the two-choice olfactometer. To determine whether all volatile components of the most attractive blend were necessary for maximal attraction, subtractive assays were then conducted, in which individual components were removed for the most attractive blend, to define the final composition of the chimeric blend. Binary logistic regression models were used to determine significance in all two-choice assays. The chimeric blend was then assessed under field conditions in malaria endemic villages in Ethiopia, to assess the effect of dose, trap type, and placement relative to ground level. Field data were analyzed both descriptively and using a Welch-corrected t-test.ResultsA ratio-optimized chimeric blend was identified that significantly attracted gravid An. arabiensis under laboratory conditions. In the field, trap captures of An. arabiensis and Anopheles pharoensis were dependent on the presence of the lure, trap type (CDC, BG Sentinel and Suna traps), placement relevant to ground level, with low release rates generally luring more mosquitoes.ConclusionsThe workflow designed for the development of chimeric lures provides an innovative strategy to target odour-mediated behaviours. The chimeric lure identified here can be used in existing trapping systems, and be customized to increase sustainability, in line with goals of the Global Vector Control Response Group.

TI  - Indus river water level monitoring using satellite radar altimetry
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimetry-based monitoring of water bodies is an advanced and cost-effective approach, mainly for regions where gauge density is low, as is the case of the Indus River in Pakistan. In this study, the potential of modern radar altimetry for inland waters was studied for measuring the Indus River water levels. For this purpose, two locations were selected near the Guddu and Sukkur Barrages on the lower Indus River, where Sentinel 3A tracks are available along with gauge data. Time series gauge data were used to validate altimetry derived water heights. An excellent fit of the two datasets (with correlations higher than 0.9) is found for both locations except a few points where altimetry heights deviate from ground observed heights. One of the possible reasons for this deviation may be the difference between the data acquiring time of the two datasets. Any barrage operation between this lag time may lead to changes in the gauge data. To overcome this problem, three-day moving averages of the gauge data were used that substantially improved the results (RMSD and ubRMSE lowered to less than 45 cm). The validation of satellite-derived water heights will lead to the possibility of observing river level changes on different segments of the river system. Other than the two at the Guddu and Sukkur barrages, 16 more Sentinel 3A and 3B tracks along the lower Indus River are available. These locations are the altimetry river monitoring virtual stations supplementing the low-frequency gauging network of the River. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A satellite-based investigation into the algae bloom variability in large water supply urban reservoirs during COVID-19 lockdown
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we report the first case study of the significant algae blooming in large reservoirs in relation to the COVID-19 lockdown in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and phycocyanin (PC) concentrations were estimated for the Guarapiranga and Billings reservoirs, which supply daily water use for over 20 million people and receives treated wastewater. We employed field-calibrated Sentinel 2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI images to map the spatial patterns of Chl-a and PC over the two periods: before the lockdown (April, August and October 2019) and after the lockdown in Sao Paulo (April 2020). We found a significant increase in algae pigments (Chl-a and PC) in both reservoirs in April 2020, compared to the same month of 2019. We show that the episodic algae blooming is strongly related to the increased inflows of the residential wastewater from the surrounding watersheds, because the household water use has increased similar to 3.2% in April 2020, while the runoff into the reservoirs driven by the rainfall was much lower in 2020 compared to the previous year for the same month. In the case of Guarapiranga Reservoir, PC increased nearly 500% in April 2020 compared to April 2019. Given the importance of Billings and Guarapiranga reservoirs for the water supply of the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo (MRSP), the abrupt occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms related to the state's lockdown should be considered a major concern for public and environmental health of the region. Although several environmental consequences have been reported due to the COVID-19 worldwide, this study is the first to report the impact of COVID-19 on the trophic state in the tropical reservoirs.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in melanoma: beyond histologic factors
T2  - CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy should be performed with the technical expertise required to correctly identify the sentinel node, in the context of understanding both the likelihood of positivity in a given patient and the prognostic significance of a positive or negative result. National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend SLN biopsy for all cutaneous melanoma patients with primary tumor thickness greater than 1 mm and in select patients with thickness between 0.8 and 1 mm, yet admit a lack of consistent clarity in its utility for prognosis and therapeutic value in tumors < 1 mm and leave the decision for undergoing the procedure up to the patient and treating physician. Recent studies have evaluated specific patient populations, tumor histopathologic characteristics, and gene expression profiling and their use in predicting SLN positivity. These data have given insight into improving the physician's ability to potentially predict SLN positivity, shedding light on if and when omission of SLN biopsy in specific patients based on clinicopathological characteristics might be appropriate. This review provides discussion and insight into these recent advancements.

TI  - Identification of nodal micrometastasis in colorectal cancer using deep learning on annotation-free whole-slide images
T2  - MODERN PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of nodal micrometastasis (tumor size: 0.2-2.0 mm) is challenging for pathologists due to the small size of metastatic foci. Since lymph nodes with micrometastasis are counted as positive nodes, detecting micrometastasis is crucial for accurate pathologic staging of colorectal cancer. Previously, deep learning algorithms developed with manually annotated images performed well in identifying micrometastasis of breast cancer in sentinel lymph nodes. However, the process of manual annotation is labor intensive and time consuming. Multiple instance learning was later used to identify metastatic breast cancer without manual annotation, but its performance appears worse in detecting micrometastasis. Here, we developed a deep learning model using whole-slide images of regional lymph nodes of colorectal cancer with only a slide-level label (either a positive or negative slide). The training, validation, and testing sets included 1963, 219, and 1000 slides, respectively. A supercomputer TAIWANIA 2 was used to train a deep learning model to identify metastasis. At slide level, our algorithm performed well in identifying both macrometastasis (tumor size > 2.0 mm) and micrometastasis with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.9993 and 0.9956, respectively. Since most of our slides had more than one lymph node, we then tested the performance of our algorithm on 538 single-lymph node images randomly cropped from the testing set. At single-lymph node level, our algorithm maintained good performance in identifying macrometastasis and micrometastasis with an AUC of 0.9944 and 0.9476, respectively. Visualization using class activation mapping confirmed that our model identified nodal metastasis based on areas of tumor cells. Our results demonstrate for the first time that micrometastasis could be detected by deep learning on whole-slide images without manual annotation.

TI  - InSAR surface deformation and numeric modeling unravel an active salt diapir in southern Romania
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt diapirism is often associated with potential hydrocarbon energy resources, and detecting active diapirs can strongly affect the prospect to discover new gas and oilfields. Here we use InSAR techniques as a proxy to evaluate surface deformation in the Diapiric Fold Zone located in the East Carpathians Bend. Significant surface uplift (similar to 5 mm/year) is identified in a relatively small region not previously known for the presence of an actively rising salt diapir. Using high-resolution two-dimensional thermomechanical numerical simulations of salt diapirs intrusions, we show that that the observed surface deformation can be induced by a relatively small salt diapir (1-2 km in diameter) rising from an initial salt layer located at <7 km depth. We constrain the salt diapir viscosity by comparing the InSAR surface deformation pattern with results from numerical simulations and our best fitting model is obtained for a salt viscosity of 1x10(17) Pa s. The best fitting model reveals the presence of a relatively small salt diapir that has not pierced yet the entire sedimentary layer and is located just 1-2 km below the surface.

TI  - Modeling seasonal sediment yields for a medium-scale temperate forest/agricultural watershed
T2  - PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - As vegetation cover senesces across temperate watersheds, the potential for soil erosion and subsequent sediment yields increases. Despite the importance of vegetation dynamics and evapotranspiration towards influencing watershed-scale hydrological processes, limited research has fully included these variables in modeling sediment yields, relying on surface runoff records alone. Focusing on the Upper Floyds Fork watershed, Kentucky, we applied a multi-objective approach utilizing MODIS-derived estimations of vegetation and evapotranspiration (ET) to calibrate the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) towards modeling seasonal sediment yields May 2019-April 2020. Results generated satisfactory error measures across all four variables (vegetation cover, ET, runoff, sediment). Above average precipitation and elevated erosive storm activity generated significant sediment yields even during months of greater vegetation coverage. Conversely, below average precipitation during Aug-Sep resulted in minimal sediment yields despite diminishing vegetation coverage. While precipitation acted as the dominant process controlling sediment yields, higher yields were also predicted in sub-watersheds as a function of steeper slopes, higher soil erodibilities and increased agricultural land cover during the dormant winter period. These findings may help identify when to expect increased sediment loads towards targeting specific sub-watersheds in managing future soil erosion, and defining and establishing best management practices in the future.

TI  - A critical and intensive review on assessment of water quality parameters through geospatial techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Evaluation of water quality is a priority work nowadays. In order to monitor and map, the water quality for a wide range on different scales (spatial, temporal), the geospatial technique has the potential to minimize the field and laboratory work. The review has emphasized the advance of remote sensing for the effectiveness of spectral analysis, bio-optical estimation, empirical method, and application of machine learning for water quality assessment. The water quality parameters (turbidity, suspended particles, chlorophyll, etc.) and their retrieval techniques are described in a scientific manner. Available satellite, bands, resolution, and spectrum ranges for specific parameters are critically described in this review with challenges in remote sensing for water quality analysis, considering non-optical active parameters. The application of statistical programmes like linear (multiple regression analysis) and non-linear approaches is discussed for better assessment of water quality. Emphasis is given on comparison between different models to increase the accuracy level of remote sensing of water quality assessment. A direction is suggested for future development in the field of estimation of water pollution assessment through geospatial techniques.

TI  - Estimating the attributable fraction of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma due to hepatitis B and C
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIRAL HEPATITIS
M3  - Article
AB  - A goal of the WHO strategy on the elimination of hepatitis as a public threat is a 65% reduction in the attributable mortality. Deaths related to hepatitis B and C infections are mostly due to decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but accurately measuring mortality is challenging as death certificates often do not capture the underlying disease. The aim of this collaborative study between European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) was to assess a WHO-developed protocol to support countries in implementing studies to collect data on the fraction of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma attributable to hepatitis B and C. Three sentinel sites (in Bulgaria, Norway and Portugal) collected data for patients first admitted or seen in their centres during 2016. Patients with cirrhosis or HCC were identified through patient files or healthcare databases using ICD-10 codes. The proportion of patients with cirrhosis and HCC who tested positive for HBV and HCV were calculated to estimate the aetiological fractions. After the pilot study was completed, each site was asked about the feasibility and acceptability of the protocol. A total of 1249 patients presenting with cirrhosis and/or HCC were evaluated across the three sites. The prevalence of HBV and HCV among cases of cirrhosis showed that in Norway and Portugal, HCV was responsible for about one-quarter of the cases, whereas in Bulgaria, HBV was more common. For HCC, HCV was responsible for more than one-third of cases in Norway and Portugal, while in Bulgaria HBV was more frequent as the underlying cause. Results obtained during the pilot study were comparable to published estimates obtained through statistical modelling or meta-analyses. Several challenges were reported from the sites involved in the pilot including the considerable time needed for reviewing the hospital records and extracting patient data. The pilot demonstrated the feasibility of collecting data on the prevalence of HBV and HCV infection among patients with cirrhosis and HCC in sentinel sites. This method can be used to estimate mortality attributable to HBV and HCV for elimination monitoring. Where easily implementable, sentinel studies are the best way to empower countries, get up-to date data and closely monitor the changes in the attributable fraction at a country level.

TI  - Volume and uncertainty estimates of on-farm reservoirs using surface reflectance and LiDAR data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of water volumes are crucial for water management. This study applies an automated methodology to detect small-scale on-farm dams and develops a novel application of Bayesian inference to jointly simulate volumes and uncertainties. A linear relationship was assumed between flooded pixel area images derived from LiDAR datasets and water index rasters derived from Sentinel 2 images. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method led to accurate estimates of water elevations and reservoir volumes, with a systematic error of about 2.5% and 10% of the maximum capacity during the study period in Keepit dam and Pamamaroo lake, respectively. Additionally, the method quantifies uncertainties of volumes. The presence of woody vegetation growing at the reservoir walls leads to a deterioration of estimates. This methodology may be used as an auditing tool in water governance schemes or to gain knowledge on water losses at the field scale.

TI  - Fabrication and measurement of fiber optic localized surface plasmon resonance sensor based on gold nanoparticle dimer
T2  - SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART A-MOLECULAR AND BIOMOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fiber optic localized surface plasmon resonance (FO LSPR) sensors capable of portable, real-time, and remote sensing are emerging with the progress of lab-on-fiber technology. However, the small area of the substrate by the optical fiber often restricts the sensitivity of the FO LSPR sensors. To improve the per-formance of the FO LSPR sensors, it is necessary to enhance the interactions between incident light and plasmonic nanostructures within a defined region. Dimer in which two nanoparticles are arranged with nanometer spacing can effectively increase the light-nanostructure interactions. It is well known that the nanogap made in the assembled nanoparticles significantly enhances the intensity of the electromagnetic field in the confined area by the hot spot effect. We fabricate the dimers of gold nanoparticles on the opti-cal fiber with benzenethiol using a method that reduces the repulsive force between the nanoparticles. In the dimers, the strong plasmonic interaction between the two nanoparticles produces a longitudinal plas-mon coupling band, which is compared to the transverse plasmon band by the monomer-based FO LSPR sensor with a similar density of gold nanoparticles. In the proposed sensor, the longitudinal band displays approximately 9.1 times improved sensitivity. When two types of sensors are applied to the biosensor application, the dimer-based FO LSPR sensor also proves an improved limit of detection of about 2.6 times. This method is expected to become a milestone in the field of measurement for small molecules and low concentration through the advancement of the yield and density of dimers. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is essential in maintaining terrestrial ecosystem functions, and understanding why and how vegetation evolves is necessary for regional ecological management. On the Tibetan Plateau, the effects of various factors and their interactions in directing vegetation change remain unclear. Supported by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, we quantified spatiotemporal vegetation variation in Gannan Prefecture on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau for 2000-2018 using trend analysis and spatial autocorrelation and explored its driving factors with a geographic detector method. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) illustrated fluctuating growth from 2000 to 2018, and the overall growth rate was 0.002/year. The spatial distributions of NDVI were variable, and areas with NDVI greater than 0.8 accounted for more than 69% of Gannan Prefecture area. From 2000 to 2018, the global Moran's index of vegetation NDVI was greater than 0.52 and showed a fluctuating upward trend, indicating that the vegetation NDVI tended to be distributed with a high spatial concentration. The local Moran's index of NDVI was mainly characterized by "High-High" and "Low-Low" clustering types, and the former increased significantly, but the latter decreased. The annual mean temperature, soil type, and elevation were the dominant factors driving vegetation NDVI change in Gannan Prefecture, explaining more than 15% of the variability. Furthermore, the influence of the interaction between any two factors on NDVI was an almost nonlinear enhancement. These results could help us improve our understanding of the underlying mechanism of NDVI changes and provide a scientific basis for ecological protection in alpine regions.

TI  - Land surface temperature and vegetation index as a proxy to microclimate
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of global climate change on the temperature of urban areas has become more pronounced in the past couple decades, impacting population and quality of life. The United Nations (UN), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have emphasized the impact of urban structures on microclimatic. A better understanding of these effects is important to formulate effective strategies that would contribute to address the impacts of increased urban growth. Here we address a case study of the Vila Rodrigues neighborhood, located in Passo Fundo City in southern Brazil to analyze the variations of emissivity, temperature and vegetation of the terrestrial surface, with influence of buildings. We employ Landsat satellite images, and unpublished data provided by the NASA, interpolated and classified in the QGIS software, using Bands 4, 5 and 10, converted to Gray Level (NC). This procedure allowed the spectral radiance of the reflectance temperature to be obtained. The Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were used, with correction of emissivity and spectral error, in the identification of the surface temperature of different areas in the Villa Rodrigues. The results showed a total variation of 3.86 degrees C among the sampled points, which is increased by the difference in significance of the thermal balance in urban areas under open sky with buildings. We suggest that green areas and parks with abundant vegetative cover and the application of new building materials in future constructions would help to improve the urban climate, and such regulation of the local temperature on global scale is an effective step towards addressing the adverse effects from climate change.

TI  - Gene Expression Profiling of Lymph Node Sub-Capsular Sinus Macrophages in Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph nodes are key lymphoid organs collecting lymph fluid and migratory cells from the tissue area they survey. When cancerous cells arise within a tissue, the sentinel lymph node is the first immunological organ to mount an immune response. Sub-capsular sinus macrophages (SSMs) are specialized macrophages residing in the lymph nodes that play important roles as gatekeepers against particulate antigenic material. In the context of cancer, SSMs capture tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (tEVs), a form of particulate antigen released in high amounts by tumor cells. We and others have recently demonstrated that SSMs possess anti-tumor activity because in their absence tumors progress faster. A comprehensive profiling of SSMs represents an important first step to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for SSM anti-tumor activity. Unfortunately, the isolation of SSMs for molecular analyses is very challenging. Here, we combined an optimized dissociation protocol, careful marker selection and stringent gating strategies to highly purify SSMs. We provide evidence of decreased T and B cell contamination, which allowed us to reveal the gene expression profile of this elusive macrophage subset. Squamous cell carcinomas induced an increase in the expression of Fc receptors, lysosomal and proteasomal enzymes in SSMs. Imaging of mouse and patient lymph nodes confirmed the presence of the top differentially expressed genes. These results suggest that SSMs respond to tumor formation by upregulating the machinery necessary for presentation of tumor particulate antigens to B cells.

TI  - Hunting as a Source of Local and Traditional Ecological Knowledge among <i>Campesinos</i> in Nicaragua
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Campesinos are the most numerous hunters in Latin America. Yet, local and traditional knowledge (LTK) among campesinos about hunting is often invisible to conservationists who perceive them as nonindigenous or illegal hunters. Moreover, research and methods for accessing campesino hunting LTK are limited in theory and practice. Conservationists therefore know little about campesinos' cultural understandings of hunting. We assessed the LTK of Nicaraguan campesinos to determine whether they shared cultural hunting knowledge. Through 11 months of ethnographic fieldwork, an ethnoecology framework, and cultural consensus analysis, we found that campesino hunting LTK was shared across the study community. This knowledge extended from a worldview that emphasized subsistence and hunting secrets to ensure bountiful harvests, expressed through folk taxonomies, hunting strategies, campesino-dog relationships, and preparation of hunted animals. Campesino hunting LTK emerged from campesino culture, yielding numerous implications for conservation in Latin America.

TI  - Seasonal Transport Pathway and Sources of Carbonaceous Aerosols at an Urban Site of Eastern Himalaya
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we examined the seasonal transport pathways of carbonaceous species [Organic Carbon (OC), Elemental Carbon (EC), Water-Soluble Organic Carbon (WSOC), Primary Organic Carbon (POC), Secondary Organic Carbon (SOC), and Total Carbonaceous Aerosols (TCAs)] of PM2.5 and PM10 over a semi-urban high-altitude site of Darjeeling (27.041oN, 88.266oE, 2200 m above mean sea level (amsl); an eastern Himalayan region), India during August 2018-July 2019. The annual average concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were 37 +/- 12 mu g m(-3) and 55 +/- 18 mu g m(-3), respectively that was within but quite close to the threshold limit of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) (annual 60 mu g m(-3) for PM10; and 40 mu g m(-3) for PM2.5). The seasonal average concentration of OC in PM2.5 was highest in pre-monsoon (4.2 +/- 1.7 mu g m(-3)) > post-monsoon (4.0 +/- 1.6 mu g m(-3)) > winter (3.3 +/- 1.5 mu g m(-3)) > monsoon (2.2 +/- 0.9 mu g m(-3)) whereas OC in PM10, in the order of highest in post-monsoon (5.9 +/- 2.4 mu g m(-3)) > winter (5.4 +/- 2.0 mu g m(-3)) > pre-monsoon (5.2 +/- 2.1 mu g m(-3)) > monsoon (3.6 +/- 0.9 mu g m(-3)). Similar seasonal variation in case of EC in both PM2.5 (winter 1.8 +/- 0.8 mu g m(-3); pre-monsoon 2.2 +/- 0.9 mu g m(-3); monsoon 1.2 +/- 0.4 mu g m(-3); post-monsoon 2.2 +/- 1.1 mu g m(-3)) and PM10 (winter 2.7 +/- 1.0 mu g m(-3); pre-monsoon 3.0 +/- 1.1 mu g m(-3); monsoon 1.2 +/- 0.4 mu g m(-3); post-monsoon 1.9 +/- 1.2 mu g m(-3)) were observed during the study period. Based on different altitudes (100, 500, 1000 m), the seasonal backward trajectory and its concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis reveal the local, Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), the Thar desert, semi-arid, central highlands, Nepal, and the Bay of Bengal (BoB) as the common pollutant transporting regions to the observational site of Darjeeling. Also, its cluster analysis at 500 m above ground level (AGL) indicates that air mass originates mainly from 3 sides [western region, Thar desert (17.6%); north-western region, Nepal (45.1%); southern region, Bangladesh (37.3%)] during the study. Due to high tourist influx in pre-monsoon (peak tourist season), the maximum contribution of carbonaceous aerosols was mainly from the vehicular sources, coal combustion, transboundary pollutants, biomass burning in the IGP region, and the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). Besides, active Terra and Aqua MODIS fire and thermal anomalies (>= 80 per cent) indicated the maximum prevalence of fire spots during pre-monsoon across India (except the Thar desert) followed by post-monsoon (due to crop-residue burning) in Punjab and Haryana.

TI  - Constructive and Destructive Processes During the 2018-2019 Eruption Episode at Shiveluch Volcano, Kamchatka, Studied From Satellite and Aerial Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dome-building volcanoes often develop by intrusion and extrusion, recurrent destabilization and sector collapses, and renewed volcanic growth inside the collapse embayment. However, details of the structural architecture affiliated with renewed volcanic activity and the influences of regional structures remain poorly understood. Here, we analyze the recent activity of Shiveluch volcano, Kamchatka Peninsula, characterized by repeated episodes of lava dome growth and destruction due to large explosions and gravity-driven collapses. We collect and process a multisensor dataset comprising high-resolution optical (aerial and tri-stereo Pleiades satellite), radar (TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X satellites), and thermal (aerial and MODIS, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 satellites) data. We investigate the evolution of the 2018-2019 eruption episode and evaluate the morphological and structural changes that led to the August 29, 2019 explosive eruption and partial dome collapse. Our results show that a new massive lava lobe gradually extruded onto the SW flank of the dome, concurrent with magmatic intrusion into the eastern dome sector, adding 0.15 km(3) to the lava dome complex. As the amphitheater infilled, new eruption craters emerged along a SW-NE alignment close to the amphitheater rim. Then, the large August 29, 2019 explosive eruption occurred, followed by partial dome collapse, which was initially directed away from this SW-NE trend. The eruption and collapse removed 0.11 km(3) of the dome edifice and led to the formation of a new central SW-NE-elongated crater with dimensions of 430 m x 490 m, a collapse scar at the eastern part of the dome, and pyroclastic density currents that traveled similar to 12 km downslope. This work sheds light on the structural architecture dominated by a SW-NE lineament and the complex interplay of volcano constructive and destructive processes. We develop a conceptual model emphasizing the relevance of structural trends, namely, 1) a SW-NE-oriented (possibly regional) structure and 2) the infilled amphitheater and its decollement surface, both of which are vital for understanding the directions of growth and collapse and for assessing the potential hazards at both Shiveluch and dome-building volcanoes elsewhere.

TI  - Directionally dependent Lambertian-equivalent reflectivity (DLER) of the Earth's surface measured by the GOME-2 satellite instruments
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we introduce the new concept of directionally dependent Lambertian-equivalent reflectivity (DLER) of the Earth's surface retrieved from satellite observations. This surface DLER describes Lambertian (isotropic) surface reflection which is extended with a dependence on the satellite viewing geometry. We apply this concept to data of the GOME-2 satellite instruments to create a global database of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface, providing surface DLER for 26 wavelength bands between 328 and 772 nm as a function of the satellite viewing angle via a second-degree polynomial parameterisation. The resolution of the database grid is 0.25 degrees by 0.25 degrees, but the real, intrinsic spatial resolution varies over the grid from 1.0 degrees by 1.0 degrees to 0.5 degrees by 0.5 degrees down to 0.25 degrees by 0.25 degrees by applying dynamic gridding techniques. The database is based on more than 10 years (2007-2018) of GOME-2 data from the MetOp-A and MetOp-B satellites.The relation between DLER and bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) surface reflectance is studied using radiative transfer simulations. For the shorter wavelengths (lambda < 500 nm), there are significant differences between the two. For instance, at 463 nm the difference can go up to 6% at 30 degrees solar zenith angle. The study also shows that, although DLER and BRDF surface reflectances have different properties, they are comparable for the longer wavelengths (lambda > 500 nm). Based on this outcome, the GOME2 surface DLER is compared with MODIS surface BRDF data from MODIS band 1 (centred around 645 nm) using both case studies and global comparisons. The conclusion of this validation is that the GOME-2 DLER compares well to MODIS BRDF data and that it does so much better than the non-directional LER database. The DLER approach for describing surface reflectivity is therefore an important improvement over the standard isotropic (non-directional) LER approaches used in the past.The GOME-2 surface DLER database can be used for the retrieval of atmospheric properties from GOME-2 and from previous satellite instruments like GOME and SCIAMACHY. It will also be used to support retrievals from the future Sentinel-5 UVNS (ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared) satellite instrument.

TI  - Restoring the top-of-atmosphere reflectance during solar eclipses: a proof of concept with the UV absorbing aerosol index measured by TROPOMI
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - During a solar eclipse the solar irradiance reaching the top of the atmosphere (TOA) is reduced in the Moon shadow. The solar irradiance is commonly measured by Earth observation satellites before the start of the solar eclipse and is not corrected for this reduction, which results in a decrease in the computed TOA reflectances. Consequently, air quality products that are derived from TOA reflectance spectra, such as the ultraviolet (UV) absorbing aerosol index (AAI), are distorted or undefined in the shadow of the Moon. The availability of air quality satellite data in the penumbral and antumbral shadow during solar eclipses, however, is of particular interest to users studying the atmospheric response to solar eclipses. Given the time and location of a point on the Earth's surface, we explain how to compute the obscuration during a solar eclipse, taking into account wavelength dependent solar limb darkening. With the calculated obscuration fractions, we restore the TOA reflectances and the AAI in the penumbral shadow during the annular solar eclipses on 26 December 2019 and 21 June 2020 measured by the TROPOMI/S5P instrument. We compare the calculated obscuration to the estimated obscuration using an uneclipsed orbit. In the corrected products, the signature of the Moon shadow disappeared, but only if wavelength-dependent solar limb darkening is taken into account. We find that the Moon shadow anomaly in the uncorrected AAI is caused by a reduction of the measured reflectance at 380 nm, rather than a colour change of the measured light. We restore common AAI features such as the sunglint and desert dust, and we confirm the restored AAI feature on 21 June 2020 at the Taklamakan Desert by measurements of the GOME-2C satellite instrument on the same day but outside the Moon shadow. No indication of local absorbing aerosol changes caused by the eclipses was found. We conclude that the correction method of this paper can be used to detect real AAI rising phenomena during a solar eclipse and has the potential to restore any other product that is derived from TOA reflectance spectra. This would resolve the solar eclipse anomalies in satellite air quality measurements in the penumbra and antumbra and would allow for studying the effect of the eclipse obscuration on the composition of the Earth's atmosphere from space.

TI  - Impact of the time interval between primary melanoma excision and sentinel node biopsy: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Obtaining a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) specimen is a standard staging procedure in the management of cutaneous melanoma. However, there is no consensus on the safe time interval between the primary melanoma biopsy procedure and the SLNB procedure.Objective: We evaluated the association between time from biopsy to SLNB and patients' outcomes for melanoma.Methods: We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis based on the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.Results: Six retrospective studies were included. Nine thousand seven hundred five patients were identified, of which 4383 underwent a SNLB procedure at a time interval defined as early and 4574 at an interval defined as late. A combined hazard ratio of 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92-1.68) was determined, and there was high heterogeneity (I-2 = 83%; P=.002) of the SLNB time interval on melanoma-specific survival. The combined HR for disease-free survival was 1.05 (95% CI 0.95-1.15), with low heterogeneity (I-2 = 9%; P=.36). Regarding overall survival, a combined HR of 1.25 (95% CI 0.92-1.70) was found, with low heterogeneity (I-2 = 37%; P=.2).Limitations: There is heterogeneity between some studies.Conclusion: There are no significant differences in patient outcome between a short interval versus a long interval between the primary biopsy procedure and obtaining a SNLB specimen.

TI  - Discrimination of Biomass-Burning Smoke From Clouds Over the Ocean Using MODIS Measurements
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Smokes from biomass burning can contribute substantial amounts of hazardous substances and carbon to the atmosphere. These substances can be transported seaward and deposited on the ocean surface. In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images are used to map the relative smoke concentration over the ocean between November 8 and 11, 2018 from the recent California fires, with the ultimate goal of developing a generally applicable approach to map smokes over oceans. Because both biomass-burning smokes and clouds can produce strong backscattering signals, two key differences are used to separate them: 1) water-vapor absorption in certain wavelengths only occurs in clouds and 2) cumulus and cirrus clouds occur at different altitudes, therefore, bearing different thermal signatures. Based on these observations, a decision-tree method is developed to separate smokes from clouds. First, MODIS top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance at 936 nm is used to detect both clouds and smokes over oceans. Then, brightness temperature derived from the 9730-nm band is used to separate cirrus from others. Finally, a water absorption depth (WAD) index is used to distinguish cumulus clouds from smokes, whose relative concentration in each image pixel is estimated from the MODIS TOA reflectance at 859 nm. Such derived smoke distribution and concentration are validated using concurrent Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite (CALIPSO) data, which provide the fine mode aerosol optical thickness (AOT) of smokes. Test of the approach over the recent Australia fires shows promising results, suggesting that the approach might be implemented by operational agencies to monitor and quantify smokes from biomass burning on a routine basis.

TI  - Domestic cats as environmental lead sentinels in low-income populations: a One Health pilot study sampling the fur of animals presented to a high-volume spay/neuter clinic
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-human animals serve as sentinels for numerous issues affecting humans, including exposure to toxic heavy metals like lead. Lead plays a role in perpetuating cycles of poverty in low-income communities due to the inequitable distributions of indoor health risks from lower-quality housing and outdoor health risks from industry and polluters, compounded by inequitable distributions of heath care and education. In this pilot study, we explore the potential for studying lead in low-income populations by partnering with nonprofit veterinary outreach programs. We investigate the lead concentration in fur samples of 85 domestic cats (Felis catus) presented to a high-volume spay/neuter clinic and report a mean of 0.723 mu g of lead per gram of fur. This study reveals new information about lead exposure in cats in the USA, including that females had greater lead exposure than males, lead exposure increased with increasing amount of access to the outdoors, and lead exposure increased in cats with decreased body condition. We propose that pet, feral, and free-roaming cats presented to high-volume spay/neuter clinics could serve as a source of data about lead exposure in disadvantaged communities where these clinics already operate. Such a non-invasive surveillance system using inert, unobtrusively obtained samples could be deployed to detect highly exposed cats, prompting to follow up contact to a cat's caretakers to recommend seeking lead testing for themselves, their families, and their neighbors.

TI  - Role of land surface parameter change in dust emission and impacts of dust on climate in Southwest Asia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial-temporal changes of land surface parameters (land cover change, net primary production, and vegetation phenology) affect the characteristics of atmospheric dust. This phenomenon subsequently will influence the climate parameters (radiative forcing, temperature, cloud, and precipitation). This research uses time-series data (2005-2015) from Regional Climate Model (RegCM) dust module simulation, WRF-Chem, meteorological data, aerosol optical depth, soil moisture, MODIS -based vegetation phenology, and net primary production to investigate the impacts of land surface parameter change on dust emission and the influence of dust on radiative forcing, heat fluxes, cloud formation, and the amount of precipitation over Southwest Asia. As the findings suggest, the southern regions of the Arabian Peninsula, southeastern Iraq, southwestern Iran, northern Arabian Peninsula, and southeastern Iran are subject to the most potent regional concentration of atmospheric dust. Our results revealed: (i) 12% of the land cover classes in southeastern Iraq and southwestern Iran were transformed into barren lands from 2005 to 2015 and subsequently these areas experienced the highest rate of dust formation, (ii) land surface changes and their consequences for dust formation have affected dust radiative forcing up to 10%, (iii) net-radiative forcing of dust always induces a state of cooling temperatures at surface, (iv) longwave forcing of dust causes a rise in heating impacts at top-of-atmosphere (TOA), so, dust aerosols have a cooling effect at the surface and heating effect at TOA, and (v) dust seems to reinforce cloud cover and cloud perceptible water, while reducing precipitation over Southwest Asia.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Opportunity to reduce paediatric asthma in New South Wales through nitrogen dioxide control
T2  - AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Objective: The main sources of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), road vehicles and electricity generation, are currently in a period of technological change. We assessed the number of cases of childhood asthma in New South Wales that could be avoided by lowering exposure to NO2 by 25% from current levels.Methods: Health impact assessment calculations for each of the 128 local government areas were based on the population of children aged 2 to 14, the prevalence of asthma derived from the 2017 NSW health survey, NO2 exposure from a land-use regression model using satellite data, and risk estimates derived from two meta-analyses and one Australian study.Results: A 25% reduction in NO2 below current exposure would lead to between 2,597 and 12,286 fewer children with asthma in NSW. The wide range in these estimates reflects the variation in concentration-response functions used.Conclusions: Even the lowest of these estimates would be a worthwhile reduction in this common childhood illness.Implications for public health: A 25% reduction in NO2 is ambitious, but it is achievable through improved vehicle exhaust standards, increasing electric vehicle numbers, and reform of the electricity sector. Current Australian ambient air quality standards for annual NO2 should be revised downwards.

TI  - Optimized approach for developing soil fugitive dust emission inventory in "2+26" Chinese cities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the wind erosion equation and the use of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite remote sensing data combined with parameter normalization processing, an optimized high spatialtemporal resolution soil fugitive dust (SFD) emission inventory compiling method was proposed in this study. The "2 + 26" cities in northern China, where heavy pollution frequently occurs, were used as a case study. Using the optimized method, we estimated that the PM50, PM10, and PM2.5 emissions from SFD of "2 + 26" cities in 2018 were 2,014,927, 1,007,463, and 151,120 tons, respectively. The dust emissions and emission factors of each city presented significant differences and were generally of a greater level in high-latitude areas (such as cities in Hebei Province) than in low-latitude areas (such as cities in Henan and Shandong Province). Moreover, with an increase in latitude, vegetation cover factors generally exhibit an upward trend, while temperature and rainfall exhibit a downward trend. The dust emissions in the different months showed significant differences. The total dust emission reached the highest level in "late winter-early spring" season (February to April), and the monthly emission accounted for 15-17% of the annual emissions. While in the "summer-autumn" season (July to November), it is the lowest level of the whole year, monthly emissions accounted for 3-5% of the annual emissions. The emission inventory method proposed in this study can provide a reference for dust emission assessment and further pollution prevention and control work.

TI  - Change analysis of water area and flood mapping using a novel water index 2020 (WI<sub>2020</sub>) for Landsat imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study deals with Landsat data for the change analysis and flood mapping using water class extraction. Among the various available bands, the most suitable band combination is identified using class separability analysis and a novel water index (WI2020) is proposed for the extraction of water. The proposed index is able to separate the water class from other land features and performs better than NDWI. The index-based results are also validated through supervised classification and used for change analysis and flood mapping. The change analysis is done in two ways, viz., from the year 2000 to 2020 in a span of 5 years in a periodic manner and from the year 2014 to 2020 in a continuous manner. The flood mapping is done on the images of 2014 and 2016 along with the pre-flood and post-flood situations with the help of WI2020 which gives quantitatively satisfactory results.

TI  - Multi-sensors data fusion approach for site-specific seeding of consumption and seed potato production
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the agronomic and economic prospects of Site-Specific Seeding (SSS) for consumption and seed potato production based on Management Zone (MZ) maps delineated with the fusion of multiple soil and crop attributes at four experimental sites in Belgium. Soil pH, organic carbon, P, K, Mg, Ca, Na, moisture content, cation exchange capacity, apparent electrical conductivity and crop normalized difference vegetation index were measured with an on-line visible and near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy sensor, electromagnetic induction sensor, and Sentinel-2 constellation, respectively. Spatial alignment of the different data layers generated a co-georeferenced data matrix for data fusion by k-means clustering. Per field MZ classes were ranked according to their fertility status and the prescription rule of sowing more seeds to the more fertile zones and vice versa was adopted and compared against a Uniform Rate Seeding (URS) treatment in a strip plot experiment. Cost-benefit analysis revealed that the SSS improved tuber yields, hence, increased gross margin (137.81 to 457.83 euro/ha) of production compared to the URS, although SSS consumed relatively higher amount of seeds. The percentage of gross margin increase varied between 2.34 and 27.21%, with the highest profitability in fields with low productivity. Larger seed-to-seed spacing than the control increased the proportion of the most demanded and profitable tuber category, suggesting the seeding interval is a key determinant of tuber size distribution. It is suggested to adopt SSS for potato production using the proposed multi-sensor data-fusion approach to manage in-field soil and crop variabilities, and improve productivity and profitability.

TI  - Trends in respiratory virus circulation following COVID-19-targeted nonpharmaceutical interventions in Germany, January - September 2020: Analysis of national surveillance data
T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: During the initial COVID-19 response, Germany's Federal Government implemented several nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that were instrumental in suppressing early exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2. NPI effect on the transmission of other respiratory viruses has not been examined at the national level thus far.Methods: Upper respiratory tract specimens from 3580 patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI), collected within the nationwide German ARI Sentinel, underwent RT-PCR diagnostics for multiple respiratory viruses. The observation period (weeks 1-38 of 2020) included the time before, during and after a far-reaching contact ban. Detection rates for different viruses were compared to 2017-2019 sentinel data (15350 samples; week 1-38, 11823 samples).Findings: The March 2020 contact ban, which was followed by a mask mandate, was associated with an unprecedented and sustained decline of multiple respiratory viruses. Among these, rhinovirus was the single agent that resurged to levels equalling those of previous years. Rhinovirus rebound was first observed in children, after schools and daycares had reopened. By contrast, other nonenveloped viruses (i.e. gastroenteritis viruses reported at the national level) suppressed after the shutdown did not rebound.Interpretation: Contact restrictions with a subsequent mask mandate in spring may substantially reduce respiratory virus circulation. This reduction appears sustained for most viruses, indicating that the activity of influenza and other respiratory viruses during the subsequent winter season might be low,whereas rhinovirus resurgence, potentially driven by transmission in educational institutions in a setting of waning population immunity, might signal predominance of rhinovirus-related ARIs.

TI  - Decadal terminus position changes and ice thickness measurement of Menthosa Glacier in Lahaul region of North-Western Himalaya
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier ice-thickness measurement and distribution is one of the essential variables to assess present status of glacier-water equivalent and its volumetric reserve as well as to model the future glacier dynamics under the climate changing scenario. Yet, substantial gaps in ice thickness information exist for the Himalayan glaciers. The present study provides a long-term assessment (1965-2016) of recessional and area change patterns, as well as the detailed field-based (2016-2017) Ground Penetrating Radar(GPR), derived ice-thickness measurement of the Menthosa Glacier, Lahaul Himalaya. Additionally, the study examines whether the modelled ice thickness from remote sensing data is consistent with the field-based GPR measurement and how can it be improved. The extensive field surveys coupled with the multi-temporal high (Corona KH-4A) to medium resolution (Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+)/Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel 2A-Multispectral Instrument (MSI)) remote sensing data and cross-sectional GPR surveyed profile measurements have been used to examine past half a century (1965-2016) glacier fluctuation and the recent ice-thickness estimations, respectively. The results show that the Menthosa Glacier receded by 301.5 +/- 19.2 m during the past half a century (1965-2016) with an average annual retreat of 5.9 +/- 0.4 m a(-1), whereas glacier lost 0.09 km(2) ice in the frontal section. Field measurement over the past one decade (2006-2017) also conforms to a continuous recessional pattern and substantial glacier degeneration particularly the extensive surface lowering and significant appearance of ice-cliffs in the ablation and lateral zones over this period. The GPR measurements (2017) show the minimum glacier ice thickness of 24 meters at 4691 m a.s.l. (in the lower part of ablation area) and maximum glacier ice thickness of 55 meters measured at 4758 m a.s.l. (in the upper left-side tributary part of ablation area). Moreover, the modelled ice thickness derived from remotely sensed data is having Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between 38 to 72 +/- 10 m as compared with GPR measured ice thickness..

TI  - Remote sensing of biodiversity: what to measure and monitor from space to species?
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Global biodiversity monitoring systems through remote sensing can support consistent assessment, monitoring, modelling and reporting on biodiversity which are key activities intended for sustainable management. This work presents an overview of biodiversity monitoring components, i.e. biodiversity levels, essential biodiversity variables, biodiversity indicators, scale, biodiversity inventory, biodiversity models, habitat, ecosystem services, vegetation health and biogeochemical heterogeneity and discusses what remote sensing through Earth Observations has contributed to the study of biodiversity. The technological advancements in remote sensing have enabled information-rich data on biodiversity. Remote sensing data are making a strong contribution in providing unique information relevant to various biodiversity research and conservation applications. The extensive use of Earth observation data are not yet realized in biodiversity assessment, monitoring and conservation. The development of direct remote sensing approaches and the techniques for quantifying biodiversity at the community to species level is likely to be a great challenge for comprehensive earth observation-based monitoring strategy.

TI  - Utilizing Geo-Social Media as a Proxy Data for Enhanced Flood Monitoring
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Social media plays an important role in disseminating spontaneous information during natural disasters/emergencies. It is a crowdsourcing platform, capable of complementing and supplementing remote sensing data in disaster mapping. Continuous monitoring of disasters such as floods from pre-stage to post stage is essential and geo-social media can attain it. The present research proposes a robust architecture to develop a social media-based near-real time flood monitoring system. In addition, our research article also emphasizes the efficient methods to process, analyse and explore multiple data dimensions of social media. A prototype model was prepared and tested on the tweets of Chennai floods 2015 to demonstrate social media potential in disaster monitoring. We implemented Natural Language Processing and Supervised Machine Learning in data processing and analysis segments of the framework by assembling various open source python libraries to develop the prototype. Initially, we built the required tweet corpus and performed pre-processing steps on it. Later, the collected tweets were geocoded with the place names available in the tweets and classified them into various flood topic related classes using Naive Bayes classifier. Subsequently, the tweets showcasing the flood condition were determined to generate a point map and a point density map to identify the flood hotspots. We verified our results with openly available 2015 Chennai flood map that is generated using remote sensing images and found positive outcome. A prototype web portal was developed to publish the results from above model as web maps. Furthermore, the portal would prove to be useful as a source for disseminating information to the public. The results prove that the proposed framework is evidently supportive in establishing a near real time monitoring system during emergencies.

TI  - Validating the regional estimates of changes in soil organic carbon by using the data from paired-sites: the case study of Mediterranean arable lands
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Legacy data are unique occasions for estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration changes and spatial variability, but their use showed limitations due to the sampling schemes adopted and improvements may be needed in the analysis methodologies. When SOC changes is estimated with legacy data, the use of soil samples collected in different plots (i.e., non-paired data) may lead to biased results. In the present work, N = 302 georeferenced soil samples were selected from a regional (Sicily, south of Italy) soil database. An operational sampling approach was developed to spot SOC concentration changes from 1994 to 2017 in the same plots at the 0-30 cm soil depth and tested. Results The measurements were conducted after computing the minimum number of samples needed to have a reliable estimate of SOC variation after 23 years. By applying an effect size based methodology, 30 out of 302 sites were resampled in 2017 to achieve a power of 80%, and an alpha = 0.05. A Wilcoxon test applied to the variation of SOC from 1994 to 2017 suggested that there was not a statistical difference in SOC concentration after 23 years (Z = - 0.556; 2-tailed asymptotic significance = 0.578). In particular, only 40% of resampled sites showed a higher SOC concentration than in 2017. Conclusions This finding contrasts with a previous SOC concentration increase that was found in 2008 (75.8% increase when estimated as differences of 2 models built with non-paired data), when compared to 1994 observed data (Z = - 9.119; 2-tailed asymptotic significance < 0.001). This suggests that the use of legacy data to estimate SOC concentration dynamics requires soil resampling in the same locations to overcome the stochastic model errors. Further experiment is needed to identify the percentage of the sites to resample in order to align two legacy datasets in the same area.

TI  - The African Network for Improved Diagnostics, Epidemiology and Management of common infectious Agents
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In sub-Saharan Africa, acute respiratory infections (ARI), acute gastrointestinal infections (GI) and acute febrile disease of unknown cause (AFDUC) have a large disease burden, especially among children, while respective aetiologies often remain unresolved. The need for robust infectious disease surveillance to detect emerging pathogens along with common human pathogens has been highlighted by the ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The African Network for Improved Diagnostics, Epidemiology and Management of Common Infectious Agents (ANDEMIA) is a sentinel surveillance study on the aetiology and clinical characteristics of ARI, GI and AFDUC in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods ANDEMIA includes 12 urban and rural health care facilities in four African countries (Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Republic of South Africa). It was piloted in 2018 in Cote d'Ivoire and the initial phase will run from 2019 to 2021. Case definitions for ARI, GI and AFDUC were established, as well as syndrome-specific sampling algorithms including the collection of blood, naso- and oropharyngeal swabs and stool. Samples are tested using comprehensive diagnostic protocols, ranging from classic bacteriology and antimicrobial resistance screening to multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems and High Throughput Sequencing. In March 2020, PCR testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and analysis of full genomic information was included in the study. Standardised questionnaires collect relevant clinical, demographic, socio-economic and behavioural data for epidemiologic analyses. Controls are enrolled over a 12-month period for a nested case-control study. Data will be assessed descriptively and aetiologies will be evaluated using a latent class analysis among cases. Among cases and controls, an integrated analytic approach using logistic regression and Bayesian estimation will be employed to improve the assessment of aetiology and associated risk factors. Discussion ANDEMIA aims to expand our understanding of ARI, GI and AFDUC aetiologies in sub-Saharan Africa using a comprehensive laboratory diagnostics strategy. It will foster early detection of emerging threats and continued monitoring of important common pathogens. The network collaboration will be strengthened and site diagnostic capacities will be reinforced to improve quality management and patient care.

TI  - Thermal acclimation increases the stability of a predator-prey interaction in warmer environments
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming over the next century is likely to alter the energy demands of consumers and thus the strengths of their interactions with their resources. The subsequent cascading effects on population biomasses could have profound effects on food web stability. One key mechanism by which organisms can cope with a changing environment is phenotypic plasticity, such as acclimation to warmer conditions through reversible changes in their physiology. Here, we measured metabolic rates and functional responses in laboratory experiments for a widespread predator-prey pair of freshwater invertebrates, sampled from across a natural stream temperature gradient in Iceland (4-18celcius). This enabled us to parameterize a Rosenzweig-MacArthur population dynamical model to study the effect of thermal acclimation on the persistence of the predator-prey pairs in response to warming. Acclimation to higher temperatures either had neutral effects or reduced the thermal sensitivity of both metabolic and feeding rates for the predator, increasing its energetic efficiency. This resulted in greater stability of population dynamics, as acclimation to higher temperatures increased the biomass of both predator and prey populations with warming. These findings indicate that phenotypic plasticity can act as a buffer against the impacts of environmental warming. As a consequence, predator-prey interactions between ectotherms may be less sensitive to future warming than previously expected, but this requires further investigation across a broader range of interacting species.

TI  - A survey of proximal methods for monitoring leaf phenology in temperate deciduous forests
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree phenology is a major driver of forestatmosphere mass and energy exchanges. Yet, tree phenology has rarely been monitored in a consistent way throughout the life of a flux-tower site. Here, we used seasonal time series of ground-based NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), RGB camera GCC (greenness chromatic coordinate), broadband NDVI, LAI (leaf area index), f APAR (fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation), CC (canopy closure), fR(vis) (fraction of reflected radiation) and GPP (gross primary productivity) to predict six phenological markers detecting the start, middle and end of budburst and of leaf senescence in a temperate deciduous forest using an asymmetric double sigmoid function (ADS) fitted to the time series. We compared them to observations of budburst and leaf senescence achieved by field phenologists over a 13-year period. GCC, NDVI and CC captured the interannual variability of spring phenology very well (R-2 >0.80) and provided the best estimates of the observed budburst dates, with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of less than 4 d. For the CC and GCC methods, mid-amplitude (50 %) threshold dates during spring phenological transition agreed well with the observed phenological dates. For the NDVI-based method, on average, the mean observed date coincides with the date when NDVI reaches 25% of its amplitude of annual variation. For the other methods, MAD ranges from 6 to 17 d. The ADS method used to derive the phenological markers provides the most biased estimates for the GPP and GCC. During the leaf senescence stage, NDVI- and CC-derived dates correlated significantly with observed dates (R-2 = 0.63 and 0.80 for NDVI and CC, respectively), with an MAD of less than 7 d. Our results show that proximal-sensing methods can be used to derive robust phenological metrics. They can be used to retrieve long-term phenological series at eddy covariance (EC) flux measurement sites and help interpret the interannual variability and trends of mass and energy exchanges.

TI  - Assessing the cooling efficiency of urban parks using data envelopment analysis and remote sensing data
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban parks can contribute to significant cooling effect for the city microclimate and, therefore, promote urban residents' outdoor thermal comfort. As the enhancement of the urban heat island effect, understanding the cooling efficiency of urban park and associated determinants has become critical for maximizing the ecological benefits of urban ecological infrastructure. In this paper, we measured holistically the cooling efficiency of urban parks from a relative and absolute perspective by using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS satellite imageries. We adopted two novel cooling effect indices to rank and identify the inefficient park: DEA-based cooling efficiency index for relative efficiency and park cooling intensity index (PCII) for absolute efficiency. A total of 146 urban parks within the Shanghai metropolitan city was selected to conduct the empirical research. The correlation analysis and machine learning techniques (XGBoost) were also used to examine the relationships between the characteristics of parks and two cooling effect indices. The findings revealed that the average cooling efficiency of urban park in summer was approximately 2.7 times higher than that in winter. Park size and vegetation greenness (NDVI) were identified as the dominant factors for park cooling efficiency. Moreover, larger parks with area > 5 ha showed better cooling performance on average. In the current study area, increasing the water body coverage ratio also played an important role on the improvement of cooling effect in both summer and winter. The research findings could provide valuable references for designing urban parks and for urban planning to maximize the cooling benefits and mitigate the UHI effects.

TI  - Evaluation of the influence of ENSO on tropical vegetation in long time series using a new indicator
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the intensification of extreme weather events in recent years, the drought, flood and fire caused by super El Nin similar to o - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) led to lot's of vegetation destruction in multiple tropical regions. However, little is known about the influence of ENSO on tropical vegetation of long time series (especially after 2015) and the influence's internal mechanism. Based on generating the long-term vegetation data (combined multiple satellite sensors data), a new index (Vegetation - ENSO response index, VERI) was created to evaluate the influence of ENSO on vegetation more accurately and comprehensively, which considering several factors including the correlation between ENSO index and NDVI anomaly, the change amplitude of NDVI in ENSO events and the duration time and lag time of the influence of ENSO on vegetation. The analysis indicated that tropical vegetation exhibited a fluctuating increase state with an overall increasing range of 4.46%, and the greening trends were the most significant and dramatical in the Indian Peninsula (0.0031/y), the coast of the Gulf of Guinea (0.0026/y), and the Amazon River estuary (0.0025/y). ENSO can lead to significant enhancement or degradation of vegetation in at least 10% of tropical regions, especially in East Africa (|VERI| =0.16), Southern Africa (|VERI|=0.18) and Indonesia (|VERI|=0.14). Among them, shrubs are the most widely affected areas (32.08%) due to limited water resources. ENSO's greening effect is mainly accomplished by increasing precipitation (warm/r = 0.166, cold/r = 0.249) and its degradation effect is more closely related to temperature increase (warm/r = -0.374, cold/r = -0.101). The change of VERI in different periods indicated that the ENSO's influence on vegetation has changed after 2000, which meant the improving effect of cold events on tropical vegetation was weakened, while the inhibiting effect was enhanced. These findings can help us better understand and respond to the effects of ENSO on tropical vegetation in the context of global change.

TI  - Assessing the contribution of the ENSO and MJO to Australian dust activity based on satellite- and ground-based observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite Australian dust's critical role in the regional climate and surrounding marine ecosystems, the controlling factors of the spatiotemporal variations of Australian dust are not fully understood. Here we assess the connections between observed spatiotemporal variations of Australian dust with key modes of large-scale climate variability, namely the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). Multiple dust observations from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), weather stations, and satellite instruments, namely the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), are examined. The assessed multiple dust observations consistently identify the natural and agricultural dust hotspots in Australia, including the Lake Eyre basin, Lake Torrens basin, Lake Frome basin, Simpson Desert, Barwon-Darling basin, Riverina, Barkly Tableland, and the lee side of the Great Dividing Range, as well as a country-wide, austral spring-to-summer peak in dust activity. Our regression analysis of observed dust optical depth (DOD) upon an ocean Nino index confirms previous model-based findings on the enhanced dust activity in southern and eastern Australia during the subsequent austral spring and summer dust season following the strengthening of austral wintertime El Nino. Our analysis further indicates the modulation of the ENSO-dust relationship with the MJO phases. During sequential MJO phases, the dust-active center moves from west to east, associated with the eastward propagation of MJO, with the maximum enhancement in dust activity at about 120, 130, and 140 degrees E, corresponding to MJO phases 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6, respectively. MJO phases 3-6 are favorable for enhanced ENSO modulation of dust activity, especially the occurrence of extreme dust events, in southeastern Australia, currently hypothesized to be attributed to the interaction between MJO-induced anomalies in convection and wind and ENSO-induced anomalies in soil moisture and vegetation.

TI  - Satellite Navigation and Communication Integration Based on Correlation Domain Indefinite Pulse Position Modulation Signal
T2  - WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ubiquitous signal coverage is a basic demand of Internet of Things (IoT) communications, which meets the feature of satellite communications. Infinite user number is a basic demand of IoT location-based services, which meets the feature of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Both of these demands make Satellite Navigation and Communication Integration (SNCI) an important supporting technology for IoT. Inherited from the satellite communications system, GNSS itself has a certain data transmission capacity. Thus, enhancing the communication function of the GNSS is a promising means of achieving SNCI. Considering that a unified signal system cannot currently realize high-precision positioning and high-speed data transmission simultaneously in SNCI, this project proposes a Correlation Domain Indefinite Pulse Position Modulation (CDIPPM). A pilot channel and a data channel are introduced in this technology, which are distinguished by Code Division Multiplexing (CDMA). The synchronization function is provided by the pilot channel, thereby freeing the data channel of this function. The phase of the pseudorandom code can then be used as the carrier of information. In order to transmit more information, the transmitter of the proposed technology superimposes on the data channel multiple sets of spread spectrum sequence, which are generated from one set of spread spectrum sequence by different cyclic shifting operations. The receiver will identify the number and location of the correlation function peaks by a detection algorithm and recover the message. It can be seen by theoretical analysis and simulation verification. The technology can significantly improve satellite data transmission rates and maintain the original positioning function while minimizing change in the original GNSS signal. Therefore, the SNCI system based on this technology has the following advantages: a unified signal system, high positioning accuracy, high data transmission rate, and a backward navigation function, and it is easy to promote.

TI  - Assessing Fish Habitat and the Effects of an Emergency Drought Barrier on Estuarine Turbidity Using Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuaries worldwide are experiencing stress due to increased droughts, which often prompt intervention by environmental managers and government agencies. Effective management of water resources in estuarine systems can be enhanced by new technologies and methodologies to support decision-making processes. Here, we evaluate the use of high-frequency, high-resolution satellite remote sensing within two management-relevant case studies in the San Francisco Estuary and the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. We used a remote sensing-derived time series of turbidity maps to (1) identify favorable turbidity conditions for the endangered fish species, delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), during the height of the great California drought in the dry season of 2015, and (2) evaluate changes in turbidity following the installation of an emergency saltwater intrusion barrier. The mapping results indicate several persistent areas of turbidity refugia throughout the summer in the north and west Delta; however, there was infrequent connectivity. A comparison of images captured during ebb tides before and after barrier installation showed a mean increase of 6.6 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) in the San Joaquin River and 4 NTU in Fisherman's Cut. Our assessment of the barrier supports previous findings, which used field samples to conclude barrier installation may have resulted in increased turbidity near the barrier and enhances these findings by providing spatial context.

TI  - Fire risk assessment, spatiotemporal clustering and hotspot analysis in the Luki biosphere reserve region, western DR Congo
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzes active fires from 2001 to 2019 in and around the Luki Biosphere Reserve, western DR Congo to assess fire risks. In this study, we used descriptive statistics to assess fire events, Getis-Ord G hotspot analysis to define the spatial patterns presented by the fire events. Diagnostics for spatiotemporal clustering of fires location and space-time interaction were assessed the spatiotemporal K function. MODIS data from 2001 to 2019 revealed 4602 fires events and 150,132 ha burned, corresponding to 42.6% of the study area. The results of this study show that the peak of fires was recorded in 2013 and fires are mostly recorded every year during the dry season from June to September. They occurred mostly between Noon and 01:00 PM local time. Fires that occurred in the region had low radiative power with the mean value of 23.5 Mega Watts. The Hotspot region where fires take place is located in the South-Eastern part of the studied area exhibiting a significant spatiotemporal clustering (p value = 0.012). Fires are mainly of 2 origins: annual savannah clearing and agriculture fires. The results of this research will help decision making with proactive preventive measures over time and space.

TI  - The greening effect characterized by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was not coupled with phenological trends and tree growth rates in eight protected mountains of central Mexico
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In temperature-limited ecosystems such as high-elevation forests, rising temperatures and increasing carbon dioxide can result in a greening effect and changes in the phenology of the forests. Up to now, phenological metrics of subtropical high-elevation forests remain primarily unquantified, which strongly limits a global comprehension of climate change impacts. We assessed the long-term trend dynamics (greenness and land surface phenology) using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and compared them with data from an existing dendrochronological network that came from eight protected mountains in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in central Mexico during the last 20 yr (2000-2019). We found three main NDVI clusters reflecting a longitudinal geographical pattern (Pacific, Center, and the Gulf of Mexico). A notable greening effect at the canopy level was seen for all mountains (up to 23.8% increase concerning the year 2000). Nevertheless, the NDVI trends were not uniform, and they differed along an elevation gradient with the highest increases at the bottom. Minimum temperature and soil moisture positively impacted the NDVI time series and explained up to 87% of the variance, while maximum temperature negatively affected. Regarding phenological metrics, the start, and end of the growing season were the day of the year 148 +/- 20 (late-May) and 9 +/- 12 (early-January), respectively, with an average length of 226 +/- 33 d, differing from previous studies related to annual tree-ring formation. We did not see a later or earlier start of either the spring or the fall, which partially refutes the hypothesis that the growing season extended despite the increase in temperature. Finally, our investigation revealed that the common greening effect was not parallel with radial growth trends, except for the wettest site from the Gulf of Mexico cluster, and partially related to the forest management strategies. Further modelling of regional phenology coupled with more intensive tree-ring monitoring is needed to explain the factors that mediate the processes of photosynthesis (NDVI) and storage of carbon (tree-ring formation) under a global warming outlook.

TI  - Correlation of WorldView-3 spectral vegetation indices and soil health indicators of individual urban trees with exceptions to topsoil disturbance
T2  - CITY AND ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing recognition of the potential ecosystem services provided by urban forests suggests a need to examine soil quality under urban conditions. Soil quality assessment tools are presently mostly applied in agricultural production, but these approaches must also be evaluated in the urban context. This proof-of-concept exploratory study evaluates whether Worldview-3 spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) generated for individual tree crown (ITC) objects can be correlated to soil health attributes measured in the field in Metro Boston, Massachusetts, USA. While similar studies have completed such analysis for agricultural crops, none have done so for urban trees. The statistical analysis by Pearson correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) showed that SVIs, specifically the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), correlated significantly and positively with bulk density (BD) (r = 0.536) and soil luminance (r = 0.562) and negatively with CO2 respiration (r = - 0.536), active fungi and active bacteria (r = - 0.401), and total carbon (r = - 0.548). The negative correlations with parameters commonly considered positive for soil health in agricultural settings may indicate strong perturbation at the urban soil surface level; they also suggest soil health attributes measured at this study's 0-15 cm sampling depth may not be satisfactorily indicative of tree health as measured by SVIs. This study evidences the ground truthing of satellite-based urban SVIs, including their relationships with soil health attributes at the individual tree level.

TI  - Linking vegetation spectral reflectance with ecosystem carbon phenology in a temperate salt marsh
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes constitute an important terrestrial-aquatic interface that remains underrepresented in Earth System Models due to constraining biophysical controls and spatially limited land cover. One promising approach to improve representativeness is the application of proximal remote sensing to generate phenological information, yet we lack detailed knowledge on how proximal sensors and indices perform within these ecosystems. We use measurements of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) from eddy covariance (EC) and derive ecologically-relevant phenology parameters (i.e., phenoperiods) to use as carbon phenology benchmarks. These benchmarks are compared against vegetation indices and spectral bands derived from spaceborne (i.e., MODIS) or common proximal sensors (i.e., phenocam and spectral reflectance sensors; SRS).Phenocam derived indices, which exclude infrared wavelengths (i.e., vegetation contrast index; VCI and greenness chromatic coordinate; GCC), aligned closely with NEP benchmarks and provided best predictions of carbon sink season length (within 1-6 days of benchmark). Although isolating infrared from vegetation (NIRv) offered improvements, other indices utilizing infrared bands (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index; NDVI and enhanced vegetation index; EVI) primarily underestimated season start dates (5-30 days prior to benchmark) while overestimating season end dates (7-47 days after benchmark). These discrepancies are greatest for indices derived from MODIS and SRS sensors, which have narrower full width half maximum spectral bandwidths and sharper orientation angles. The phenocam (VCI and GCC) provides the most accurate phenology parameters while offering near-infrared (NIR) response which can generate additional information on seasonal changes in canopy structure and function.The distinctive characteristics of the salt marsh environment and vegetation properties including standing dead biomass can introduce interpretation challenges for commonly used vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI). Incorporating information from proximal sensors utilizing only visible wavelengths (VCI, GCC) or isolating the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) offers improvements for studying carbon phenology within salt marshes.

TI  - Experimental and numerical investigations on corroded stainless-clad bimetallic steel bar with artificial damage
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial damage was introduced in stainless-steel cladding layer (SSCL) of stainless-clad bimetallic steel bars (SCBSBs) to simulate the initial imperfection. The corrosion performances and mechanical properties of SCBSBs were investigated experimentally. Based on the test results of corrosion performance of artificially damaged SCB-SBs, corrosion mainly occurred in the damaged area. The wc developed faster than the dc , with increases in corrosion ratio. The increment in corrosion ratio led to decreases in f(y), f(u), epsilon(u) and delta . Predictive equations were proposed to quantify inluences of corrosion on f(y), f(u), epsilon(y), epsilon(u) , epsilon(u)/epsilon(y) and delta . A stress-strain model was proposed to clarify mechanical properties of artificially damaged SCBSB specimens with various corrosion ratios. The comparisons among different steel bars were conducted to investigate differences in effects of corrosion on mechanical properties. Different energy indexes were calculated to quantify the ductility of artificially damaged SCBSB specimens comprehensively. The finite element analysis was carried out to investigate the effects of corrosion morphology and location on strength properties of SCBSBs. Based on numerical results, when corrosion ratio was the same, the fu and fy of corroded SCBSBs increased, with the increase in W/D . The effect of corrosion location on strength properties of corroded SCBSBs could be ignored. Contributions of this study were useful to determine resistance of structures with SCBSBs during the service life accurately.

TI  - Effect of Groundwater Level on Soil Moisture, Soil Temperature and Surface Temperature
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic behavior of groundwater level effects the soil moisture, soil temperature and surface temperature. In the study, the effect has been studied at two observation sites with varying groundwater level. Regular measurements of soil moisture and soil temperature were taken in field at 1.5, 2.2 and 3 m depth to observe the groundwater level effect on these parameters. Preliminary analysis during November 2016-April 2017 was carried to find the relationship among soil moisture, soil temperature and surface temperature with groundwater level at each observation depth. Soil moisture and groundwater level has shown strong negative correlation (R-2 = 0.734, depth 1.5 m; R-2 = 0.799, depth 2.2 m and R-2 = 0.852, depth 3.0 m) at shallow groundwater level site and weak correlation (R-2 = 0.578, depth 1.5 m; R-2 = 0.501 and R-2 = 0.339, depth 3.0 m) at deep groundwater level site. Soil temperature and groundwater level has also shown strong positive correlation (R-2 = 0.840, depth 1.5 m, R-2 = 0.862, depth 2.2 m and R-2 = 0.917, depth 3.0 m) at shallow groundwater site and poor correlation (R-2 = 0.573, depth 1.5 m; R-2 = 0.468, depth 2.2 m and R-2 = 0.428, depth 3.0 m) at deep groundwater site. Soil moisture and soil temperature were also found strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.701, depth 1.5 m; R-2 = 0.602, depth 2.2 m and R-2 = 0.731, depth 3.0 m). Further, LANDSAT-8 data during observation period was processed to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) which in addition was correlated with soil moisture, soil temperature and groundwater level. LST was found significantly correlated with soil moisture and soil temperature at shallow groundwater site. However, a strong positive correlation, i.e., R-2 = 0.874 was deducted between LST and groundwater level at shallow groundwater site and poor correlation, i.e., R-2 = 0.434 at deep groundwater site. Thus, we have seen that shallow groundwater level has significant effect on these observed variables. The empirical results support our basic hypothesis and suggest further work for the better understanding and coupling of relationship among these parameters.

TI  - Evaluation of urban greenspace vulnerability to typhoon in Taiwan
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban greenspace (UGS) represents an essential component of city ecosystems. It plays a critical role for various purposes, such as reducing urban heat island effect and air pollution, regulating torrential run-off and offering joyful routes for walking, jogging and cycling based on personal interest as well as a platform for social networking. It is especially important in a populated country like Taiwan with population highly concentrated in cities. It is rather vulnerable to strong winds and heavy precipitation brought up by typhoons, while there are no existing frameworks to access its vulnerability to typhoons in Taiwan. Here, we examine the vulnerability of UGS to typhoons in Taiwan by a novel assessment framework considering 21 indicators organized into three dimensions, including hazard, exposure/sensitivity and adaptive capacity. The 21 indicators are derived from the Sentinel-2 MSI data obtained from European Space Agency (ESA), typhoon data acquired from Japan Meteorology Agency (JMA), and census data achieved by the government official sites of Taiwan. Google Earth Engine and GIS are used to analyze the deviation of UGS variables. Five major metropolitan areas of Taiwan are selected as the study sites, consisting of Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung, and Kaohsiung cities. Interestingly, it is found that (i) There exists a great spatial gap between hazard levels and the top-priority regions to enhance the strategies and adaptive capacity in order to better respond to typhoons in Taiwan; (ii) The Northern and middle parts of Taiwan exhibit high and very high hazard levels since the occurrence frequency and wind speed of typhoons are higher. In contrast, the Southern Taiwan is characterized by low and very low hazard levels occupying over approximately half of the study sites; (iii) Exposure and sensitivity of the UGS in Taiwan vary greatly from very low to very high levels over the study sites with 43 % attributed to high and very high levels; and (iv) 22 % of the metropolitan areas are classified as high and very high vulnerable, mainly distributed over the Taoyuan, Taichung, Taipei, and New Taipei cities. Results suggest that the presented framework is useful in evaluating the vulnerability of UGS to typhoons and implicates proper management of urban trees as a nature-based solution to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

TI  - Systematic discrimination of irrigation and upheaval associated salinity using multitemporal SAR data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing salinization in the soil profile by irrigation water and groundwater upheaval is a widespread issue and considered as a major threat to agricultural production in arid and semi-arid regions. The present study aimed to propose a systematic SAR simulation involving the imaginary part of dielectric constant measurements of two consecutive seasons (dry and wet) to quantify and discriminate the irrigation-induced and upheaval associated salinity from total salinity levels and investigate its impact on crop growth. The Sentinel-1 data of C-band frequency (5.36 GHz) acquired for both the dry and wet spells from 2015 to 2019 was instrumental in the present study. The total soil EC (Electrical Conductivity) was quantified from the imaginary part of dielectric constant (epsilon '') using semi-empirical microwave simulation "DSDM-SS". Irrigation-induced salinity (epsilon(Irrigation)'') and upheaval-associated salinity (epsilon(Upheaval)'') were extracted from epsilon '' by proposing a site-, and climatic-specific novel model. The epsilon(Upheaval)'' and epsilon(Irrigation)'' have shown promising statistical significance with the in-situ soil EC (R-2 = 0.89, p = <0.001, rMSE = 1.08, Bias = 0.584) and groundwater EC measurements (R2 = 0.85, p = <0.001, rMSE = 1.28, Bias = 1.16). The study found that the rate of salinity increase over time due to irrigation (77%) was considerably higher than the upheaval (42%) process. This demonstrated that the intensive use of groundwater for irrigation has a higher impact on vegetation vigor (theta = -0.87) than the upheaval process. The study revealed that crop failure in the dry season was provoked by osmotic stress and waterlogging conditions. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Investigating the relationship of aerosols with enhanced vegetation index and meteorological parameters over Pakistan
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols have severe effects on climate, human health and ecosystems. The impact of aerosols on climate, ecosystems and human health can be better understood if the variability of optical properties of aerosols is accurately known. In this paper, we have used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets of aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm, Angstrom exponent (440/870) (AE) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) over Pakistan. We have also analyzed the relationship between meteorological variables (e.g., temperature, relative humidity (RH) and wind speed (WS)) and aerosol optical properties to acquire a deep knowledge of aerosol variability. The coefficients of determination (R-2) between Aqua-AOD and AERONET-AOD are found to be 0.6724 over Lahore and 0.7678 over Karachi. Aqua-AOD has also been validated with AOD data from Terra, MISR and SeaWiFS. High AOD (0.8-1) and low AE (0.4-0.8) have been observed over south and southwestern Pakistan indicating the presence of dust aerosols. In northeastern Pakistan, EVI is negatively correlated with AOD. The northeastern Pakistan is characterized by high values of AOD (similar to 1) during all seasons. AOD showed a significant interannual variation with the lowest values (0.22) in January and the highest (0.58) in July. AE is observed to be lower in spring and summer than in winter and autumn seasons in south and southwestern Pakistan. A positive R (>= 0.6) is observed between AOD and temperature over the southwestern Pakistan while a negative R (-0.4 <=) is observed between AOD and RH over the southwestern Pakistan.

TI  - From Cedar Cemeteries to Marsh Lakes: a Case Study of Sea-Level Rise and Habitat Change in a Northeastern US Salt Marsh
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evidence for relative sea-level rise in the Mullica River-Great Bay, a relatively undisturbed watershed in southern New Jersey, stretches over hundreds of years. The increase in global sea-level rise in the region is enhanced by subsidence and results in rates that are approximately double the global average. In recent decades, the occurrence of "ghost forests," standing dead forests, especially of the salt-intolerant Atlantic White Cedar, is becoming increasingly obvious as tidal inundation of salty waters increases further inland, especially in the upper portions of the Mullica River and its tributaries. Even older evidence of sea-level rise in the watershed is the subtidal and intertidal occurrence of "cedar cemeteries," i.e., buried accumulations of Atlantic white cedar stumps and timbers that have been radiocarbon-dated from the fifteenth to the sixteenth centuries to as old as the fifth century. Some of these are being exposed as rising water extends intertidal creeks into adjacent wetlands and uncovers this rot-resistant wood. Sea-level rise is perhaps the most significant threat to the persistence of salt marshes over the coming century. Sea-level rise decreases salt marsh area by erosion at the marsh edge, drowning of the marsh surface, and the expansion of marsh pools into larger marsh "lakes." In some instances, this loss of salt marshes is compensated for by expansion landward into ghost forests, but in this watershed and others, the expansion is by invasive plant species such as Phragmites australis, which is suboptimal habitat for fishes, crabs, and other invertebrates. The combination of a fast rate of sea-level rise in an area relatively free from recent human intervention makes the Mullica Valley watershed an ideal location to continue to evaluate the effects of sea-level rise on salt marsh ecosystems.

TI  - Definite description of episodic free relatives in Jordanian Arabic: A choice function analysis
T2  - LINGUA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses a puzzle in the semantics of episodic free yalli relative clauses in Jordanian Arabic (henceforth, Y-FR). Despite the fact that the Y-FR functions as referential definite descriptions, especially when occupying the syntactic position of DP or PP argument, it can be interpreted non-referentially on a variety of other occasions. We resolve the puzzle by proposing a unified analysis of Y-FR based on the following assumptions: (i) the FY definite description is inherently a predicative structure. (ii) Such a predicate is interpreted via choice function. (ii) The function is represented by an epsilon term e which is a function from sets of individuals into singleton sets. (iii) The output of the epsilon function undergoes further compositional operations to derive the referential and non-referential readings of the Y-FR definite description. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Mobile phone coverage and violent conflict
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine the effects of mobile phone coverage on violent conflicts in Africa using a new monthly panel dataset on mobile phone coverage at 55 x55 km grid cell levels for 32 African countries covering the period from 2008 to 2018. The base rate of a conflict event in a month across our data set is 0.0039 with a standard deviation of 0.0620. We find that access to mobile phone coverage increases the probability of a conflict occurring in the next month by 0.0028. This finding is robust to a suite of sensitivity checks including the use of various specifications and alternative datasets. We examine heterogeneity on the impact of mobile phone coverage across state-based conflict, non-state-based conflict and one-sided conflict, and find that our results are being driven by non-state conflicts. We examine economic growth as a channel through which mobile phone coverage influences conflict. In doing so, we construct new satellite data for night-time light activity as a proxy for economic growth. We find that economic activity is a channel through which mobile phone coverage influences conflicts, and that higher economic growth weakens the positive effect of mobile phone coverage on conflict.

AB  - A detailed spatial inventory of the extent and depth distribution for tropical peatlands is not currently available; however, there is a critical need for new detailed peatland information at national, regional and global scales. Hence, the objective of this study was to provide a rigorous assessment of the extent and depth distribution of tropical peatlands in Indonesia. Data were acquired using a standard method protocol of semi-detailed peatland mapping programs (1:50 000 scale) from 2013 to 2019 for all Indonesian peatlands. Arc-GIS and multi-source satellite images (Landsat ETM-7, Landsat 8 OLI, ALOS, SPOT-5 and SPOT-6/7, and DEM/SRTM) were used to delineate soil-mapping units (polygons) which were supported by depth observation points derived from databases of soil maps 1:50 000 and peatland maps 1:250 000, and then subsequently verified with rigorous groundtruthing. Field transects were made between rivers using systematic distances to observe peat morphological features and thickness resulting in a total of 18,232 data points that included 14,185 new observations and 4,047 legacy points. Our results provide the first systematic census for all Indonesian peatlands and showed that peatlands occupied 13.43 million ha distributed on four islands (million ha): Sumatera (5.85) > Kalimantan (4.54) > Papua (3.01) > Sulawesi (0.024). Peat depth was classified into six categories: D1(50-<100 cm), D2 (100-<200 cm), D3 (200-<300 cm), D4 (300-<500 cm), D5 (500-<700 cm) and D6 (=700 cm), which represented (million ha/peatlands%) 3.17 (24%), 3.44 (26%), 2.61 (19%), 2.32 (17%), 1.29 (10%) and 0.59 (4%), respectively. Exceptionally deep (=700 cm) peatlands occurred on Kalimantan and Sumatera Islands, but were not found on Papua and Sulawesi Islands. The present peatland extent (13.43 million ha) was smaller than previous estimates (pre-2012) that varied from 14.9 to 27.0 million ha. The smaller peatland extent in the present semi-detailed mapping inventory (1:50 000) than previous estimates (pre-2012) may result primarily from (i) segregation of mineral soil inclusions previously considered as peatland, (ii) improved remote sensing and GIS tools (e.g., DEM/SRTM) that prevented misclassification of peatland areas, and (iii) extensive field observation for verification of peatland boundaries and thickness requirements (>50 cm) that eliminated peatlands lost to enhanced decomposition from agricultural management and drainage practices. Our study on peatland extent and thickness provides new detailed information of tropical peatlands in Indonesia (a major region of tropical peatlands) to serve as a baseline for future inventories. The information provided by this study updates peat information for Indonesia (extent and depth), fills a critical knowledge gap for accurately determining regional/global organic C stocks, and informs future directions for the sustainable use and management of tropical peatlands.

TI  - A novel CNN-LSTM-based approach to predict urban expansion
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series remote sensing data offer a rich source of information that can be used in a wide range of applications, from monitoring changes in land cover to surveillance of crops, coastal changes, flood risk assessment, and urban sprawl. In this paper, time-series satellite images are used to predict urban expansion. As the ground truth is not available in time-series satellite images, an unsupervised image segmentation method based on deep learning is used to generate the ground truth for training and validation. The automated annotated images are then manually validated using Google Maps to generate the ground truth. The remaining data were then manually annotated. Prediction of urban expansion is achieved by using a ConvLSTM network, which can learn the global spatio-temporal information without shrinking the size of spatial feature maps. The ConvLSTM based model is applied on the time-series satellite images and the results of prediction are compared with Pix2pix and Dual GAN networks. In this paper, experimental results are conducted using several multi-date satellite images representing the three largest cities in Saudi Arabia, namely: Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam. The evaluation results show that the proposed ConvLSTM based model produced better prediction results in terms of Mean Square Error, Root Mean Square Error, Peak Signal to Noise Ratio, Structural Similarity Index, and overall classification accuracy as compared to Pix2pix and Dual GAN. Moreover, the training time of the proposed architecture is less than the Dual GAN architecture.

TI  - Fusion Methods and Multi-classifiers to Improve Land Cover Estimation Using Remote Sensing Analysis
T2  - GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Adopting a low spatial resolution remote sensing imagery to get an accurate estimation of Land Use Land Cover is a difficult task to perform. Image fusion plays a big role to map the Land Use Land Cover. Therefore, This study aims to find out a refining method for the Land Use Land Cover estimating using these steps; (1) applying a three pan-sharpening fusion approaches to combine panchromatic imagery that has high spatial resolution with multispectral imagery that has low spatial resolution, (2) employing five pixel-based classifier approaches on multispectral imagery and fused images; artificial neural net, support vector machine, parallelepiped, Mahalanobis distance and spectral angle mapper, (3) make a statistical comparison between image classification results. The Landsat-8 image was adopted for this research. There are twenty Land Use Land Cover thematic maps were generated in this study. A suitable and reliable Land Use Land Cover method was presented based on the most accurate results. The results validation was performed by adopting a confusion matrix method. A comparison made between the images classification results of multispectral imagery and all fused images levels. It proved the Land Use Land Cover map produced by Gram-Schmidt Pan-sharpening and classified by support vector machine method has the most accurate result among all other multispectral imagery and fused images that classified by the other classifiers, it has an overall accuracy about (99.85%) and a kappa coefficient of about (0.98). However, the spectral angle mapper algorithm has the lowest accuracy compared to all other adopted methods, with overall accuracy of 53.41% and the kappa coefficient of about 0.48. The proposed procedure is useful in the industry and academic side for estimating purposes. In addition, it is also a good tool for analysts and researchers, who could interest to extend the technique to employ different datasets and regions.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Reports of English Christian socialism's death at the end of the Second World War were greatly exaggerated. Like their Catholic counterparts in much of western Europe, Anglican Christian socialists contributed to debates about post-war reconstruction, issuing warnings against an impersonal or bureaucratic state and experimenting with small-scale community initiatives such as industrial missions, parish meetings and housing associations. From the 1950s, the worldview inherited from Victorian Christian socialism began to be challenged by affluence, anti-colonialism, the decline of deference and eventually by the rise of identity politics. Criticism also came from radical Christian socialists like David Nicholls who found the incarnationalist tradition of Henry Scott Holland too comfortable and paternalistic. Nevertheless, Anglican ideas of national community retained some of their attraction into the late 20th century, particularly offering an alternative vision of society to Thatcherism in the 1980s. This article is based on a lecture given to the 2020 Scott Holland symposium.

TI  - Extreme heat vulnerability assessment in tropical region: a case study in Malaysia
T2  - CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past decade, the inevitable increase in temperature has caused Malaysia to experience more extreme heat events, and yet very little research has been dedicated in exploring the heat-related vulnerability of exposed population. In this study, the extreme heat vulnerability index (EHVI) has been evaluated to identify the most vulnerable districts to extreme heat events. We evaluated exposure, population sensitivity and adaptive capacity from sociodemographic and remote sensing data. We have applied multivariate analysis on 13 indicators for every 87 districts to elucidate the extreme heat vulnerability in Peninsular Malaysia. The EHVI was generated by summing up the normalized extreme heat exposure scores and factor scores from the multivariate analysis. Our findings clarify that the most vulnerable populations are confined in the urban and northern region of Peninsular Malaysia. The source of vulnerability varied between both regions, with urbanization and population density increase the vulnerability in urban areas, high heat exposure and sensitive population are the dominant factors of vulnerability in the northern region. These findings are valuable in identifying districts vulnerable to extreme heat and help regulatory body; in designing effective adaptation and preparedness strategies to increase the population resilience towards extreme heat.

TI  - Trade-off between carbon sequestration and water loss for vegetation greening in China
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use management of forests and croplands mainly drives the vegetation greening in China. Vegetation greening strongly modulates the trade-off between carbon sequestration via photosynthesis and water loss from evapotranspiration (ET) at the terrestrial ecosystem (representing by ecosystem water use efficiency, WUE). The function of vegetation greening in terrestrial carbon sequestration is well known, but the impacts of water loss from ET caused by vegetation greening on WUE are often neglected. Here, the GIS-based Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model was established to evaluate ET in China from 2001 to 2015, incorporating vege-tation dynamics as a key component. To quantify the net effect of the ET caused by vegetation greening on WUE, we compared two different simulation scenarios: actual vegetation greening scenario and simulated without vegetation greening scenario. The results show that forests and croplands mainly contribute to the growth in GPP and NPP in China with annual rates of 2.53 gC.m(-2) yr(-2) and 1.59 gC.m(-2) yr(-2) from 2001 to 2015, respectively. With the increase of terrestrial carbon sequestration, the ET under actual vegetation greening scenario was generated 6.78 mm.yr(-1) more than that under simulated without vegetation greening scenario. But as a result of the negative impacts of vegetation physiological effect (elevated CO2 concentration and the decreased VPD) on ET, values of ET under two different scenarios all exhibited a decline trend from 2001 to 2015 with rates of -2.04% and -3.63%, respectively. Consequently, although the WUE under two different scenarios exhibited increased trends (6.44%, actual vegetation dynamics scenario; 10.74%, simulated without vegetation greening scenario), the ET caused by vegetation greening led to an obvious divergence between the WUE under two different scenarios. For better understanding the impacts of human activities on carbon and water cycles at the terrestrial ecosystem, it is necessary to take the water loss from ET caused by vegetation greening into consideration, which is crucial for enhancing the sustainability of future vegetation-related projects.

TI  - Crop burning and forest fires: Long-term effect on adolescent height in India
T2  - RESOURCE AND ENERGY ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the effect of biomass burning on adolescent health in India. The biomass burning problem is quite acute especially in North India, with some states experiencing forest fires and few states actively engaging in crop burning practice. We combine remote sensing data on biomass burning events with a pan-India survey on teenage girls (TAG survey). We exploit regional and temporal variation in our data to establish the link between occurrence of extremely high levels of biomass burning during early life and adolescent height for girls in India. Our results indicate that exposure to extremely high level of biomass burning during prenatal and postnatal period is associated with lower height (by 0.7 percent or 1.07 cm) later in life. Girls from North India are found to be especially vulnerable to the harmful effects of exposure to biomass burning. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Detecting cocoa plantations in Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana and their implications on protected areas
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana are the largest producers of cocoa in the world. In recent decades the cultivation of this crop has led to the loss of vast tracts of forest areas in both countries. Efficient and accurate methods for remotely identifying cocoa plantations are essential to the implementation of sustainable cocoa practices and for the periodic and effective monitoring of forests. In this study, a method for cocoa plantation identification was developed based on a multi-temporal stack of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images and a multi-feature Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and second-order texture features were assessed for their importance in an RF classification, and their optimal combination was used as input variables for the RF model to identify cocoa plantations in both countries. The RF model-based cocoa map achieved 82.89% producer's and 62.22% user's accuracy, detecting 3.69 million hectares (Mha) and 2.15 Mha of cocoa plantations for Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana, respectively. The results demonstrate that a combination of an RF model and multi-feature classification can distinguish cocoa plantations from other land cover/use, effectively reducing feature dimensions and improving classification efficiency. The results also highlight that cocoa farms largely encroach into protected areas (PAs), as 20% of the detected cocoa plantation area is located in PAs and almost 70% of the PAs in the study area house cocoa plantations.

AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products were used in this study which covers a period of 2000-2014. Comparison of the SCA derived from MODIS and Landsat NDSI showed a significant correlation, the resultant coefficient of determination (R-2) was 0.85. For analyzing the trend in the SCA, the Mann-Kendall test was applied; the results show an increasing non-significant trend in the mean annual SCA with a Sen's slope value of +16.99 (km(2)/year), and a significant increasing trend in the winter SCA was identified. The annual mean SCA was 8.92 km(2) and 564 km(2) for elevation ranges of 5001-5694 m and 4001-4500 m respectively. The spatial extent of snow cover was maximum in 70 degrees-78.3 degrees slope class and minimum in 30 degrees-40 degrees slope class. The results highlight the MODIS snow cover products' capability to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of snow cover in complex mountainous watersheds.

TI  - Land-Use and Land-Cover Change Detection in a North-Eastern Wetland Ecosystem of Bangladesh Using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakshmibaur-Nalair Haor, a freshwater wetland ecosystem is situated in the north-eastern region of Bangladesh. This place hosts the second largest freshwater swamp forest in Bangladesh. Containing rich biodiversity, this unique area experiences significant landscape changes. This study examines land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes between 1989 and 2019 in the Lakshmibaur-Nalair Haor area by operating Landsat multispectral imageries through remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. The changing status of the haor was analyzed by initiating normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI). The unsupervised classification technique was implemented to classify these images into five major classes (vegetation, cropland, bare soil, shallow water, and deep water bodies) using threshold values of NDVI and MNDWI. After accuracy assessment, the post-classification comparison method was performed to evaluate the change detection. This study demonstrates that this valuable area lost similar to 2208.6 ha (37.54%) of the deep water body and 489.6 ha (8.34%) of vegetation over the last 3 decades. However, it has gained about 1729 ha (29.39%) of cropland, 2673 ha (45.44%) of shallow water and 1124 ha (28%) of bare soil. Such changes indicate significant human interventions such as expansion of croplands with increased population pressure. Gradual change of deep water into shallow water over time is enabling local community to expand agricultural lands and activities during the dry season. This study's findings are useful in understanding and tracking changes in wetlands in Bangladesh and other similar settings.

TI  - Automatic mapping of urban green spaces using a geospatial neural network
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed and precise urban green spaces (UGS) maps provide essential data for the sustainable urban development and related studies (e.g. heatwave events, heat related health risk, urban flooding, urban biodiversity and ecosystem services). However, remote sensing of mapping UGS is challenging due to the existence of mixed pixels and the cost and difficulty of collecting quality training data. This study presents a neural network-based automatic mapping method of UGS that integrates the use of Sentinel-2A satellite images and crowdsourced geospatial big data. The proposed neural network consists of three parts: (i) a multi-scale feature extraction module; (ii) a multi-modal information fuse module; and (iii) and a boundary enhancement module. The results showed that the proposed method achieved a high overall classification accuracy of 94.6%, which presents a clear UGS structure of a large scale. This study provides a fresh insight into how remote-sensing and crowdsourced geospatial big data can be integrated to improve urban mapping of green spaces through neural network.

TI  - Impacts of a Mesoscale Dust Storm on Aerosols Characteristics, Optical and Radiative Properties Over a Semiarid Region, Western India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the impacts on aerosol characteristics, optical and radiative properties due to a mesoscale dust storm which originated from the Arabian, Iran/Pakistan region and observed to pass in vicinity over the semiarid region of Western India in April, 2017. The extent and long-distance transport of dust along with varying aerosol optical depth (AOD) were studied with high spatial and temporal resolution space-based observations. In situ measurements of particulate matter (PM) indicated high dust loading with PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations as high as 223 and 253 mu g/m(3) and 142.6 and 160 mu g/m(3), respectively. High concentrations of Inhalable, thoracic and alveolic PM aerosols (similar to 290, 200 and 100 mu g/m3, respectively) are also observed due to high dust load in the atmosphere, that is hazardous to human health, particularly for people suffering from respiratory ailments. The fine-mode fraction and Angstrom exponent have also been analyzed using satellite data. Satellite-derived AOD and in situ meteorological data were used as model inputs to estimate the radiative forcing impact of dust aerosols using a coupled radiative transfer model. The radiative transfer model simulations results indicate a reduction in the total downward surface flux by 6.5%, 6.7%, 5.0%, 10.1%, 7.1%, 8.9%, 3.7% and 5.3% as height decreases from 5 to 0 km (surface) during pre- to post-dust storm event period, respectively. The aerosols vertical profiles obtained from spaceborne CALIPSO LiDAR validated the predominant presence of "dust'' aerosols during this event. The study provides important quantitative insights into extreme variabilities in aerosol properties resulting to a "cooling effect'' during a severe mesoscale dust storm event over a semiarid region.

AB  - Background and Objectives Clinicopathologic characteristics have prognostic value in clinical stage IB-II patients with melanoma. Little is known about the prognostic value of obesity that has been associated with an increased risk for several cancer types and worsened prognosis after diagnosis. This study aims to examine effects of obesity on outcome in patients with clinical stage IB-II melanoma.Methods Prospectively recorded data of patients with clinical stage IB-II melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) between 1995 and 2018 at the University Medical Center of Groningen were collected from medical files and retrospectively analyzed. Cox-regression analyses were used to determine associations between obesity (body mass index> 30), tumor (location, histology, Breslow-thickness, ulceration, mitotic rate, SLN-status) and patient-related variables (gender, age, and social-economic-status [SES]) and disease-free interval (DFI), melanoma-specific survival (MSS), and overall survival (OS).Results Of the 715 patients, 355 (49.7%) were women, median age was 55 (range 18.6-89) years, 149 (20.8%) were obese. Obesity did not significantly affect DFI (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.98-2.00; p = 0.06), MSS (adjusted HR = 1.48;95%CI = 0.97-2.25; p = 0.07), and OS (adjusted HR = 1.25; 95% CI = 0.85-1.85; p = 0.25). Increased age, arm location, increased Breslow-thickness, ulceration, increased mitotic rate, and positive SLN-status were significantly associated with decreased DFI, MSS, and OS. Histology, sex, and SES were not associated.Conclusion Obesity was not associated with DFI, MSS, or OS in patients with clinical stage IB-II melanoma who underwent SLNB.

TI  - Persistent Clones and Local Seed Recruitment Contribute to the Resilience of <i>Enhalus acoroides</i> Populations Under Disturbance
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-induced land use in coastal areas is one of the main threats for seagrass meadows globally causing eutrophication and sedimentation. These environmental stressors induce sudden ecosystem shifts toward new alternative stable states defined by lower seagrass richness and abundance. Enhalus acoroides, a large-sized tropical seagrass species, appears to be more resistant toward environmental change compared to coexisting seagrass species. We hypothesize that reproductive strategy and the extent of seedling recruitment of E. acoroides are altered under disturbance and contribute to the persistence and resilience of E. acoroides meadows. In this research, we studied eight populations of E. acoroides in four lagoons along the South Central Coast of Vietnam using 11 polymorphic microsatellite loci. We classified land use in 6 classes based on Sentinel-2 L2A images and determined the effect of human-induced land use at different spatial scales on clonal richness and structure, fine-scale genetic structure and genetic diversity. No evidence of population size reductions due to disturbance was found, however, lagoons were strongly differentiated and may act as barriers to gene flow. The proportion and size of clones were significantly higher in populations of surrounding catchments with larger areas of agriculture, urbanization and aquaculture. We postulate that large resistant genets contribute to the resilience of E. acoroides meadows under high levels of disturbance. Although the importance of clonal growth increases with disturbance, sexual reproduction and the subsequent recruitment of seedlings remains an essential strategy for the persistence of populations of E. acoroides and should be prioritized in conservation measures to ensure broad-scale and long-term resilience toward future environmental change.

TI  - A bi-seasonal classification of woody plant species using Sentinel-2A and SPOT-6 in a localised species-rich savanna environment
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable management of biodiversity benefit from cost-effectively multi-temporal classification schemes afforded by remote sensing techniques. This study compared classification accuracies of woody plant species (n = 27) and three coexisting land cover types using dry and wet seasons data. Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Neural Network (DNN), were applied to Sentinel-2A and SPOT-6 images. The results showed higher overall classification accuracies for wet season data (65%-72%) for both images and classifiers (DNN, RF and SVM), compared to dry season classification (52%-59%). Near infrared region bands, available in both Sentinel-2A and SPOT-6 imagery, produced high performance for both wet (83%) and dry (80%) seasons. Overall, the findings shows potential of multispectral remote-sensing for woody plant species diversity in different seasons. Such a study should be extended to higher frequency species diversity classification, to capture dynamics that may manifest at short time intervals of the year.

TI  - Salt extrusion kinematics: insights from existing data, morphology and InSAR modelling of the active emergent Anguru diapir in the Zagros fold and thrust belt, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Emergent salt diapirs are highly mobile geological objects, the kinematics of which pose essential pure and applied problems for geologists and engineers. Movement and deformation of buried salt after its ejection onto the surface is a multivariable process that is susceptible to plenty of intrinsic and ambient factors. As a result, existing data acquisition approaches give extremely variable movement rates for subaerial salt extrusions. The Anguru diapir in the Zagros fold and thrust belt (ZFTB) is a typical emergent intra-anticlinal salt plug that demonstrates very recent activity, and hence was selected to be studied for quantifying salt kinematics under relatively well-defined physical conditions. We used interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time-series data to evaluate surface displacement over the salt dome by constructing 236 interferograms derived from 47 Envisat ASAR (time span: 2003-10) and 12 ALOS PALSAR (time span: 2006-10) images, which, combined with other lines of evidence, suggest a very recent extrusion history. The maximum line of sight (LOS) displacement rates of the diapir surface are -2.6 and + 1.4 cm a(-1). Modelling of the Anguru salt plug surface suggests a bibbed pattern of LOS movements that allows interpretation of the interferometric patterns observed over active upwelling (doming) or downwarping structures.

TI  - Climate change, drought, land degradation and migration: exploring the linkages
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts are significant drivers of land degradation, which in turn has adverse effects on resource-dependent rural populations and can potentially lead to livelihood losses and subsequent migration out of affected areas. Linkages between land degradation and migration are complex and not particularly well documented, as they occur within a larger context of multi-scale interactions of socio-economic, political, demographic, and environmental processes. Given these uncertainties, further research in this field is needed. Here, we review existing research on how droughts affect land degradation-migration dynamics, and illustrate the pathways by which migration is affected by and responds to the climatic driver. We pay particular attention to methods used to identify, measure, and understand migration related to land degradation - including statistical approaches, application of remote sensing data and qualitative approaches - and identify common challenges encountered by researchers. We conclude by identifying future directions and priorities for research.

TI  - Satellite-based estimates of nitrogen oxide and methane emissions from gas flaring and oil production activities in Sakha Republic, Russia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT-X
M3  - Article
AB  - Crude oil production activities and associated petroleum gas (APG) flaring are responsible for significant air polluting and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and have negative effects on the environment and climate. In Russia, one of the world's major oil producers, APG flaring remains a routine practice despite regulatory policies. We present the first analysis of nitrogen oxide and methane emissions over Tas-Yuryakh and Talakan oil fields in Sakha Republic (Eastern Siberia, Russia) using multi-satellite observations.Satellite-based TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) nitrogen dioxide (NO2) mean fields show local NO2 enhancements corresponding to the locations of gas flares detected from Sentinel 2 imagery and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) fire data. We derive the annual nitrogen oxide (NOx = NO2+NO) emissions from TROPOMI NO2 observations using an exponentially-modified Gaussian model. We obtain NOx emissions up to 1.34 mol/s (in 2019) in Tas-Yuryakh, where persistent production APG flaring is detected, and about 0.6 mol/s in Talakan, where oil production is three times larger than in Tas-Yuryakh but gas flaring is employed only occasionally. In 2019 we observe a new flaring site in Tas-Yuryakh from the NO2 mean fields, corresponding to an increase in the environmental fees paid by the companies to the local budgets. Assuming that all NOx emissions are associated with APG flaring, the volume of gas flared for 2019 is estimated at 1.25 +/- 0.48 billion cubic metres (bcm) in Tas-Yuryakh and 0.5 +/- 0.2 bcm in Talakan.Furthermore, we find a clear methane (CH4) anomaly of about 30 ppb from the TROPOMI XCH4 mean fields near Talakan oil field. We estimate CH4 emissions of about 28-63 tons/h from individual TROPOMI XCH4 plumes using the cross-sectional flux method.The estimated satellite-based NOx and CH4 emissions are higher than the inventories, which are expected to underestimate the contribution from the oil and gas industry and are generally available with several years of delay. TROPOMI NO2 and CH4 observations demonstrate their capability in identifying emission sources from space with unprecedented detail. The results show how satellite observations can support environmental authorities in monitoring the emissions from the oil and gas industry and the commitment of oil companies in reducing APG flaring.

TI  - A novel index for ecological drought monitoring based on ecological water deficit
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the concept of ecological drought was first defined by the Science for Nature and People Partnership (SNAPP) in 2016, there remains no widely accepted ecological drought monitoring index. Therefore, this study constructed a new ecological drought index, the standardized ecological water deficit index (SEWDI). The SEWDI is based on the difference between ecological water requirement and consumption, referred to as the standardized precipitation index (SPI) method, which was used to monitor ecological drought in Northwestern China (NWRC). The performance of the SEWDI was compared with that of other widely-used drought indices, including standardized root soil moisture index (SSI), self-calibrated Palmer drought index (scPDSI), standardized precipitation-evaporation drought index (SPEI), and SPI, using the Pearson correlations between these indices and standardized normalized difference vegetation index (SNDVI) under different time scales, wetness and water use efficiencies (WUE) of vegetation. The SEWDI at a 12-month scale was decomposed in NWRC during 1982-2015 using the rotational empirical orthogonal function (REOF) in order to demarcate five ecological drought regions, including southeastern sub-region (SE), southwestern sub-region (SW), northwestern sub-region (NW), northeastern sub-region (NE), and central sub-region (CT). The characteristics of ecological drought in NWRC, such as intensity, duration, and frequency, were extracted using the run theory. The return periods of five types of drought were calculated using wavelet analysis. Results showed that the performance of SEWDI in monitoring ecological drought was the best among the drought indices under different time scales, and the 12-month-scale was largely unaffected by wetness and WUE. Results of monitoring indicated that serious ecological droughts in the NWRC mainly occurred in 1982-1986, 1990-1996, and 2005-2010, primarily in SE, SW, and CT, SW and NE, and NW, NE, and CT, respectively. Furthermore, SEWDI in the arid SW, NW and CT showed a longer return period compared to that in the humid NE and SE, and the evolution of ecological drought in arid regions was mainly influenced by meteorological drought and the scarcity of root soil moisture. This study provides ant approach for quantifying ecological drought severity across natural vegetation areas which can be employed by decision makers

TI  - Contribution of remote sensing and GIS to mapping groundwater vulnerability in arid zone: Case from Amour Mountains- Algerian Saharan Atlas
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Protecting groundwater resource from pollution in arid zone is coming an important act for sensing development in this region calling for geomatics tools to characterize the geological and hydrogeological environment. The present work gives a new way to combine remote sensing and geographic information systems to elaborate vulnerability map of Deffa watershed (in Amour Mountains). This region is a good example of arid zones how know an important growth of agriculture, but there is under gap of geological, hydrogeological and soil knowledge. In the first time, we analyzed the Landsat 8-OLI image data with bands combination, ratios composition in RGB and filters to cartography the lithology's contours and lineament map. The false color composition of bands (765, 753, and 543) in RGB given the primary lithological delimitation. Supported by band rationing technique, we produced of 1/50000 geological map. The filter treatments given the lineament map superposed to the first one to realize geo-structural map. In addition, these images served to elaborate pedology map, using Decision Tree (Slope, Redness Index and Lithology parameters). Secondly, we established a GIS including the result map of RS treatment (lithology, lineament and soil maps) and additional spatial information (aquifer type and deep of groundwater surface and precipitations ...). In GIS, the vulnerability index are calculated using GOD and PI methods. Both of maps displayed four classes of vulnerability: between Low and Extreme in the first map, and Very low to High vulnerability in the second one. In the some areas, we have controversial values of vulnerability; this leads us to validate these maps using pollution indicators (NO3, NH4+ and SO42- ). The validation displayed that the PI coincides better with special concentrations of pollutants.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To evaluate the feasibility and clinical value of the combination of carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) and indocyanine green (ICG) for identifying sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in endometrial cancer.Materials and Methods About 153 patients with endometrial cancer were recruited from July 2015 to May 2019. All patients underwent SLN biopsy according to the SLN algorithm for surgical staging with ICG and/or CNPs. The detection rate, factors associated with the detection rate, sensitivity, and negative predictive value (NPV) of SLNs were analyzed.Results The detection rates of SLNs with the combined method were the highest among the different methods. As calculated per hemipelvis, the sensitivity and NPV with ICG alone or with ICG plus CNPs were 100%. With CNP, tumor Grade 3 and laparoscopy were related to unsuccessful overall SLN mapping while tumor diameter greater than 2 cm and laparoscopy were statistically associated with failed bilateral mapping. With ICG, a higher body mass index was significantly associated with unsuccessful bilateral detection of SLN.Conclusion SLN assessment in endometrial cancer is feasible and safe with high sensitivity and high NPV when ICG and CNPs are combined and in low-risk patients. It is a superior option to use CNPs in laparotomy for patients with endometrial cancer.

TI  - A Spectrum Extension Approach for Radiometric Calibration of the Advanced Hyperspectral Imager Aboard the Gaofen-5 Satellite
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The advanced hyperspectral imager (AHSI) is one of the sensors aboard the Chinese Gaofen-5 (GF-5) satellite, possessing characteristics of high spatial and spectral resolution, as well as width swath. To better understand the radiometric performance of GF-5/AHIS after its launch, this article presents an on-orbit radiometric calibration approach for AHSI visible and near-infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) sensors from field automatic observations with a field spectrometer in the absence of SWIR measurements. A spectrum extension method was proposed to extend the retrieved surface hyperspectral reflectance in the VNIR spectral ranges to SWIR by incorporating the historical hyperspectral reflectance library. The radiometric calibration coefficients of GF-5/AHSI were calculated by linear fitting of the observed digital number (DN) values with GF-5/AHSI and predicted at-sensor radiances with MODTRAN 5 based on extended hyperspectral surface reflectance. Comparisons with onboard calibration results were also performed, and the averaged relative differences were within 5% with 1 delta standard deviations less than 10% for most bands, except for those in the atmospheric absorption and low signal-to-noise ratio bands. The comparison results indicate that the on-site radiometric calibration results are consistent with the onboard results, and the operational on-orbit radiometric calibration approach is reliable in the case that there are no measurements in the SWIR spectra range. The on-orbit radiometric performance of GF-5/AHSI rapidly degraded during the first several months after its launch and then tended to be relatively stable.

TI  - Pigeons (<i>Columba livia domestica</i>) Are Susceptible to Infectious Bursal Disease: A Comparative Study of Their Hematological and Serum Biochemical Alterations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The hematological and serum biochemical alterations following very virulent infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) infection in pigeons and chickens were evaluated in this study. Sixty IBDV seronegative birds comprising 30 (3-6 weeks old) pigeons and 30 (3 weeks old) chickens were randomly divided as follows: 10 uninoculated pigeons only, 10 inoculated pigeons + 10 sentinel chickens, 10 inoculated chickens + 10 sentinel pigeons, and 10 uninoculated chickens. Inoculated birds were administered 0.20 ml of inoculum containing very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV). Blood was collected postinoculation/exposure (pi/pe) and processed for hematology and biochemistry. The results revealed significantly (P < 0.05) increased packed cell volume, decreased mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and MCH concentration (MCHC) in inoculated and sentinel chickens. Total leukocyte count (TLC), heterophil, and heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio were increased from 3 dpi/dpe in inoculated pigeons and from 3 to 14 dpi/dpe in inoculated and sentinel chickens. At 10 and 14 dpi/dpe, there was significantly (P < 0.05) increased serum total protein and globulin concentrations and decreased albumin/globulin ratio in pigeons and chickens. Serum urea concentration showed significant (P < 0.05) increase in inoculated and sentinel chickens at 3 and 4 dpi/dpe. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on hematological and serum biochemical alterations due to vvIBDV infection in pigeons.

TI  - The effect of omitting axillary dissection and the impact of radiotherapy on patients with breast cancer sentinel node macrometastases: a cohort study following the ACOSOG Z0011 and AMAROS trials
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To report the outcomes of implementing the ACOSOG Z0011 and AMAROS trials relevant to clinical practice, and to define target groups in whom to avoid or recommend axillary radiotherapy (ART). We also aimed to analyse the reduction in morbidity when axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was omitted. Methods A retrospective cohort study of T1-T2 patients with macrometastases at sentinel lymph node (SLN) who were treated between 2011 and 2020. Breast surgery included either lumpectomy or mastectomy. Patients with <= 2 positive SLN were divided into two cohorts by whether they received ART or not. Survival outcomes and morbidity were analysed by Kaplan-Meyer curves and Cox-regression, respectively. Results 260 pN1a patients were included and ALND was avoided in 167 (64.2%). According the Z0011 results, 72 (43.1%) received no further ART; and based on AMAROS criteria 95 (56.9%) received ART. Median follow-up was 54 months. The 5-year overall survival was 96.8% in the non-RT cohort and 93.4% in the RT cohort (p = 0.19), while the respective 5-year disease-free survivals were 100% and 92.3% (p = 1.06). Lymphedema developed in 3.6% of patients after SLNB versus 43% after ALND (OR 20.25; 95%CI 8.13-50.43). Decreased upper-extremity range of motion appeared in 8.4% of patients after SLNB versus 31.2% after ALND (OR 4.95; 95%CI 2.45-9.98%). Conclusions Our study confirms that omitting ALND is safe and has high survival rates in patients with T1-T2 tumours and <= 2 positive SLNs. Adding ART could be a treatment option for patients who present other risk factors. Avoiding ALND with or without ART was associated with significantly less arm morbidity.

TI  - Health Sentinel: A mobile crowdsourcing platform for self-reported surveys provides early detection of COVID-19 clusters in San Luis Potosi, Mexico
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Health Sentinel (Centinela de la Salud, CDS), a mobile crowdsourcing platform that includes the CDS app, was deployed to assess its utility as a tool for COVID-19 surveillance in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. Methods: The CDS app allowed anonymized individual surveys of demographic features and COVID-19 risk of trans-mission and exacerbation factors from users of the San Luis Potosi Metropolitan Area (SLPMA). The platform's data processing pipeline computed and geolocalized the risk index of each user and enabled the analysis of the variables and their association. Point process analysis identified geographic clustering patterns of users at risk and these were compared with the patterns of COVID-19 cases confirmed by the State Health Services. Results: A total of 1554 COVID-19 surveys were administered through the CDS app. Among the respondents, 50.4 % were men and 49.6 % women, with an average age of 33.5 years. Overall risk index frequencies were, in descending order: no-risk 77.8 %, low risk 10.6 %, respiratory symptoms 6.7 %, medium risk 1.4 %, high risk 2.0 %, very high risk 1.5 %. Comorbidity was the most frequent vulnerability category (32.4 %), followed by the inability to keep home lockdown (19.2 %). Statistically significant risk clusters identified at a spatial scale between 5 and 730 m coincided with those in neighborhoods containing substantial numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: The CDS platform enables the analysis of the sociodemographic features and spatial distribution of in-dividual risk indexes of COVID-19 transmission and exacerbation. It is a useful epidemiological surveillance and early detection tool because it identifies statistically significant and consistent risk clusters in neighborhoods with a substantial number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

TI  - Ice Cliff Dynamics of Debris-Covered Trakarding Glacier in the Rolwaling Region, Nepal Himalaya
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice cliffs can act as "hot spots" for melt on debris-covered glaciers and promote local glacier mass loss. Repeat high-resolution remote-sensing data are therefore required to monitor the role of ice cliff dynamics in glacier mass loss. Here we analyze high-resolution aerial photogrammetry data acquired during the 2007, 2018, and 2019 post-monsoon seasons to delineate and monitor the morphology, distribution, and temporal changes of the ice cliffs across the debris-covered Trakarding Glacier in the eastern Nepal Himalaya. We generate an ice cliff inventory from the 2018 and 2019 precise terrain data, with ice cliffs accounting for 4.7 and 6.1% of the debris-covered area, respectively. We observe large surface lowering (>2.0 m a(-1)) where there is a denser distribution of ice cliffs. We also track the survival, formation, and disappearance of ice cliffs from 2018 to 2019, and find that similar to 15% of the total ice cliff area is replaced by new ice cliffs. Furthermore, we observe the overall predominance of northwest-facing ice cliffs, although we do observe spatial heterogeneities in the aspect variance of the ice cliffs (ice cliffs face in similar/various directions). Many new ice cliffs formed across the stagnant middle sections of the glacier, coincident with surface water drainage and englacial conduit intake observations. This spatial relationship between ice cliffs and the glacier hydrological system suggests that these englacial and supraglacial hydrological systems play a significant role in ice cliff formation.

TI  - Recent above-ground biomass changes in central Chukotka (Russian Far East) using field sampling and Landsat satellite data
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Upscaling plant biomass distribution and dynamics is essential for estimating carbon stocks and carbon balance. In this respect, the Russian Far East is among the least investigated sub-Arctic regions despite its known vegetation sensitivity to ongoing warming. We representatively harvested above-ground biomass (AGB; separated by dominant taxa) at 40 sampling plots in central Chukotka. We used ordination to relate field-based taxa projective cover and Landsat-derived vegetation indices. A general additive model was used to link the ordination scores to AGB. We then mapped AGB for paired Landsat-derived time slices (i.e. 2000/2001/2002 and 2016/2017), in four study regions covering a wide vegetation gradient from closed-canopy larch forests to barren alpine tundra. We provide AGB estimates and changes in AGB that were previously lacking for central Chukotka at a high spatial resolution and a detailed description of taxonomical contributions. Generally, AGB in the study region ranges from 0 to 16 kg m(-2), with Cajander larch providing the highest contribution. Comparison of changes in AGB within the investigated period shows that the greatest changes (up to 1.25 kg m(-2) yr(-1)) occurred in the northern taiga and in areas where land cover changed to larch closed-canopy forest. As well as the notable changes, increases in AGB also occur within the land-cover classes. Our estimations indicate a general increase in total AGB through-out the investigated tundra-taiga and northern taiga, whereas the tundra showed no evidence of change in AGB.

TI  - Impact of Policy and Funding Decisions on COVID-19 Surveillance Operations and Case Reports - South Sudan, April 2020-February 2021.
T2  - MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Early models predicted substantial COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality across Africa (1-3). However, as of March 2021, countries in Africa are among those with the lowest reported incidence of COVID-19 worldwide (4). Whether this reflects effective mitigation, outbreak response, or demographic characteristics, (5) or indicates limitations in disease surveillance capacity is unclear (6). As countries implemented changes in funding, national policies, and testing strategies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, surveillance capacity might have been adversely affected. This study assessed whether changes in surveillance operations affected reporting in South Sudan; testing and case numbers reported during April 6, 2020-February 21, 2021, were analyzed relative to the timing of funding, policy, and strategy changes.* South Sudan, with a population of approximately 11 million, began COVID-19 surveillance in February 2020 and reported 6,931 cases through February 21, 2021. Surveillance data analyzed were from point of entry screening, testing of symptomatic persons who contacted an alert hotline, contact tracing, sentinel surveillance, and outbound travel screening. After travel restrictions were relaxed in early May 2020, international land and air travel resumed and mandatory requirements for negative pretravel test results were initiated. The percentage of all testing accounted for by travel screening increased >300%, from 21.1% to 91.0% during the analysis period, despite yielding the lowest percentage of positive tests among all sources. Although testing of symptomatic persons and contact tracing yielded the highest percentage of COVID-19 cases, the percentage of all testing from these sources decreased 88%, from 52.6% to 6.3% after support for these activities was reduced. Collectively, testing increased over the project period, but shifted toward sources least likely to yield positive results, possibly resulting in underreporting of cases. Policy, funding, and strategy decisions related to the COVID-19 pandemic response, such as those implemented in South Sudan, are important issues to consider when interpreting the epidemiology of COVID-19 outbreaks.

TI  - Feasibility of Pooled One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification for Molecular Staging of Pathologically Node-Negative Colon Cancer: A Prospective Multicenter Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Although conventional one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) is a useful molecular-staging method, its complexity hinders its use in clinical practice. A pooled approach for OSNA (pOSNA) has been evaluated for its feasibility in pathologically node-negative colon cancer (pNNCC) for molecular staging of lymph node metastasis in clinical practice. Methods Subjects were patients diagnosed with clinical stage II-IIIA colon cancer between January 2017 and September 2018. pOSNA involved harvesting pericolic lymph nodes from fresh surgical specimens, cutting them in half, placing 50% of the nodes in a single test tube, and performing the OSNA assay. The remaining halved pericolic, intermediate, and main lymph nodes were submitted for histopathologic examination, with metastasis determined by hematoxylin and eosin staining of a cut surface of each node. Results Of the 98 enrolled patients, 92 formed the analysis set. The mean number of harvested lymph nodes per case was 24.3 (range 5-66) and the mean number of lymph nodes used for pOSNA analysis was 6.9 (range 1-35). The concordance rate, sensitivity, and specificity between methods were 89.1%, 84.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-0.91), and 90.9% (95% CI 0.88-0.94), respectively. The pOSNA upstaging rate for node-negative patients was 9.1% (6/66), and pOSNA returned false-negative results in 15.4% of node-positive cases (4/26). Conclusions pOSNA demonstrated an upstaging rate for pNNCC equivalent to that in previous studies, suggesting its feasibility for molecular staging of pNNCC in clinical practice.

TI  - Impact of temperature and water availability on microwave-derived gross primary production
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation optical depth (VOD) from microwave satellite observations has received much attention in global vegetation studies in recent years due to its relationship to vegetation water content and biomass. We recently have shown that VOD is related to plant productivity, i.e., gross primary production (GPP). Based on this relationship between VOD and GPP, we developed a theory-based machine learning model to estimate global patterns of GPP from passive microwave VOD retrievals. The VOD-GPP model generally showed good agreement with site observations and other global data sets in temporal dynamic but tended to overestimate annual GPP across all latitudes. We hypothesized that the reason for the overestimation is the missing effect of temperature on autotrophic respiration in the theorybased machine learning model. Here we aim to further assess and enhance the robustness of the VOD-GPP model by including the effect of temperature on autotrophic respiration within the machine learning approach and by assessing the interannual variability of the model results with respect to water availability. We used X-band VOD from the VOD Climate Archive (VODCA) data set for estimating GPP and used global state-of-the-art GPP data sets from FLUXCOM and MODIS to assess residuals of the VOD-GPP model with respect to drought conditions as quantified by the Standardized Precipitation and Evaporation Index (SPEI). Our results reveal an improvement in model performance for correlation when including the temperature dependency of autotrophic respiration (average correlation increase of 0.18). This improvement in temporal dynamic is larger for temperate and cold regions than for the tropics. For unbi-ased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) and bias, the results are regionally diverse and are compensated in the global average. Improvements are observed in temperate and cold regions, while decreases in performance are obtained mainly in the tropics. The overall improvement when adding temperature was less than expected and thus may only partly explain previously observed differences between the global GPP data sets. On interannual timescales, estimates of the VOD-GPP model agree well with GPP from FLUXCOM and MODIS. We further find that the residuals between VOD-based GPP estimates and the other data sets do not significantly correlate with SPEI, which demonstrates that the VOD-GPP model can capture responses of GPP to water availability even without including additional information on precipitation, soil moisture or evapotranspiration. Exceptions from this rule were found in some regions: significant negative correlations between VOD-GPP residuals and SPEI were observed in the US corn belt, Argentina, eastern Europe, Russia and China, while significant positive correlations were obtained in South America, Africa and Australia. In these regions, the significant correlations may indicate different plant strategies for dealing with variations in water availability.Overall, our findings support the robustness of global microwave-derived estimates of gross primary production for large-scale studies on climate-vegetation interactions.

TI  - Impacts of urbanization and land transitions on seagrass beds in tropical lagoon in central Vietnam
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Socio-economic development activities have significantly affected biodiversity of seagrass beds in the coastal lagoon areas in central Vietnam. This study was carried out to investigate the major past and potential impacts on seagrass changes in Lang Co lagoon. In this study, historical satellite remote sensing data and GIS technology were used to evaluate the variation of seagrass beds during the period of 1998 to 2020. Bottom Reflectance Index (BRI) was employed with the correlation coefficient between the band pairs and the depth, which fluctuated between 0.76 and 0.90 with the bottom reflectance of the bands including bands 1, 2 and 3 ranging between 0.59 to 3.10, 0.66 to 2.35 and 0.45 to 1.95, respectively. Two coefficients were used to evaluate the accuracy of underwater objects including Kappa coefficient (K) and overall accuracy (OA) which ranged from 0.78 to 0.88 and 83.78 to 91.22, respectively. The classification results of terrestrial layers recorded Kappa coefficients and overall accuracies ranging from 0.76 to 0.90 and 85.35 to 99.27, respectively. The change in the area of seagrass beds and other land use types around Lang Co lagoon was studied during the period of 22 years. In the period of 1998-2004, seagrass was not clearly affected by socio-economic development activities, while the period of 2006-2012 witnessed significant impacts of socio-economic activities on seagrass beds. The period of 2014-2020 revealed the most apparent impacts of economic development on seagrass beds. The results of analyzing land use transitions indicated that while water, sand and artificial layers were stable over time; bare soil, forest and agricultural soil layers combined with plantation areas tended to change continuously over the years. The study results provide a scientific database for sustainable management of the Lang Co lagoon ecosystem in particular and coastal area in central Vietnam in general. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Hydrochemistry and environmental isotopes of spring water and their relation to structure and lithology identified with remote sensing methods in Wadi Araba, Egypt
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Springs located at the historical sites of Wadi Araba (Eastern Desert of Egypt) and emerging from the escarpments of the Northern and Southern Galala Plateaus were investigated. A combination of methods, including hydrochemistry, stable and radioisotope composition, and structural analyses based on satellite data, provided information about the structure of the subsurface and the derived groundwater flow paths. Satellite images reveal karst features within the northern plateau, e.g. conical landforms. Karstic caves were documented along both escarpments. Chemical analysis of floodwater from Wadi Araba indicates higher concentrations of terrestrial salts compared to floodwaters from central and southern parts of the desert. delta O-18 and delta H-2 signatures in spring waters resemble those of floodwater and fall on the global meteoric water line, confirming their fast infiltration with minor influence of evaporation. The aquifer feeding the springs of the Northern Galala Plateau has low retention and the springs dry out quickly, even after heavy rainfall. Contrastingly, H-3 activities in springs emerging from the Southern Galala Plateau refer to much slower subsurface passage. With respect to H-3 content (3.8 TU) in recent flood waters, the spring water at Southern Galala Plateau contains about 40% recently recharged groundwater. However, its largest spring-the St. Antony spring-discharges water with a radiocarbon age of about 15,000 years. In combination with this spring's constant and high discharge over a period of several months, that age estimate suggests a large reservoir with moderate to high retention.

TI  - Highly time-resolved characterization of carbonaceous aerosols using a two-wavelength Sunset thermal-optical carbon analyzer
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbonaceous aerosols have great influence on the air quality, human health and climate change. Except for organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), brown carbon (BrC) mainly originates from biomass burning as a group of OC, with strong absorption from the visible to nearultraviolet wavelengths, and makes a considerable contribution to global warming. Large numbers of studies have reported long-term observation of OC and EC concentrations throughout the world, but studies of BrC based on longterm observations are rather limited. In this study, we established a two-wavelength method (658 and 405 nm) applied in the Sunset thermal-optical carbon analyzer. Based on a 1-year observation, we firstly investigated the characteristics, meteorological impact and transport process of OC and EC. Since BrC absorbs light at 405 nm more effectively than 658 nm, we defined the enhanced concentrations (dEC = EC405 nm EC658 nm) and gave the possibility of providing an indicator of BrC. The receptor model and MODIS fire information were used to identify the presence of BrC aerosols. Our results showed that the carbonaceous aerosol concentrations were the highest in winter and lowest in summer. Traffic emission was an important source of carbonaceous aerosols in Nanjing. Receptor model results showed that strong local emissions were found for OC and EC; how ever, dEC was significantly affected by regional or longrange transport. The dEC/OC and OC/EC ratios showed similar diurnal patterns, and the dEC/OC increased when the OC/EC ratios increased, indicating strong secondary sources or biomass burning contributions to dEC. A total of two biomass burning events both in summer and winter were analyzed, and the results showed that the dEC concentrations were obviously higher on biomass burning days; however, no similar levels of the OC and EC concentrations were found both in biomass burning days and normal days in summer, suggesting that biomass burning emissions made a great contribution to dEC, and the sources of OC and EC were more complicated. Large number of open fire counts from the northwestern and southwestern areas of the study site were observed in winter and significantly contributed to OC, EC and dEC. In addition, the nearby Yangtze River Delta area was one of the main potential source areas of dEC, suggesting that anthropogenic emissions could also be important sources of dEC. The results proved that dEC can be an indicator of BrC on biomass burning days. Our modified two-wavelength instrument provided more information than the traditional single-wavelength thermal-optical carbon analyzer and gave a new idea about the measurement of BrC; the application of dEC data needs to be further investigated.

TI  - Environmental and spatial risk factors for the larval habitats of Plasmodium knowlesi vectors in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo.
T2  - Scientific Reports
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use changes, such as deforestation and agriculture, can influence mosquito vector populations and malaria transmission. These land-use changes have been linked to increased incidence in human cases of the zoonotic malaria Plasmodium knowlesi in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. This study investigates whether these associations are partially driven by fine-scale land-use changes creating more favourable aquatic breeding habitats for P. knowlesi anopheline vectors. Using aerial remote sensing data, we developed a sampling frame representative of all land use types within a major focus of P. knowlesi transmission. From 2015 to 2016 monthly longitudinal surveys of larval habitats were collected in randomly selected areas stratified by land use type. Additional remote sensing data on environmental variables, land cover and landscape configuration were assembled for the study site. Risk factor analyses were performed over multiple spatial scales to determine associations between environmental and spatial variables and anopheline larval presence. Habitat fragmentation (300 m), aspect (350 m), distance to rubber plantations (100 m) and Culex larval presence were identified as risk factors for Anopheles breeding. Additionally, models were fit to determine the presence of potential larval habitats within the areas surveyed and used to generate a time-series of monthly predictive maps. These results indicate that land-use change and topography influence the suitability of larval habitats, and may partially explain the link between P. knowlesi incidence and deforestation. The predictive maps, and identification of the spatial scales at which risk factors are most influential may aid spatio-temporally targeted vector control interventions.

TI  - Environmental and spatial risk factors for the larval habitats of <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> vectors in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use changes, such as deforestation and agriculture, can influence mosquito vector populations and malaria transmission. These land-use changes have been linked to increased incidence in human cases of the zoonotic malaria Plasmodium knowlesi in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. This study investigates whether these associations are partially driven by fine-scale land-use changes creating more favourable aquatic breeding habitats for P. knowlesi anopheline vectors. Using aerial remote sensing data, we developed a sampling frame representative of all land use types within a major focus of P. knowlesi transmission. From 2015 to 2016 monthly longitudinal surveys of larval habitats were collected in randomly selected areas stratified by land use type. Additional remote sensing data on environmental variables, land cover and landscape configuration were assembled for the study site. Risk factor analyses were performed over multiple spatial scales to determine associations between environmental and spatial variables and anopheline larval presence. Habitat fragmentation (300 m), aspect (350 m), distance to rubber plantations (100 m) and Culex larval presence were identified as risk factors for Anopheles breeding. Additionally, models were fit to determine the presence of potential larval habitats within the areas surveyed and used to generate a time-series of monthly predictive maps. These results indicate that land-use change and topography influence the suitability of larval habitats, and may partially explain the link between P. knowlesi incidence and deforestation. The predictive maps, and identification of the spatial scales at which risk factors are most influential may aid spatio-temporally targeted vector control interventions.

TI  - Arctic open-water periods are projected to lengthen dramatically by 2100
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The shrinking of Arctic-wide September sea ice extent is often cited as an indicator of modern climate change; however, the timing of seasonal sea ice retreat/advance and the length of the open-water period are often more relevant to stakeholders working at regional and local scales. Here we highlight changes in regional open-water periods at multiple warming thresholds. We show that, in the latest generation of models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the open-water period lengthens by 63 days on average with 2 degrees C of global warming above the 1850-1900 average, and by over 90 days in several Arctic seas. Nearly the entire Arctic, including the Transpolar Sea Route, has at least 3 months of open water per year with 3.5 degrees C warming, and at least 6 months with 5 degrees C warming. Model bias compared to satellite data suggests that even such dramatic projections may be conservative. In several of the Arctic ocean basins, the period of open water without sea-ice cover will lengthen by more than 90 days under 2 C-o of global warming, suggest analyses of the latest (CMIP6) climate model simulations.

TI  - Fat-enlarged axillary lymph nodes are associated with node-positive breast cancer in obese patients
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Obesity associated fat infiltration of organ systems is accompanied by organ dysfunction and poor cancer outcomes. Obese women demonstrate variable degrees of fat infiltration of axillary lymph nodes (LNs), and they are at increased risk for node-positive breast cancer. However, the relationship between enlarged axillary nodes and axillary metastases has not been investigated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between axillary metastases and fat-enlarged axillary nodes visualized on mammograms and breast MRI in obese women with a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer. Methods This retrospective case-control study included 431 patients with histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer. The primary analysis of this study included 306 patients with pre-treatment and pre-operative breast MRI and body mass index (BMI) > 30 (201 node-positive cases and 105 randomly selected node-negative controls) diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between April 1, 2011, and March 1, 2020. The largest visible LN was measured in the axilla contralateral to the known breast cancer on breast MRI. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the association between node-positive status and LN size adjusting for age, BMI, tumor size, tumor grade, tumor subtype, and lymphovascular invasion. Results A strong likelihood of node-positive breast cancer was observed among obese women with fat-expanded lymph nodes (adjusted OR for the 4th vs. 1st quartile for contralateral LN size on MRI: 9.70; 95% CI 4.26, 23.50; p < 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic curve for size of fat-enlarged nodes in the contralateral axilla identified on breast MRI had an area under the curve of 0.72 for predicting axillary metastasis, and this increased to 0.77 when combined with patient and tumor characteristics. Conclusion Fat expansion of axillary lymph nodes was associated with a high likelihood of axillary metastases in obese women with invasive breast cancer independent of BMI and tumor characteristics.

TI  - Characterizing the behaviour of surge-type glaciers in the Geladandong Mountain Region, Inner Tibetan Plateau, from 1986 to 2020
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although surging glaciers in the Geladandong Mountain region represent a small percentage of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau's glacier population, they can provide valuable insight into the glacier processes, flow instabilities, and fast glacier flow. Here we identify 11 surge-type glaciers and reported the observations of surging behaviour in this region by mapping changes in the terminus position, surface velocity, and elevation of glaciers, using a combination of Landsat and ASTER satellite imagery from 1986 to 2020, TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X, NASADEM, and topographic maps. Among the 11 surge-type glaciers, nine glaciers started to surge in the 1980s and 1990s, and two glaciers began to surge after 2000. In total, we present 22 surface velocity data sets, which show that the active phases usually last 10-19 years and peak surge velocities are between 30 +/- 1.26 m a(-1) and 100 +/- 1.26 m a(-1). The acceleration phases at the beginning can last for several years, and the deceleration phases at the end last for a maximum of 2 years, and the flow velocity in summer is greater than that in winter. Under the background of global climate warming, no single process is responsible for glacier surges in the Geladandong Mountain region. The dynamic evolution of glacier surges does not fit neatly within either of the classically cited thermal or hydrological models of surging. We hypothesize that the recent glacier surges may be caused by multiple factors. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Limitations of WRF land surface models for simulating land use and land cover change in Sub-Saharan Africa and development of an improved model (CLM-AF v. 1.0)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover change (LULCC) impacts local and regional climates through various biogeophysical processes. Accurate representation of land surface parameters in land surface models (LSMs) is essential to accurately predict these LULCC-induced climate signals. In this work, we test the applicability of the default Noah, Noah-MB and Community Land Model (CLM) LSMs in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model over Sub-Saharan Africa. We find that the default WRF LSMs do not accurately represent surface albedo, leaf area index, and surface roughness in this region due to various flawed assumptions, including the treatment of the MODIS woody savanna land use and land cover (LULC) category as closed shrubland. Consequently, we developed a WRF CLM version with more accurate African land surface parameters (CLM-AF), designed such that it can be used to evaluate the influence of LULCC. We evaluate meteorological performance for the default LSMs and CLM-AF against observational datasets, gridded products, and satellite estimates. Further, we conduct LULCC experiments with each LSM to determine if differences in land surface parameters impact the LULCC-induced climate responses. Despite clear deficiencies in surface parameters, all LSMs reasonably capture the spatial pattern and magnitude of near-surface temperature and precipitation. However, in the LULCC experiments, inaccuracies in the default LSMs result in illogical localized temperature and precipitation changes. Differences in thermal changes between Noah-MP and CLM-AF indicate that the temper- ature impacts from LULCC are dependent on the sensitivity of evapotranspiration to LULCC in Sub-Saharan Africa. Errors in land surface parameters indicate that the default WRF LSMs considered are not suitable for LULCC experiments in tropical or Southern Hemisphere regions and that proficient meteorological model performance can mask these issues. We find CLM-AF to be suitable for use in Sub-Saharan Africa LULCC studies, but more work is needed by the WRF community to improve its applicability to other tropical and Southern Hemisphere climates.

TI  - Ocean Color Hyperspectral Remote Sensing With High Resolution and Low Latency--The HYPSO-1 CubeSat Mission
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sporadic ocean color events with characteristic spectra, in particular algal blooms, call for quick delivery of high-resolution remote sensing data for further analysis. Motivated by this, we present the mission design for HYPerspectral Smallsat for Ocean observation (HYPSO-1), a 6U CubeSat at 500 km orbital altitude hosting a custom-built pushbroom hyperspectral imager with wavelengths 387-801 nm at 3.33 nm bandpass and a swath width of 70 km. The imager's expected signal-to-noise ratio is characterized for typical open ocean water-leaving radiance which can be flexibly increased by binning pixels. Using geometric principles, the satellite shall execute a slew maneuver during a scan to induce greater overlap in the pixels with a goal to enable better than 100 m spatial resolution. Since high-dimensional hyperspectral data need to be transmitted over limited space-to-ground communications, we have designed a modular FPGA-based onboard image processing architecture that significantly reduces the data size without losing important spatial-spectral information. We justify the concept with a simulated scenario where HYPSO-1 first collects numerous hyperspectral images of a 40 km by 40 km coastal area in Norway and aims to immediately transfer these to nearby ground stations. Using CCSDS123 lossless compression, it takes about one orbital revolution to obtain the complete data product when considering overhead in satellite bus communications and less than 10 min without the overhead. It is shown that even better latency can be achieved with more advanced onboard processing algorithms.

TI  - Patterns of relapse and pathological response according to surrogate type in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and negative axillary involvement
T2  - CLINICA E INVESTIGACION EN GINECOLOGIA Y OBSTETRICIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To determine relapse patterns and pathological response in relation to surrogate types of breast cancer after neoadjuvant treatment to analyse survival and optimize surveillance. Material and methods: Retrospective analysis of 112 patients with 116 tumours, with negative axillary involvement, treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy at our hospital, between 2008 and 2014, who systematically underwent surgery. We analysed pathological response according to surrogate subtypes, rates and patterns of recurrence, disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Pathological complete response (pCR) was achieved in 52.6%, finding that these patients had better survival (p< .05). Looking at surrogate subtypes, we observed a pCR in 85% of pure Her-2/neu positive tumours, 65.6% of triple negatives, 43.8% of Her-2 posi-tive Luminal B, 40% of Luminal B and 25% of Luminal A (p< .05). With a median follow-up of 53 months, we found a 9% rate of relapses. The less aggressive types had a median loco-regional relapse time of 38.5 months and a systemic recurrence time of 74 months. The more aggres-sive types showed a loco-regional relapse time of 36.2 months and systemic recurrence time of 8 months. Conclusions: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy according to surrogate type is a useful strategy to attempt pCR. Loco-regional relapse and systemic recurrence patterns allow surveillance adjust-ments.

TI  - Heat risk assessment based on mobile phone data: case study of Bratislava, Slovakia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this interdisciplinary study is to assess the heat risk for Bratislava. The following layers were created to compute the risk index: the hazard layer of air temperature, a mitigation layer of tree vegetation, an exposure layer of population and a vulnerability layer of individuals over 65 years of age. The MUKLIMO_3 model was used to evaluate the field of mean surface air temperature at 9 PM during selected days of the summer heat wave in August 2018. The tree vegetation layer, in the form of percentage per grid cell, was derived from Sentinel-2 satellite data. Population density data are based on mobile positioning data, and elderly population data are based on a gridded database from the statistical census. Input layers were unified into a resolution of 500 x 500 m, and the heat risk index was calculated by summation of the weighted input layers. The results reflect the variability of the population and the elderly population within the city, as well as the variability of the temperature field, which is caused by the joint effect of an urban heat island and topography. The highest values of risk index occur within the broader city centre, with specific hot spots at several places.

TI  - A semi-empirical scheme for bathymetric mapping in shallow water by ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2: A case study in the South China Sea
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To derive shallow water bathymetry for coastal areas, a common approach is to deploy a scanning airborne bathymetric light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system or a shipborne echosounder for ground surveys. However, recent advancements in satellite remote sensing, including the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) offer new tools for generating satellite derived bathymetry (SDB). The key payload onboard ICESat-2 is the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), a micro-pulse, photon-counting LiDAR system, simultaneously emitting six separate 532 nm beams at 10 kHz pulse rate. However, despite its high resolution, the major limitation for bathymetry is that ICESat-2 only provides along-track height profiles, leaving observation gaps between the parallel ground tracks. Merging ICESat-2 observations with optical multispectral imagery, as demonstrated herein, provides an effective solution for deriving a full scene of water depth in light of the spectral attenuation behavior.This study aims to combine ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2 optical data to derive shallow water bathymetry (depth <20 m) at six islands and reefs in the South China Sea. ICESat-2 ATL03 point clouds of georeferenced photons are first filtered to determine the seafloor elevation along the ground track. Results indicate a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.26-0.61 m as compared with independent observations from an airborne LiDAR campaign. Next, three semi-empirical functions, namely the Modified Linear/Polynomial/Exponential Ratio Models with its kernel formed by the log ratio between Sentinel-2's green and blue bands, are used to fit the spectral data with ICESat-2 height profiles. After water depth mapping using the trained model, independent ICESat-2 point clouds are used to validate the Sentinel-2 derived bathymetry. The RMSE values of the three models using the weighted average of multiple images for these six islands are within 0.50-0.90 m in 0-15 m deep. We also demonstrate that a synthesis of satellite laser altimetry and optical remote sensing can produce SDB results that potentially meet the requirement of category C in Zones of Confidence (ZOC) of the Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) in 0-8 m deep. It is foreseen that ICESat-2 will be a helpful tool for mapping coastal and shallow waters around the world especially where bathymetric data are unavailable.

TI  - A novel germline mutation in hMLH1 in three Korean women with endometrial cancer in a family of Lynch syndrome: case report and literature review
T2  - HEREDITARY CANCER IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Endometrial cancer is often the sentinel cancer in women with Lynch syndrome, among which endometrioid endometrial cancer is the most common. We found a Korean case of uterine carcinosarcoma associated with Lynch syndrome. And we reviewed 27 Korean women with endometrial cancer associated with Lynch syndrome already released in case report so far. Case presentation The proband, a 45-year-old Korean woman received treatment for endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Her older sister and niece were treated for endometrioid adenocarcinoma and carcinosarcoma, respectively. Family history met the Amsterdam II criteria and immunohistochemical analysis revealed a loss of MLH1 and PMS2. They all harbored a previously unreported germline likely pathogenic variant in c.1367delC in MLH1. They underwent staging operations including total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic/paraaortic lymph node dissection, and washing cytology. All three women were healthy without evidence of relapse for over 4 years. Conclusion This report indicates a novel germline c.1367delC variant in MLH1, and presents a Korean case of uterine carcinosarcoma associated with Lynch syndrome. Furthermore, the c.1757_1758insC variant in MLH1 was suggested as a founder mutation in Lynch syndrome in Korean women.

TI  - Landsat 8 monitoring of multi-depth suspended sediment concentrations in Lake Erie's Maumee River using machine learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing has been widely used to map suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in waterbodies. However, due to the complexity of sediment-water interactions, it has been difficult to derive linear and non-linear regression equations to reliably predict SSC, especially when trying to estimate depth of integrated sediment. This study uses Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) sensor to map SSC within the Maumee River in Ohio, USA, at multiple depth intervals (15, 61, 91, and 182 cm). Simple linear least squares regression (LLSR), and three common machine learning models: random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and model averaged neural network (MANN) were used to estimate SSC at the depth intervals. All machine learning models significantly outperformed LLSR while RF performed the best. In both RF and MANN, R (2) (coefficient of determination) increases with depth with a maximum R (2) of 0.89 and 0.83, respectively, at a depth of 0-182 cm. The results show that machine learning models can implement nonlinear relationships that produce better predictions than traditional linear regression methods in estimating depth integrated SSC, especially when samples are limited.

TI  - Combined effects of temperature and of high hydrogen and oxygen contents on the mechanical behavior of a zirconium alloy upon cooling from the β<sub>Zr</sub> phase temperature range
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - During hypothetical loss-of-coolant accidents (LOCA), zirconium-based nuclear fuel claddings can be exposed to high temperatures in the beta(Zr) phase domain and absorb substantial amounts of hydrogen (up to about 3000 weight ppm) and oxygen (up to about 1 weight %). This paper provides novel data about the combined effects of high hydrogen and oxygen contents on the mechanical behavior of the (prio-r)beta(Zr) phase, as a function of temperature, upon cooling from the beta(Zr) phase temperature range. A protocol was developed to homogeneously charge Zircaloy-4 cladding tubes at different hydrogen contents, up to 3200 weight ppm, and oxygen contents, between 0.13 and 0.9 wt%. Tensile tests were then performed at various temperatures between 700 degrees C and 30 degrees C upon cooling from the beta(Zr) domain. The results show that the mechanical behavior strongly depends on the testing temperature and the hydrogen and oxygen contents. Relationships are proposed to describe the macroscopic ductile-to-brittle transition and the mechanical behavior of the material as a function of temperature, hydrogen and oxygen contents. The predictions based on these relationships are compared to selected data from the literature obtained on claddings oxidized at high temperature, including results from semi-integral LOCA tests. Also, it is shown that considering the combined effects of hydrogen and oxygen is necessary to interpret the material's mechanical behavior, particularly the embrittlement of claddings subjected to LOCA-relevant secondary hydriding.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing has been widely used to monitor surface water, but its application in observing rapid inundation changes remains challenging. Observations relying on only one sensor could hardly achieve both high temporal and high spatial resolutions. High spatial resolution images are not frequent enough to capture the fast-changing inundation, while high temporal resolution images do not provide sufficient detail on spatial variations. To address this resolution compromise for rapid response, here we propose a new automated method to estimate daily sub-pixel water cover, the surface water fraction, from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat images. First, water indices are derived from MODIS and Landsat images, and the Landsat derived water indices are used to generate a binary water map. We then aggregate the Landsat water map to the coarser MODIS resolution, making a surface water fraction map. Second, the relationship between the MODIS derived water indices and the Landsat derived surface water fraction is fitted using a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model. Lastly, the fitted GPR model is applied to new MODIS imagery to estimate surface water fraction. The experiment results showed that the proposed method could provide water fraction with Root Mean Squared Errors of less than 7%. By mapping fractional water cover automatically and regularly, the proposed method could facilitate daily emergency responses and long-term analyses.

TI  - Optimum interpolation analysis for Fengyun-3C sea surface temperature data using oriented elliptic correlation scales
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Optimum interpolation (OI) analysis is performed on the sea surface temperature (SST) products retrieved from the Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) visible and infrared radiometer (VIRR). The oriented elliptic correlation scale is employed on the SST data and then compared with those from the traditional rectangular correlation scale in the OI analysis. The results were also evaluated against the daily SST data from the in-situ buoys and the Reynolds Optimum Interpolation 1/4 Degree Daily SST (OISST) during 2015. The statistical metrics indicate that the SSTs determined using the oriented elliptic correlation scales have higher accuracy than those from rectangular correlation scales, as the root-mean-square error (RMSE) from 0.42 degrees C to 0.38 degrees C, which are higher than those obtained with the comparison with OISST (RMSE of 0.28 degrees C). This assessment demonstrates that the original SST data from FY-3C VIRR are of poor quality due to the presence of unresolved errors, whereas the oriented elliptic correlation scales for SST demonstrate better performance than the rectangular correlation scales in the OI analysis.

TI  - Validation of preliminary geometric positioning accuracy for China's civil high-resolution surveying and mapping satellites: Ziyuan-3 01 and Gaofen-7 panchromatic imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The positioning accuracy of Ziyuan-3 01 (ZY-3 01) and Gaofen-7 (GF-7) panchromatic imagery, obtained during the early deployment of the satellites, was verified. Particularly, this paper first validated the geometric positioning accuracy of GF-7 panchromatic imagery. Based on the rigorous geometric model of surveying and mapping satellites, this study applied a geometric calibration (GC) model using the Rodrigues rotation matrix. Also, we employed the self-calibrating bundle adjustment with an additional parameter model to compensate for the internal orientation distortion. The results show that the positioning accuracy can be largely improved with few ground control points. Especially, the horizontal accuracy (specified in x and y) and elevation accuracy of ZY-3 01 in the Anping area are around 4 m and 2 m, respectively, and that of GF-7 in the Beijing area can achieve 3.2 m, 2.8 m, and 1.2 m in the x, y, and z directions, respectively.

TI  - The principles and practice of death: The Oslerian conflicted conception of dying
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL BIOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sir William Osler espoused a particularly idealized medical life that included the patient in the physician's worldview. Disease is not considered a monolith, only a reflection of one's broader health. Death, too, is configured as a part of one's being, not as a thing apart from life. The wholesomeness that characterized Osler's practice is well known-however, his long discussions and thoughts on death have not been sufficiently analyzed. His clinical views have been hinted at and numerous medical historians have noted that Osler's worldview on death was avant-garde for its time, one in which he described finality not as a time of suffering and anguish, but as "singularly free from mental distress." This essay contends with this simple view. This straightforward understanding becomes complicated when delving into such primary resources as Osler's Study on Dying cards, his writings on other medical conditions, and personal reflections following the personal losses of his sons Edward Revere Osler and Paul Revere Osler. This essay contends that the loss and the death he imagines is not one of peace, but rather, of horror and terror. Furthermore, the primary sources show Osler not as the paragon of flawless clinical acumen and reasoning, but a man of personal beliefs that were in conflict with views he espoused more publicly. The essay therefore reconceptualizes the common understanding of a stoic Osler, determines how death prefigures into Oslerian thought, and challenges the idea of an Oslerian simple death.

TI  - Global and regional impacts of land cover changes on isoprene emissions derived from spaceborne data and the MEGAN model
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by plant foliage, isoprene is by far the most important in terms of both global emission and atmospheric impact. It is highly reactive in the air, and its degradation favours the generation of ozone (in the presence of NOx) and secondary organic aerosols. A critical aspect of BVOC emission modelling is the representation of land use and land cover (LULC). The current emission inventories are usually based on land cover maps that are either modelled and dynamic or satellite-based and static. In this study, we use the state-of-the-art Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) model coupled with the canopy model MOHYCAN (Model for Hydrocarbon emissions by the CANopy) to generate and evaluate emission inventories relying on satellite-based LULC maps at annual time steps. To this purpose, we first intercompare the distribution and evolution (2001-2016) of tree coverage from three global satellite-based datasets, MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), ESA Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (ESA CCI-LC), and the Global Forest Watch (GFW), and from national inventories. Substantial differences are found between the datasets; e.g. the global areal coverage of trees ranges from 30 to 50 x 10(6) km(2), with trends spanning from -0.26 to +0.03 % yr(-1) between 2001 and 2016. At the national level, the increasing trends in forest cover reported by some national inventories (in particular for the US) are contradicted by all remotely sensed datasets. To a great extent, these discrepancies stem from the plurality of definitions of forest used. According to some local censuses, clear cut areas and seedling or young trees are classified as forest, while satellite-based mappings of trees rely on a minimum height. Three inventories of isoprene emissions are generated, differing only in their LULC datasets used as input: (i) the static distribution of the stand-alone version of MEGAN, (ii) the time-dependent MODIS land cover dataset, and (iii) the MODIS dataset modified to match the tree cover distribution from the GFW database. The mean annual isoprene emissions (350-520 Tg yr(-1)) span a wide range due to differences in tree distributions, especially in isoprene-rich regions. The impact of LULC changes is a mitigating effect ranging from 0.04 to 0.33 % yr(-1) on the positive trends (0.94 % yr(-1)) mainly driven by temperature and solar radiation. This study highlights the uncertainty in spatial distributions of and temporal variability in isoprene associated with remotely sensed LULC datasets. The interannual variability in the emissions is evaluated against spaceborne observations of formaldehyde (HCHO), a major isoprene oxidation product, through simulations using the global chemistry transport model (CTM) IMAGESv2. A high correlation (R > 0.8) is found between the observed and simulated interannual variability in HCHO columns in most forested regions. The implementation of LULC change has little impact on this correlation due to the dominance of meteorology as a driver of short-term interannual variability. Nevertheless, the simulation accounting for the large tree cover declines of the GFW database over several regions, notably Indonesia and Mato Grosso in Brazil, provides the best agreement with the HCHO column trends observed by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI).Overall, our study indicates that the continuous tree cover fields at fine resolution provided by the GFW database are our preferred choice for constraining LULC (in combination with discrete LULC maps such as those of MODIS) in biogenic isoprene emission models.

TI  - Evaluation of time scale of meteorological, hydrological and agricultural drought indices
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was carried out to characterize drought in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra, which experiences recurring droughts, through meteorological, hydrological and agricultural drought indices, namely the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Streamflow Drought Index (SDI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), respectively. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Streamflow Drought Index (SDI) were computed at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12-month time scales using in situ precipitation and streamflow data, respectively, for 35 years (1980-2014). The VCI was computed using MODIS satellite data at 500 m resolution for 1, 3 and 5-month time scales for 15 years (2000-2014). The time scales of drought indices were evaluated using historical drought years and foodgrain production. The drought area observed by SPI, SDI and VCI at different time scales was correlated with foodgrain production during kharif season for 15 years (2000-2014). The correlation analysis indicated a significant correlation between foodgrain production and 3-month SPI (r = - 0.724) and 5-month VCI (r = - 0.811), respectively, however, a low correlation was observed between multiscale SDI and foodgrain production. 3-month SPI and 5-month VCI were found to be more appropriate time scales to observe meteorological and agricultural droughts, respectively, in the region; while none of the SDI's time scales could capture hydrological drought. The analysis also revealed that the magnitude of meteorological (observed by 3-month SPI) and agricultural (observed by 5-month VCI) droughts mimic the quantum of loss in foodgrain production very closely. However, the severity and the areal extent of droughts observed by these indices were varied both spatially and temporally. Thus, the present study concluded that a single indicator (i.e., meteorological, hydrological or agricultural) is not sufficient to capture the actual drought situation, thereby suggesting the use of multiple indicators-based approaches for realistic drought characterization and monitoring.

TI  - Assessment of Frailty Can Guide Decision Making for Utilization of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients with Thick Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is often omitted in selected patients with advanced primary melanoma, although the justification/criteria for omission have been debated.Objective. We sought to determine whether assessment of frailty could serve as an objective marker to guide selection for SLNB in patients with advanced primary melanoma.Methods. Patients presenting with clinical stage IIC (ulcerated, > 4 mm Breslow thickness) cutaneous melanoma from January 1999 through June 2019 were included. Frailty was assessed using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Frailty Index (MSK FI), a composite score of functional status and medical comorbidities. Five-year melanoma-specific survival (MSS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Cox regression, and predictors of OS were identified using competing risk models.Results. MSS did not differ between patients who did (n = 451) or did not undergo SLNB (n = 179) [63.2% vs. 65.0%, p = 0.14]; however, omission of SLNB was associated with decreased 5-year OS (29% vs. 44%, p < 0.001). In a multivariable competing risk model, selection for SLNB omission was an independent predictor of death from non-melanoma causes (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-2.3, p < 0.001). After incorporation of the MSK FI score into the multivariable model in this subset, MSK FI (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.5-4.1, p < 0.001), but not SLNB omission, was an independent predictor of poorer OS.Conclusion. We observed worse OS in patients with thick melanoma selected not to undergo SLNB, which was attributed to death due to non-melanoma causes. Formal assessment of frailty may provide an objective prognostic measure to guide selective use of SLNB in these patients.

TI  - Biocompatible zinc gallogermanate persistent luminescent nanoparticles for fast tumor drainage lymph node imaging in vivo
T2  - COLLOIDS AND SURFACES B-BIOINTERFACES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumor drainage lymph node identification and dissection are crucial for the oncological surgery to prevent/delay the recurrence. However, commercial imaging reagents distinguish the lymph nodes by staining them dark, which would be seriously interfered by blood and surrounding tissues. In this study, we reported the Cr3+/Pr3+doped zinc gallogermanate persistent luminescent nanoparticles (PLNPs) for fast tumor drainage lymph node imaging with high contrast. PLNPs were synthesized by citrate sol-gel method and dispersed in Tween 80 for in vivo applications. PLNPs were well dispersed in water with hydrodynamic radii of 5 nm and emitted strong persistent luminescence at 696 nm upon the irradiation of UV light. The advantage of afterglow imaging over fluorescent imaging of PLNPs was first established after subcutaneous injection to mice with much higher contrast and less interference of autofluorescence. PLNPs quickly migrated to sentinel lymph nodes after the interdermal injection to extremity of mice. The tumor drainage lymph node imaging was achieved within 5 min upon the intratumoral injection to H460 tumor bearing mice and the signal to noise ratio was 462. Due to the lack of targeting moieties, the intravenous injected PLNPs mainly accumulated in liver. There were no statistical changes in serum biochemistry and abnormal histopathological characteristic, indicating the low toxicity of PLNPs. These findings highlighted the great potential of PLNPs as high-performance imaging reagent for lymph node identification.

TI  - Individual differences in epistemically suspect beliefs: the role of analytic thinking and susceptibility to cognitive biases
T2  - THINKING & REASONING
M3  - Article
AB  - The endorsement of epistemically suspect (i.e., paranormal, conspiracy, and pseudoscientific) beliefs is widespread and has negative consequences. Therefore, it is important to understand the reasoning processes - such as lower analytic thinking and susceptibility to cognitive biases - that might lead to the adoption of such beliefs. In two studies, I constructed and tested a novel questionnaire on epistemically suspect beliefs (Study 1, N = 263), and used it to examine probabilistic reasoning biases and belief bias in syllogistic reasoning as predictors of the endorsement of those beliefs, while accounting for analytic thinking and worldview variables (Study 2, N = 397). Probabilistic reasoning biases, analytic thinking, religious faith, and political liberalism consistently predicted various epistemically suspect beliefs, whereas the effect of syllogistic belief bias was largely restricted to pseudoscientific beliefs. Further research will be needed to examine the role the biased evaluation of evidence plays in the endorsement of epistemically suspect beliefs.

TI  - Assessing the appropriateness of the Moving Epidemic Method and WHO Average Curve Method for the syndromic surveillance of acute respiratory infection in Mauritius
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Mauritius introduced Acute respiratory infection (ARI) syndromic surveillance in 2007. The Moving Epidemic Method (MEM) and the World Health Organization Average Curve Method (WHO ACM) have been used widely in several countries to establish thresholds to determine the seasonality of acute respiratory infections. This study aimed to evaluate the appropriateness of these tools for ARI syndromic surveillance in Mauritius, where two or more waves are observed.Method The proportion of attendance due to acute respiratory infections was identified as the transmissibility indicator to describe seasonality using the Moving Epidemic Method and the WHO Average Curve Method. The proportion was obtained from weekly outpatient data between 2012 and 2018 collected from the sentinel acute respiratory infections surveillance. A cross-validation analysis was carried out. The resulting indicators of the goodness of fit model were used to assess the robustness of the seasonal/epidemic threshold of both the Moving Epidemic Method and WHO Average Curve Method. Additionally, a comparative analysis examined the integrity of the thresholds without the year 2017.Result The cross-validation analysis demonstrated no statistically significant differences between the means scores of the indicators when comparing the two waves/seasons curves of WHO ACM and MEM. The only exception being that the Wilcoxon sign rank test strongly supported that the specificity mean score of the two waves/seasons curve for WHO ACM outweighed that of its corresponding wave model for the MEM (P = 0.002). The comparative analysis with 2017 data showed the value of the epidemic threshold remained the same regardless of the methods and the number of seasonal waves.Conclusion The two waves models of the Moving Epidemic Method and WHO Average Curve Method could be deployed for acute respiratory infection syndromic surveillance in Mauritius, considering that two or more activity peaks are observed in a season.

TI  - Integration of Sentinel-derived NDVI to reduce uncertainties in the operational field monitoring of maize
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy cover (CC) is a key parameter in calibration and validation of crop growth models, especially those used in operational field monitoring. However, CC direct measurements require intense field campaigns, increasing the cost in time-series data acquisition for large agricultural areas. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a commonly used remote-sensing vegetation index, expressing crop water-status, being indirectly related to CC. In this paper, we explore the relationship between on-site CC and the high-resolution NDVI data acquired via Sentinel 2 products. This relationship was utilized to produce CC time series over the cultivation period in four maize fields in northern and central Greece. Subsequently, the expression linking CC and NDVI was used to operationally validate CC change in a crop model capable to simulate the maize growth cycle (AquaCrop). The proposed method involves the dynamic in-season re-adjustment to a number of key model input parameters, based on the remotely acquired CC time series, namely maximum CC, canopy growth and decline coefficient, growing degree days needed to the beginning of senescence stage. These re-adjusted parameters were imported to model's crop file to improve simulations in CC, soil water content, final biomass and yield. Results showed that the remotely acquired CC time series could be successfully used as an alternative mean to validate CC simulations. Moreover, the ingestion of re-estimated parameters to crop file, improved model's capability to simulate CC (R2 0.98; RMSE < 5.12%), biomass (Pe < 12%) and yield (Pe < 12%). No significant differences were observed in model's performance regarding soil water content simulation.

TI  - Evaluating satellite hyperspectral (Orbita) and multispectral (Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2) imagery for identifying cotton acreage
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing demonstrates a great potential for identifying crops. Orbita hyperspectral image satellite (OHS) is a new hyperspectral satellite in orbit with the highest spectral and spatial resolutions and relatively short spectral range. In this study, the OHS, along with Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (System, Landsat) eight operational land imager (OLI) images (assigned as L8) and Sentinel-2B (S2B) images, was used to identify cotton and estimate its acreage in Beiquan town, Shihezi city, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China based on spectral reflectance, sample separability, and accuracy. And Two Class Support vector machine was adapted to map cotton acreage. For the spectral reflectance of cotton, OHS is slightly higher than the analytical spectral device (ASD) in the visible range and is similar in the near-infrared range. Both the S2B and L8 spectrum curves of cotton fit well with the ASD spectrum's. For the sample separability, the pair values between cotton and non-cotton (e.g. impervious surface, water, maize, grape, etc.) of OHS and S2B are better than that of L8 in general, indicating that OHS and S2B are more reliable than L8 for cotton identification using OHS, L8, and S2B. The results show that the overall accuracy of these three sensors is comparable: an overall accuracy of 0.96 from OHS, 0.95 from S2B, and 0.94 from L8. Moreover, the cotton identification accuracy is not only related to the spatial resolution but also to the spectral resolution and band position, and more importantly to each sensor speci?cations, even though each satellite hyperspectral and multispectral sensor has its own unique advantages in being complimentary for identifying cotton and other crops.

AB  - Atmospheric heterogeneity mainly exposes itself as tropospheric-phase delay in Satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture radar (InSAR) observations, which smears or even overshadows the deformation component of InSAR measurements. In this study, we estimated the performance of four Global Atmospheric Models (GAMs), i.e. European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5), ERA-Interim (ERA-I), Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications v2 (MERRA2) and Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service for InSAR (GACOS), for tropospheric-phase delay reduction in InSAR applications in the Tibetan plateau, of which ERA5 is the latest GAM released by ECMWF. We demonstrated the effectiveness of Atmospheric Phase Screen (APS) correction using the four GAMs for more than 700 Sentinel-1 Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans interferograms covering two study areas in the southern (R1) and northwest margins (R2) of the Tibetan plateau. Topography-correlated signals have been widely observed in these interferograms, which are most likely due to the APS effects. We calculated the Standard Deviations (SD) and Pearson's Correlation Coefficients (r) between InSAR Line of Sight measurements and topography before and after applying APS correction. The results show that the SDs of non-deformation areas from the GAMs decrease to approximately 4 mm from around 10 mm and 12 mm originally on average for R1 and R2, respectively, and the r after the APS correction are reduced below 0.4 from around 0.8 for the selected interferometric pairs. In addition, as the newly released GAM, ERA5 has similar performance with GACOS products and outperforms other models generally. This suggests that GAMs, particularly ERA5, have great potential in the APS correction for InSAR applications in the Tibetan plateau.

TI  - A meta-analysis of the efficacy of vascularised lymph node transfer in reducing limb volume and cellulitis episodes in patients with cancer treatment-related lymphoedema
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Lymphoedema after cancer treatment is a chronic and disabling complication that presents a significant health care burden during survivorship with limited treatment options. Vascularised lymph node transfer (VLNT) can reconstruct lymphatic flow to reduce limb volumes, but limited higher-order evidence exists to support its effectiveness.Aim: The aim of the study was to systematically review and meta-analyse the effectiveness of VLNT in reducing upper limb (UL) or lower limb (LL) volume and cellulitis episodes in patients with cancer treatment-related lymphoedema (CTRL).Methods: PubMed, Medline (Ovid) and Embase databases were searched between January 1974 and December 2019. Full-length articles where VLNT was the sole therapeutic procedure for CTRL, reporting volumetric limb, frequency of infection episodes and/or lymphoedemaspecific quality-of-life data, were included in a random-effects meta-analysis of circumferential reduction rate (CRR). Methodological quality was assessed using STROBE/CONSORT, and a novel, lymphoedema-specific scoring tool was used to assess lymphoedema-specific methodological reporting. Sensitivity analyses on the site of VLNT harvest and recipient location were performed.Results: Thirty-one studies (581 patients) were eligible for inclusion. VLNT led to significant limb volume reductions in UL (above elbow pooled CRRs [CRRP] = 42.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 36.5-48.8]; below elbow CRR = 34.1% [95% CI: 33.0-35.1]) and LL (above knee CRRP = 46.8% [95% CI: 43.2-50.4]; below knee CRRP = 54.6% [95% CI: 39.0-70.2]) CTRL. VLNT flaps from extra-abdominal donor sites were associated with greater volume reductions (CRRP = 49.5% [95% CI: 46.5-52.5]) than those from intra-abdominal donor sites (CRRp = 39.6% [95% CI: 37.2-42.0]) and synchronous autologous breast reconstruction/ VLNT flaps (CRRP = 32.7% [95% CI: 11.1-54.4]) (p < 0.05). VLNT was also found to reduce the mean number of cellulitis episodes by 2.1 episodes per year (95% CI: -2.7--1.4) and increased lymphoedema-specific quality-of-life scores (mean difference in Lymphoedema-Specific Quality of Life (LYMQOL) "overall domain" = +4.26).Conclusions: VLNT is effective in reducing excess limb volume and cellulitis episodes in both UL and LL lymphoedema after cancer treatment. However, significant heterogeneity exists in outcome reporting, and standardisation of reporting processes is recommended. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integrating change magnitude maps of spectrally enhanced multi-features for land cover change detection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Constructing a change magnitude map (CMM) is a key component of binary change detection. Recently, integrating multiple features to obtain a comprehensive CMM has become a popular research topic. However, the current integration approaches mainly utilize simple spectral CMMs that are derived based on a single spectral change index (e.g. image difference, Euclidean distance, and change vector analysis), which is not sufficient for addressing complex land cover changes. In this study, we propose a spectrally enhanced multi-feature fusion (SeMF) method with CMM integration for effective change detection. Seven commonly used spectral change indices are analysed from the aspects of the spectral value and spectral shape; two of these indices are selected to construct the optimal spectral-based CMM, which is more efficient, robust and stable than the single spectral change indices. The rotation-invariant local binary patterns (RiLBP) and Canny methods are further used for CMM generation via the textural and shape features, respectively. These three types of CMMs are adaptively assigned weights by using an information entropy-based fusion strategy and ultimately integrated into a comprehensive CMM. Two groups of experiments with Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Gaofen (GF)-1 images are designed to verify the effectiveness of the SeMF method. The experimental results indicate that the SeMF method is superior to both spectral feature-based and multi-feature-based change detection methods.

TI  - Estimating the heavy metal concentrations in topsoil in the Daxigou mining area, China, using multispectral satellite imagery
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A precise estimation of the heavy metal concentrations in soils using multispectral remote sensing technology is challenging. Herein, Landsat8 imagery, a digital elevation model, and geochemical data derived from soil samples are integrated to improve the accuracy of estimating the Cu, Pb, and As concentrations in topsoil, using the Daxigou mining area in Shaanxi Province, China, as a case study. The relationships between the three heavy metals and soil environmental factors were investigated. The optimal combination of factors associated with the elevated concentrations of each heavy metal was determined combining correlation analysis with collinearity tests. A back propagation network optimised using a genetic algorithm was trained with 80% of the data for samples and subsequently employed to estimate the heavy metal concentrations in the area. The validation results show that the RMSE of the proposed model is lower than those of the existing linear model and rule-based M5 model tree. From the spatial distribution map of the three metals concentrations using the proposed method, there are findings that high concentrations of the heavy metals studied occur in the mining area, across the slag storage area, on the sides of the road used for transporting ore materials, and along the base of slopes in the area. These findings are consistent with the survey results in the field. The validation and findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Rain-induced characteristics in C- and X-band synthetic aperture radar observations of tropical cyclones
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work focused on the rain-induced characteristics of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) at the C- and X-bands. Six SAR images were collected in tropical cyclones: four C-band dual-polarized Sentinel-1 (S-1) images during the 2016 hurricane season and two vertical-vertical) polarized TerraSAR-X (TS-X) images of Hurricane Sandy (2012). Wind speeds were retrieved from the S-1 images at the vertical-horizontal polarization channel, and winds from the TS-X images were obtained from the Hurricane Research Division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . Simultaneously, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) rain rates, current data from the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model and wave spectra simulated by the WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) model were collocated. The three-scale backscattering model was employed to simulate the normalized radar cross-section (NRCS)without considering the rain effect, yielding a 2.21-dB root mean square errorand 2.23-dB for S-1 and TS-X, respectively. The difference between model-simulated and observed NRCS was analysed using the TRMM rain rate. The results indicate a linear relationship of the difference at the X-band with the TRMM rain rate, while the difference at the C-band exhibited a 'V' relationship with the TRMM rain rate. It was also discovered that the difference at the X-band decreased with increasing wind speed, while the difference at the C-band increased with increasing wind speed.

TI  - DSRC: An Improved Topographic Correction Method for Optical Remote-Sensing Observations Based on Surface Downwelling Shortwave Radiation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The complex terrain in mountainous areas distorts solar illumination, which brings a strong topographic effect on optical remote-sensing observations. Although many efforts have been done to correct this effect via normalizing solar illumination induced differences, there are still high uncertainty, especially for poor illuminated surfaces. In this study, a downwelling shortwave radiation (DSR)-based correction (DSRC) method was proposed. The topographic effects were accounted by normalizing DSR differences at different topographic conditions, and a stratified correction strategy was applied by separating the image into different groups according to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to consider the spectral differences of different land-cover types. The DSRC method was applied to nine Landsat 8 scenes with high-resolution DSR data acquired by downscaling the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) DSR product. The performance analysis indicates that the correlation coefficient between the corrected surface reflectance and illumination conditions notably decreased. Compared with SCS+ C, empirical rotation, Statistical-Empirical, and Modified Minnaert methods, the DSRC method well retains inherent spectral pattern and provides good advantages in normalizing the aspect differences of surface reflectance. Furthermore, the comparison of NDVI values before and after correction indicated that DSRC preserved the original values and successfully corrected the overestimated NDVI values of poor illuminated surfaces. The corrected NDVI time series provide more reasonable cycle of the phenology of vegetated surfaces than the original series. In summary, the DSRC method has a strong potential for reducing topographic effects that currently limit the applications of remotely sensed data in mountainous areas.

TI  - Combining WV-2 images and tree physiological factors to detect damage stages of <i>Populus gansuensis</i> by Asian longhorned beetle (<i>Anoplophora glabripennis</i>) at the tree level
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky), commonly known as Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), is a wood-boring insect that can cause lethal infestation to multiple borer leaf trees. In Gansu Province, northwest China, ALB has caused a large number of deaths of a local tree species Populus gansuensis. The damaged area belongs to Gobi desert where every single tree is artificially planted and is extremely difficult to cultivate. Therefore, the monitoring of the ALB infestation at the individual tree level in the landscape is necessary. Moreover, the determination of an abnormal phenotype that can be obtained directly from remote-sensing images to predict the damage degree can greatly reduce the cost of field investigation and management. Methods Multispectral WorldView-2 (WV-2) images and 5 tree physiological factors were collected as experimental materials. One-way ANOVA of the tree's physiological factors helped in determining the phenotype to predict damage degrees. The original bands of WV-2 and derived vegetation indices were used as reference data to construct the dataset of a prediction model. Variance inflation factor and stepwise regression analyses were used to eliminate collinearity and redundancy. Finally, three machine learning algorithms, i.e., Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification And Regression Tree (CART), were applied and compared to find the best classifier for predicting the damage stage of individual P. gansuensis. Results The confusion matrix of RF achieved the highest overall classification accuracy (86.2%) and the highest Kappa index value (0.804), indicating the potential of using WV-2 imaging to accurately detect damage stages of individual trees. In addition, the canopy color was found to be positively correlated with P. gansuensis' damage stages. Conclusions A novel method was developed by combining WV-2 and tree physiological index for semi-automatic classification of three damage stages of P. gansuensis infested with ALB. The canopy color was determined as an abnormal phenotype that could be directly assessed using remote-sensing images at the tree level to predict the damage degree. These tools are highly applicable for driving quick and effective measures to reduce damage to pure poplar forests in Gansu Province, China.

TI  - The Potential of ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 Radar Data for Soil Moisture Retrieval With High Spatial Resolution Over Agroforestry Areas, China
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors, such as Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) and Sentinel-1, provide significant opportunities for soil moisture content (SMC) retrieval with relatively high spatial resolutions (10 similar to 30 m). In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) SMC retrieval algorithm combined with the water cloud model, the advanced integral equation model, and the Oh model database was proposed. The SAR copolarization backscatter, the local incidence angle (ILIA), and the normalized difference vegetation index were used in input vectors for the ANN algorithm for the retrieval and mapping of the ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 SMC at a 30-m resolution. The results of the comparison between the SMC retrievals and the measured SMC show that Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 SMC retrievals with high accuracy correspond to low-vegetation areas (crop, grass, and shrub), with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.021 and 0.033 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. ALOS-2 SMC retrievals provide higher accuracy (RMSE = 0.076 cm(3)/cm(3)) than Sentinel-1 SMC retrievals at high vegetation (e.g., forest). However, it remains challenging for soil moisture retrieval in forest land. The C-hand and L-band SMC retrievals have higher RMSE (up to 0.047 cm(3)/cm(3)) at low incidence angle (<20 degrees) and high incidence angle (>50 degrees). In addition, by considering the impact of rainfall on the SMC, it appears that the Sentinel-I and AIRS-2 SMC have a good response to the rainfall events. Finally, the results of the comparison between the SMC retrievals and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L2 SMC product show that the correlation coefficients between Sentinel-1, ALOS-2, and SMAP are higher in September when the vegetation is drying than in July when the vegetation is growing.

TI  - Analysis of asymmetry in diurnal warming and its impact on vegetation phenology in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau using MODIS remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of its high altitude, the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) serves as a de facto ecological barrier between China and Southeast Asia. Studying the phenological characteristics of vegetation on QTP and their response to climate change can help us to understand how climate change can impact on highland terrestrial ecosystems and how to improve predicting highland vegetation phenology. Using long-term NDVI data we derived from the MODIS spectral reflectance product (MOD09A1) and in situ climate data in QTP, we investigated (1) the trends of temporal and spatial variations in the phenological characteristics of the highland vegetation, such as the start of growing season (SOS), middle time of growing season (MOS), end of growing season (EOS), and length of growing season (LEN), and (2) the responses of SOS, MOS, and EOS to asymmetry in diurnal warming, i.e., asymmetry in the preseason daily daytime maximum temperature (T-max) and daily nighttime minimum temperature (T-min). Results showed that (1) the vegetation phenology in QTP displayed a salient zonal distribution pattern. From the northwest to the southeast, the vegetation SOS and MOS gradually advanced, EOS decreased, and LEN extended; (2) T-min warmed up faster than T-max, which indicated that daytime warming and nighttime warming were asymmetrical; (3) the increase in preseason T-max and that in preseason T-min played different roles in SOS, MOS, and EOS; and (4) the preseason T-min showed a stronger control on vegetation phenology than the preseason T-max. For instance, a 1 degrees C increase in preseason T-min advanced SOS by 7.07d (p < 0.05) and MOS by 6.80d (p < 0.05), and delayed EOS by 6.70d (p < 0.05). While a 1 degrees C increase in preseason T-max delayed the SOS, MOS, and EOS by 5.12d, 4.84d, and 1.04d, respectively. (C) 2021 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Psychological Correlates of Populist Attitudes
T2  - POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of demand-side populism with a focus on attitudinal and behavioral factors are becoming more popular, but only a few have explored the phenomenon's psychological determinants. We tackle the lack of conversation between populism scholars and political psychologists and test the impact of conspiracy beliefs, moral disengagement, need for cognition, and belief in simple solutions on populist attitudes. We use the most widespread ideational definition in an attempt to bring clarity to demand-side populism, as the literature often conflates the concept of populism with adjacent ideological and psychological factors. We analyze representative samples from two very different countries (Italy and Turkey) to test our hypotheses. We use two of the most often-used measures of populist attitudes and also explore populism's individual building blocks: people-centrism, antielitism, and a Manichean worldview. We consistently find conspiracy beliefs (and our control variable of institutional trust) as primary sources of populist attitudes, whereas the impact of the other psychological factors is more dependent on context and operationalization. Our article calls for more conceptual clarity, careful theorization, and more work on the refinement of available survey measures. We also highlight the importance of national contexts and the dangers of generalization based on individual country studies.

TI  - Flood hazard susceptibility assessment in Chiffa wadi watershed and along the first section of Algeria North-South highway using GIS and AHP method
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood susceptibility mapping and assessment are essential to determine adequate protective measures to ensure an area or infrastructure's safety. This study aims to assess the susceptibility to flood hazards in the Chiffa wadi watershed and, alongside an important socio-economic project, the North-South highway's first section. The applied approach, a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, provided valuable results despite the lack of inventory of previous floods in the watershed. First, the triggering factors were selected based on field observations and climatic analysis. Then, the factors were mapped using a set of remote sensing data and other public institution data. Finally, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used to weight and combine the factors. The calculated flood hazard susceptibility index was used to map the extent of this phenomenon using GIS techniques. An innovative approach was also used by combining the resulting flood hazard map with the road chaining plan to identify the most susceptible segments to flood hazard by kilometric points. The results indicate that 49.08% of the total section is highly to very highly susceptible to flooding. The results obtained can help the authorities to develop protection strategies to ensure the safety of the infrastructures and their users. Finally, the integration of geospatial techniques and AHP based on field observations and climate analysis in flood hazard assessment is a cost-effective and rapid approach and can be used in other geohazard assessments affecting the same infrastructure.

TI  - Xunzi and the "Great Pattern"
T2  - INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION OF CHINESE CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Xunzi was chronologically third of the three great Confucian philosophers of the classical period, following Confucius and Mencius. I have elsewhere argued for a constructivist, as opposed to a realist, interpretation of Xunzi's philosophy. On the constructivist account, sages and exemplary persons are responsible for the contingent social artifice that characterize the way. Unlike realism, according to which there is just one right way, constructivism is compatible with pluralism. This article responds to the work of Aaron Stalnaker, specifically his critique of the constructivist account as it pertains to the concept li (sic) (pattern). Stalnaker appeals to Xunzi's use of the phrase "dali" (sic)(sic), which he translates "the Great Pattern." Stalnaker also emphasizes certain passages that he believes suggest a realist interpretation of Xunzi. I explain why this issue is fundamentally about whether or not Xunzi's view presupposes transcendence, and then I explain why neither the passages Stalnaker emphasizes nor Xunzi's use of the phrase dali strongly suggest a transcendent realism. Finally, I highlight other passages that tend to suggest a constructivist interpretation. While a decisive conclusion cannot be drawn, I argue that, on the whole, the constructivist account appears to provide the more consistent interpretation of Xunzi's worldview.

TI  - Estimation of degree of sea ice ridging in the Bay of Bothnia based on geolocated photon heights from ICESat-2
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a comparison of Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) geolocated photon heights and operational ice charts from the Finnish Ice Service in the Bay of Bothnia in spring 2019. We show that ICESat-2 (IS2) retrievals from ice areas with different ridging characteristics, more precisely the degree of ice ridging (DIR), differ significantly. DIR is a particularly useful parameter for ice navigators, as it provides information on how difficult it is to navigate through an area based on e.g. sail heights and distribution of sea ice ridges. DIR estimates are included in ice charts of the Baltic Sea and are based primarily on in situ observations from an active icebreaker fleet. We show that DIR may potentially be estimated from IS2. We also present a comparison of IS2 measurements and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar frames, discussing several individual cases of IS2 photon elevation behaviour over Baltic sea ice. We suggest that IS2 data can be of benefit to international ice services, especially if a time-critical photon height product were to be made available. Furthermore, we show that the difference between highest and mean photon elevations (elevation anomalies) of IS2 correspond to expected ridge sail heights in our study area. Our study is one of the first steps in creating sea ice applications beyond the traditional goal of freeboard and thickness retrieval for IS2.

TI  - Improving wetland cover classification using artificial neural networks with ensemble techniques
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland cover classification grows out of the need for management and protection for wetland sources to depict wetland landscapes. Exploring improved classification methods is important to derive good-quality wetland mapping products. This study investigates and applies two artificial neural network (ANN) based ensemble methods, namely, the MultiBoost artificial neural network (MBANN) and the rotation artificial neural network (RANN), for wetland cover classification, taking the Zoige wetland sited in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China as the case area. The RANN trains and combines diverse ANNs by constructing a series of sparse rotation matrices, whereas the MBANN is developed from the sequential iteration in combination with the parallel sampling technique. Sixteen features related to wetland covers were extracted based on the digital elevation model data and Landsat 8 OLI images. The deep visual geometry group (VGG11) and random forests (RF) were implemented for comparison with our methods. The classification capability evaluation shows that our ensemble methods significantly improve the single ANN and outperform the VGG11 and RF. The RANN yields the highest overall accuracy (0.961), followed by the MBANN (0.942), VGG11 (0.934), RF (0.931), and ANN (0.916). We further concern and evaluate the classifier's robustness because it reflects the uniformity of classification capability. The RANN and the MBANN are insensitive to the reduction in data size, resistant to feature variability, and not influenced by data noise. Overall, the use of ensemble techniques can refine single ANN in classification capability and stability. The results from this study attest the important role of ensemble learning, which provides a promising scheme for wetland cover classification.

TI  - Wavelet-ANFIS hybrid model for MODIS NDVI prediction
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization at the expense of the natural environment has been increasing in Turkey in recent years. The toll it takes on the ecosystem has an adverse impact on local weather systems and natural resources. These rapid ecosystem changes are mostly observed in the western parts of Turkey. For a reliable prediction of sustainable development planning, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be used as the main index for the description of both urbanization and land class. This study proposes the optimum adaptive neural-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) and hybrid Wavelet-ANFIS (WANFIS) models to estimate NDVI variation for certain seasonal (summer and winter) data in a grid area of 20 x 20 km(2) centered at the Kandilli region of Istanbul, Turkey (28 degrees 57' 53 '' E and 41 degrees 01' 07 '' N). The calculated NDVI values were obtained using the WANFIS model and compared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Observations. The results reveal that the mean absolute percentage error of NDVI values are calculated as 1.5% and 0.7% for the winter and summer test datasets, respectively. The coefficient of determination (R-2) values of the winter and summer test datasets are 0.977 and 0.991, respectively. Further, when compared with ANFIS, the results demonstrate that the WANFIS model exhibits a better approximation for the estimation of NDVI variation in the summer than in the winter.

TI  - Two shifts for crop mapping: Leveraging aggregate crop statistics to improve satellite-based maps in new regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type mapping at the field level is critical for a variety of applications in agricultural monitoring, and satellite imagery is becoming an increasingly abundant and useful raw input from which to create crop type maps. Still, in many regions crop type mapping with satellite data remains constrained by a scarcity of field-level crop labels for training supervised classification models. When training data is not available in one region, classifiers trained in similar regions can be transferred, but shifts in the distribution of crop types as well as transformations of the features between regions lead to reduced classification accuracy. We present a methodology that uses aggregate-level crop statistics to correct the classifier by accounting for these two types of shifts. To adjust for shifts in the crop type composition we present a scheme for properly reweighting the posterior probabilities of each class that are output by the classifier. To adjust for shifts in features we propose a method to estimate and remove linear shifts in the mean feature vector. We demonstrate that this methodology leads to substantial improvements in overall classification accuracy when using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to map crop types in Occitanie, France and in Western Province, Kenya. When using LDA as our base classifier, we found that in France our methodology led to percent reductions in misclassifications ranging from 2.8% to 42.2% (mean = 21.9%) over eleven different training departments, and in Kenya the percent reductions in misclassification were 6.6%, 28.4%, and 42.7% for three training regions. While our methodology was statistically motivated by the LDA classifier, it can be applied to any type of classifier. As an example, we demonstrate its successful application to improve a Random Forest classifier.

TI  - Effect of vegetation structure on above ground biomass in tropical deciduous forests of Central India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aimed to determine the above-ground biomass (AGB) of tropical deciduous forests in Central India using field-based techniques and spaceborne quad-pol ALOS PALSAR-2 L-band and dual-pol Sentinel 1A C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Field sampling based on 73 forested grids exhibited a diverse forest composition in the Satpura Tiger Reserve (STR) with a total of 54 tree species of which 31.48% species were IUCN Red-Listed. The forests were highly diverse (H '=3.22) with a low concentration of dominance (CD = 0.06) and a quite high species evenness (E = 0.81). The sensitivity and correlation between field-based AGB and SAR backscatter in STR were highest in cross-polarization due to its higher sensitivity to the vegetation structure in both L- and C-band SAR, where L-VH based AGB estimates were found more accurate (RMSE:5.17%). The study provided vital information for setting up strategies for biodiversity conservation, enhancing forest productivity, and restoring wildlife habitats.

TI  - Assessing the tropical forest cover change in northern parts of Sonitpur and Udalguri District of Assam, India
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sonitpur and Udalguri district of Assam possess rich tropical forests with equally important faunal species. The Nameri National Park, Sonai-Rupai Wildlife Sanctuary, and other Reserved Forests are areas of attraction for tourists and wildlife lovers. However, these protected areas are reportedly facing the problem of encroachment and large-scale deforestation. Therefore, this study attempts to estimate the forest cover change in the area through integrating the remotely sensed data of 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 with the Geographic Information System. The Maximum Likelihood algorithm-based supervised classification shows acceptable agreement between the classified image and the ground truth data with an overall accuracy of about 96% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.95. The results reveal a forest cover loss of 7.47% from 1990 to 2000 and 7.11% from 2000 to 2010. However, there was a slight gain of 2.34% in forest cover from 2010 to 2020. The net change of forest to non-forest was 195.17 km(2) in the last forty years. The forest transition map shows a declining trend of forest remained forest till 2010 and a slight increase after that. There was a considerable decline in the forest to non-forest (11.94% to 3.50%) from 2000-2010 to 2010-2020. Further, a perceptible gain was also observed in the non-forest to the forest during the last four decades. The overlay analysis of forest cover maps show an area of 460.76 km(2) (28.89%) as forest (unchanged), 764.21 km(2) (47.91%) as non-forest (unchanged), 282.67 km(2) (17.72%) as deforestation and 87.50 km(2) (5.48%) as afforestation. The study found hotspots of deforestation in the closest areas of National Park, Wildlife Sanctuary, and Reserved Forests due to encroachments for human habitation, agriculture, and timber/fuelwood extractions. Therefore, the study suggests an early declaration of these protected areas as Eco-Sensitive Zone to control the increasing trends of deforestation.

TI  - Can intraoperative ultrasound replace the frozen section in the assessment of ex vivo sentinel lymph node biopsy in early breast cancer in countries with limited resources?
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY AND NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Accurate staging and proper management of axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) in breast cancer patients are important for treatment. Surgical management of the axilla has evolved greatly in the last 20 years. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), which was first investigated in the early 1990s, has replaced routine axillary lymph node dissection. This study evaluates the capability of using an ultrasound (US) as an alternative tool for the frozen section in the assessment of the ex vivo sentinel lymph node biopsy in countries with limited resources.Results: The study is a prospective study that included 216 female patients with early breast cancer and negative axillary lymph nodes. All excised lymph nodes were examined by the intraoperative US and frozen section examinations. All the results were correlated with the final histopathological results. The number of negative nodes by US, frozen, and paraffin section examination was 58.30%, 69.40%, and 69.40%, respectively. The number of positive nodes by the US, frozen, and paraffin section examinations was 41.70%, 30.60%, and 30.60% respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of US in the detection of positive lymph nodes were 95.45%, 82%, 70%, 97.62%, and 86.11%, respectively, and the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of frozen examination in the detection of positive lymph nodes were 90.91%, 96%, 90.91%, 96%, and 94.44%, respectively.Conclusion: Intraoperative US is a good negative test in the assessment of ex vivo SLNB, but it is not a good positive test, so it cannot replace the intraoperative frozen section in the assessment of SLNs.

TI  - MICRU: an effective cloud fraction algorithm designed for UV-vis satellite instruments with large viewing angles
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds impact the radiative transfer of the Earth's atmosphere and strongly influence satellite measurements in the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and infrared (IR) spectral ranges. For satellite measurements of trace gases absorbing in the UV-vis spectral range, particularly clouds ultimately determine the vertical sensitivity profile, mainly by reducing the sensitivity for trace-gas columns below the cloud.The Mainz iterative cloud retrieval utilities (MICRU) algorithm is specifically designed to reduce the error budget of trace-gas retrievals, such as those for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which strongly depends on the accuracy of small cloud fractions (CFs) in particular. The accuracy of MICRU is governed by an empirical parameterisation of the viewing-geometry-dependent background surface reflectivity taking instrumental and physical effects into account. Instrumental effects are mainly degradation and polarisation effects; physical effects are due to the anisotropy of the surface reflectivity, e.g. shadowing of plants and sun glitter.MICRU is applied to main science channel (MSC) and polarisation measurement device (PMD) data collected between April 2007 and June 2013 by the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2A (GOME-2A) instrument aboard the MetOp-A satellite. CFs are retrieved at different spectral bands between 374 and 758 nm. The MICRU results for MSC and PMD at different wavelengths are intercompared to study CF precision and accuracy, which depend on wave-length and spatial correlation. Furthermore, MICRU results are compared to FRESCO (fast retrieval scheme for clouds from the oxygen A band) and OCRA (optical cloud recognition algorithm) operational cloud products.We show that MICRU retrieves small CFs with an accuracy of 0.04 or better for the entire 1920 km wide swath with a potential bias between -0.01 and -0.03. CFs retrieved at shorter wavelengths are less affected by adverse surface heterogeneities. The comparison to the operational CF algorithms shows that MICRU significantly reduces the dependence on viewing angle, time, and sun glitter. Systematic effects along coasts are particularly small for MICRU due to its dedicated treatment of land and ocean surfaces.The MICRU algorithm is designed for spectroscopic instruments ranging from the GOME to Sentinel-5P/Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) but is also applicable to UV-vis imagers like the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Sentinel-2.

TI  - Monitoring shoreline shift under rapid sea-level change on the Caspian Sea observed over 60 years of satellite and aerial photo records
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Caspian Sea is the world's largest inland water body and endures rapid fluctuations in sea level and shoreline changes. The present study investigates and analyzes shoreline changes in the two areas of Tajan and Sefidrud on the southern coasts of the Caspian Sea using aerial photos, affixed with TM, ETM, and OLI images from Landsat satellites, as well as images rendered by Google Earth, all within the time period from 1955 to 2018. Shoreline changes were analyzed using the waterline algorithm on high resolution aerial photos and images from the Google Earth engine. Shoreline extraction on Landsat images was conducted after comparing six different indices, of which the wetness index exhibited the least mean error (1.3 m). Calculations on shoreline changes were undertaken in 4 time periods using the DSAS extension in Arc GIS 10.3 including 1955-1977, 1977-1995, 1995-2002 and 2002-2018. Coastal accretion on the Tajan shoreline after decreases in sea level were evident in the first, third, and fourth time periods, while coastal erosion was discernible in the second time period during significant increases in sea level. The situation, however, was different for the coasts of Sefidrud. The shoreline was divided into 14 distinct parts where the shoreline change rate was inconsistent with the actual changes in sea level. The dismatch between sea level and shoreline changes in the Sefidrud region points to the existence of a different set of factors, in addition to the sea level, which significantly affect the status of the coastlines.

TI  - Time series analysis of multispectral satellite images using game theory classifier
T2  - OPTIK
M3  - Article
AB  - Change information of the earth's surface obtained from time series analysis of remote sensing images becoming more important in monitoring the local and global resources. In this paper, time series analysis of multispectral images by the combinations of hybrid graph cut segmentation (HGCS) and game theory (GT) classifier is proposed. Segmentation in satellite images can be posed as a problem of pixel intensity clustering. The traditional segmentation algorithms suffer from random initialization which may yields local optimum results. To overcome this, HGCS is used for segmentation which provides more stability and improved performance. The performance of traditional classifier depends on size of data set, number of observations and features. The size of the feature space strongly increases when multitemporal images are analyzed, which makes the classifier fail to find the correct solution. To find the optimum solution, game theory classifier is proposed. The proposed method explores and exploits the advantages of both hybrid graph cut segmentation and game theory classifier. The superiority of the approach has been demonstrated over a multitemporal LANDSAT images both visually and numerically with statistical support. The results have been compared with several traditional algorithms, viz. misclassification rate, CPSNR, CMSE and validity index.

TI  - A New Algorithm for Land-Cover Classification Using PolSAR and InSAR Data and Its Application to Surface Roughness Mapping Along the Gulf Coast
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During a flooding event, the ability of the terrain to dissipate water flow energy depends on its land-cover type and the associated surface roughness. In this study, we developed a new land-cover classification algorithm using repeat-pass polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. Through a two-level hierarchical approach, we classified nine land-cover types with distinct surface roughness coefficients (Manning's n). We demonstrated the performance of this algorithm using available L-band ALOS PALSAR scenes acquired between April 2007 and April 2011 over the Houston area. The radar-based surface roughness estimates show a good agreement with those independently derived from NOAA's 22-class Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) 2010 land-cover classification data. Our algorithm is robust, and the randomly selected training sets only account for 0.3% of the total multilooked radar pixels (30-m spacing). Furthermore, we were able to accurately map surface roughness over the New Orleans area using available ALOS PALSAR scenes without selecting any new training sets. We note that NOAA's C-CAP data are currently used for estimating surface roughness in the operational storm-surge models, and a new version is typically released every five to six years. With the launch of the L-band NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission in the near future, our algorithm can be used to fill the temporal gaps of the existing C-CAP-based surface roughness database and improve the accuracy of near real-time hydrodynamic modeling.

TI  - An extended superficial circumflex iliac artery perforator flap transfer for a relatively-small breast reconstruction after total mastectomy
T2  - MICROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Superficial circumflex iliac artery (SCIA) perforator (SCIP) flap has been applied in various reconstructions. Unlike traditional groin flap, SCIP flap has a longer pedicle and can be used as a chimeric flap for complex reconstruction. By utilizing both the superficial and the deep branches of the SCIA, a SCIP flap can be raised as an extended large bulky flap. Although there are many articles reporting usefulness of SCIP flap, there is no case reporting a large SCIP flap transfer for breast reconstruction after total mastectomy. We applied a free extended SCIP flap for a case of post-total-mastectomy breast reconstruction. A 51-year-old female who had undergone total mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy was referred for autologous tissue breast reconstruction. Physical exam revealed that the iliac and lower abdominal regions were suitable for a donor site. As the patient desired to preserve a similar donor site for possible future contralateral breast reconstruction, the iliac region was selected as a donor site. A 23 x 15 cm SCIP flap was elevated based on the superficial and the deep branches of the SCIA, and was transferred to the recipient site. The SCIA and concomitant vein were anastomosed to the lateral thoracic artery and vein in an end-to-end fashion. Postoperative course was uneventful. The reconstructed breast shape and texture were similar to the contralateral breast with no donor site complication, and the patient was very satisfied with functionally and esthetically pleasing results. Extended SCIP flap may be an option for relatively-small breast reconstruction.

TI  - Effects of air quality and vegetation on algal bloom early warning systems in large lakes in the middle-lower Yangtze River basin
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of algal bloom early warning systems have rarely paid attention to the dynamics of excessive proliferation of phytoplankton (EPP), which occurs prior to algal blooms, or to the sensitivity of a lake to EPP based on multiple environmental factors. In this study, we investigated EPP dynamics in large lakes and identified major factors that influenced the lake's vulnerability to EPP, to improve algal bloom early warning systems. High temporal moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and multi-source daily site monitoring data of large lakes in the middle-lower Yangtze River basin were analyzed. Then, the floating algal index (FAI) and resource use efficiency (RUE) by phytoplankton were used to investigate the EPP dynamics and lake's vulnerability to EPP, respectively. Moreover, generalized linear models were used to assess the relative importance of environmental factors on RUE. The results indicate that the lakes freely connected (FC) to the Yangtze River (Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake) had lower FAIs but higher RUEs than the non-connected lakes (NC; Chaohu Lake and Taihu Lake). The key factors affecting RUE-FC were standard deviation of water level within 30 days(WL30), particulate matter <10 mu m(PM10), and relative humidity(Hum), which explained 15.91% of the variations in RUE. The key factors affecting RUE-NC were ozone(O3), basin normalized difference vegetation index standard deviation(BNDVISD), and dissolved oxygen(DO), which explained 35.28% of the variations in RUE. These results emphasize the importance of air quality in influencing or reflecting EPP risks in large lakes. In addition, basin vegetation and hydrological rhythms can influence NH4+ through non-point source loading. Algal bloom early warning systems can be improved by routine monitoring and forecasting of potential environmental factors such as air quality and basin vegetation.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Change Analysis and Future Scenario of LULC Using the CA-ANN Approach: A Case Study of the Greater Bay Area, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) transition analysis is a systematic approach that helps in understanding physical and human involvement in the natural environment and sustainable development. The study of the spatiotemporal shifting pattern of LULC, the simulation of future scenarios and the intensity analysis at the interval, category and transition levels provide a comprehensive prospect to determine current and future development scenarios. In this study, we used multitemporal remote sensing data from 1980-2020 with a 10-year interval, explanatory variables (Digital Elevation Model (DEM), slope, population, GDP, distance from roads, distance from the city center and distance from streams) and an integrated CA-ANN approach within the MOLUSCE plugin of QGIS to model the spatiotemporal change transition potential and future LULC simulation in the Greater Bay Area. The results indicate that physical and socioeconomic driving factors have significant impacts on the landscape patterns. Over the last four decades, the study area experienced rapid urban expansion (4.75% to 14.75%), resulting in the loss of forest (53.49% to 50.57%), cropland (21.85% to 16.04%) and grassland (13.89% to 12.05%). The projected results (2030-2050) also endorse the increasing trend in built-up area, forest, and water at the cost of substantial amounts of cropland and grassland.

TI  - The potential of sentinel-1 InSAR coherence for grasslands monitoring in Eastern Cape, South Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the potential of the repeat-pass synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) coherence for grasslands monitoring in Eastern Cape Province, in South Africa. We used 12 pairs of InSAR data in the Interferometric Wide swath mode (IW), in VV-polarization (with different spatial baseline B? and different temporal repeat intervals between the subsequent acquisitions), covering grasslands in the study area during two growing seasons; drought season (2015/2016) and non-drought season (2016/2017). Results show that non drought season has higher variability in the coherence between the different regions of interest (ROIs) than the drought season and higher variability in the backscattering coefficient. Based on our results, we conclude that InSAR-based data have shown potential for grasslands monitoring, and the regularity of Sentinel-1 data is well suited for InSAR applications. However, the potential to separate grasslands from other vegetation categories appears to be limited with longer temporal baselines of 12 days intervals using only Sentinel-1A data. This potential will be improved with the 6 days intervals that will become available with Sentinel-1B in the study area.

TI  - Change detection of Gaza coastal zone using GIS and remote sensing techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaza' coastal zone suffers from permanent erosion as a result of the anthropogenic intervention. This study aims to assess and map land-use / land cover and shoreline changes in Gaza coastal zone using remote sensing and GIS tools as a step towards implementing coastal zone management. In addition, bathymetric map will be extracted using Landsat-8 image. Firstly, land-use / land cover change detection was carried out using SPOT-5, Landsat and Quick Bird for the years 2004, 2009 and 2016. Six classes were assigned to the study area using maximum supervised classification to investigate the evolution during past period. Secondly, change detection along the shoreline was implemented over the past 42 years from 1972 to 2014. Finally, the ratio transform technique was applied to the newly acquired multi-spectral image to extract the nearshore bathymetric map of the coastal area. Results of change detection revealed that coastal area was significantly changed: urban/built-up and agricultural area expanded, whereas area of bare land / sand shrank by 14,52 km(2). In addition, shoreline analysis showed that, northern regions were substantially eroded by 186,15,103 m(2) in the period 1998-2007. Moreover, an accretion occurred at the southern beach of Gaza's fishing port with a rate of 9,53,103 m(2)/year during the period 2007-2014. Ultimately, it is concluded that ratio transform algorithm used to extract bathymetry could retrieve depths from -25 m to -30 m. In addition, the result shows a good correlation between the estimated algorithm depths and the observed depths.

TI  - Assessment of Thermal-induced Forest Stress: A case of Akure Forest Reserve, Ondo State, Nigeria
T2  - Journal of Applied Sciences & Environmental Management
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest stress or health has become a topic of serious interest to researchers in recent times. It reached a crescendo consequent upon the renewed interest in climate change's effects, resilience and mitigation. Forest stress is majorly a climate-related occurrence that can only be managed but not totally eradicated. Therefore, this study is aimed at assessing thermal induced stress in Akure forest reserve in Ondo State, Nigeria, using the instrumentality of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS). The temperature data used for this study was extracted from Landsat 8 (OLI) imagery obtained from United States Geological Survey (USGS) database between the years 2016 and 2020. A land use land cover change detection analysis of the study area revealed that between 2016 and 2020, forest and water body decreased from 4344.59 to 2971.71 ha and 187.28 to 178.23 ha respectively while shrubs and bare land increased from 1472.13 to 2533.05 ha and 578.16 to 899.34 ha respectively. Forest stress and health of the study area was assessed using vegetation indices and land surface temperature LST). The result reveals changes in mean LST across the four lands cover types during the study period. It ranges between 22.28 degrees C (water body) in 2016 to 28.99 oC (bare land) in 2018. The spatial trend of Vegetation Health Index (VHI) was used to delineate the health of the forest. The study reveals that the spectral changes in the biophysical characteristics of the forest could not be solely attributed to temperature variability. Other climatic parameters and soil related variables must have contributed to notice stress in the forest reserve. However, this study has brought to the fore the robustness of geospatial technologies on the study of forest stress, health and drought.

TI  - Cropping Pattern Mapping in an Agro-Natural Heterogeneous Landscape Using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 Satellite Datasets
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantity of land covered by various crops in a specific time span, referred to as a cropping pattern, dictates the level of agricultural production. However, retrieval of this information at a landscape scale can be challenging, especially when high spatial resolution imagery is not available. This study hypothesized that utilizing the unique advantages of multi-date and medium spatial resolution freely available Sentinel-2 (S2) reflectance bands (S2 bands), their vegetation indices (VIs) and vegetation phenology (VP) derivatives, and Sentinel-1 (S1) backscatter data would improve cropping pattern mapping in heterogeneous landscapes using robust machine learning algorithms, i.e., the guided regularized random forest (GRRF) for variable selection and the random forest (RF) for classification. This study's objective was to map cropping patterns within three sub-counties in Murang'a County, a typical African smallholder heterogeneous farming area, in Kenya. Specifically, the performance of eight classification scenarios for mapping cropping patterns was compared, namely: (i) only S2 bands; (ii) S2 bands and VIs; (iii) S2 bands and VP; (iv) S2 bands and S1; (v) S2 bands, VIs, and S1; (vi) S2 bands, VP, and S1; (vii) S2 bands, VIs, and VP; and (viii) S2 bands, VIs, VP, and S1. Reference data of the dominant cropping patterns and non-croplands were collected. The GRRF algorithm was used to select the optimum variables in each scenario, and the RF was used to perform the classification for each scenario. The highest overall accuracy was 94.33% with Kappa of 0.93, attained using the GRRF-selected variables of scenario (v) S2, VIs, and S1. Furthermore, McNemar's test of significance did not show significant differences (p <= 0.05) among the tested scenarios. This study demonstrated the strength of GRRF in selecting the most important variables and the synergetic advantage of S2 and S1 derivatives to accurately map cropping patterns in small-scale farming-dominated landscapes. Consequently, the cropping pattern mapping approach can be used in other sites of relatively similar agro-ecological conditions. Additionally, these results can be used to understand the sustainability of food systems and to model the abundance and spread of crop insect pests, diseases, and pollinators.

TI  - UNESCO World Heritage properties in changing and dynamic environments: change detection methods using optical and radar satellite data
T2  - HERITAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents recent capabilities of active and passive earth observation sensors along with related processing image chains, for monitoring UNESCO World Heritage properties. Exceptional heritage sites and landscapes are found in dynamic environments, whereas both anthropogenic and natural changes are observed. The use of radar and optical satellite imageries can be used as a systematic observation tool for stakeholders, to map drastic or slowly driven landscape changes towards the better protection and management of these sites and their surrounding areas. The study presents the results from the analysis of the European Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite images over two broader areas in the Eastern Mediterranean basin that hold important UNESCO World Heritage properties. Initially, a recent strong earthquake of a 6.7 magnitude scale in the Aegean Sea is studied using radar Sentinel-1 images. These radar images were processed through the Hybrid Pluggable Processing Pipeline (HyP3) cloud platform for analyzing both significant changes of the VV (vertical transmit, vertical receive) and VH (vertical transmit, horizontal receive) backscattering signal as well as through an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) analysis. Then, long-term changes in Cyprus during the last two decades are monitored by a Sentinel-2 image compared to the European Corine Land Use Land Cover data of 2000. These changes are mapped after a supervised classification process using the random forest (RF) classifier. The overall results demonstrate that the recent developments of the space sector in all its segments (resolution of the sensors, the capacity to storage in the cloud, processing advancements and open-access datasets and tools) can be beneficial for monitoring UNESCO World Heritage properties.

TI  - Evaluation of Object-Based Greenhouse Mapping Using WorldView-3 VNIR and SWIR Data: A Case Study from Almeria (Spain)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic covered greenhouse (PCG) mapping via remote sensing has received a great deal of attention over the past decades. The WorldView-3 (WV3) satellite is a very high resolution (VHR) sensor with eight multispectral bands in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) spectral range, and eight additional bands in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region. A few studies have already established the importance of indices based on some of these SWIR bands to detect urban plastic materials and hydrocarbons which are also related to plastics. This paper aims to investigate the capability of WV3 (VNIR and SWIR) for direct PCG detection following an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach. Three strategies were carried out: (i) using object features only derived from VNIR bands (VNIR); (ii) object features only derived from SWIR bands (SWIR), and (iii) object features derived from both VNIR and SWIR bands (All Features). The results showed that the majority of predictive power was attributed to SWIR indices, especially to the Normalized Difference Plastic Index (NDPI). Overall, accuracy values of 90.85%, 96.79% and 97.38% were attained for VNIR, SWIR and All Features strategies, respectively. The main PCG misclassification problem was related to the agricultural practice of greenhouse whitewash (greenhouse shading) that temporally masked the spectral signature of the plastic film.

TI  - On the Next-Generation High Throughput Satellite Systems With Optical Feeder Links
T2  - IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Next-generation multibeam high throughput satellite (HTS) systems aim at achieving Terabits/s throughputs with thousands of spot beams. Conventional radio frequency (RF) Ku-/Ka- band feeder links, between gateways and satellites, are unable to achieve such throughputs due to limited spectrum availability in these bands. Free space optical (FSO) feeder links present a promising alternative to RF feeder links and have gained increased attention lately in the satellite community. This article presents performance analysis of multibeam HTS systems where the feeder link operates in the FSO band and the user link, between the satellite and the user terminal, is in the RF Ka-band. We consider that the FSO feeder link is impaired by the scintillation fading due to atmospheric turbulence and the RF Ka-band user link is attenuated by the rain fading. In multibeam HTS systems, frequency reuse in the user link creates interbeam interference (IBI) due to overlapping side lobes of the multibeam antenna radiation pattern. Considering a forward link with a fixed gain transparent satellite payload, we use the zero-forcing precoding technique to mitigate IBI in the user link. We derive exact and approximate statistics of the end-to-end signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. Also, by capitalizing on these results, we analyze information-theoretic metrics including the outage probability and ergodic capacity. Our results provide various important insights, e.g., 1) outage performance and ergodic capacity is typically restricted by rain fading in the RF link, and 2) outage diversity of rain fading in the RF link is 0, hence outage performance only increases marginally with power at high signal-to-noise ratio.

TI  - Bacterial RTX toxins and host immunity
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review RTX toxin action often defines the outcome of bacterial infections. Here, we discuss the progress in understanding the impacts of RTX toxin activities on host immunity. Recent findings Bordetella pertussis CyaA activity paralyzes sentinel phagocytic cells by elevating cellular cAMP levels and blocks differentiation of infiltrating monocytes into bactericidal macrophages, promoting also de-differentiation of resident alveolar macrophages into monocyte-like cells. Vibrio cholerae multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxins (MARTX), through Rho inactivating and alpha/beta-hydrolase (ABH) domain action blocks mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in epithelial cells and dampens the inflammatory responses of intestinal epithelia by blocking immune cell recruitment. The action of actin crosslinking effector domain and Ras/Rap1-specific endopeptidase (RRSP) domains of MARTX compromises the phagocytic ability of macrophages. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans LtxA action triggers neutrophil elastase release into periodontal tissue, compromising the epithelial barrier and promoting bacterial spreads into deeper tissue. Action of RTX toxins enables bacterial pathogens to cope with the fierce host immune defenses. RTX toxins often block phagocytosis and bactericidal reactive oxygen species and NO production. Some RTX toxins can reprogram the macrophages to less bactericidal cell types. Autophagy is hijacked for example by the activity of the V. cholerae ABH effector domain of the MARTX protein. Subversion of immune functions by RTX toxins thus promotes bacterial survival and proliferation in the host.

TI  - I Am Niqabi: From Existential Unease to Cyber-Fundamentalism
T2  - SOCIETIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, niqabi women are more and more visible, even in traditionally non-Muslim societies. However, there is a deep ignorance with regard to their worldview in general and about them in particular. The aim of this paper, which is based on a research carried out using the Grounded Theory, is to give answer to three fundamental questions: did niqabi women belonging to the Telegram channel Orgullo niqabi choose to become niqabis after experiencing some kind of crisis or existential unease? Has the grouping of these women in said channel contributed to the polarization of their posture on the niqab in some way? Additionally, if that is the case, has said polarization fueled or given rise to some ideology in particular? One of our conclusions, after conducting 27 in-depth interviews, is that most of these women opted for being niqabi and Muslim in response to the existential unease they experienced, which somehow kept them searching for some meaning in their lives. Another interesting aspect we have observed is that these women have reinforced their posture on the niqab, polarizing their perception in a fundamentalist way. Additionally, our third conclusion is that these women are cyber-fundamentalists, given that, besides the reactionary nature of their ideology, they construct it in a modern way.

TI  - Characterizing Near-Field Surface Deformation in the 1990 Rudbar Earthquake (Iran) Using Optical Image Correlation
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 1990 Rudbar earthquake (Mw 7.3) broke along three right-stepping segments of the left-lateral Rudbar fault, in the western Alborz mountains (Iran), producing similar to 80 km of surface rupture. Previously reported horizontal (similar to 60 cm) field offsets were surprisingly low, and the vertical (similar to 95 cm) unexpected, given the relatively large moment release, shallow source depth, vertical fault geometry, and left-lateral rake. We characterize the surface displacement from optical image correlation of satellite and aerial images. A maximum displacement of similar to 6.5 m is observed in the eastern part of the rupture consistent with both a sharp pulse in the moment release rate similar to 10 s after the rupture initiation, and the macroseismic isoseismal curves. We find similar to 2.2 m mean surface slip, larger than field measurements, but consistent with empirical scaling laws based upon the seismological moment release. Estimates of fault zone width based on correlation of 1 m resolution aerial photos (and corrected for smoothing bias) are <200 m; these values increase artificially with lower resolution imagery, which is more affected by smoothing bias. The large mismatch between field and correlation displacements suggests the Rudbar earthquake probably featured significant off-fault deformation, consistent with its low structural maturity. Finally, we document a surface rupture along a structural continuation of the Kabateh segment, east of the Sefid Rud river. Slip along this segment (1-2 m), is less than the neighboring Zard Geli segment (1.5-6 m). The two faults converge at Sefid Rud, which appears to represent a major structural feature controlling fault segmentation in this region.

TI  - Sensor Integrated Load-Bearing Structures: Measuring Axis Extension with DIC-Based Transducers
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we present a novel, cost-effective camera-based multi-axis force/torque sensor concept for integration into metallic load-bearing structures. A two-part pattern consisting of a directly incident and mirrored light beam is projected onto the imaging sensor surface. This allows the capturing of 3D displacements, occurring due to structure deformation under load in a single image. The displacement of defined features in size and position can be accurately analyzed and determined through digital image correlation (DIC). Validation on a prototype shows good accuracy of the measurement and a unique identification of all in- and out-of-plane displacement components under multiaxial load. Measurements show a maximum deviation related to the maximum measured values between 2.5% and 4.8% for uniaxial loads (F-x, F-y,F-z,M-z) and between 2.5% and 10.43% for combined bending, torsion and axial load. In the course of the investigations, the measurement inaccuracy was partly attributed to the joint used between the sensor parts and the structure as well as to eccentric load.

Moreover, policymakers are interested in understanding the factors that have a significant impact on land use change. This paper analyses the dynamics of land use change in Lebanon between the years 1984 and 2019 and identifies the main factors behind this process. The use of LandSat satellite images enables the creation of land use maps at several periods and the monitoring of the evolution of built up areas as well as of green areas. Five periods emerge from this analysis, for which it is possible to propose explanatory factors, after an in-depth qualitative analysis. Within the framework of Structural Equation Models, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis is carried out to determine the impacts of several factors related to governance and financial data. Moreover, the urban sprawl is further investigated and explained by cultural, environmental, and infrastructural factors. The main results reveal that the development of built up areas is highly dependent on good funding conditions, whereas banking conditions and weak governance are correlated. The case of Lebanon presents specificities probably linked to historical and cultural considerations that deserve to be studied in future works. In the form of recommendations, new land use policies should be enacted to ensure sustainability in the form of an equilibrium between the urban development, from one side, and the preservation of natural resources and good environmental conditions on the other side. This could comprise the preservation of natural zones; the subsidization of the cultivation profession; and the encouragement of urban densification instead of horizontal sprawl.

TI  - Constraining Ice Water Content of Thin Antarctic Cirrus Clouds Using Ground-Based Lidar and Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We combine observations of optically thin cirrus clouds made by lidar at Davis, Antarctica (69 degrees S, 78 degrees E), during 14-15 June 2011 with a microphysical retrieval algorithm to constrain the ice water content (IWC) of these clouds. The cirrus clouds were embedded in a tropopause jet that flowed around a ridge of high pressure extending southward over Davis from the Southern Ocean. Cloud optical depths were 0.082 +/- 0.001, and subvisual cirrus were present during 11% of the observation period. The macrophysical cirrus cloud properties obtained during this case study are consistent with those previously reported at lower latitudes. MODIS satellite imagery and AIRS surface temperature data are used as inputs into a radiative transfer model in order to constrain the IWC and ice water path of the cirrus. The derived cloud IWC is consistent with in situ observations made at other locations but at similarly cold temperatures. The optical depths derived from the model agree with those calculated directly from the lidar data. This study demonstrates the value of a combination of ground-based lidar observations and a radiative transfer model in constraining microphysical cloud parameters that could be utilized at locations where other lidar measurements are made.

TI  - Sensitivity of C-Band SAR Polarimetric Variables to the Directionality of Surface Roughness Parameters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface roughness is an important factor in many soil moisture retrieval models. Therefore, any mischaracterization of surface roughness parameters (root mean square height, RMSH, and correlation length, l) may result in unreliable predictions and soil moisture estimations. In many environments, but particularly in agricultural settings, surface roughness parameters may show different behaviours with respect to the orientation or azimuth. Consequently, the relationship between SAR polarimetric variables and surface roughness parameters may vary depending on measurement orientation. Generally, roughness obtained for many SAR-based studies is estimated using pin profilers that may, or may not, be collected with careful attention to orientation to the satellite look angle. In this study, we characterized surface roughness parameters in multi-azimuth mode using a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). We characterized the surface roughness parameters in different orientations and then examined the sensitivity between polarimetric variables and surface roughness parameters; further, we compared these results to roughness profiles obtained using traditional pin profilers. The results showed that the polarimetric variables were more sensitive to the surface roughness parameters at higher incidence angles (theta). Moreover, when surface roughness measurements were conducted at the look angle of RADARSAT-2, more significant correlations were observed between polarimetric variables and surface roughness parameters. Our results also indicated that TLS can represent more reliable results than pin profiler in the measurement of the surface roughness parameters.

TI  - Forest Land Cover Mapping at a Regional Scale Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Imagery and RF Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last several decades, thanks to improvements in and the diversification of open-access satellite imagery, land cover mapping techniques have evolved significantly. Notable changes in these techniques involve the automation of different steps, yielding promising results in terms of accuracy, class detection and efficiency. The most successful methodologies that have arisen rely on the use of multi-temporal data. Several different approaches have proven successful. In this study, one of the most recently developed methodologies is tested in the region of Galicia (in Northwestern Spain), with the aim of filling gaps in the mapping needs of the Galician forestry sector. The methodology mainly consists of performing a supervised classification of individual images from a selected time series and then combining them through aggregation using decision criteria. Several of the steps of the methodology can be addressed in multiple ways: pixel resolution selection, classification model building and aggregation methods. The effectiveness of these three tasks as well as some others are tested and evaluated and the most accurate and efficient parameters for the case study area are highlighted. The final land cover map that is obtained for Galicia has high accuracy metrics (an overall accuracy of 91.6%), which is in line with previous studies that have followed this methodology in other regions. This study has led to the development of an efficient open-access solution to support the mapping needs of the forestry sector.

TI  - Quantifying river ice movement through a combination of European satellite monitoring services
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Every spring the mechanical river ice break-up and associated ice-runs or flooding pose a threat to communities at Northern latitudes. Monitoring and mitigation efforts along remote Arctic rivers are possible but logistically complex. In recent years, Earth observation programs have emerged based on spaceborne sensors that record large parts of the Earth's surface at a regular interval and with fast downlink. Most optical satellites have a similar sun-synchronous orbit, and have thus an akin ground track. When different sun-synchronous missions are combined this results in near-simultaneous acquisitions, which make it possible to monitor fast displacements that occur at or near the Earth's surface over large scales. Hence, it becomes possible to generate a new monitoring system; one of observing river ice movement. In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of a multi-satellite monitoring system by combining data from freely available medium- and coarse-resolution satellites, in this study that is Sentinel-2 and PROBA-V. Velocities of floating river ice during the spring of 2016 are estimated over a more than 700 km long reach of the Lena River in Russia. In order to achieve automatic velocity estimates at such scales, efficient and river-ice specific processing steps are included. Entropy filters are used to detect regions of high contrast and neglects open water or an intact ice cover, and also help the image matching. Post-processing is done through filtering on the general flow direction, stemming from a global river mask dataset. In all, this study shows the potential of extracting river ice movement from a combination of low and medium resolution satellite sensors in sun-synchronous orbit.

TI  - Determining the habitat fragmentation thru geoscience capabilities in Turkey: A case study of wildlife refuges
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Technical forest management started 180 years ago in Turkey, during which time there have been various approaches and policy changes. The primary objective of forestry has been considered as timber production, so the intangible benefits have never been given the proper attention they deserve. The majority of Turkey's wildlife has prospered within the forest ecosystems. This situation has gradually led to a change of status, so some forests and land areas have been reassigned with the conservation agendas as the primary purpose; however timber production has never slowed down. Thus, operational forestry practices, such as roading, logging, etc., have kept on exploiting these lands to their full extent despite their conservation statuses. In Turkey and anywhere else, since forestry has always evolved around extracting the timber out of the forest lands, the accessibility has long been provided, building roads to take related services to forested ecosystems. The remnants of these roads, along with the more standardized new ones can be found everywhere, regardless of the land status. Such expansion has resulted in habitat fragmentation emerging as a major threat for the protected areas. In this study, the expansion of all-weather and dry-weather accessible roads and suburban spread was examined in two adjacent, Ilgaz and Gavurdagi, wildlife refuges for the years of 1960, 1993, 2010 and 2019, relying heavily on the mapping, geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing. It was found that 275.5 km dry-weather roads in 1960 rose to 700 km in 2019, which meant 254% increase. Additionally, when the core along with the surrounding 3000 m buffer area was considered, 51 km all-weather roads in 1960 increased almost four and a half times by 2019. Suburban expansion was relatively stable inside the core area but had almost quadrupled within the surrounding areas, exposing the refuges to more people. These findings indicated that the wildlife habitats of Turkey are fragmented and under heavy human pressure.

TI  - Evaluating Carbon Monoxide and Aerosol Optical Depth Simulations from CAM-Chem Using Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The scope of this work was to evaluate simulated carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the CAM-chem model against observed satellite data and additionally explore the empirical relationship of CO, AOD and fire radiative power (FRP). The simulated seasonal global concentrations of CO and AOD were compared, respectively, with the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) and the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite products for the period 2010-2014. The CAM-chem simulations were performed with two configurations: (A) tropospheric-only; and (B) tropospheric with stratospheric chemistry. Our results show that the spatial and seasonal distributions of CO and AOD were reasonably reproduced in both model configurations, except over central China, central Africa and equatorial regions of the Atlantic and Western Pacific, where CO was overestimated by 10-50 ppb. In configuration B, the positive CO bias was significantly reduced due to the inclusion of dry deposition, which was not present in the model configuration A. There was greater CO loss due to the chemical reactions, and shorter lifetime of the species with stratospheric chemistry. In summary, the model has difficulty in capturing the exact location of the maxima of the seasonal AOD distributions in both configurations. The AOD was overestimated by 0.1 to 0.25 over desert regions of Africa, the Middle East and Asia in both configurations, but the positive bias was even higher in the version with added stratospheric chemistry. By contrast, the AOD was underestimated over regions associated with anthropogenic activity, such as eastern China and northern India. Concerning the correlations between CO, AOD and FRP, high CO is found during March-April-May (MAM) in the Northern Hemisphere, mainly in China. In the Southern Hemisphere, high CO, AOD, and FRP values were found during August-September-October (ASO) due to fires, mostly in South America and South Africa. In South America, high AOD levels were observed over subtropical Brazil, Paraguay and Bolivia. Sparsely urbanized regions showed higher correlations between CO and FRP (0.7-0.9), particularly in tropical areas, such as the western Amazon region. There was a high correlation between CO and aerosols from biomass burning at the transition between the forest and savanna environments over eastern and central Africa. It was also possible to observe the transport of these pollutants from the African continent to the Brazilian coast. High correlations between CO and AOD were found over southeastern Asian countries, and correlations between FRP and AOD (0.5-0.8) were found over higher latitude regions such as Canada and Siberia as well as in tropical areas. Higher correlations between CO and FRP are observed in Savanna and Tropical forests (South America, Central America, Africa, Australia, and Southeast Asia) than FRP x AOD. In contrast, boreal forests in Russia, particularly in Siberia, show a higher FRP x AOD correlation than FRP x CO. In tropical forests, CO production is likely favored over aerosol, while in temperate forests, aerosol production is more than CO compared to tropical forests. On the east coast of the United States, the eastern border of the USA with Canada, eastern China, on the border between China, Russia, and Mongolia, and the border between North India and China, there is a high correlation of CO x AOD and a low correlation between FRP with both CO and AOD.Therefore, such emissions in these regions are not generated by forest fires but by industries and vehicular emissions since these are densely populated regions.

TI  - Monitoring Lakes Surface Water Velocity with SAR: A Feasibility Study on Lake Garda, Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The SAR Doppler frequencies are directly related to the motion of the scatterers in the illuminated area and have already been used in marine applications to monitor moving water surfaces. Here we investigate the possibility of retrieving surface water velocity from SAR Doppler analysis in medium-size lakes. ENVISAT images of the test site (Lake Garda) are processed and the Doppler Centroid Anomaly technique is adopted. The resulting surface velocity maps are compared with the outputs of a hydrodynamic model specifically validated for the case study. Thermal images from MODIS Terra are used in support of the modeling results. The surface velocity retrieved from SAR is found to overestimate the numerical results and the existence of a bias is investigated. In marine applications, such bias is traditionally removed through Geophysical Model Functions (GMFs) by ascribing it to a fully developed wind waves spectrum. We found that such an assumption is not supported in our case study, due to the small-scale variations of topography and wind. The role of wind intensity and duration on the results from SAR is evaluated, and the inclusion of lake bathymetry and the SAR backscatter gradient is recommended for the future development of GMFs suitable for lake environments.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Peatland Productivity and Climate Relationships Across the Western South American Altiplano
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The South American Altiplano is one of the largest semiarid high-altitude plateaus in the world. Within the Altiplano, peatlands known as "bofedales" are important components of regional hydrology and provide key water resources and ecosystem services to Andean communities. Warming temperatures, changes in hydroclimate, and shifting atmospheric circulation patterns all affect peatland dynamics and hydrology. It is therefore urgent to better understand the relationships between climate variability and the spatiotemporal variations in peatland productivity across the Altiplano. Here, we explore climate influences on peatland vegetation using 31 years of Landsat data. We focus specifically on the bofedal network in the western Altiplano, the driest sector of the plateau, and use the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an indicator of productivity. We develop temporally and spatially continuous NDVI products at multiple scales in order to evaluate relationships with climate variables over the past three decades. We demonstrate that cumulative precipitation and snow persistence over the prior 2 years are strongly associated with growing season productivity. A step change in peatland productivity between 2013-2015 drives an increasing trend in NDVI and is likely a response to consecutive years of anomalously high snow accumulation and rainfall. Early summer minimum temperatures emerge as a secondary influence on productivity. Understanding large-scale productivity dynamics and characterizing the response of bofedales to climate variability over the last three decades provides a baseline to monitor the responses of Andean peatlands to climate change.

TI  - Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome in Cats and Its Prevalence among Veterinarian Staff Members in Nagasaki, Japan
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigated severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus (SFTSV) infection in cats in Nagasaki, Japan. In total, 44 of 133 (33.1%) cats with suspected SFTS were confirmed to be infected with SFTSV. Phylogenetic analyses of SFTSV isolates from cats indicated that the main genotype in Nagasaki was J1 and that unique reassortant strains with J2 (S segment) and unclassified genotypes (M and L segments) were also present. There were no significant differences in virus growth in cell cultures or fatality in SFTSV-infected mice between the SFTSV strains that were isolated from recovered and fatal cat cases. Remarkably, SFTSV RNAs were detected in the swabs from cats, indicating that the body fluids contain SFTSV. To evaluate the risk of SFTSV infection when providing animal care, we further examined the seroprevalence of SFTSV infection in veterinarian staff members; 3 of 71 (4.2%) were seropositive for SFTSV-specific antibodies. Our results provide useful information on the possibility of using cats as sentinel animals and raised concerns of the zoonotic risk of catching SFTSV from animals.

TI  - Determination of the radius of influence for groundwater sources using a spatial mapping method
T2  - Ceylon Journal of Science
M3  - Article
AB  - The radial distance over which a particular land-use has the major influence on the groundwater quality is known as the radius of influence (ROI). For this study, total of 39 open well sampling sites were selected across the 13 DSDs in Colombo district. Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS image was acquired and supervised classification was employed to classify land-uses into four major categories. From each well, buffer zones were created at 100 m interval from 0 to 500 m. Following that the intersect tool was applied at each buffer zone to calculate the areas of intersecting land-uses. Simple regression analysis between higher percentage land-use and parameters were conducted to find the optimum radius of influence. The results of groundwater quality revealed that COD, BOD5, DO and pH levels in some wells were not meeting the standard levels of 15, 3, 6 mg L-1 and 6-8.5 respectively. Most of the wells with higher COD and BOD5 have higher percentage of impervious areas. Highest co-efficient for COD, 0.23 (p < 0.05) at 200 m radius and for BOD5, 0.05 (p < 0.05) at 200 m radius were obtained. Low pH values were observed in intense agricultural areas and at 500 m radius, highest co-efficient of 0.037 (p < 0.05) was obtained. Correlations between COD and BOD5 concentrations with impervious areas were low (R-2; 11% and 21% respectively) even at significant level of 0.05 but correlation between pH and vegetated areas was comparatively higher (R-2; 40.9%). The study suggests that sustainable land-use management practices should be carried out to protect the groundwater resources.

TI  - Tracking Deformation Processes at the Legnica Glogow Copper District (Poland) by Satellite InSAR-I: Room and Pillar Mine District
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining exploitation leads to slow or rapid ground subsidence resulting from deformation until the collapse of underground post-mining voids following excavation activities. Satellite SAR interferometry capabilities for the evaluation of ground movements allows the monitoring of intensive surface mine subsidence and can provide new knowledge about the risks in the mining industry. This work integrates both conventional and advanced Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) to study the ground subsidence in the Legnica Glogow Copper District (LGCD, Poland) by processing about 400 Sentinel-1 images from October 2014 to April 2019. Even without field data and information on past and ongoing excavation activities, the DInSAR approach allowed us to identify 30 troughs of subsidence, ranging from 500 m to 2.5 km in diameter, which in some cases, took place several times during the analyzed time span. The cumulative subsidence in 4 years and 7 months exceeds 70 cm in several zones of the LGCD. The sub-centimetric precision achieved by advanced analysis (A-DInSAR), allowed us to monitor the real extent of the mining influence area on the surface, with deformation velocities of up to 50 mm/year. The ground deformation detected at LGCD can be due to both mining-induced tremors and roof subsidence above the underground excavation rooms. As deformations do not occur concurrently with tremors, this can be related to excavation activities or to degradation of abandoned mines.

TI  - Predicting the spatial distribution of soil mineral particles using OLI sensor in northwest of Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Texture is one of the most important soil properties that knowledge of the spatial distribution is essential for land-use planning and other activities related to agriculture and environment protection. So, this study was performed to supply the soil texture spatial distribution using standardized spectral reflectance (ZPC1) index of Landsat 8 satellite images in the north-west of Iran. The soil sampling was performed using a random method in 145 points. Mineral soil particles including clay, silt, and sand were determined, and soil texture was calculated. In this study, Landsat 8 satellite images were used to interpolate the soil texture spatial distribution. In the first step, the principal component analysis (PCA) was obtained. Then, PCA1 was standardized using a z-score (ZPC1), and regression techniques were used to create proper relationships between ZPC1 and the primary soil particles. Then, spatial distribution of soil particles was used to create a spatially distributed map of the soil textural classes. The results showed that the standardization of the first component reduced the standard deviation of PCA1 from 23.6 to 10.8. The results of comparing ZPC1 with soil mineral components showed that with increasing the amounts of soil clay and sand, the ZPC1 value decreases and increases, respectively. The results showed that the ranges of the spatial distribution of clay and sand were similar to the laboratory-measured amounts. The results of texture class prediction using the soil texture triangle showed that the amount of similarity between the measured and predicted classes was 53.79%.

AB  - Human activities, exacerbated by periods of armed conflict, have impacted the biodiversity-rich forests in Western Rwanda during recent decades, creating a need to enhance forest protection and restoration policies that address widespread environmental degradation in this mountainous region. Contrasting observations and the lack of recent forest-cover maps make reliable assessments of forest-cover change in Western Rwanda difficult. We investigate forest-cover dynamics across Western Rwanda between 1986 and 2019, using the random forest algorithm to classify a suite of Landsat-5, Landsat-7, and Landsat-8 images to produce forest-cover maps at quadrennial intervals. Approximately 19% (23,412 ha) of the initial forest extent was lost between 1986 and 2006, primarily due to pastureland expansion and forest conversions associated with armed conflicts. Forest loss peaked between 2010 and 2014, a period corresponding to rapid extension of public infrastructures and overexploitation of forest products to supply the growing urban areas. Western Rwanda experienced a 17% increase in forest cover between 1986 (144,792 ha) and 2019 (169,197 ha), due to the establishment of tree plantations around protected areas and throughout agricultural land-uses. The published forest datasets for Western Rwanda either overestimate forest area due to confusions with agricultural land cover or they underestimate deforestation due to the complex mountainous terrain. Ongoing forest losses and increasing isolation of natural forests pose significant threats to the biodiversity habitats and the sustainable supply of ecosystem services in this densely populated, globally important biodiversity hotspot region.

TI  - Integration of Remote Sensing and Mexican Water Quality Monitoring System Using an Extreme Learning Machine
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing, as a driver for water management decisions, needs further integration with monitoring water quality programs, especially in developing countries. Moreover, usage of remote sensing approaches has not been broadly applied in monitoring routines. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the efficacy of available sensors to complement the often limited field measurements from such programs and build models that support monitoring tasks. Here, we integrate field measurements (2013-2019) from the Mexican national water quality monitoring system (RNMCA) with data from Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-3 OLCI, and Sentinel-2 MSI to train an extreme learning machine (ELM), a support vector regression (SVR) and a linear regression (LR) for estimating Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), Turbidity, Total Suspended Matter (TSM) and Secchi Disk Depth (SDD). Additionally, OLCI Level-2 Products for Chl-a and TSM are compared against the RNMCA data. We observed that OLCI Level-2 Products are poorly correlated with the RNMCA data and it is not feasible to rely only on them to support monitoring operations. However, OLCI atmospherically corrected data is useful to develop accurate models using an ELM, particularly for Turbidity (R-2 = 0.7). We conclude that remote sensing is useful to support monitoring systems tasks, and its progressive integration will improve the quality of water quality monitoring programs.

TI  - Shallow Landslides Physically Based Susceptibility Assessment Improvement Using InSAR. Case Study: Carpathian and Subcarpathian Prahova Valley, Romania
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A multi-temporal satellite radar interferometry technique is used for deriving the actual surface displacement patterns in a slope environment in Romania, in order to validate and improve a landslide susceptibility map. The probability the occurrence of future events is established using a deterministic approach based on a classical one-dimension infinite slope stability model. The most important geotechnical parameters for slope failure in the proposed study area are cohesion, unit weight and friction angle, and the triggering factor is a rapid rise in groundwater table under wetting conditions. Employing a susceptibility analysis using the physically based model under completely saturated conditions proved to be the most suitable scenario for identifying unstable areas. The kinematic characteristics are assessed by the Small BAseline Subsets (SBAS) interferometry technique applied to C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 imagery. The analysis was carried out mainly for inhabited areas which present a better backscatter return. The validation revealed that more than 22% of the active landslides identified by InSAR were predicted as unstable areas by the infinite slope model. We propose a refinement of the susceptibility map using the InSAR results for unravelling the danger of the worst-case scenario.

TI  - A Comparison of Optimized Sentinel-2 Super-Resolution Methods Using Wald's Protocol and Bayesian Optimization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of earth observation and remote sensing, super-resolution aims to enhance the resolution of a captured image by upscaling and enhancing its details. In recent years, numerous methods for super-resolution of Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral images have been suggested. Most of those methods depend on various tuning parameters that affect how effective they are. This paper's aim is twofold. Firstly, we propose to use Bayesian optimization at a reduced scale to select tuning parameters. Secondly, we choose tuning parameters for eight S2 super-resolution methods and compare them using real and synthetic data. While all the methods give good quantitative results, Area-To-Point Regression Kriging (ATPRK), Sentinel-2 Sharpening (S2Sharp), and Sentinel-2 Symmetric Skip Connection convolutional neural network (S2 SSC) perform markedly better on several datasets than the other methods tested in this paper.

TI  - Remote Sensing Based Yield Estimation of Rice (<i>Oryza Sativa</i> L.) Using Gradient Boosted Regression in India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and spatially explicit yield information is required to ensure farmers' income and food security at local and national levels. Current approaches based on crop cutting experiments are expensive and usually too late for timely income stabilization measures like crop insurances. We, therefore, utilized a Gradient Boosted Regression (GBR), a machine learning technique, to estimate rice yields at similar to 500 m spatial resolution for rice-producing areas in India with potential application for near real-time estimates. We used resampled intermediate resolution (similar to 5 km) images of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Leaf Area Index (LAI) and observed yields at the district level in India for calibrating GBR models. These GBRs were then used to downscale district yields to 500 m resolution. Downscaled yields were re-aggregated for validation against out-of-sample district yields not used for model training and an additional independent data set of block-level (below district-level) yields. Our downscaled and re-aggregated yields agree well with reported district-level observations from 2003 to 2015 (r = 0.85 & MAE = 0.15 t/ha). The model performance improved further when estimating separate models for different rice cropping densities (up to r = 0.93). An additional out-of-sample validation for the years 2016 and 2017, proved successful with r = 0.84 and r = 0.77, respectively. Simulated yield accuracy was higher in water-limited, rainfed agricultural systems. We conclude that this downscaling approach of rice yield estimation using GBR is feasible across India and may complement current approaches for timely rice yield estimation required by insurance companies and government agencies.

TI  - Prevalent risk of glacial lake outburst flood hazard in the Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalaya region of Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The retreating behavior of glaciers observed in most of the Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalaya (HKH) region has given rise to the formation and expansion of numerous glacial lakes in the region. The lakes expansion under changing climate usually poses high risk of glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) hazard for the downstream communities. In the present study, the risk of glacial lake outburst flood was investigated in the HKH region of Pakistan using LANDSAT-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) image data of 2013 period coupled with ground information. The results of present study revealed 3044 lakes (surface area about 134.8 km(2)) in the three HKH ranges, maximum in the Karakoram (1325) and minimum in the Hindu Kush range (722) during 2013. The lakes exhibited an overall increase of about 26% in number and 7% in area in the region during 2001-2013 period. The increase in lake number was 91% within 2500-3500 m, 20% within 3500-4500 m and 31% within 4500-5500 m elevation range. Among total identified lakes during 2013, 36 were characterized as potentially dangerous glacial lakes (PDGLs) that can pose GLOF hazard in the HKH region. A regular monitoring of cryosphere changes and critical glacial lakes is essential to develop sustainable risk management strategies for this region in future.

TI  - The Use of Land Cover Indices for Rapid Surface Urban Heat Island Detection from Multi-Temporal Landsat Imageries
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aims of this study were to determine surface urban heat island (SUHI) effects and to analyze the land use/land cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) changes for 11 time periods from the years 2002 to 2020 using Landsat time series images. Bursa, which is the fourth largest metropolitan city in Turkey, was selected as the study area, and Landsat multi-temporal images of the summer season were used. Firstly, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and index-based built-up index (IBI) were created using the bands of Landsat images, and LULC classes were determined by applying automatic thresholding. The LST values were calculated using thermal images and SUHI effects were determined. The results show that NDVI, SAVI, MNDWI and IBI indices can be used effectively for the determination of the urban, vegetation and water LULC classes for SUHI studies, with overall classification accuracies between 89.60% and 95.90% for the used images. According to the obtained results, generally the LST values increased for almost all land cover areas between the years 2002 and 2020. The SUHI magnitudes were computed by using two methods, and it was found that there was an important increase in the 18-year time period.

TI  - Deep Neural Networks with Transfer Learning for Forest Variable Estimation Using Sentinel-2 Imagery in Boreal Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of forest structural variables is essential to provide relevant insights for public and private stakeholders in forestry and environmental sectors. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) enables accurate forest inventory, but it is expensive for large area analyses. Continuously increasing volume of open Earth Observation (EO) imagery from high-resolution (<30 m) satellites together with modern machine learning algorithms provide new prospects for spaceborne large area forest inventory. In this study, we investigated the capability of Sentinel-2 (S2) image and metadata, topography data, and canopy height model (CHM), as well as their combinations, to predict growing stock volume with deep neural networks (DNN) in four forestry districts in Central Finland. We focused on investigating the relevance of different input features, the effect of DNN depth, the amount of training data, and the size of image data sampling window to model prediction performance. We also studied model transfer between different silvicultural districts in Finland, with the objective to minimize the amount of new field data needed. We used forest inventory data provided by the Finnish Forest Centre for model training and performance evaluation. Leaving out CHM features, the model using RGB and NIR bands, the imaging and sun angles, and topography features as additional predictive variables obtained the best plot level accuracy (RMSE% = 42.6%, |BIAS%| = 0.8%). We found 3x3 pixels to be the optimal size for the sampling window, and two to three hidden layer DNNs to produce the best results with relatively small improvement to single hidden layer networks. Including CHM features with S2 data and additional features led to reduced relative RMSE (RMSE% = 28.6-30.7%) but increased the absolute value of relative bias (|BIAS%| = 0.9-4.0%). Transfer learning was found to be beneficial mainly with training data sets containing less than 250 field plots. The performance differences of DNN and random forest models were marginal. Our results contribute to improved structural variable estimation performance in boreal forests with the proposed image sampling and input feature concept.

TI  - Integrating Convolutional Neural Network and Multiresolution Segmentation for Land Cover and Land Use Mapping Using Satellite Imagery
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Depletion of natural resources, population growth, urban migration, and expanding drought conditions are some of the reasons why environmental monitoring programs are required and regularly produced and updated. Additionally, the usage of artificial intelligence in the geospatial field of Earth observation (EO) and regional land monitoring missions is a challenging issue. In this study, land cover and land use mapping was performed using the proposed CNN-MRS model. The CNN-MRS model consisted of two main steps: CNN-based land cover classification and enhancing the classification with spatial filter and multiresolution segmentation (MRS). Different band numbers of Sentinel-2A imagery and multiple patch sizes (32 x 32, 64 x 64, and 128 x 128 pixels) were used in the first experiment. The algorithms were evaluated in terms of overall accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and kappa coefficient. The highest overall accuracy was obtained with the proposed approach as 97.31% in Istanbul test site area and 98.44% in Kocaeli test site area. The accuracies revealed the efficiency of the CNN-MRS model for land cover map production in large areas. The McNemar test measured the significance of the models used. In the second experiment, with the Zurich Summer dataset, the overall accuracy of the proposed approach was obtained as 92.03%. The results are compared quantitatively with state-of-the-art CNN model results and related works.

TI  - A Census of Eddies in the Tropical Eastern Boundary of the Indian Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indo-Australian Basin (IAB) constitutes a crucial water route for the global ocean's circulation between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Locally generated eddies contribute to the continued westward transport of water away from the IAB. In this paper, results from the first comprehensive regional ocean eddy census are discussed. A hybrid eddy census and tracking algorithm is used to analyze satellite altimetry data from 1993 to 2018. A total of 2,792 eddies were identified and tracked. Cyclonic eddies and anticyclonic eddies exhibit geographical segregation in terms of their dynamic characteristics. Larger amplitudes, radii, and absolute vorticities are associated with high eddy kinetic energy regions located in the vicinity of the South Java Current, South Equatorial Current, and Indonesian Throughflow. The eddies are grouped into three duration-based classifications providing the first systematic insight into understanding their physical characteristics, formation, and distribution in the IAB.Plain Language Summary The Indo-Australian Basin (IAB) is one of the most important pathways for the exchange of water between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. In addition to ocean currents that move water westward, clockwise or anticlockwise rotating ocean eddies contribute to the transport from the IAB and toward the western Indian Ocean. The changing characteristics of these eddies are identified, quantified, and described in this paper. To do so, we use satellite data that reveal changes in sea surface height as an indicator for the presence of an eddy. The eddies are tracked from their genesis in the eastern IAB to their dissipation in the western Indian Ocean. In addition to the many small-scale features discovered for the first time, we found that one eddy existed for over a year and traveled a distance of more than 3,000 km during this time.

TI  - Long-Term Variations of Global Solar Radiation and Atmospheric Constituents at Sodankyla in the Arctic
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - An empirical model of global solar irradiance (EMGSI) under all sky conditions was developed by using solar radiation and meteorological parameters at Sodankyla. The calculated hourly global solar irradiance is in agreement with that observed at the ground during 2008-2011 and at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). This model is used to calculate the global solar irradiance at the ground and its attenuation in the atmosphere due to absorbing and scattering substances in 2000-2018. The sensitivity test indicates that the responses of global solar irradiance to changes in water vapor and scattering factors are nonlinear and negative, and global solar irradiance is more sensitive to changes in scattering (expressed by the scattering factor S/G, S and G are diffuse and global solar radiation, respectively) than to changes in water vapor. Using this empirical model, we calculated the albedos at the TOA and the surface, which are in agreement with the satellite-retrieved values. A good relationship between S/G and aerosol optical depth (AOD) was determined and used to estimate AOD in 2000-2018. An empirical model for estimation of tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD) was also developed and used to calculate tropospheric NO2 VCD in 2000-2018. During 2000-2018, the estimated global solar irradiance decreased by 0.92%, and diffuse irradiance increased by 1.28% per year, which is ascribed to the increases of S/G (1.73%) and water vapor (0.43%). Annual surface air temperature increases by 0.07 degrees C per year. Annual mean loss of global solar irradiance caused by absorbing and scattering substances and total loss are 1.94, 1.17 and 3.11 MJ m(-2), respectively. Annual mean losses of absorbing and scattering global solar irradiance show negative and positive trends, respectively, and the annual total loss increases by 0.24% per year. Annual mean losses due to absorption were much larger than those due to scattering. The calculated albedos at the TOA are smaller than at the surface. The calculated and satellite-retrieved annual albedos decrease at the TOA and increase at the surface. During 2000-2018, annual means of the AOD and the tropospheric NO2 VCD increased by 8.23% and 0.03% per year, respectively.

TI  - Enhancement of Detecting Permanent Water and Temporary Water in Flood Disasters by Fusing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Imagery Using Deep Learning Algorithms: Demonstration of Sen1Floods11 Benchmark Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying permanent water and temporary water in flood disasters efficiently has mainly relied on change detection method from multi-temporal remote sensing imageries, but estimating the water type in flood disaster events from only post-flood remote sensing imageries still remains challenging. Research progress in recent years has demonstrated the excellent potential of multisource data fusion and deep learning algorithms in improving flood detection, while this field has only been studied initially due to the lack of large-scale labelled remote sensing images of flood events. Here, we present new deep learning algorithms and a multi-source data fusion driven flood inundation mapping approach by leveraging a large-scale publicly available Sen1Flood11 dataset consisting of roughly 4831 labelled Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical imagery gathered from flood events worldwide in recent years. Specifically, we proposed an automatic segmentation method for surface water, permanent water, and temporary water identification, and all tasks share the same convolutional neural network architecture. We utilize focal loss to deal with the class (water/non-water) imbalance problem. Thorough ablation experiments and analysis confirmed the effectiveness of various proposed designs. In comparison experiments, the method proposed in this paper is superior to other classical models. Our model achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 52.99%, Intersection over Union (IoU) of 52.30%, and Overall Accuracy (OA) of 92.81% on the Sen1Flood11 test set. On the Sen1Flood11 Bolivia test set, our model also achieves very high mIoU (47.88%), IoU (76.74%), and OA (95.59%) and shows good generalization ability.

TI  - Exploring the Drivers of Sentinel-2-Derived Crop Phenology: The Joint Role of Climate, Soil, and Land Use
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The exploration of crop seasonality across a region offers a way to help understand the phenological spatial patterns of complex landscapes, like agricultural ones. Knowing the role of environmental factors in influencing crop phenology patterns and processes is a key aspect for understanding the impact of climate and land use changes on agricultural landscape dynamics. We identified pixels with similar phenological behavior (i.e., pheno-clusters) and compared them to the land cover map of the study area to assess the role of the land management component in controlling the phenological patterns identified. Results demonstrated that soil texture is the most important factor for permanent crops, while large amount of rainfall and high values of available water content are the main drivers in spring cultivations (i.e., irrigated crops). Scarce water availability (in terms of soil texture, low annual precipitation and high minimum temperature) represented the main driving factor for non-irrigated crops, whose phenology is characterized by summer drought and fall-winter productivity. Compared to vegetation maps that use only land cover from a single season or period, using seasonality of the NDVI time series to classify the agricultural landscape provides different and more ecologically relevant information about croplands.

TI  - Sensitivity Analysis of Sentinel-1 Backscatter to Oil Palm Plantations at Pluriannual Scale: A Case Study in Gabon, Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper focuses on a sensitivity analysis of Sentinel-1 backscattering signatures from oil palm canopies cultivated in Gabon, Africa. We employed one Sentinel-1 image per year during the 2015-2021 period creating two separated time series for both the wet and dry seasons. The first images were almost simultaneously acquired to the initial growth stage of oil palm plants. The VH and VV backscattering signatures were analysed in terms of their corresponding statistics for each date and compared to the ones corresponding to tropical forests. The times series for the wet season showed that, in a time interval of 2-3 years after oil palm plantation, the VV/VH ratio in oil palm parcels increases above the one for forests. Backscattering and VV/VH ratio time series for the dry season exhibit similar patterns as for the wet season but with a more stable behaviour. The separability of oil palm and forest classes was also quantitatively addressed by means of the Jeffries-Matusita distance, which seems to point to the C-band VV/VH ratio as a potential candidate for discrimination between oil palms and natural forests, although further analysis must still be carried out. In addition, issues related to the effect of the number of samples in this particular scenario were also analysed. Overall, the outcomes presented here can contribute to the understanding of the radar signatures from this scenario and to potentially improve the accuracy of mapping techniques for this type of ecosystems by using remote sensing. Nevertheless, further research is still to be done as no classification method was performed due to the lack of the required geocoded reference map. In particular, a statistical assessment of the radar signatures should be carried out to statistically characterise the observed trends.

TI  - Analysis of Solar Power and Energy Variability Through Site Adaptation of Satellite Data With Quality Controlled Measured Solar Radiation Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based solar power data is becoming more and more important because of its continuous temporal and spatial availability. However, its reliability can be enhanced through quality control and calibration against ground-based measurement data. Here, a holistic methodology is employed for the adaptation of satellite-based data for estimating solar energy. For the purpose, high-quality ground-based measurement data and satellite-based datasets are assessed across 12 sites in three small islands located in the Indian Ocean. Initially, both datasets go through a rigorous quality control process. A quantitative analysis of irradiance and insolation data is then conducted. Eventually, site adaptation of satellite-based data is performed using bias removal technique and statistical analysis of datasets. A set of seven statistical performance indicators is used to support the assessment. Analysis of datasets shows that adaptation of peak values should be performed separately. Results showed that despite the small surface areas of the islands studied, a spatial variation of insolation can be depicted. A temporal variation of insolation is also noted with a peak in the summer and low insolation levels in winter. Peak irradiance values tend to exceed solar constant for all sites. Variations of peak irradiance can only be noticed in ground-based measurement data. While insolation levels are comparable in the summer season for all the sites, insolation levels in the winter season are higher in the sites with lower latitudes. Calibration factors for peak irradiance, monthly and annual average irradiance as well as yearly insolation are presented.

TI  - Comparison of Historical Water Temperature Measurements with Landsat Analysis Ready Data Provisional Surface Temperature Estimates for the Yukon River in Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water temperature is a key element of freshwater ecological systems and a critical element within natural resource monitoring programs. In the absence of in situ measurements, remote sensing platforms can indirectly measure water temperature over time and space. The Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center has processed archived Landsat imagery into analysis ready data (ARD), including Level-2 Provisional Surface Temperature (pST) estimates derived from the Landsat 4-5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). We compared in situ measurements of water temperature within the Yukon River in Alaska with 52 instances of pST estimates between June 2014 and September 2020. Agreement was good with an RMSE of 2.25 degrees C and only a slight negative bias in the estimated mean daily water temperature of -0.47 degrees C. For the 52 dates compared, the average daily water temperature measured by the USGS streamgage was 11.3 degrees C with a standard deviation of 5.7 degrees C. The average daily pST estimate was 10.8 degrees C with a standard deviation of 6.1 degrees C. At least in the case of large unstratified rivers in Alaska, ARD pST can be used to infer water temperature in the absence of or in tandem with ground-based water temperature monitoring campaigns.

TI  - Species-Level Classification and Mapping of a Mangrove Forest Using Random Forest-Utilisation of AVIRIS-NG and Sentinel Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although studies on species-level classification and mapping using multisource data and machine learning approaches are plenty, the use of data with ideal placement of central wavelength and bandwidth at appropriate spatial resolution, for the classification of mangrove species is underreported. The species composition of a mangrove forest has been estimated utilising the red-edge spectral bands and chlorophyll absorption information from AVIRIS-NG and Sentinel-2 data. In this study, three dominant species, Heritiera fomes, Excoecaria agallocha and Avicennia officinalis, have been classified using the random forest (RF) model for a mangrove forest in Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary, India. Various combinations of reflectance/backscatter bands and vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2, AVIRIS-NG, and Sentinel-1 were used for species-level discrimination and mapping. The RF model showed maximum accuracy using Sentinel-2, followed by the AVIRIS-NG, in discriminating three dominant species and two mixed compositions. This study indicates the potential of Sentinel-2 data for discriminating various mangrove species owing to the appropriate placement of central wavelength and bandwidth in Sentinel-2 at >= 10 m spatial resolution. The variable importance plots proved that species-level classification could be attempted using red edge and chlorophyll absorption information. This study has wider applicability in other mangrove forests around the world.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, I offer a reading of Agnon's work, and especially his classic Zionist novel Tmol shilshom (Only Yesterday), from the perspective of cultural and historical analysis. It is my contention that cultural reading will significantly enhance the scholarship of racism and antisemitism that his works address. Reading Tmol shilshom in this fashion affords theoretical and cultural insight into the genealogy and assimilation experiences of the beast (the dog) and the Jew-two figures that challenge the idea of the modern nation by contesting the very possibility of abstraction and symbolism that the national and humanistic imagination enables. I offer a tentative look at the way in which discourse performs identity through violence, that is, differentiation and exclusion. I seek to show that the novel Tmol shilshom, written during the Holocaust, combines the colonial experience with the Jewish one, employing a signifier that never renders a coherent symbol and therefore always highlights difference, reluctant to be submerged by any worldview.

TI  - Machine Learning in Agriculture: A Comprehensive Updated Review
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - The digital transformation of agriculture has evolved various aspects of management into artificial intelligent systems for the sake of making value from the ever-increasing data originated from numerous sources. A subset of artificial intelligence, namely machine learning, has a considerable potential to handle numerous challenges in the establishment of knowledge-based farming systems. The present study aims at shedding light on machine learning in agriculture by thoroughly reviewing the recent scholarly literature based on keywords' combinations of "machine learning" along with "crop management", "water management", "soil management", and "livestock management", and in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Only journal papers were considered eligible that were published within 2018-2020. The results indicated that this topic pertains to different disciplines that favour convergence research at the international level. Furthermore, crop management was observed to be at the centre of attention. A plethora of machine learning algorithms were used, with those belonging to Artificial Neural Networks being more efficient. In addition, maize and wheat as well as cattle and sheep were the most investigated crops and animals, respectively. Finally, a variety of sensors, attached on satellites and unmanned ground and aerial vehicles, have been utilized as a means of getting reliable input data for the data analyses. It is anticipated that this study will constitute a beneficial guide to all stakeholders towards enhancing awareness of the potential advantages of using machine learning in agriculture and contributing to a more systematic research on this topic.

TI  - Model-Based Estimation of Forest Canopy Height and Biomass in the Canadian Boreal Forest Using Radar, LiDAR, and Optical Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the fundamental technical challenges of any new spaceborne vegetation remote sensing mission is the determination of what sensor(s) to place onboard and what, if any, overlapping modes of operation they will employ as each onboard sensor adds significant cost to the overall mission. In this article, the remote sensing of forest parameters using multimodal remote sensing is presented. In particular, polarimetric radar, Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), and near-IR passive optical sensing platforms are employed in conjunction with physics-based models. These models are used to accurately estimate forest aboveground biomass as well as canopy height in homogeneous areas. It is shown that this proposed method is capable of achieving high accuracy estimates while using minimal ancillary data in the estimation process. We present a method to combine measured data sets with our geometric and electromagnetic sensor models to develop a forest parameter estimation algorithm that fuses multimodal remote sensing technologies with a minimal amount of ground information and yields an accurate estimate of forest structure including dry biomass and canopy height with rms errors of 1.6 kg/m(2) and 1.68 m respectively.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the appearance on Earth, human has been constantly operating in nature, exploiting its riches, but also adapting it to its own needs. Both developing and developed countries are constantly concerned about the urbanization process. Urbanization, in order to be positive, must be developed correctly. If such a thing does not happen, then this development will negatively affect both the environment and human health. In order to develop adequate strategies and policies for the most sustainable and effective land use management, it is necessary to quantify, monitor, determine the factors that have influenced this change in land use and the spread mapping of the urban environment. In this study, Landsat satellite images were used to determine the spatial-temporal characteristics of the urban sprawl environment in the Municipality of Prishtina for a period of 20 years (2000-2020). To map the land cover for Prishtina from 2000 to 2020, the Supervised maximum likelihood classification was used using the Landsat ETM + and OLI data archives in ArcGIS 10.5 software. Using landscape metrics and detection techniques after the classification of satellite images, enabled and assisted in the evaluation and analysis of trends and patterns of urban sprawl. The determination of the changes and the analysis made revealed that during the period 2000-2020, in Prishtina, there was an increase of the built areas by 16.46 km(2) at the expense of the unbuilt areas. That there has been an increase in urban areas was also confirmed by the results of landscape metrics.

T2  - FORUM FOR WORLD LITERATURE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article proposes a new perception of The Lazarus Project (2008) by Alcksandar Hcmon. Literary transformation of the past events in light of historical experience, their reinterpretation, and adoption appear within the novel in the forms of history representation and memory production. The author's position in the book is actualised through its structure with alternating chapters and realised in two conflicting identities: a historian who just records events, and a creator who builds up the conditioned reality of the characters' world. The analysis of the novel's structure displays the hybridity of narrative strategies in historical, fictional, and biblical dimensions. Including photography in literary hybridisation highlights a means through which the forms of the representation of the author's worldview get separated from existing practices and recombine with new ones. The conjunction of biography, photography, space and time frames in The Lazarus Project refers to a specific type of narration that underlines its transnational character. The article also deconstructs the examples of biblical allusions and as direct so indirect references to the Bible that can be a way of transcending historical barriers. Originality in research of Hemon's novel as a representative of migrant literature consists in revealing the influence of transcultural narratives of contemporary postcolonial fiction on the migrant identity. The application of an interdisciplinary approach intends to demonstrate the diversity of narratives in the book as an original piece of postmodern metafiction.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES-X
M3  - Article
AB  - The landslide is a common problem in the Siwalik zone of Nepal Himalaya during the monsoon period. The heterogeneity of lithology comprising of thickly bedded sandstone and mudstone, weakly cemented conglom-erate beds, and permeable quaternary deposits on moderate to steep slopes are primarily responsible for the landslide in this zone. In this study, a multidisciplinary approach is used for the landslide characterization. The polygon-based landslide inventory map was prepared by using Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and Google Earth imag-eries. The draft inventory map was verified and updated by several field visits. The final inventory map was overlaid with topographical, geological, and hydrological maps in Q-GIS and explored the landslide character-istics. Landslide distribution to geological units, thrust zone, slope, aspect, and rainfall amount along with the geotechnical properties are manifested and the relation between each selected factor is discussed. The study shows that a multidisciplinary technique provides the better option for landslide characterization.

TI  - Land cover change and its impact on human-elephant conflict: a case from Fashiakhali forest reserve in Bangladesh
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land cover are a major driving force behind habitat change, which significantly impacts the distribution of wildlife and ecological systems. However, there is a substantial lack of information on the effects of land cover changes on wildlife habitat and local conservation. Therefore, it is essential to understand how land cover changes may threaten future land cover trends and wildlife habitat loss, especially in protected areas. Landsat satellite imagery uses a geographic information system and remote sensing techniques to determine the spatiotemporal pattern of land cover change and its impact on the human-elephant conflict in the Fashiakhali Wildlife Sanctuary. We found that within the sanctuary (1994-2005), settlements, agricultural land, and bare land increased by 69.8ha (2.3%), 991.6ha (32.3%), and 39.5ha (1.3%), and forest areas and water areas decreased by 1094.1ha (35.7%) and 6.9ha (0.2%), respectively. On the other hand (2005-2015), settlements, agricultural land, and water areas increased by 11.7ha (0.4%), 264.7ha (8.6%), and 36.2ha (1.2%), and forest areas and bare land decreased by 308.9ha (10.1%) and 3.7ha (0.1%), respectively. Our findings have shown that increased agriculture and settlements have become a severe threat to the ecological sustainability of elephant habitat, resulting in habitat fragmentation and human encroachment of elephant habitats, as well as extreme pressure and competition on resources.

TI  - Machine Learning for Arctic Sea Ice Physical Properties Estimation Using Dual-Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work introduces a novel method that combines machine learning (ML) techniques with dual-polarimetric (dual-pol) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations for estimating quad-polarimetric (quad-pol) parameters, which are presumed to contain geophysical sea ice information. In the training phase, the output parameters are generated from quad-pol observations obtained by Radarsat-2 (RS2), and the corresponding input data consist of features obtained from overlapping dual-pol Sentinel-1 (S1) data. Then, two, well-recognized ML methods are studied to learn the functional relationship between the output and input data. These ML approaches are the Gaussian process regression (GPR) and neural network (NN) for regression models. The goal is to use the aforementioned ML techniques to generate Arctic sea ice information from freely available dual-pol observations acquired by S1, which can, in general, only be generated from quad-pol data. Eight overlapping RS2 and S1 scenes were used to train and test the GPR and NN models. Statistical regression performance measures were computed to evaluate the strength of the ML regression methods. Then, two scenes were selected for further evaluation, where overlapping optical images were available as well. This allowed the visual interpretation of the maps estimated by the ML models. Finally, one of the methods was tested on an entire S1 scene to perform prediction on areas outside of the RS2 and S1 overlap. Our results indicate that the studied ML techniques can be utilized to increase the information retrieval capacity of the wide swath dual-pol S1 imagery while embedding physical properties in the methodology.

TI  - Comparison of Sentinel-2 and UAV Multispectral Data for Use in Precision Agriculture: An Application from Northern Greece
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - The scope of this work is to compare Sentinel-2 and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) imagery from northern Greece for use in precision agriculture by implementing statistical analysis and 2D visualization. Surveys took place on five dates with a difference between the sensing dates for the two techniques ranging from 1 to 4 days. Using the acquired images, we initially computed the maps of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), then the values of this index for fifteen points and four polygons (areas). The UAV images were not resampled, aiming to compare both techniques based on their initial standards, as they are used by the farmers. Similarities between the two techniques are depicted on the trend of the NDVI means for both satellite and UAV techniques, considering the points and the polygons. The differences are in the a) mean NDVI values of the points and b) range of the NDVI values of the polygons probably because of the difference in the spatial resolution of the two techniques. The correlation coefficient of the NDVI values, considering both points and polygons, ranges between 83.5% and 98.26%. In conclusion, both techniques provide important information in precision agriculture depending on the spatial extent, resolution, and cost, as well as the requirements of the survey.

T2  - JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Organic waste in garbage dumps serves as an easily obtained food subsidy for many species globally, with a variety of both positive and negative effects on animals' reproductive and health parameters. However, in some regions, such as southern Patagonia, this phenomenon remains unstudied. In Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego province, Argentina, seven species of facultative and obligate scavenging raptors have been recorded using the garbage dump. During November 2018 to September 2019, we assessed seasonal garbage dump use by facultative and obligate scavenging raptors in Ushuaia, Argentina, and recorded abundance, mortality events, and microplastic ingestion. We observed up to 225 raptors of five species foraging in the deposit zone of the garbage dump, with a fourfold overall increase in early winter compared to the other seasons. We recorded 17 dead raptors of three species, and we identified shooting, entanglement, plastic ingestion, and electrocution as the causes of mortality. Even in samples collected from control birds not associated with the garbage dump, 80-90% of the excreta samples contained microplastics. We suggest that raptors at the Ushuaia garbage dump may serve as sentinel species for environmental monitoring programs, which can facilitate evidence-based conservation management.

In order to fully exploit the content of MTInSAR products, methods are needed for the automatic identification of relevant changes along displacement time series and the classification of the targets on the ground according to their kinematic regime. This work reviews some of the classical procedures for model ranking, based on statistical indices, which are applied to the characterization of MTInSAR displacement time series, and introduces a new quality index based on the Fisher distribution. Then, we propose a procedure to recognize automatically the minimum number of parameters needed to model a given time series reliably within a predefined confidence level. The method, though general, is explored here for polynomial models, which can be used in particular to approximate satisfactorily and with computational efficiency the piecewise linear trends that are generally used to model warning signals preceding the failure of natural and artificial structures. The algorithm performance is evaluated under simulated scenarios. Finally, the proposed procedure is also demonstrated on displacement time series derived by the processing of Sentinel-1 data.

TI  - Historic declines in growth portend trembling aspen death during a contemporary leaf miner outbreak in Alaska
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change-driven droughts and insect outbreaks are becoming more frequent and widespread, increasing forest vulnerability to mortality. By addressing the impacts of climate and insects on tree growth preceding death, we can better understand tree mortality risk under a changing climate. Here, we used tree stature and interannual growth (basal area increment; BAI) to assess processes leading to trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) survival or mortality during an unprecedented leaf miner (Phyllocnistis populiella) outbreak in boreal North America. We identified eight sites (22 plots) in the longest running forest monitoring network in Alaska, spanning similar to 350 km of latitude, that experienced >= 0.25 Mg.ha(-1).yr(-1) aspen mortality during the outbreak. We compared the size and canopy position, growth patterns, and sensitivity to climate and leaf mining of aspen that survived (living; n = 84) vs. died (dying; n = 76) and linked the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to plot-level aspen growth and stand biomass recruitment, growth, and mortality. Dying aspen were in the subcanopy, smaller in diameter, and after a drought in 1957 had lower growth than living aspen until death. Before the outbreak, growth of all trees was positively influenced by moisture and negatively by temperature, but only living trees maintained this climate response during the outbreak. Leaf mining reduced growth of both groups, exerting at least a twofold greater impact than climate. The NDVI captured plot-level tree growth and stand biomass growth and mortality, yet it was nearly two times more strongly associated with living than dying tree growth and 12 times more strongly associated with biomass growth than mortality. These differences suggest that NDVI may inadequately detect insect-driven dieback and dispersed mortality of aspen across the boreal biome. Our findings reveal that a historic drought triggered a multi-decadal growth decline that predisposed aspen to mortality during the leaf miner outbreak and that while aspen growth is influenced by moisture and temperature, it is more strongly affected by P. populiella. We conclude that as the climate warms and insect outbreaks increase in frequency and magnitude at high latitudes, we should expect to see persistent and greater declines in aspen growth and increases in mortality.

TI  - Junctional Tachycardia as a Diagnostic Criterion in Acute Rheumatic Fever
T2  - PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is an acute inflammatory process resulting in rheumatic carditis, one of the most common acquired heart diseases in youth. Among the clinical manifestations of carditis, pathologic valve regurgitation and atrioventricular block are included in the criteria for the diagnosis of ARF. Besides atrioventricular block, ARF may often present with other arrhythmias, such as junctional tachycardia (JT). However, JT is currently not recognized as a criterion for the diagnosis of ARF. Three adolescents presented in our hospital with JT, polyarthralgia, and laboratory signs of inflammation with evidence of preceding group A Streptococcus infection. None of the patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of ARF. On the basis of the presumed diagnosis of ARF, all 3 patients were treated with intravenous steroids. Steroid therapy was given, and JT converted to sinus rhythm within an average of 62 hours. Subsequent electrocardiograms revealed variable degree of atrioventricular block in all 3 patients, providing clinical evidence and fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of ARF. Patients were monitored for a total 2 to 8 days before discharge on standard antiinflammatory treatment. Follow-up electrocardiograms and Holter monitoring revealed resolution of the atrioventricular block and lack of JT recurrence in all patients. On the basis of these sentinel cases, we propose that JT should be included as a diagnostic criterion for the diagnosis of ARF.

TI  - Silvi-Net - A dual-CNN approach for combined classification of tree species and standing dead trees from remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest managers and nature conservationists rely on precise mapping of single trees from remote sensing data for efficient estimation of forest attributes. In recent years, additional quantification of dead wood in particular has garnered interest. However, tree-level approaches utilizing segmented single trees are still limited in accuracy and their application is therefore mostly restricted to research studies. Furthermore, the combined classification of presegmented single trees with respect to tree species and health status is important for practical use but has been insufficiently investigated so far. Therefore, we introduce Silvi-Net, an approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) fusing airborne lidar data and multispectral (MS) images for 3D object classification. First, we segment single 3D trees from the lidar point cloud, render multiple silhouette-like side-view images, and enrich them with calibrated laser echo characteristics. Second, projected outlines of the segmented trees are used to crop and mask the MS orthomosaic and to generate MS image patches for each tree. Third, we independently train two ResNet-18 networks to learn meaningful features from both datasets. This optimization process is based on pretrained CNN weights and recursive retraining of model parameters. Finally, the extracted features are fused for a final classification step based on a standard multi-layer perceptron and majority voting. We analyzed the network?s performance on data captured in two study areas, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (ChEZ) and the Bavarian Forest National Park (BFNP). For both study areas, the lidar point density was approximately 55 points/m(2) and the ground sampling distance values of the true orthophotos were 10 cm (ChEZ) and 20 cm (BFNP). In general, the trained models showed high generalization capacity on independent test data, achieving an overall accuracy (OA) of 96.1% for the classification of pines, birches, alders, and dead trees (ChEZ) -and 91.5% for coniferous, deciduous, snags, and dead trees (BFNP). Interestingly, lidar-based imagery increased the OA by 2.5% (ChEZ) and 5.9% (BFNP) compared to experiments only utilizing MS imagery. Moreover, Silvi-Net also demonstrated superior OA compared to the baseline method PointNet++ by 11.3% (ChEZ) and 2.2% (BFNP). Overall, the effectiveness of our approach was proven using 2D and 3D datasets from two natural forest areas (400-530 trees/ha), acquired with different sensor models, and varying geometric and spectral resolution. Using the technique of transfer learning, Silvi-Net facilitates fast model convergence, even for datasets with a reduced number of samples. Consequently, operators can generate reliable maps that are of major importance in applications such as automated inventory and monitoring projects.

TI  - Extrapolating Satellite-Based Flood Masks by One-Class Classification-A Test Case in Houston
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood masks are among the most common remote sensing products, used for rapid crisis information and as input for hydraulic and impact models. Despite the high relevance of such products, vegetated and urban areas are still unreliably mapped and are sometimes even excluded from analysis. The information content of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is limited in these areas due to the side-looking imaging geometry of radar sensors and complex interactions of the microwave signal with trees and urban structures. Classification from SAR data can only be optimized to reduce false positives, but cannot avoid false negatives in areas that are essentially unobservable to the sensor, for example, due to radar shadows, layover, speckle and other effects. We therefore propose to treat satellite-based flood masks as intermediate products with true positives, and unlabeled cells instead of negatives. This corresponds to the input of a positive-unlabeled (PU) learning one-class classifier (OCC). Assuming that flood extent is at least partially explainable by topography, we present a novel procedure to estimate the true extent of the flood, given the initial mask, by using the satellite-based products as input to a PU OCC algorithm learned on topographic features. Additional rainfall data and distance to buildings had only minor effect on the models in our experiments. All three of the tested initial flood masks were considerably improved by the presented procedure, with obtainable increases in the overall kappa score ranging from 0.2 for a high quality initial mask to 0.7 in the best case for a standard emergency response product. An assessment of kappa for vegetated and urban areas separately shows that the performance in urban areas is still better when learning from a high quality initial mask.

TI  - Spatial Component Analysis to Improve Mineral Estimation Using Sentinel-2 Band Ratio: Application to a Greek Bauxite Residue
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing can be fruitfully used in the characterization of metals within stockpiles and tailings, produced from mining activities. Satellite information, in the form of band ratio, can act as an auxiliary variable, with a certain correlation with the ground primary data. In the presence of this auxiliary variable, modeled with nested structures, the spatial components without correlation can be filtered out, so that the useful correlation with ground data grows. This paper investigates the possibility to substitute in a co-kriging system, the whole band ratio information, with only the correlated components. The method has been applied over a bauxite residues case study and presents three estimation alternatives: ordinary kriging, co-kriging, component co-kriging. Results have shown how using the most correlated component reduces the estimation variance and improves the estimation results. In general terms, when a good correlation with ground samples exists, co-kriging of the satellite band-ratio Component improves the reconstruction of mineral grade distribution, thus affecting the selectivity. On the other hand, the use of the components approach exalts the distance variability.

TI  - Stakeholders' Consumption of Agricultural Injury Reports from News Media: A Six-Year Analysis of Website Usage and Visitor Analytics
T2  - SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - AgInjuryNews.org is a news report-based, online sentinel surveillance dataset that has provided publicly available news and media reports of agricultural injuries since early 2015. In the 6 years since its inception, AgInjuryNews.org has hosted 12,897 unique visitors and has collected 997 user account registrations. New users from geographic areas home to NIOSH-funded agricultural research centres were most prominent, with these centres returning in larger numbers, comparatively. Users were acquired mostly through web searches, collaborations with other agencies, and paid Facebook.com advertisements. Paid advertisements recruited 3792 visitors; however, retention, registrations, and on-site engagement from this source was low. This analysis shows that data consumption on AgInjuryNews.org is steadily growing. Similar self-hosted programs that provide data or digital resources to agricultural safety and health stakeholders should consider the integration of auditing and analytics tracking, including user registrations.

TI  - Green Algae Detection in the Middle . Downstream of Nakdong River Using High-Resolution Satellite Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, because of changes in temperature and rising water temperatures due to increased pollution sources, many algae have been produced in the water system. Therefore, there has been a lot of research using satellite images for the generation and monitoring of green algae. However, in prior studies, it is difficult to consider the optical properties of the local water system by using only a single index, and by using medium and low-resolution satellite images to conduct large-scale algae detection, there is a problem of accuracy in narrow, broad rivers. Therefore, in this work, we utilize high-resolution images of Sentinel-2 satellites to perform green algae detection on a single index (NDVI, SEI, FGAI) and development index (NDVI & SEI, FGAI & SEI) that mixes single indices. In this study, POD, FAR, and PC values were utilized to evaluate the accuracy of green algae detection algorithms, and the FGAI & SEI index showed the highest accuracy with 98.29% overall accuracy PC.

TI  - Super-Resolution-Guided Progressive Pansharpening Based on a Deep Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening and super-resolution (SR) methods share the same target to improve the spatial resolution of images. Based on this similarity, we propose and develop a novel pansharpening algorithm that is guided by a deep SR convolutional neural network. The proposed framework comprises three components: an SR process, a progressive pansharpening process, and a high-pass residual module. Specifically, the SR process extracts inner spatial detail that is present in multispectral images. Then, progressive pansharpening is used as a detailed pansharpening process, and the high-pass residual module helps by directly injecting spatial detail from panchromatic images. The performance of the proposed network has been compared with that of traditional and other deep-learning-based pansharpening algorithms based on QuickBird, WorldView-3, and Landsat-8 data, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Ecosystem Water Use Efficiency: A Review of Direct and Indirect Estimation Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE) is a key index for understanding the ecosystem of carbon-water coupling. The undistinguishable carbon-water coupling mechanism and uncertainties of indirect methods by remote sensing products and process models render challenges for WUE remote sensing. In this paper, current progress in direct and indirect methods of WUE estimation by remote sensing is reviewed. Indirect methods based on gross primary production (GPP)/evapotranspiration (ET) from ground observation, processed models and remote sensing are the main ways to estimate WUE in which carbon and water cycles are independent processes. Various empirical models based on meteorological variables and remote sensed vegetation indices to estimate WUE proved the ability of remotely sensed data for WUE estimating. The analytical model provides a mechanistic opportunity for WUE estimation on an ecosystem scale, while the hypothesis has yet to be validated and applied for the shorter time scales. An optimized response of canopy conductance to atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in an analytical model inverted from the conductance model has been also challenged. Partitioning transpiration (T) and evaporation (E) is a more complex phenomenon than that stated in the analytic model and needs a more precise remote sensing retrieval algorithm as well as ground validation, which is an opportunity for remote sensing to extrapolate WUE estimation from sites to a regional scale. Although studies on controlling the mechanism of environmental factors have provided an opportunity to improve WUE remote sensing, the mismatch in the spatial and temporal resolution of meteorological products and remote sensing data, as well as the uncertainty of meteorological reanalysis data, add further challenges. Therefore, improving the remote sensing-based methods of GPP and ET, developing high-quality meteorological forcing datasets and building mechanistic remote sensing models directly acting on carbon-water cycle coupling are possible ways to improve WUE remote sensing. Improvement in direct WUE remote sensing methods or remote sensing-driven ecosystem analysis methods can promote a better understanding of the global ecosystem carbon-water coupling mechanisms and vegetation functions-climate feedbacks to serve for the future global carbon neutrality.

TI  - Territorialization using georreferencing and stratification of the social vulnerability of families in Primary Care
T2  - CIENCIA & SAUDE COLETIVA
M3  - Review
AB  - This article describes a process of territorialization undertaken in Family Health Strategy micro-areas by a team of residents from the Interprofessional Public Health Residency Program at Cariri Regional University using georeferencing tools and the stratification of families according to degree of social vulnerability. A map of social vulnerability was created using SW Maps and Google Earth Pro based on sociodemographic and clinical data obtained from forms A and B of the e-SUS and inputted into an Excel worksheet. The families were stratified into five degrees of vulnerability based on the overall score obtained for a set of socioeconomic and clinical sentinel indicators: without risk, low risk, medium risk, high risk and very high risk. During the territorialization process, we identified streets and side streets and georeferenced points of risk, social facilities, registered and unregistered families, and vacant homes. Over half of the 615 georeferenced families (316 or 51.38%) were not registered in the e-SUS or had not completed their registration at the time of data collection. Most of the 299 registered families (60.53%) were classified as being at low risk and a considerable portion were medium risk.

TI  - A 30 m terrace mapping in China using Landsat 8 imagery and digital elevation model based on the Google Earth Engine
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The construction of terraces is a key soil conservation practice on agricultural land in China providing multiple valuable ecosystem services. Accurate spatial information on terraces is needed for both management and research. In this study, the first 30 m resolution terracing map of the entire territory of China is produced by a supervised pixel-based classification using multisource and multi-temporal data based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We extracted time-series spectral features and topographic features from Landsat 8 images and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model (SRTM DEM) data, classifying cropland area (cultivated land of Globeland30) into terraced and non-terraced types through a random forest classifier. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were evaluated by 10 875 test samples and achieved values of 94% and 0.72, respectively. For terrace class, the producer's accuracy (PA) was 79.945 %, and the user's accuracy (UA) was 71.149 %. The classification performed best in the Loess Plateau and southwestern China, where terraces are most numerous. Some northeastern, eastern-central, and southern areas had relatively high uncertainty. Typical errors in the mapping results are from the sloping cropland (non-terrace cropland with a slope of >= 5 degrees), low-slope terraces, and non-crop vegetation. Terraces are widely distributed in China, and the total terraced area was estimated to be 53.55 Mha (i.e., 26.43% of China's cropland area) by pixel counting (PC) method and 58.46 +/- 2.99 Mha (i.e., 28.85% +/- 1.48% of China's cropland area) by error-matrix-based model-assisted estimation (EM) method. Elevation and slope were identified as the main features in the terrace/non-terrace classification, and multi-temporal spectral features (such as percentiles of NDVI, TIRS2, and BSI) were also essential. Terraces are more challenging to identify than other land use types because of the intra-class feature heterogeneity, interclass feature similarity, and fragmented patches, which should be the focus of future research. Our terrace mapping algorithm can be used to map large-scale terraces in other regions globally, and our terrace map will serve as a landmark for studies on multiple ecosystem service assessments including erosion control, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity conservation. The China terrace map is available to the public at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3895585 (Cao et al., 2020).

TI  - Stream Network Modeling Using Remote Sensing Data in an Alpine Cold Catchment
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrological information derived from a digital elevation model is very important in distributed hydrological modeling. As part of alpine hydrological research on stream network modeling using remote sensing data in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau, three digital elevation model (DEM) datasets were obtained for the purpose of hydrological features, mainly including channel network, watershed extent and terrain character. The data sources include the airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) with point spacing of 1 m, the High Mountain Asia (HMA) DEM and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM. Mapping of the watershed and stream network was conducted using each of the three DEM datasets. The modeled stream networks using the different DEMs were verified against the actual network mapped in the field. The results show that the stream network derived from the LiDAR DEM was the most accurate representation of the network mapped in the field. The SRTM DEM overestimated the basin hypsometry relative to the LiDAR watershed at the lowest elevation, while the HMA DEM underestimated the basin hypsometry relative to the LiDAR watershed at the highest elevation. This may be because, compared with the SRTM DEM and the HMA DEM, the LiDAR DEM has higher initial point density, accuracy and resolution. It can be seen that the LiDAR data have great potential for the application in hydrologic modeling and water resource management in small alpine catchments.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variations and Controls on Anthropogenic Heat Fluxes in 12 Selected Cities in the Eastern China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal variations of anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) is reported to be associated with global warming. However, confined to the low spatial resolution of energy consumption statistical data, details of AHF was not well descripted. To obtain high spatial resolution data of AHF, Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime light time-series product and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) product were applied to construct the human settlement index. Based on the spatial regression relationship between human settlement index and energy consumption data. A 1-km resolution dataset of AHF of 12 selected cities in the eastern China was obtained. Ordinary least-squares (OLS) model was applied to detect the mechanism of spatial patterns of AHF. Results showed that industrial emission in selected cities of the eastern China was accountable for 63% of the total emission. AHF emission in megacities, such as Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, and Hangzhou, was most significant. AHF increasing speed in most areas in the chosen cities was quite low. High growth or extremely high growth of AHF were located in central downtown areas. In Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Jinan, Hangzhou, Changzhou, Zhaoqing, and Jiangmen, a single kernel of AHF was observed. Potential influencing factors showed that precipitation, temperature, elevation, normalized different vegetation index, gross domestic product, and urbanization level were positive with AHF. Overall, this investigation implied that urbanization level and economic development level might dominate the increasing of AHF and the spatial heterogeneousness of AHF. Higher urbanization level or economic development level resulted in high increasing speeds of AHF. These findings provide a novel way to reconstruct of AHF and scientific supports for energy management strategy development.

TI  - Semi-Automatic Fractional Snow Cover Monitoring from Near-Surface Remote Sensing in Grassland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is an important variable in both climatological and hydrological studies because of its relationship to environmental energy and mass flux. However, variability in snow cover can confound satellite-based efforts to monitor vegetation phenology. This research explores the utility of the PhenoCam Network cameras to estimate Fractional Snow Cover (FSC) in grassland. The goal is to operationalize FSC estimates from PhenoCams to inform and improve the satellite-based determination of phenological metrics. The study site is the Oakville Prairie Biological Field Station, located near Grand Forks, North Dakota. We developed a semi-automated process to estimate FSC from PhenoCam images through Python coding. Compared with previous research employing RGB images only, our use of the monochrome RGB + NIR (near-infrared) reduced pixel misclassification and increased accuracy. The results had an average RMSE of less than 8% FSC compared to visual estimates. Our pixel-based accuracy assessment showed that the overall accuracy of the images selected for validation was 92%. This is a promising outcome, although not every PhenoCam Network system has NIR capability.

TI  - Capacity Development for Use of Remote Sensing for REDD plus MRV Using Online and Offline Activities: Impacts and Lessons Learned
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Four workshops and a webinar series were organized, with the aim of building capacity in countries to use Earth Observation Remote Sensing data to monitor forest cover changes and measure emissions reductions for REDD+ results-based payments. Webinars and workshops covered a variety of relevant tools and methods. The initiative was collaboratively organised by a number of Global Forest Observations Initiative (GFOI) partner institutions with funding from the World Bank's Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF). The collaborative approach with multiple partners proved to be efficient and was able to reach a large audience, particularly in the case of the webinars. However, the impact in terms of use of tools and training of others after the events was higher for the workshops. In addition, engagement with experts was higher from workshop participants. In terms of efficiency, webinars are significantly cheaper to organize. A hybrid approach might be considered for future initiatives; and, this study of the effectiveness of both in-person and online capacity building can guide the development of future initiatives, something that is particularly pertinent in a COVID-19 era.

TI  - Submarine and Subaerial Morphological Changes Associated with the 2014 Eruption at Stromboli Island
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stromboli is an active insular volcano located in the Southern Tyrrhenian Sea and its recent volcanic activity is mostly confined within the Sciara del Fuoco (SdF, hereafter), a 2-km wide subaerial-submarine collapse scar, which morphologically dominates the NW flank of the edifice. In August-November 2014, an effusive eruption occurred along the steep SdF slope, with multiple lava flows reaching the sea. The integration of multisensor remote sensing data, including lidar, photogrammetric, bathymetric surveys coupled with SAR amplitude images collected before and after the 2014 eruption enabled to reconstruct the dynamics of the lava flows through the main morphological changes of the whole SdF slope. Well-defined and steep-sided ridges were created by lava flows during the early stages of the eruption, when effusion rates were high, favoring the penetration into the sea of lava flows as coherent bodies. Differently, fan-shaped features were emplaced during the declining stage of the eruption or in relation to lava overflows and associated gravel flows, suggesting the prevalence of volcaniclastic breccias with respect to coherent lava flows. The estimated volume of eruptive products emplaced on the SdF slope during the 2014 eruption, accounts for about 3.7 x 10(6) m(3), 18% of which is in the submarine setting. This figure is different with respect to the previous 2007 eruption at Stromboli, when a large lava submarine delta formed. This discrepancy can be mainly related to the different elevation of the main vents feeding lava flows during the 2007 eruption (around 400 m) and the 2014 eruption (around 650 m). Besides slope accretion, instability processes were detected both in the subaerial and submarine SdF slope. Submarine slope failure mobilized at least 6 x 10(5) m(3) of volcaniclastic material, representing the largest instability event detected since the 2007 lava delta emplacement.

TI  - Inflating Source Imaging and Stress/Strain Field Analysis at Campi Flegrei Caldera: The 2009-2013 Unrest Episode
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyze the 2009-2013 uplift phenomenon at Campi Flegrei (CF) caldera in terms of temporal and spatial variations in the stress/strain field due to the effect of an inflating source. We start by performing a 3D stationary finite element (FE) modeling of X-band COSMO-SkyMed DInSAR and GPS mean velocities to retrieve the geometry and location of the deformation source. The modeling results suggest that the best-fit source is a three-axis oblate spheroid similar to 3 km deep, which is mostly elongated in the NE-SW direction. Furthermore, we verify the reliability of model results by calculating the total horizontal derivative (THD) of the modeled vertical velocity component; the findings emphasize that the THD maxima overlap with the projection of source boundaries at the surface. Then, we generate a 3D time-dependent FE model, comparing the spatial and temporal distribution of the shear stress and volumetric strain with the seismic swarms beneath the caldera. We found that low values of shear stress are observed corresponding with the shallow hydrothermal system where low-magnitude earthquakes occur, whereas high values of shear stress are found at depths of about 3 km, where high-magnitude earthquakes nucleate. Finally, the volumetric strain analysis highlights that the seismicity occurs mainly at the border between compression and dilatation modeled regions, and some seismic events occur within compression regions.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 and Skin: The Pathologist's Point of View
T2  - BIOMOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has dramatically changed our lives and habits. In just a few months, the most advanced and efficient health systems in the world have been overwhelmed by an infectious disease that has caused 3.26 million deaths and more than 156 million cases worldwide. Although the lung is the most frequently affected organ, the skin has also resulted in being a target body district, so much so as to suggest it may be a real "sentinel" of COVID-19 disease. Here we present 17 cases of skin manifestations studied and analyzed in recent months in our Department; immunohistochemical investigations were carried out on samples for the S1 spike-protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as electron microscopy investigations showing evidence of virions within the constituent cells of the eccrine sweat glands and the endothelium of small blood vessels. Finally, we conduct a brief review of the COVID-related skin manifestations, confirmed by immunohistochemistry and/or electron microscopy, described in the literature.

TI  - The effect of seasonal influenza vaccine on medically-attended influenza and non-influenza respiratory viruses infections at primary care level, Hong Kong SAR, 2017/18 to 2019/20
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine (SIV) varies with the degree of matching with the vaccine and circulating viruses. We continued our SIV effectiveness against medically-attended influenza-like illness (ILI) under the Department of Health Hong Kong's sentinel private medical practitioners (PMP) network, using the test-negative case-control design, for the 2018/19 and 2019/20 season. In addition, we studied the potential interference between SIV and ILI caused by non-influenza respiratory viruses (NIRV) based on data collated from 2017/18 to 2019/20 seasons. 3404 patients were analysed. Across the 2017/18 to 2019/20 seasons, the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of SIV was 44% (95% CI 30-56%) against pan-negative controls, 57% (95%CI 42-68%) against NIRV controls and 50% (95%CI 38-59%) against both. SIV was moderately effective against medically-attended ILI caused by influenza A/B in both 2018/19 and 2019/20 winter seasons (53.2% (95%CI 36.7-65.5%) and 41.8% (95%CI 6.3-64.1%), respectively). The VE against the main circulating subtype, influenza A(H1), was higher for the 2018/19 season (57.2% (95%CI 39.8- 69.9%), compared to 34.6% (95%CI-9.6-61.4%) in the 2019/20 season). When compared to pan negative controls, those with single NIRV infections were similarly likely to have received SIV (OR 1.05 (95%CI 0.72-1.54) within the influenza season; OR 0.97 (95%CI 0.73-1.29) when including non-influenza seasons). Analyses by type of virus showed no increased risk of SIV identified among those with single infections of EV/RV, HMPV and parainfluenza but a 2-fold increased risk was shown for those with single infections of adenovirus and parainfluenza virus (adenovirus: OR 2.54 (95%CI 1.24-5.14) within influenza season and OR 1.78 (95%CI 1.01-3.09) for the whole period; parainfluenza virus: OR 2.01 (95%CI 1.22- 3.29) within influenza season and OR 1.89 (95%CI 1.29-2.76) for the whole period). SIV programme and surveillance of influenza and NIRV, including SARS-CoV-2, should continue during the COVID-19 pandemic. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A Comprehensive Evaluation of Five Evapotranspiration Datasets Based on Ground and GRACE Satellite Observations: Implications for Improvement of Evapotranspiration Retrieval Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a vital part of the hydrological cycle and the water-energy balance. To explore the characteristics of five typical remote sensing evapotranspiration datasets and provide guidance for algorithm development, we used reconstructed evapotranspiration (Recon) data based on ground and GRACE satellite observations as a benchmark and evaluated five remote sensing datasets for 592 watersheds across the continental United States. The Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) dataset (with bias and RMSE values of 23.18 mm/year and 106.10 mm/year, respectively), process-based land surface evapotranspiration/heat flux (P-LSH) dataset (bias = 22.94 mm/year and RMSE = 114.44 mm/year) and the Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML) algorithm generated ET dataset (bias = -17.73 mm/year and RMSE = 108.97 mm/year) showed the better performance on a yearly scale, followed by the model tree ensemble (MTE) dataset (bias = 99.45 mm/year and RMSE = 141.32 mm/year) and the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset (bias = -106.71 mm/year and RMSE = 158.90 mm/year). The P-LSH dataset outperformed the other four ET datasets on a seasonal scale, especially from March to August. Both PML and MTE showed better overall accuracy and could accurately capture the spatial variability of evapotranspiration in arid regions. The P-LSH and GLEAM products were consistent with the Recon data in middle-value section. MODIS and MTE had larger bias and RMSE values on a yearly scale, whereby the MODIS and MTE datasets tended to underestimate and overestimate ET values in all the sections, respectively. In the future, the aim should be to reduce bias in the MODIS and MTE algorithms and further improve seasonality of the ET estimation in the GLEAM algorithm, while the estimation accuracy of the P-LSH and MODIS algorithms should be improved in arid regions. Our analysis suggests that combining artificial intelligence algorithms or data-driven algorithms and physical process algorithms will further improve the accuracy of ET estimation algorithms and the quality of ET datasets, as well as enhancing their capacity to be applied in different climate regions.

TI  - Time-weighted dynamic time warping analysis for mapping interannual cropping practices changes in large-scale agro-industrial farms in Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods for crop phenology detection using time series analysis have provided accurate information for large agricultural areas in shorter processing times, which can be useful for agronomic management and supply chain monitoring. Given the crop dynamics in the Brazilian Cerrado, with alternating crop type plantings, crop successions, and crop rotations, as well as climate and crop practices variation between harvest periods, these methods can be useful for detecting subtle land use and land cover changes at farm and crop field scales, improving thematic classifications and the near real-time crop monitoring. In this study, the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping method was applied to recognize patterns in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time series for land use and cover classification, identifying crop successions and rotations at crop field level in a large-scale agro-industrial agglomerate of farms located at Brazilian Cerrado. We detected and analyzed temporal cropping patterns in training samples to classify the MODIS time series and images, using a robust ground truth data set for validation. The method distinguished Cotton-fallow, Soybean-cotton, Soybeanmaize, and Soybean-millet cropping patterns with an overall accuracy above 85% for all evaluated harvest periods. Seasonal variations in the crop fields, caused by interannual succession and rotation, were detected. The method demonstrated the benefit of creating a spatial vector data set for supporting decision-making in several crop management contexts, improving crop and supply chain monitoring.

TI  - Big Remote Sensing Image Classification Based on Deep Learning Extraction Features and Distributed Spark Frameworks
T2  - BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Big data analysis assumes a significant role in Earth observation using remote sensing images, since the explosion of data images from multiple sensors is used in several fields. The traditional data analysis techniques have different limitations on storing and processing massive volumes of data. Besides, big remote sensing data analytics demand sophisticated algorithms based on specific techniques to store to process the data in real-time or in near real-time with high accuracy, efficiency, and high speed. In this paper, we present a method for storing a huge number of heterogeneous satellite images based on Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) and Apache Spark. We also present how deep learning algorithms such as VGGNet and UNet can be beneficial to big remote sensing data processing for feature extraction and classification. The obtained results prove that our approach outperforms other methods.

TI  - Evaluating thunderclap headache
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN NEUROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review Thunderclap headache (TCH) is an abrupt-onset of severe headache that needs to be thoroughly investigated because the most common secondary cause is subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). There has been no consensus guideline regarding the diagnostic workup. This review aims to provide an update on the evaluation of TCH. Recent findings The most important update in the 2019 American College of Emergency Physicians guideline for evaluation of acute headache in the emergency department is that negative noncontrast brain computed tomography (CT) findings within 6 h from ictus essentially excludes SAH. Additionally, the updated guideline recommends that after a negative brain CT, CT angiogram is a reasonable alternative to lumbar puncture if clinical suspicion of an intracranial source of SAH is high. An important update of reversible vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS), the second most common etiology of TCH, is the RCVS2 score development based on clinical and radiological features, providing high specificity and sensitivity for distinguishing RCVS from other intracranial arteriopathies. Although the evaluation of TCH is exhaustive, the potentially catastrophic consequence of a missed diagnosis of sentinel headache justifies the efforts. Awareness of the clinical features and application of diagnostic tools specific for different pathological conditions can facilitate the diagnostic workup.

TI  - A Disease Control-Oriented Land Cover Land Use Map for Myanmar
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Malaria is a serious infectious disease that leads to massive casualties globally. Myanmar is a key battleground for the global fight against malaria because it is where the emergence of drug-resistant malaria parasites has been documented. Controlling the spread of malaria in Myanmar thus carries global significance, because the failure to do so would lead to devastating consequences in vast areas where malaria is prevalent in tropical/subtropical regions around the world. Thanks to its wide and consistent spatial coverage, remote sensing has become increasingly used in the public health domain. Specifically, remote sensing-based land cover/land use (LCLU) maps present a powerful tool that provides critical information on population distribution and on the potential human-vector interactions interfaces on a large spatial scale. Here, we present a 30-meter LCLU map that was created specifically for the malaria control and eradication efforts in Myanmar. This bottom-up approach can be modified and customized to other vector-borne infectious diseases in Myanmar or other Southeastern Asian countries.

At present, different thermal infrared payloads (TIRPs) have been carried by the Earth remote sensing satellites at home and abroad. According to magnitudes of spatial resolution and imaging width, TIRPs can be divided into three kinds: 1) large width and low resolution, mainly including TIRPs with a width greater than 1000 km and resolution lower than 1 km, such as the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the infrared atmospheric sounder (IRAS) carried on Terra and FY-3D satellites, respectively; 2) medium width and medium resolution, including thermal infrared cameras with a width of 100 1000 km and a resolution of 100 - 1000 m, such as TM/ETM +/TIRS of Landsat 5/7/8; 3) narrow width and high resolution, generally referring to the width less than 100 km and the resolution better than 100 m, such as the visual and infrared multispectral imager (VIMI) aboard GF-5 and the long-wave infrared camera of VRSS-2.The special project of "Big Earth Data Science Engineering Project" proposes to make fine depictions of human activity traces and coastal ecology based on remote sensing data, and to realize real-time quantitative observation of urban heat island, human economic activities and polar environmental changes mainly by thermal infrared and low-light-level cameras, which puts forward higher requirements for the spatial and temporal resolutions of corresponding payloads. Generally, there are two types of data acquisition methods for remote sensing cameras with linear detectors including the push-broom with a long linear-array and the whisk-broom with a short linear-array. However, affected by engineering boundary constraint conditions such as structure size, weight, and power consumption of the satellite, the imaging method of push-broom with a long linear-array is difficult to meet the requirements of short-term, wide-range and high-resolution. Accordingly, the whisk-broom imaging with a long linear-array is an effective method for solving this contradiction.Methods In view of the above requirements, this research proposes a whisk-broom imaging method based on a long multiple-modules-stitched linear-array thermal infrared sensor with three spectral segments, and realizes the widerange and high-resolution ground imaging with a width of 300 km and a resolution of 30 m (sub-satellite point) at an orbital altitude of 505 km. On the one hand, in order to achieve a large range of coverage along the orbit, the thermal infrared imager (TIRI) detector is composed of four 512 x 4 x 3 long-wave time delay integration focal plane modules which are cross stitched together (Fig. 4). Each detector module contains three bands including 8-10.5 mu m, 10.3-11.3 mu m, and 11.5-12.5 mu m. The effective pixel number of each band is 512 x 4, and the pixel size is 30 won x 30 won. 25 pixels are overlaps between connected modules, and 26 dumb pixels are used to isolate different bands of single module to reduce the influence of edge effect. On the other hand, the system adopts all-optical path cryogenic optical system and deep cryogenic optical machine design to reduce thermal radiation of instruments, and sets blocking rings between the rear lens group and dewar, as well as inside dewar, to improve the extinction ability of the system outside the field of view (Fig. 2, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Finally, in order to realize wide-range imaging, the TIRI is equipped with a high-precision one-dimensional scanning mechanism (Fig. 7, Fig. 8), which can achieve the wide-range imaging cross the flight direction while ensuring the ground spatial resolution, and greatly shorten revisit period of camera.Results and Discussions Based on the analysis above, the innovative results of this research mainly include two aspects: 1) wide-range and high-resolution imaging technology; the TIRI of CASEarth small satellite adopts a multi-module splicing long-linear detector (Fig. 4), ensuring the ground spatial resolution and increasing the field of view along the orbit, and a high-precision one-dimensional scanning mechanism to realize the large depth whisk-broom imaging across the flight direction, which achieves the earth imaging with a width of 300 km and a resolution of 30 m at the orbit of 505 km (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). The efficiency of ground data acquisition is greatly improved and the revisit period of the camera is shortened. 2) Design of all-optical path cryogenic optical system; the temperature of optical lens is 195 K, which greatly reduces thermal radiation of the instrument, and the proportion of the background response to the 300 K target reaches the same level as that of Landsat 8 TIRS (Fig. 2, Fig. 5, Fig. 6).Conclusions Aiming at the technological frontier of wide-range and high-resolution imaging, this research, guided by the project of CASEarth TIRI, conducts the researches including the designs of all-optical path cryogenic optical system and multi-module splicing long-linear detectors, the whisk-broom imaging with a long-linear detector array, and the radiation calibration methods (Fig. 9), and introduces the wide-range and high-resolution imaging technology of TIRI in detail, which provides a theoretical and technical reference for the actual in-orbit applications and the development of related optical payloads. Meanwhile, this research can provide the data and technical support for global fine remote sensing and associated high-precision quantitative applications.

TI  - Impacts Analysis of Typical Spectral Absorption Models on Geostationary Millimeter Wave Atmospheric Radiation Simulation
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - To analyze atmospheric radiation characteristics of geostationary millimeter wave remote sensing, three different typical spectral absorption line database based line-by-line millimeter wave atmospheric absorption models, Millimeter-wave Propagation Model (MPM) ROSenkranz Model (ROS) , High-resolution TRAN smission molecular absorption Model (HITRAN), were applied. Under different atmospheric temperature, pressure and water vapor conditions, the differences between the three models were analyzed on 424 GHz, which are planned to add to a geostationary satellite. A multi-layer millimeter wave radiative transfer model was presented. By utilizing intensively observing radiosonde data of Shanghai, simulated millimeter wave radiations of Fengyun 3B (FY3B) microwave humidity sounder MWHS) were calculated under the three atmospheric absorption models. The simulations were compared with the real observations of FY3B MWHS, with temporalspatial matching. The accuracy of the three models was analyzed. Simulations show that, for 424 GHz channels, the trends of the three models' results are the same over atmospheric temperature, pressure and water vapor. The values of MPM and ROS are much closer to each other than HITRAN. The performance of MPM is better than ROS and HITRAN. Simulation errors in channel 5 are less than channel 3 and 4 of FY3B/MWHS.

TI  - Decades of Ground Deformation in the Weihe Graben, Shaanxi Province, China, in Response to Various Land Processes, Observed by Radar Interferometry and Levelling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground deformation is usually used as direct evidence for early warning of geological hazards. The Weihe Graben, located in the southern margin of the Ordos Plateau, is surrounded by many active faults. Earthquakes (e.g., the 1556 Huaxian M 8 earthquake), mine accidents and ground fissures are the major hazards that pose great threats to this densely populated region. In order to characterise both tectonic and anthropogenic activities in the Weihe Graben, we use Envisat data from 2003 to 2010 and Sentinel-1 data from 2014 to 2021, combined with levelling data from 1970 to 2014, to investigate the long-term ground deformation. We generate four InSAR rate maps using the small-baseline subset (SBAS) algorithm. The uncertainties of the InSAR rates are 1-2 mm/year by calculating the differences between the InSAR and levelling measurements. From the deformation time series, we found that most of the faults surrounding the Weihe Graben move at a relatively slow rate (<3 mm/year). Elastic dislocation modelling based on the InSAR and levelling data yields a slip rate of 2.3 +/- 0.3 mm/year for the Huashan Fault, the seismogenic fault for the 1556 Huaxian earthquake. Anthropogenic deformation is much stronger than the tectonic deformation. We identified localised subsidence of 12 mines with a deformation rate ranging from 5 to 17 mm/year. The cities of Xi'an and Xianyang also show evident subsidence, which is likely to be caused by groundwater extraction. Land subsidence in Xi'an has slowed down from an average rate of 10-20 mm/year between 2003 and 2010 to about 5-10 mm/year between 2017 and 2020, but in Xianyang, subsidence has increased dramatically in the past five years from 1 mm/year to 7 mm/year. This is because new industrial and urban development centres have gradually moved from Xi'an to Xianyang. We identified a region bounded by the Kouzhen-Guanshan and Fufeng-Liquan Faults with strong subsidence, as a result of excessive extraction of groundwater. To quantify the effects of crustal groundwater unloading on faults, we calculated the static Coulomb stress changes on the two faults and found that Coulomb stress changes are localised in the upper 5 km with a magnitude of 0.01-0.02 bar/year. The Coulomb stress changes might be large enough (0.1 bar) to affect local seismicity if such excessive extraction of groundwater continued for 10 years.

TI  - Retrieval of High Temporal Resolution Aerosol Optical Depth Using the GOCI Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High temporal resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) products are very important for the studies of atmospheric environment and climate change. Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) is a suitable data source for AOD retrieval, as it can monitor hourly aerosol changes and make up for the low temporal resolution deficiency of polar orbiting satellite. In this study, we proposed an algorithm for retrieving high temporal resolution AOD using GOCI data and then applied the algorithm in the Yangtze River Delta, a typical region suffering severe air pollution issues. Based on Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance determined by MODIS V5.2 algorithm and MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) data, after spectral conversion between MODIS and GOCI, the GOCI surface reflectance at different solar angles were obtained and used to retrieve AOD. Five indicators including correlation coefficient (R), significant level of the correlation (p value), mean absolute error (MAE), mean relative error (MRE) and root mean square error (RMSE) were employed to analyze the errors between the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observed AOD and the GOCI retrieved AOD. The results showed that the GOCI AOD retrieved by the continental aerosol look-up table was consistent with the AERONET AOD (R > 0.7, p <= 0.05). The highest R value of Taihu Station and Xuzhou CUMT Station are both 0.84 (8:30 a.m.); the minimum RMSE at Taihu and Xuzhou-CUMT stations were 0.2077 (11:30 a.m.) and 0.1937 (10:30 a.m.), respectively. Moreover, the results suggested that the greater the solar angle of the GOCI sensor, the higher the AOD retrieval accuracy, while the retrieved AOD at noon exhibited the largest error as assessed by MAE and MRE. We concluded that the inaccurate estimation of surface reflectance was the root cause of the retrieval errors. This study has implications in providing a deep understanding of the effects of solar angle changes on retrieving AOD using GOCI.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Continuous Impervious Surface Mapping by Fusion of Landsat Time Series Data and Google Earth Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of impervious surfaces in urban areas using remote sensing with fine spatial and temporal resolutions is crucial for monitoring urban development and environmental changes in urban areas. Spatiotemporal super-resolution mapping (STSRM) fuses fine-spatial-coarse-temporal remote sensing data with coarse-spatial-fine-temporal data, allowing for urban impervious surface mapping at both fine-spatial and fine-temporal resolutions. The STSRM involves two main steps: unmixing the coarse-spatial-fine-temporal remote sensing data to class fraction images, and downscaling the fraction images to sub-pixel land cover maps. Yet, challenges exist in each step when applying STSRM in mapping impervious surfaces. First, the impervious surfaces have high spectral variability (i.e., high intra-class and low inter-class variability), which impacts the accurate extraction of sub-pixel scale impervious surface fractions. Second, downscaling the fraction images to sub-pixel land cover maps is an ill-posed problem and would bring great uncertainty and error in the predictions. This paper proposed a new Spatiotemporal Continuous Impervious Surface Mapping (STCISM) method to deal with these challenges in fusing Landsat and Google Earth imagery. The STCISM used the Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis and the Fisher Discriminant Analysis to minimize the within-class variability and maximize the between-class variability to reduce the spectral unmixing uncertainty. In addition, the STCISM adopted a new temporal consistency check model to incorporate temporal contextual information to reduce the uncertainty in the time-series impervious surface prediction maps. Unlike the traditional temporal consistency check model that assumed the impervious-to-pervious conversion is unlikely to happen, the new model allowed the bidirectional conversions between pervious and impervious surfaces. The temporal consistency check was used as a post-procession method to correct the errors in the prediction maps. The proposed STCISM method was used to predict time-series impervious surface maps at 5 m resolution of Google Earth image at the Landsat frequency. The results showed that the proposed STCISM outperformed the STSRM model without using the temporal consistency check and the STSRM model using the temporal consistency check based on the unidirectional pervious-to-impervious surface conversion rule.

TI  - Satellite-based observations of the green depressing cropping system in a farming-pastoral ecotone of northern China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The green depressing cropping system (GDCS) has existed in the farming-pastoral ecotone of northern China (FPENC) for hundreds of years. This ancient practice aims to promote an agricultural system that is both green and sustainable at the same time. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding the extent and implementation of the GDCS in China. Here we present a study that analyses GDCS fields and their related farmland use patterns in Ulanqab, China. This study takes into consideration satellite imagery, ground truth data, phenological records, and other ancillary data from 2015 to 2019 at the Ulanqab region. The integration of the former datasets, combined with visual interpretation and a random forest classification approach, successfully mapped the distribution of GDCS fields, GDCS frequencies, GDCS-crop rotation, and the determinants (terrain, irrigation) of the distribution of the GDCS practice. Our results suggest that GDCS is still prevailing and relatively widespread in Ulanqab, especially in the Houshan area, where a total of 10.29% of farmlands in the study region have adopted the practice. Cereal crops, potato, and other drought-resistant crops were the preferred previous and subsequent crops of GDCS, rather than maize and sunflowers. According to our results, 91.5% of the GDCS fields were rainfed in Ulanqab, suggesting that the practice is associated with dry farming. We also found that the practice is particularly prevalent in the fields with a steeper slope. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the importance of remote sensing towards the implementation of pilot programs that involve crop rotation and fallow systems.

TI  - Vapor Pressure Deficit and Sunlight Explain Seasonality of Leaf Phenology and Photosynthesis Across Amazonian Evergreen Broadleaved Forest
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonian evergreen forests show distinct canopy phenology and photosynthetic seasonality but the climatic triggers are not well understood. This imposes a challenge for modeling leaf phenology and photosynthesis seasonality in land surface models (LSMs) across Amazonian evergreen forest biome. On continental scale, we tested two climatic triggers suggested by site observations, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and short-wave incoming radiation (SW) for defining leaf shedding and incorporated VPD- and SW-triggered new canopy phenology modules in the ORCHIDEE LSM (hereafter VPD-AP and SW-AP versions). Our results show that both VPD and SW are plausible precursors of large scale litterfall seasonality across the basin by comparing against in situ data from 14 sites. Specially, both VPD-AP and SW-AP correctly capture the increases in litterfall during the early dry season, followed by a flush of new leaves with increasing photosynthetic rates during the later dry season. The VPD-AP version performs better than the SW-AP version in capturing a dry-season increase of photosynthesis across the wet Amazonia areas where mean annual precipitation exceeds 2,000 mm yr(-1), consistent with previous satellite data analysis. Both VPD-AP and SW-AP model versions perform well in northern, central and southern Amazon regions where the SW seasonality is unimodal, but miss the seasonality of satellite GPP proxies in the eastern region off the coast of Guyana shield where SW seasonality is bimodal. Our findings imply that atmospheric dryness and sunlight availability likely explain the seasonality of leaf shedding and leaf flush processes, respectively, and consequently control canopy photosynthesis in Amazonian evergreen forests.

TI  - Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Changes and Expansion Patterns in Mainland Chinese Urban Land between 1995 and 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - China has experienced greater and faster urbanization than any other country, and while coordinated regional development has been promoted, urbanization has also introduced various problems, such as an increased scarcity of land resources, uncontrolled demand for urban land, and disorderly development of urban fringes. Based on GIS, remote sensing data, and spatial statistics covering the period 1995-2015, this study identified the patterns, as well as spatial and temporal changes, with respect to urban land expansion in 367 mainland Chinese cities. Over this study period, the area of urban land in mainland China increased from 3.05 to 5.07 million km(2), at an average annual growth rate of 2.56%. This urban land expansion typically occurred the fastest in medium-sized cities, followed by large cities, and then small cities, with megacities and megalopolises exhibiting the slowest expansion rates. Nearly 70% of the new urban land came from arable land, 11% from other built land, such as pre-existing rural settlements, and 15% from forests and grasslands. When considering marginal-, enclave-, and infill-type expansion patterns, growth in >80% of the 367 cities surveyed was dominated by marginal expansion patterns. Marginal and enclave expansion patterns were found to be becoming more prevalent, with infill-type expansion being seen less. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis and data support for urban spatial planning, the protection of farmland, and the promotion of urban land use efficiency, and can be used as guidance for regional urbanization planning.

TI  - Exploring on the Eco-Climatic Effects of Land Use Changes in the Influence Area of the Yellow River Basin from 2000 to 2015
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yellow River is the second largest river in China, and the provinces and cities affected by the Yellow River are called the Yellow River Basin influence area. The relationship between land use and surface thermal effects in the influence area of the Yellow River Basin from 2000 to 2015 was analyzed using MODIS remote sensing data and an energy balance algorithm. The results showed that: (1) net radiation and latent heat flux both increased, and the high value areas were located in the urban expansion areas and natural and seminatural areas, respectively; (2) net surface energy intake showed a upward trend, and increased as the intensity of human influence increased, indicating that human activities had strengthed the positive trend of net surface energy intake and increased the warming effect; (3) net radiation had a greater impact on surface energy intake than latent heat flux, and this relationship was more obvious in land use types that were greatly affected by human activities. This study emphasizes the difference in energy budgets of different land use types under the influence of human activities. It provides a theoretical basis for judging the climate change trend and urban heat island effect in the influence area of the Yellow River Basin from the perspective of biogeophysics.

TI  - Object-based classification of vegetation species in a subtropical wetland using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2A images
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification of vegetation species is a fundamental technical task, necessary for the sustainable management of wetland ecosystems. GEographic-Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) and data mining have enabled classification and monitoring of wetlands with higher accuracies and lower costs. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of Random Forest (RF) and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) data mining methods in vegetation species object-based classification in a subtropical wetland, integrating Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2A images. In this work, 91.3% accuracy was reached for the object-based classification of vegetation in wetlands with the RF method, and 81.1% accuracy was reached with the k-NN method. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) features obtained the two major importances, 9.7% (VHM) and 8.9% (VVM). The optical features, red edge and the two short-wavelength infrared bands resulted in values greater than 6%. We conclude that the integration of optical satellite images and SAR, together with the use of GEOBIA and data mining, was successful in classifying vegetation classes of wetlands.

TI  - 3D SAR Speckle Offset Tracking Potential for Monitoring Landfast Ice Growth and Displacement
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the growth and displacement of landfast ice along the shoreline of the Mackenzie Delta in Northwest Territories, Canada, by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) speckle offset tracking (SPO). Three-dimensional (3D) offsets were reconstructed from Sentinel-1 ascending and descending SAR images acquired on the same dates during the November 2017-April 2018 and October 2018-May 2019 annual cycles. The analysis revealed both horizontal and vertical offsets. The annual horizontal offsets of up to similar to 8 m are interpreted as landfast ice displacements caused by wind and ocean currents. The annual vertical offsets of approximately -1 to -2 m were observed from landfast ice, which are likely due to longer radar penetration up to the ice-water interface with increasing landfast ice thickness. Numerical ice thickness model estimates supported the conclusion that the cumulative vertical negative offsets correspond to the growth of freshwater ice. Time-series analysis showed that the significant growth and displacement of landfast ice in the Mackenzie Delta occurred between November and January during the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 cycles.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate access to large-scale, high-resolution crop-type distribution maps is important for agricultural management and sustainable agricultural development. Due to the limitations of remote sensing image quality and data processing capabilities, large-scale crop classification is still challenging. This study aimed to map the distribution of crops in Heilongjiang Province using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images. We obtained Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images from all the covered study areas in the critical period for crop growth in 2018 (May to September), combined monthly composite images of reflectance bands, vegetation indices and polarization bands as input features, and then performed crop classification using a Random Forest (RF) classifier. The results show that the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 monthly composite images combined with the RF classifier can accurately generate the crop distribution map of the study area, and the overall accuracy (OA) reached 89.75%. Through experiments, we also found that the classification performance using time-series images is significantly better than that using single-period images. Compared with the use of traditional bands only (i.e., the visible and near-infrared bands), the addition of shortwave infrared bands can improve the accuracy of crop classification most significantly, followed by the addition of red-edge bands. Adding common vegetation indices and Sentinel-1 data to the crop classification improved the overall classification accuracy and the OA by 0.2 and 0.6%, respectively, compared to using only the Sentinel-2 reflectance bands. The analysis of timeliness revealed that when the July image is available, the increase in the accuracy of crop classification is the highest. When the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images for May, June, and July are available, an OA greater than 80% can be achieved. The results of this study are applicable to large-scale, high-resolution crop classification and provide key technologies for remote sensing-based crop classification in small-scale agricultural areas.

TI  - Mapping the Urban Atmospheric Carbon Stock by LiDAR and WorldView-3 Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the worsening impacts of urbanizations have been impelled to the importance of monitoring and management of existing urban trees, securing sustainable use of the available green spaces. Urban tree species identification and evaluation of their roles in atmospheric Carbon Stock (CS) are still among the prime concerns for city planners regarding initiating a convenient and easily adaptive urban green planning and management system. A detailed methodology on the urban tree carbon stock calibration and mapping was conducted in the urban area of Brussels, Belgium. A comparative analysis of the mapping outcomes was assessed to define the convenience and efficiency of two different remote sensing data sources, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and WorldView-3 (WV-3), in a unique urban area. The mapping results were validated against field estimated carbon stocks. At the initial stage, dominant tree species were identified and classified using the high-resolution WorldView3 image, leading to the final carbon stock mapping based on the dominant species. An object-based image analysis approach was employed to attain an overall accuracy (OA) of 71% during the classification of the dominant species. The field estimations of carbon stock for each plot were done utilizing an allometric model based on the field tree dendrometric data. Later based on the correlation among the field data and the variables (i.e., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI and Crown Height Model, CHM) extracted from the available remote sensing data, the carbon stock mapping and validation had been done in a GIS environment. The calibrated NDVI and CHM had been used to compute possible carbon stock in either case of the WV-3 image and LiDAR data, respectively. A comparative discussion has been introduced to bring out the issues, especially for the developing countries, where WV-3 data could be a better solution over the hardly available LiDAR data. This study could assist city planners in understanding and deciding the applicability of remote sensing data sources based on their availability and the level of expediency, ensuring a sustainable urban green management system.

TI  - A Remote Sensing Approach to Understanding Patterns of Secondary Succession in Tropical Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring biodiversity on a global scale is a major challenge for biodiversity conservation. Field assessments commonly used to assess patterns of biodiversity and habitat condition are costly, challenging, and restricted to small spatial scales. As ecosystems face increasing anthropogenic pressures, it is important that we find ways to assess patterns of biodiversity more efficiently. Remote sensing has the potential to support understanding of landscape-level ecological processes. In this study, we considered cacao agroforests at different stages of secondary succession, and primary forest in the Northern Range of Trinidad, West Indies. We assessed changes in tree biodiversity over succession using both field data, and data derived from remote sensing. We then evaluated the strengths and limitations of each method, exploring the potential for expanding field data by using remote sensing techniques to investigate landscape-level patterns of forest condition and regeneration. Remote sensing and field data provided different insights into tree species compositional changes, and patterns of alpha- and beta-diversity. The results highlight the potential of remote sensing for detecting patterns of compositional change in forests, and for expanding on field data in order to better understand landscape-level patterns of forest diversity.

TI  - Multi-Reservoir Water Quality Mapping from Remote Sensing Using Spatial Regression
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional water quality mapping is the key practical issue in environmental monitoring. Global regression models transform measured spectral image data to water quality information without the consideration of spatially varying functions. However, it is extremely difficult to find a unified mapping algorithm in multiple reservoirs and lakes. The local model of water quality mapping can estimate water quality parameters effectively in multiple reservoirs using spatial regression. Experiments indicate that both models provide fine water quality mapping in low chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration water (study area 1; root mean square error, RMSE: 0.435 and 0.413 mg m(-3) in the best global and local models), whereas the local model provides better goodness-of-fit between the observed and derived Chla concentrations, especially in high-variance Chla concentration water (study area 2; RMSE: 20.75 and 6.49 mg m(-3) in the best global and local models). In-situ water quality samples are collected and correlated with water surface reflectance derived from Sentinel-2 images. The blue-green band ratio and Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI)/Fluorescence Line Height (FLH) are feasible for estimating the Chla concentration in these waterbodies. Considering spatially-varying functions, the local model offers a robust approach for estimating the spatial patterns of Chla concentration in multiple reservoirs. The local model of water quality mapping can greatly improve the estimation accuracy in high-variance Chla concentration waters in multiple reservoirs.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Moisture Using Sentinel-1 SAR Images and Multiple Linear Regression Model Considering Antecedent Precipitations
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is to estimate soil moisture (SM) using Sentinel-1A/B C-band SAR (synthetic aperture radar) images and Multiple Linear Regression Model(MLRM) in the Yongdam-Dam watershed of South Korea. Both the Sentinel-1A and -1B images (6 days interval and 10 m resolution) were collected for 5 years from 2015 to 2019. The geometric, radiometric, and noise corrections were performed using the SNAP (SentiNel Application Platform) software and converted to backscattering coefficient of VV and VH polarization. The in-situ SM data measured at 6 locations using TDR were used to validate the estimated SM results. The 5 days antecedent precipitation data were also collected to overcome the estimation difficulty for the vegetated area not reaching the ground. The MLRM modeling was perfbrmed using yearly data and seasonal data set, and correlation analysis was performed according to the number of the independent variable. The estimated SM was verified with observed SM using the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). As a result of SM modeling using only BSC in the grass area, R-2 was 0.13 and RMSE was 4.83%. When 5 days of antecedent precipitation data was used, R-2 was 0.37 and RMSE was 4.11%. With the use of dry days and seasonal regression equation to reflect the decrease pattern and seasonal variability of SM, the correlation increased significantly with R-2 of 0.69 and RMSE of 2.88%.

TI  - Estimation of the Monthly Dynamics of Surface Water in Wetlands from Satellite and Secondary Hydro-Climatological Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellites produce valuable information for studying the surface water in wetlands, but in many cases the period covered, the spatial resolution and/or the revisit frequency is not enough to produce long historical series. In this paper we propose a novel method which uses regression models that include climatic and hydrological variables to complete the satellite information. We used this method in the Lagunas de Ruidera wetland (Spain). We approached the monthly dynamic of the surface water for a long period (1984-2015). Information from LANDSAT (30-m resolution) and MODIS (250-m resolution) satellites were tested but, due to the size of some lagoons, only the LANDSAT approach produced satisfactory results. An ensemble of regression models based on hydro-climatological explanatory variables was defined to complete the gaps in the monthly surface water. It showed a root mean squared error of around 476 pixels (0.4 Km(2)) in the cross-validation analysis. Our analysis showed that the explanatory variables with a more significant participation in the regression ensemble are the aquifer discharge, the effective precipitation and the surface water from the previous month. From January to June, the mean surface water in Lagunas de Ruidera is around 4.3 Km(2). In summer a reduction of around 13% of the surface water can be observed, which is recovered during the autumn.

TI  - Mapping Sub-Metre 3D Land-Sea Coral Reefscapes Using Superspectral WorldView-3 Satellite Stereoimagery
T2  - OCEANS-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Shallow coral reefs ensure a wide portfolio of ecosystem services, from fish provisioning to tourism, that support more than 500 million people worldwide. The protection and sustainable management of these pivotal ecosystems require fine-scale but large-extent mapping of their 3D composition. The sub-metre spaceborne imagery can neatly produce such an expected product using multispectral stereo-imagery. We built the first 3D land-sea coral reefscape mapping using the 0.3 m superspectral WorldView-3 stereo-imagery. An array of 13 land use/land cover and sea use/sea cover habitats were classified using sea-, ground- and air-truth data. The satellite-derived topography and bathymetry reached vertical accuracies of 1.11 and 0.89 m, respectively. The value added of the eight mid-infrared (MIR) channels specific to the WorldView-3 was quantified using the classification overall accuracy (OA). With no topobathymetry, the best combination included the eight-band optical (visible + near-infrared) and the MIR8, which boosted the basic blue-green-red OA by 9.58%. The classes that most benefited from this MIR information were the land use "roof" and land cover "soil" classes. The addition of the satellite-derived topobathymetry to the optical+MIR1 produced the best full combination, increasing the basic OA by 9.73%, and reinforcing the "roof" and "soil" distinction.

TI  - Remote sensing-based actual evapotranspiration assessment in a data-scarce area of Brazil: A case study of the Urucuia Aquifer System
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The large groundwater reserves of the Urucuia Aquifer System (UAS) enabled agricultural development and economic growth in the western Bahia State, in northeastern Brazil. Over the last several years, concern has grown around the aquifer's diminishing water levels, and water balance (WB) studies are in demand. Considering the lack of measured actual evapotranspiration (ETa), a major component of the water cycle, this work uses the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model to estimate ETa, and compares it to basin-scale estimates from the Soil Moisture Accounting Procedure (SMAP) monthly model and from an annual WB closure method, based on gridded meteorological data and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) product. Additionally, a comparative assessment of different versions of the SSEBop parameterization was performed. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery was used to implement eight different versions of the SSEBop algorithm over the UAS between 2000 and 2013. SSEBop and SMAP ETa yielded similar seasonal patterns, with correlation coefficient (r) up to 0.65, mean difference (MD) of 0.8 mm/month and mean absolute difference (MAD) of 18.5 mm/month. Comparison of SSEBop annual ETa estimates to annual SMAP and WB closure estimates yielded low MD (12.1 and-7.3 mm/year, respectively) and MAD (82.5 and 82.8 mm/year, respectively), but also low r values (0.00 and 0.37, respectively). The comparison of the different SSEBop versions indicated the need to incorporate a calibration step of the aerodynamic heat resistance (rah) parameter. SSEBop results were also used for land cover and drought monitoring. Analysis indicates that agriculture, associated with an increasing trend of atmospheric evaporative demand, is responsible for the decrease in groundwater levels and streamflow in the studied time period.

TI  - Artificial Neural Network Model of Soil Heat Flux over Multiple Land Covers in South America
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil heat flux (G) is an important component for the closure of the surface energy balance (SEB) and the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) by remote sensing algorithms. Over the last decades, efforts have been focused on parameterizing empirical models for G prediction, based on biophysical parameters estimated by remote sensing. However, due to the existing models' empirical nature and the restricted conditions in which they were developed, using these models in large-scale applications may lead to significant errors. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess the ability of the artificial neural network (ANN) to predict mid-morning G using extensive remote sensing and meteorological reanalysis data over a broad range of climates and land covers in South America. Surface temperature (T-s), albedo (alpha), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), obtained from a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and net radiation (R-n) from the global land data assimilation system 2.1 (GLDAS 2.1) product, were used as inputs. The ANN's predictions were validated against measurements obtained by 23 flux towers over multiple land cover types in South America, and their performance was compared to that of existing and commonly used models. The Jackson et al. (1987) and Bastiaanssen (1995) G prediction models were calibrated using the flux tower data for quadratic errors minimization. The ANN outperformed existing models, with mean absolute error (MAE) reductions of 43% and 36%, respectively. Additionally, the inclusion of land cover information as an input in the ANN reduced MAE by 22%. This study indicates that the ANN's structure is more suited for large-scale G prediction than existing models, which can potentially refine SEB fluxes and ET estimates in South America.

TI  - SAR Oil Spill Detection System through Random Forest Classifiers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A set of open-source routines capable of identifying possible oil-like spills based on two random forest classifiers were developed and tested with a Sentinel-1 SAR image dataset. The first random forest model is an ocean SAR image classifier where the labeling inputs were oil spills, biological films, rain cells, low wind regions, clean sea surface, ships, and terrain. The second one was a SAR image oil detector named "Radar Image Oil Spill Seeker (RIOSS)", which classified oil-like targets. An optimized feature space to serve as input to such classification models, both in terms of variance and computational efficiency, was developed. It involved an extensive search from 42 image attribute definitions based on their correlations and classifier-based importance estimative. This number included statistics, shape, fractal geometry, texture, and gradient-based attributes. Mixed adaptive thresholding was performed to calculate some of the features studied, returning consistent dark spot segmentation results. The selected attributes were also related to the imaged phenomena's physical aspects. This process helped us apply the attributes to a random forest, increasing our algorithm's accuracy up to 90% and its ability to generate even more reliable results.

TI  - Extent change of protected mangrove forest and its relation to wave power exposure on Aldabra Atoll
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests, vital for the conservation of biodiversity, protection of coastlines, and carbon capture, are decreasing globally at a rate higher than most other tropical forests. They are threatened by sea level rise, drought and storm surge, especially on low-lying islands where forests are directly exposed to the elements and have limited land area. We investigated changes in the spatial extent of mangroves on Aldabra Atoll, Seychelles - a protected area without direct human pressures, over 21 years using Landsat images. Over the 21-year study period, mean mangrove extent was 1283 ha with an overall net increase of 60 ha (0.23% year(-1)). The majority of extent changes were small (< 2 ha) and contiguous to the existing mangrove extent. We then assessed the relation of mangrove cover change along the lagoon coastline with wave power (rate of energy transfer by waves), using fetch measures and local wind data. We found lower wave power values for stable mangrove areas than for areas that had gained or lost mangroves from 1997 to 2018. We identified wave power thresholds of 2.3 W m(-1) for stable mangrove and 7.1 W m(-1) for mangrove occurrence. These thresholds might be valuable for assessing threats and sites with the greatest potential for mangrove restoration across similar areas worldwide. Our results highlight the importance of quantifying mangrove extent changes at a local scale to assist with planning for the protection and restoration of this ecologically important habitat, given its vulnerability to the pressures associated with climate change.

TI  - Combining simulated hyperspectral EnMAP and Landsat time series for forest aboveground biomass mapping
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is a critical measure of ecosystem structure and plays a key role in global carbon cycling. Due to its widespread availability, optical remotely sensed data are key for regional-and global scale AGB assessment, and with the planned and recent launches of spaceborne imaging spectroscopy missions such as the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP), understanding the benefit of added spectral information for AGB mapping is important. We used simulated EnMAP imagery derived from Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery acquired over Sonoma County, California, USA in combination with Landsat time series to map forest AGB. A Gaussian Process Regression model was implemented to estimate forest AGB from one-and two-date (April and June) EnMAP imagery. A lidar-based reference AGB map was used as base data for training and validation sample extraction. As a comparison, we used corresponding Landsat Best Available Pixel (BAP) composites as well as a year-long 16-day interpolated Landsat time series (TS) for 2013. EnMAP imagery was able to effectively map forest AGB, with the two-date model (RMSE = 97.5 Mg/ha) outperforming the two single date models. All EnMAP models outperformed the corresponding Landsat BAP models, the best of which was the two-date model (RMSE = 108.8 Mg/ha). The added temporal dimension of the Landsat time series resulted in the best Landsat-based AGB map (RMSE = 102.3 Mg/ha). Combining the two datasets further improved AGB mapping efforts, with 2-date EnMAP + 2013 Landsat TS providing the best overall AGB maps (RMSE = 86.0 Mg/ha). This study demonstrates not only the added value of hyperspectral imagery for forest AGB mapping, but also the possible synergies between hyperspectral and multispectral data sources and hence between spectrally and temporally dense information. It can be expected that with the next generation of spaceborne hyperspectral sensors, the combination of dense spectral and temporal data will work to further improve global efforts for mapping forest AGB from optical Earth observation data.

TI  - Evaluation of the MODIS (C6) Daily Albedo Products for Livingston Island, Antarctic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although extensive research of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo data is available on the Greenland Ice Sheet, there is a lack of studies evaluating MODIS albedo products over Antarctica. In this paper, MOD10A1, MYD10A1, and MCD43 (C6) daily albedo products were compared with the in situ albedo data on Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands (SSI), Antarctica, from 2006 to 2015, for both all-sky and clear-sky conditions, and for the entire study period and only the southern summer months. This is the first evaluation in which MYD10A1 and MCD43 are also included, which can be used to improve the accuracy of the snow BRDF/albedo modeling. The best correlation was obtained with MOD10A1 in clear-sky conditions (r = 0.7 and RMSE = 0.042). With MCD43, only data from the backup algorithm could be used, so the correlations obtained were lower (r = 0.6). However, it was found that there was no significant difference between the values obtained for all-sky and for clear-sky data. In addition, the MODIS products were found to describe the in situ data trend, with increasing albedo values in the range between 0.04 decade(-1) and 0.16 decade(-1). We conclude that MODIS daily albedo products can be applied to study the albedo in the study area.

TI  - Tropospheric Volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> Mass and Flux Retrievals from Satellite. The Etna December 2018 Eruption
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of volcanic clouds in the atmosphere affects air quality, the environment, climate, human health and aviation safety. The importance of the detection and retrieval of volcanic SO2 lies with risk mitigation as well as with the possibility of providing insights into the mechanisms that cause eruptions. Due to their intrinsic characteristics, satellite measurements have become an essential tool for volcanic monitoring. In recent years, several sensors, with different spectral, spatial and temporal resolutions, have been launched into orbit, significantly increasing the effectiveness of the estimation of the various parameters related to the state of volcanic activity. In this work, the SO2 total masses and fluxes were obtained from several satellite sounders-the geostationary (GEO) MSG-SEVIRI and the polar (LEO) Aqua/Terra-MODIS, NPP/NOAA20-VIIRS, Sentinel5p-TROPOMI, MetopA/MetopB-IASI and Aqua-AIRS-and compared to one another. As a test case, the Christmas 2018 Etna eruption was considered. The characteristics of the eruption (tropospheric with low ash content), the large amount of (simultaneously) available data and the different instrument types and SO2 columnar abundance retrieval strategies make this cross-comparison particularly relevant. Results show the higher sensitivity of TROPOMI and IASI and a general good agreement between the SO2 total masses and fluxes obtained from all the satellite instruments. The differences found are either related to inherent instrumental sensitivity or the assumed and/or calculated SO2 cloud height considered as input for the satellite retrievals. Results indicate also that, despite their low revisit time, the LEO sensors are able to provide information on SO2 flux over large time intervals. Finally, a complete error assessment on SO2 flux retrievals using SEVIRI data was realized by considering uncertainties in wind speed and SO2 abundance.

TI  - Potential of machine learning and WorldView-2 images for recognizing endangered and invasive species in the Atlantic Rainforest
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Key message We found high accuracy classification (F(measure =)95%, on cross-validation) ofAraucaria angustifolia(Bertol.) Kuntze, an endangered native species, andHovenia dulcisThunb. an aggressive, invasive alien species in WorldView-2 multispectral images. In applying machine learning algorithms, the spectral attributes mainly related to the near-infrared band were the most important for the models. Context It is difficult to classify tree species in tropical rainforests due to the high spectral response's diversity of existing species, as well as to adjust efficient machine learning techniques and orbital image resolution. Aims To explore the spectral and textural response of an endangered species (A. angustifolia) and an invasive species (H. dulcis) in WorldView-2 multispectral images, testing its recognition capability by machine learning techniques. Methods We used a WordView-2 (2016) image with 0.5-m spatial resolution. Then we manually clipped the canopy area of the two species in this image using two compositions: True color composition (R=660 nm, G=545 nm, B=480 nm) and near-infrared composition (NIR-2=950 nm, G=545 nm, B=480 nm). Thus, we applied spectral and textural descriptors (pyramid histogram of oriented gradients-PHOG and Edge Filter), which selects the most representative features of the dataset. Finally, we used artificial neural networks (ANN) and random forest (RF) for tree species classification. Results The species classification was performed with high accuracy (F-measure = 95%, on cross-validation), essentially for spectral attributes using the near-infrared composition. RF surpassed the ANN classification rates and also proved to be more stable and faster for training and testing. Conclusion The WorldView-2 multispectral sensor showed the potential to provide sufficient information for classifying two species, proving its usefulness in this phytophysiognomy where hyperspectral sensors are generally used for this type of classification.

TI  - Combined Model Color-Correction Method Utilizing External Low-Frequency Reference Signals for Large-Scale Optical Satellite Image Mosaics
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical satellites are affected by factors such as seasonal and atmospheric variation, illumination, and sensor distortion. Thus, satellite images covering large-scale area often show conspicuous color differences, resulting in poor color continuity of the mosaicked satellite image. This study proposes a novel combined model color correction (CMCC) method for high-resolution optical satellite images, which constructively combines a defogging model with a radiation correction model. First, this study analyzed the feasibility of using easily available low-resolution satellite images as external references to correct the color of high-resolution images and describes the selection criteria for external references. Second, considering the negative effects of atmosphere on the color and clarity of remote sensing images, we proposed an optical satellite image enhancement method, which is based on the content characteristics of remote sensing images and the dark channel prior defogging method. Finally, we designed a two-stage color correction process: 1) correcting the color of downsampled images via low-frequency modeling and replacement and 2) mapping the color of downsampled images to original images through local modeling and super-resolution color correction. Furthermore, this study proposes an indicator of quality considered mean absolute error (QCMAE) for quantitative evaluation of the color correction result. We selected 328 Gaofen-1 (GF-1) high-resolution images for the experiments. Visual effects and statistical results of images after being processed by the proposed CMCC are both superior to the three state-of-the-art methods, which verifies the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method.

TI  - LAI scale effect research based on compact airborne spectrographic imager data in the Heihe Oasis
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the key parameters for characterizing crop canopy structure, Leaf Area Index (LAI) has great significance in monitoring the crop growth and estimating the yield. However, due to the nonlinearity and spatial heterogeneity of LAI inversion model, there exists scale error in LAI inversion result, which limits the application of LAI product from different remote sensing data. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct studies on scale effect. This study was based on the Heihe Oasis, Zhangye city, Gansu province, China and the following works were carried out: Airborne hyperspectral CASI (Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager) image and LAI statistic models were adopted in muti-scale LAI inversion. The overall difference of muti-scale LAI inversion was analyzed in an all-round way. This was based on two aspects, "first inversion and then integration" and "first integration and then inversion", and on scale difference characteristics of three scale transformation methods. The generation mechanism of scale effect was refined, and the optimal LAI inversion model was expanded by Taylor expansion. By doing so, it quantitatively analyzed the contribution of various inversion processes to scale effect. It was found that the cubic polynomial regression model based on NDVI (940.7 nm, 712 nm) was the optimal model, where its coefficient of determination R-2 and the correlation coefficient of test samples R reached 0.72 and 0.936, respectively. Combined with Taylor expansion, it analyzed the scale error generated by LAI inversion model. After the scale effect correction of one-dimensional and two-dimensional variables, the correlation coefficient of CCD-LAI (China Environment Satellite HJ/CCD images) and CASI-LAI products (Compact Airborne Spectro graphic Imager products) increased from 0.793 to 0.875 and 0.901, respectively. The mean value, standard deviation, and relative true value of the two went consistent. Compared with one-dimensional variable correction method, the two-dimensional method had a better correction result. This research used the effective information in hyperspectral data as sub-pixels and adopted Taylor expansion to correct the scale error in large-scale and low-resolution LAI product, achieving large-scale and high-precision LAI monitoring.

TI  - Modeling-Assisted InSAR Phase-Unwrapping Method for Mapping Mine Subsidence
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared with traditional measurement technologies, synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) has unique advantages in monitoring ground subsidence due to underground mining. However, when the subsidence gradient of the subsidence trough exceeds the maximum measurable gradient of InSAR technology, the interference fringes will be too dense, causing phase aliasing. As a result, it is impossible to obtain correct phase-unwrapping result. The main objectives of this letter are two folded. First is to develop an unwrapping strategy to deal with the unwrapping problem caused by large subsidence gradient at the mine subsidence trough. The main idea of this strategy is to estimate most of the subsidence phase by multiple model inversions based on iterative approach. Then, the model phases from multiple models are combined with the final unwrapped residual phase. Another objective of this letter is to evaluate the feasibility of the three common deformation models, i.e., Mogi, probability integral method (PIM), and Okada, in solving the phase-unwrapping problem. Their advantages and disadvantages are outlined. Both the simulated data and real data are used for this experiment. The result shows that the problem of large subsidence gradient in the differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) results can be solved by multiple model inversion. Among the three models, the use of Okada model seems to provide slightly more accurate result for solving the large-scale subsidence in the mining area than the other two models with the proposed strategy.

TI  - Detection of Beta-Lactam-Resistant <i>Escherichia coli</i> and Toxigenic <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> Strains in Wild Boars Foraging in an Anthropization Gradient
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The wild boar (Sus scrofa) has been identified as a reservoir of zoonoses and food-borne pathogens. Wild boar populations are growing worldwide, also near urban centers such as Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain). The aim of this study was to assess the presence of zoonotic agents in the wild boar populations from the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (MAB). The detection of Escherichia coli carrying critical antimicrobial resistance genes to beta-lactams and, for the first time in Spain, the detection of toxigenic Clostridioides difficile strains in wild boars foraging in urban areas show the value of this game species as a sentinel of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (AMRB) and zoonotic agents in the environment. Moreover, the wild boars foraging in urban and peri-urban locations were more exposed to AMRB sources than the wild boars dwelling in natural environments. The responsible health agencies should undertake specific actions to fully assess the potential implications for the human population and/or environmental health. Zoonotic diseases and hazards beyond the compulsory surveillance diseases should be specifically targeted in the growing human-wildlife interface of urban environments such as the MAB under the One Health approach. Disease transmission among wild boars, domestic animals and humans is a public health concern, especially in areas with high wild boar densities. In this study, fecal samples of wild boars (n = 200) from different locations of the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona were analyzed by PCR to explore the frequency of beta-lactamases and extended cephalosporin and carbapenem resistance genes (ESBLs) in Escherichia coli strains and the presence of toxigenic Clostridioides difficile. The prevalence of genes conferring resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials was 8.0% (16/200): bla(CMY-2) (3.0%), bla(TEM-1b) (2.5%), bla(CTX-M-14) (1.0%), bla(SHV-28) (1.0%), bla(CTX-M-15) (0.5%) and bla(CMY-1) (0.5%). Clostridioides difficile TcdA+ was detected in two wild boars (1.0%), which is the first report of this pathogen in wild boars in Spain. Moreover, the wild boars foraging in urban and peri-urban locations were more exposed to AMRB sources than the wild boars dwelling in natural environments. In conclusion, the detection of E. coli carrying ESBL/AmpC genes and toxigenic C. difficile in wild boars foraging in urban areas reinforces the value of this game species as a sentinel of environmental AMRB sources. In addition, these wild boars can be a public and environmental health concern by disseminating AMRB and other zoonotic agents. Although this study provides the first hints of the potential anthropogenic sources of AMR, further efforts should be conducted to identify and control them.

TI  - Evaluating the Clinical Utility of Routine Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and the Value of Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Elderly Patients Diagnosed With Oestrogen Receptor Positive, Clinically Node Negative Breast Cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER-BASIC AND CLINICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) provides staging information and guides adjuvant therapy in early breast cancer (EBC). Routine SLNB in oncogeriatricians with low-risk EBC remains controversial.Aims: To evaluate axillary management in elderly patients diagnosed with oestrogen receptor positive (ER+), clinically lymph node negative (cLN-) EBC, and to assess whether SLNB affects further axillary management or adjuvant chemotherapy (ACTX) decision making.Methods: Female patients aged > 65 years, diagnosed with ER+, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HER2-), and cLN- breast cancer (BC), who underwent surgery and SLNB were included. Clinicopathological predictors of ACTX and completion axillary lymph node dissection (CALND) were determined. Kaplan-Meier analyses assessed survival outcomes.Results: A total of 253 patients were included (median age: 72 years, range: 66-90), all underwent SLNB; 50 (19.8%) had lymphatic metastasis on SLNB (SLNB+). Of these, 19 proceeded to CALND (38.0%), 10 (52.6%) of whom had further axillary disease (ALND+). 20 of the 50 SLNB+ patients received ACTX (40.0%) as did 31 of the 203 SLNB- patients (15.2%) (P < .001). Oncotype DX (ODX) testing was utilized in 82 cases (32.8%). Younger age (P < .001), SLNB+ (P < .001) and ODX score (P = .003) were all associated with ACTX prescription. ODX > 25 (OR: 4.37, 95% CI: 1.38-13.80, P = .012) independently predicted receiving ACTX. Receiving ACTX and proceeding to CALND did not improve disease-free (P = .485 and P = .345) or overall survival (P = .981 and P = .646).Conclusions: Routine SNLB may not be necessary in elderly patients diagnosed with ER+, cLN- EBC. Future oncogeriatric practice is likely to see genomic testing guiding ACTX prescription in this group.

TI  - Rapid Ecosystem Change at the Southern Limit of the Canadian Arctic, Torngat Mountains National Park
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern protected areas guard against habitat and species loss but are themselves highly vulnerable to environmental change due to their fixed spatial boundaries. In the low Arctic, Torngat Mountains National Park (TMNP) of Canada, widespread greening has recently occurred alongside warming temperatures and regional declines in caribou. Little is known, however, about how biophysical controls mediate plant responses to climate warming, and available observational data are limited in temporal and spatial scope. In this study, we investigated the drivers of land cover change for the 9700 km(2) extent of the park using satellite remote sensing and geostatistical modelling. Random forest classification was used to hindcast and simulate land cover change for four different land cover types from 1985 to 2019 with topographic and surface reflectance imagery (Landsat archive). The resulting land cover maps, in addition to topographic and biotic variables, were then used to predict where future shrub expansion is likely to occur using a binomial regression framework. Land cover hindcasts showed a 235% increase in shrub and a 105% increase in wet vegetation cover from 1985/89 to 2015/19. Shrub cover was highly persistent and displaced wet vegetation in southern, low-elevation areas, whereas wet vegetation expanded to formerly dry, mid-elevations. The predictive model identified both biotic (initial cover class, number of surrounding shrub neighbors), and topographic variables (elevation, latitude, and distance to the coast) as strong predictors of future shrub expansion. A further 51% increase in shrub cover is expected by 2039/43 relative to 2014 reference data. Establishing long-term monitoring plots within TMNP in areas where rapid vegetation change is predicted to occur will help to validate remote sensing observations and will improve our understanding of the consequences of change for biotic and abiotic components of the tundra ecosystem, including important cultural keystone species.

TI  - An Assessment of Individuals' Systems Thinking Skills via Immersive Virtual Reality Complex System Scenarios
T2  - SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study utilized the application of authentic Virtual Reality (VR) to replicate the real-world complex system scenarios of a large retail supply chain. The proposed VR scenarios were developed based on an established systems thinking instrument that consists of seven dimensions: level of complexity, independence, interaction, change, uncertainty, systems' worldview, and flexibility. However, in this study, we only developed the VR scenarios for the first dimension, level of complexity, to assess an individual's Systems Thinking Skills (STS) when he or she engages in a turbulent virtual environment. The main objective of this study was to compare a student's STS when using traditional ST instruments versus VR scenarios for the complexity dimension. The secondary aim was to investigate the efficacy of VR scenarios utilizing three measurements: Simulation Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), System Usability Scale (SUS), and Presence Questionnaire (PQ). In addition to the three measures, NASA TLX assessment was also performed to assess the perceived workload with regards to performing the tasks in VR scenarios. The results show students' preferences in the VR scenarios are not significantly different from their responses obtained using the traditional systems skills instrument. The efficacy measures confirmed that the developed VR scenarios are user friendly and lie in an acceptable region for users. Finally, the overall NASA TLX score suggests that users require 36% perceived work effort to perform the activities in VR scenarios.

TI  - Multispectral Sentinel-2 and SAR Sentinel-1 Integration for Automatic Land Cover Classification
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of land cover and land use dynamics are fundamental to understanding the radical changes that human activity is causing locally and globally and to analyse the continuous metamorphosis of landscape. In Europe, the Copernicus Program offers numerous territorial monitoring tools to users and decision makers, such as Sentinel data. This research aims at developing and implementing a land cover mapping and change detection methodology through the classification of Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data. The goal is to create a versatile and economically sustainable algorithm capable of rapidly processing large amounts of data, allowing the creation of national-scale products with high spatial resolution and update frequency for operational purposes. Great attention was paid to compatibility with the main activities planned in the near future at the national and European level. In this sense, a land cover classification system consistent with the European specifications of the EAGLE group has been adopted. The methodology involves the definition of distinct sets of decision rules for each of the land cover macro-classes and for the land cover change classes. The classification refers to pixels' spectral and backscatter characteristics, exploiting the main multi-temporal indices while proposing two new ones: the NDCI to distinguish between broad-leaved and needle-leaved trees, and the Burned Index (BI) to identify burned areas. This activity allowed for the production of a land cover map for 2018 and the change detection related to forest disturbances and land consumption for 2017-2018, reaching an overall accuracy of 83%.

TI  - Thermal Regime of Highway Embankments in the Arctic: Field Observations and Numerical Simulations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - There is limited understanding of how frozen fill compacted below freezing air temperatures affects the performance of highway embankments in the Arctic. Fill material needed to construct embankments is typically obtained from borrow sources potentially containing high ice content that makes compaction challenging. Embankment test sections along the recently constructed Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway (ITH) in the Northwest Territories, Canada, were constructed with frozen fill material and instrumented with thermistor strings to monitor temperatures at different locations within the embankment and the foundation soil. Thermal modeling was carried out using a commercially available finite-element software applying (1) thermal modifiers available from the literature and (2) available climate parameters from weather stations and satellite data for a surface energy balance model calibrated with recorded field data. Thermal model results for the 3-year monitoring period show good agreement with recorded field data for both modeling approaches. With climate change being an important consideration for embankment design, construction, and maintenance in the Arctic, climate modeling scenarios provided by the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) were used to evaluate thermal resilience under near-term and long-term conditions. The results confirm that the design of embankments and maintenance operations need to consider impacts of near-term and long-term climate change in order to maintain the thermal stability of these embankments and to provide adequate resilience against permafrost degradation.

TI  - Characterizing forest disturbances across the Argentine Dry Chaco based on Landsat time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest loss in the tropics affects large areas, but whereas full forest conversions are routinely assessed, forest degradation patters remain often unclear. This is particularly so for the world's tropical dry forests, where remote sensing of forest disturbances is challenging due to high canopy complexity, strong phenology and climate variability, and diverse degradation drivers. Here, we used the full depth of the Landsat archive and devised an approach to detect disturbances related to forest degradation across the entire Argentine Dry Chaco (about 489,000 km(2)) over a 30-year timespan. We used annual time series of different spectral indices, summarized for three seasonal windows, and applied LandTrendr to temporally segment each time series. The resulting pixellevel forest disturbance metrics then served as input for a Random Forests classification which we used to produce an area-wide disturbance map, and associated yearly area estimates of disturbed forest. Finally, we evaluated disturbance trends in relation to climate and soil conditions. Our best model produced a disturbance map with an overall accuracy of 79%, with a balanced error distribution. A total of 8% (24,877 +/- 860 km(2)) of the remaining forest in the Argentine Dry Chaco have been affected by forest disturbances between 1990 and 2017. Diverse spatial patterns of forest disturbances indicate a variety of agents driving disturbances. We also found the disturbed area to vary strongly between years, with larger areas being disturbed during drought years. Our approach shows that it is possible to robustly map forest disturbances in tropical dry forests using Landsat time series, and demonstrates the value of ensemble approaches to capture spectrally-complex and heterogeneous land-change processes. For the Chaco, a global deforestation hotspot, our analyses provide the first Landsat-based assessment of forest disturbance in remaining forests, highlighting the need to better consider such disturbances in assessments of carbon budgets and biodiversity change.

TI  - Shallow Bathymetry from Multiple Sentinel 2 Images via the Joint Estimation of Wave Celerity and Wavelength
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we present a new method called BathySent to retrieve shallow bathymetry from space that is based on the joint measurement of ocean wave celerity (c) and wavelength (lambda). We developed the method to work with Sentinel 2 data, exploiting the time lag between two Sentinel 2 spectral bands, acquired quasi-simultaneously, from a single satellite dataset. Our method was based on the linear dispersion law, which related water depth to wave celerity and wavelength: when the water depth was less than about half the dominant wavelength, the wave celerity and wavelength decreased due to decreasing water depth (h) as the waves propagated towards the coast. Instead of using a best weighted (c,lambda) fit with the linear dispersion relation to retrieve h, we proposed solving the linear dispersion relation for each (c,lambda) pair to find multiple h-values within the same resolution cell. Then, we calculated the weighted averaged h-value for each resolution cell. To improve the precision of the final bathymetric map, we stacked the bathymetry values from N-different datasets acquired from the same study area on different dates. We first tested the algorithm on a set of images representing simulated ocean waves, then we applied it to a real set of Sentinel 2 data obtained of our study area, Gavres peninsula (France, 47 degrees,67 lat.; -3 degrees 35 lon.). A comparison with in situ bathymetry yielded good results from the synthetic images (r(2) = 0.9) and promising results with the Sentinel 2 images (r(2) = 0.7) in the 0-16 m depth zone.

TI  - Convolutional Neural Networks to Estimate Dry Matter Yield in a Guineagrass Breeding Program Using UAV Remote Sensing
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forage dry matter is the main source of nutrients in the diet of ruminant animals. Thus, this trait is evaluated in most forage breeding programs with the objective of increasing the yield. Novel solutions combining unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and computer vision are crucial to increase the efficiency of forage breeding programs, to support high-throughput phenotyping (HTP), aiming to estimate parameters correlated to important traits. The main goal of this study was to propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach using UAV-RGB imagery to estimate dry matter yield traits in a guineagrass breeding program. For this, an experiment composed of 330 plots of full-sib families and checks conducted at Embrapa Beef Cattle, Brazil, was used. The image dataset was composed of images obtained with an RGB sensor embedded in a Phantom 4 PRO. The traits leaf dry matter yield (LDMY) and total dry matter yield (TDMY) were obtained by conventional agronomic methodology and considered as the ground-truth data. Different CNN architectures were analyzed, such as AlexNet, ResNeXt50, DarkNet53, and two networks proposed recently for related tasks named MaCNN and LF-CNN. Pretrained AlexNet and ResNeXt50 architectures were also studied. Ten-fold cross-validation was used for training and testing the model. Estimates of DMY traits by each CNN architecture were considered as new HTP traits to compare with real traits. Pearson correlation coefficient r between real and HTP traits ranged from 0.62 to 0.79 for LDMY and from 0.60 to 0.76 for TDMY; root square mean error (RSME) ranged from 286.24 to 366.93 kg.ha(-1) for LDMY and from 413.07 to 506.56 kg.ha(-1) for TDMY. All the CNNs generated heritable HTP traits, except LF-CNN for LDMY and AlexNet for TDMY. Genetic correlations between real and HTP traits were high but varied according to the CNN architecture. HTP trait from ResNeXt50 pretrained achieved the best results for indirect selection regardless of the dry matter trait. This demonstrates that CNNs with remote sensing data are highly promising for HTP for dry matter yield traits in forage breeding programs.

TI  - The COVID-19 Pandemic, Authoritarianism, and Rejection of Sexual Dissenters in Poland
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Poland, both, gender hierarchy restricting women's sexuality and heteronormativity are rooted in traditional "family values" supported by the teachings of the Polish Catholic Church and attached to Polish national identity. Dissenters to traditional norms regulating gender and sexual relations are rejected as a threat to social order and national unity. Latent growth curve modeling performed on data from a 3-wave longitudinal study indicated linear, interrelated increases in authoritarianism; a desire for national cohesion; and rejection of sexual dissenters in the nationally representative sample of Polish participants (N = 889) as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic unfolded in Poland. Data were collected before and during the outbreak of the pandemic allowing us to link the changes in social attitudes to this naturally occurring threat. Cross-lagged panel analysis indicated that authoritarianism predicted desire for national cohesion, which resulted in rejection of dissenters. These results are in line with theoretical models of authoritarianism as a response to threat. They are also in line with findings linking death anxiety and the threat of infectious disease to increases in authoritarianism, traditional worldview defense, in-group cohesion and sexual restrictiveness.

TI  - Aerosols optical depth and Angstrom exponent over different regions in Garhwal Himalaya, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE) are observed to be important parameters in understanding the status of ambient aerosol concentration over a particular location and depend not only upon the local but also on the large- scale dynamics of the atmosphere. The present article analyses the AOD and AE parameters retrieved with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) instruments onboard satellites, for the upper (Chamoli) and foothill (Dehradun) regions of Garhwal Himalaya in Uttarakhand, India, from 2006 to 2015. Aerosol properties are investigated at monthly, seasonal, and annual scales. The monthly mean values of MODIS-derived AOD and AE were observed to be 0.18 (+/- 0.14) and 1.05 (+/- 0.43) respectively over the Dehradun region. The seasonal maximums in AOD with MODIS and MISR were observed as 0.23 +/- 0.06 and 0.29 +/- 0.07 respectively in the pre-monsoon season, and the minimum values (0.099 +/- 0.02) were observed in the post-monsoon season, over the Dehradun region. In contrast, in the Chamoli region, the maximum AOD (MODIS) was 0.21 +/- 0.06 observed in the monsoon season and the minimum was 0.036 +/- 0.007 in the post-monsoon season. Over a decade, the AE for Chamoli and Dehradun was found to vary from 0.07 to 0.17 and from 0.14 to 0.20 respectively. The median AE for Chamoli and Dehradun was found to be 1.49 and 1.47 respectively, marking the dominance of fine mode particles of anthropogenic origin. Observations show the presence of dust and polluted dust resulting from the longrange transport from the west. The comparison of AOD values from the two sensors shows a significant correlation (0.73) with slightly higher values from MISR over the year. The results obtained are important in understanding the climatic implications due to the atmospheric aerosols over the abovementioned Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, India.

TI  - Evaluating the Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio for Assessing Fire Severity Using Sentinel-2 Imagery in Northeast Siberian Larch Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire severity is a key fire regime characteristic with high ecological and carbon cycle relevance. Prior studies on boreal forest fires primarily focused on mapping severity in North American boreal forests. However, the dominant tree species and their impacts on fire regimes are different between North American and Siberian boreal forests. Here, we used Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to test the potential for using the most common spectral index for assessing fire severity, the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), over two fire scars and 37 field plots in Northeast Siberian larch-dominated (Larix cajanderi) forests. These field plots were sampled into two different forest types: (1) dense young stands and (2) open mature stands. For this evaluation, the dNBR was compared to field measurements of the Geometrically structured Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI) and burn depth. We found a linear relationship between dNBR and GeoCBI using data from all forest types (R-2 = 0.42, p < 0.001). The dNBR performed better to predict GeoCBI in open mature larch plots (R-2 = 0.56, p < 0.001). The GeoCBI provides a holistic field assessment of fire severity yet is dominated by the effect of fire on vegetation. No significant relationships were found between GeoCBI components (overall and substrate stratum) and burn depth within our fires (p > 0.05 in all cases). However, the dNBR showed some potential as a predictor for burn depth, especially in the dense larch forests (R-2 = 0.63, p < 0.001). In line with previous studies in boreal North America, the dNBR correlated reasonably well with field data of aboveground fire severity and showed some skills as a predictor of burn depth. More research is needed to refine spaceborne fire severity assessments in the larch forests of Northeast Siberia, including assessments of additional fire scars and integration of dNBR with other geospatial proxies of fire severity.

TI  - Economic and disease burden of Japanese encephalitis in Zhejiang Province, 2013-2018
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundJapanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne disease and associated with high mortality and disability rate among symptomatic cases. In the absence of local data, this study estimated the economic burden and the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to JE in Zhejiang Province, China during 2013-2018, to increase disease awareness and provide evidence for effective health policy.Methodology/Principle findingsWe merged multiple data sources, including National Notifiable Disease Registry System (NNDRS), patient interviews and medical records from corresponding hospitals for JE cases which occurred during 2013-2018 in Zhejiang Province. Direct costs were extracted from hospitals' billing systems and patient interviews. Indirect costs and disease burden were calculated based on questionnaire survey from patient interviews and follow-up assessment by general practitioners. Given under-reporting, an expansion factor (EF) was applied to extrapolate the JE burden to the provincial level. The total economic burden of JE during 2013-2018 was estimated at US $12.01 million with an EF = 3. Of this, $8.32 million was due to direct economic cost and $3.69 million to indirect cost. The disease burden of JE was 42.75 DALYs per million population (28.44 YLD, 14.28 YLL) according to the 1990 Global Burden of Disease (GBD 1990) methodology and 80.01 DALYs (53.67YLD, 26.34YLL) according to the GBD 2010 methodology. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the overall economic burden varied from US$ 1.73-36.42 million. The greatest variation was due to the prognosis of illness (-85.57%-203.17%), followed by occupation (-34.07%134.12%) and age (-72.97%-47.69%).Conclusions/SignificanceJE imposes a heavy burden for families and society in Zhejiang Province. This study provides comprehensive empirical estimates of JE burden to increase awareness and strengthen knowledge of the public. These data may support provincial level public health decision making for prevention and control of JE. Ongoing surveillance for acute meningitis and encephalitis syndrome (AEMS) in sentinel hospitals, is needed to further refine estimates of JE burden.

TI  - Biological Early Warning Systems: The Experience in the Gran Sasso-Sirente Aquifer
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological early warning systems (BEWS) are installed worldwide for the continuous control of water intended for multiple uses. Sentinel aquatic organisms can alert us to contaminant presence through their physiological or behavioural alterations. The present study is aimed at sharing the experience acquired with water biomonitoring of the Gran Sasso-Sirente (GS-S) aquifer. It represents the major source of the Abruzzi region surface water, also intended as drinkable and for irrigation use. Besides the biomonitoring of drinkable water of the Teramo Province made by Daphnia Toximeter and irrigation water of the L'Aquila Province by Algae Toximeter, a novel sensor named "SmartShell" has been developed to register the behaviour of the "pea clam" P. casertanum, an autochthonous small bivalve living in the Nature 2000 site "Tirino River spring". The valve movements have been recorded directly on the field. Its behavioural rhythms have been analysed through spectral analyses, providing the basis for further investigations on their alterations as early warnings and allowing us to propose this autochthonous bivalve species as a novel sentinel organism for spring water.

TI  - Mapping Croplands in the Granary of the Tibetan Plateau Using All Available Landsat Imagery, A Phenology-Based Approach, and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as "The Roof of World", has expansive alpine grasslands and is a hotspot for climate change studies. However, cropland expansion and increasing anthropogenic activities have been poorly documented, let alone the effects of agricultural activities on food security and environmental change in the TP. The existing cropland mapping products do not depict the spatiotemporal characteristics of the TP due to low accuracies and inconsistent cropland distribution, which is affected by complicated topography and impedes our understanding of cropland expansion and its associated environmental impacts. One of the biggest challenges of cropland mapping in the TP is the diverse crop phenology across a wide range of elevations. To decrease the classification errors due to elevational differences in crop phenology, we developed two pixel- and phenology-based algorithms to map croplands using Landsat imagery and the Google Earth Engine platform along the Brahmaputra River and its two tributaries (BRTT) in the Tibet Autonomous Region, also known as the granary of TP, in 2015-2019. Our first phenology-based cropland mapping algorithm (PCM1) used different thresholds of land surface water index (LSWI) by considering varied crop phenology along different elevations. The second algorithm (PCM2) further offsets the phenological discrepancy along elevational gradients by considering the length and peak of the growing season. We found that PCM2 had a higher accuracy with fewer images compared with PCM1. The number of images for PCM2 was 279 less than PCM1, and the Matthews correlation coefficient for PCM2 was 0.036 higher than PCM1. We also found that the cropland area in BRTT was estimated to be 1979 +/- 52 km(2) in the late 2010s. Croplands were mainly distributed in the BRTT basins with elevations of 3800-4000 m asl. Our phenology-based methods were effective for mapping croplands in mountainous areas. The spatially explicit information on cropland area and distribution in the TP aid future research into the effects of cropland expansion on food security and environmental change in the TP.

TI  - Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo) Methods Implemented as ArcMap Models with Remote-Sensed and Ground-Based Inputs, Examined along with MODIS ET, for Peloponnese, Greece
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study develops ArcMap models to implement the following three methods: FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (FAO PM), Hargreaves-Samani (HS) and Hansen, with the former used as a reference. Moreover, three models implementing statistical indices (RMSD, MB, NMB) are also created. The purpose is threefold, as follows: to investigate the variability in the daily mean reference evapotranspiration (ETo) for the Decembers and Augusts during 2016-2019, over Peloponnese, Greece. Furthermore, to investigate the agreement between the methods' ETo estimates, and examine the former along with MODIS ET (daily) averaged products. The study area is a complex Mediterranean area. Meteorological data from sixty-two stations under the National Observatory of Athens (NOA), and MODIS Terra LST products, have been employed. FAO PM is found sensitive to wind speed and depicts interactions among climate parameters (T, evaporative demand and water availability) in the frame of climate change. The years 2016-2019 are four of the warmest since the preindustrial era. Hargreaves-Samani's estimations for the Decembers of 2016-2019 were almost identical to MODIS ET, despite their different physical meaning. However, for the Augusts there are considerable discrepancies between the methods' and MODIS's estimates, attributed to the higher evaporative demand in the summertime. The GIS models are accurate, reliable, time-saving, and adjustable to any study area.

Combined with Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology, spatial analysis technology of geographic information system and contribution rate method, the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics, influencing factors, and the contribution rate of each factor to land subsidence along the Lunan high-speed railway from 2016 to 2018 were researched. The accuracy of subsidence results by InSAR monitoring was verified by the linear fitting method and root mean square error method. The influence of uneven subsidence on linear engineering was discussed based on the evaluation results of subsidence gradient zoning. The results indicate that the maximum accumulated subsidence along the Lunan high-speed railway is 499 mm. Multiple subsidence center areas have been formed in the study area, with the maximum subsidence rate exceeding -55 mm/yr. The maximum subsidence gradient and curvature radius of the Lunan high-speed railway meet the requirements of line smoothness when the train speed is 350 km/h. The coal mining, compressible layer thickness, and changes in groundwater level are positively correlated with land subsidence, the total contribution rate to land subsidence is more than 90%. The research results provide scientific support for the prevention and control of land subsidence along the linear engineering.

TI  - Sentinel-1 and 2 Time-Series for Vegetation Mapping Using Random Forest Classification: A Case Study of Northern Croatia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-cover (LC) mapping in a morphologically heterogeneous landscape area is a challenging task since various LC classes (e.g., crop types in agricultural areas) are spectrally similar. Most research is still mostly relying on optical satellite imagery for these tasks, whereas synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is often neglected. Therefore, this research assessed the classification accuracy using the recent Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR and Sentinel-2 (S2) time-series data for LC mapping, especially vegetation classes. Additionally, ancillary data, such as texture features, spectral indices from S1 and S2, respectively, as well as digital elevation model (DEM), were used in different classification scenarios. Random Forest (RF) was used for classification tasks using a proposed hybrid reference dataset derived from European Land Use and Coverage Area Frame Survey (LUCAS), CORINE, and Land Parcel Identification Systems (LPIS) LC database. Based on the RF variable selection using Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA), the combination of S1 and S2 data yielded the highest overall accuracy (OA) of 91.78%, with a total disagreement of 8.22%. The most pertinent features for vegetation mapping were GLCM Mean and Variance for S1, NDVI, along with Red and SWIR band for S2, whereas the digital elevation model produced major classification enhancement as an input feature. The results of this study demonstrated that the aforementioned approach (i.e., RF using a hybrid reference dataset) is well-suited for vegetation mapping using Sentinel imagery, which can be applied for large-scale LC classifications.

TI  - Time Series InSAR Three-Dimensional Displacement Inversion Model of Coal Mining Areas Based on Symmetrical Features of Mining Subsidence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The three-dimensional (3-D) displacements of mining areas is the basis of studying the mining subsidence law and obtaining surface movement parameters. The traditional multi-temporal interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology can only obtain the surface deformation in line-of-sight (LOS) direction, even if some methods can obtain the 3-D displacements of mining area based on InSAR. However, it has high data requirements for data types, which are not conducive to the inversion of 3-D displacements. In this paper, the symmetry of the surface basin caused by mining subsidence under different mining degrees is analyzed. According to the basic symmetrical features of mining subsidence-that the surface vertical displacement and horizontal displacement in near horizontal coal seam is symmetrical with respect to the main section of the basin, combined with time series InSAR technology (TS-InSAR)-a novel method for retrieving the 3-D displacement results from a single-geometry InSAR dataset based on symmetrical features (hereafter referred to as the SGI-SF method) is proposed. The SGI-SF method first generates multi-temporal observations of LOS displacement from a single-geometry InSAR dataset, and then transforms them into multi-temporal observations of 3-D displacement datasets according to symmetrical features. There is no necessity to obtain the surface movement parameters from the measured data to calculate 3-D displacement fields. Finally, the time series of 3-D displacements are estimated from multi-temporal 3-D displacements using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method. Nine descending Sentinel-1 images from the Yulin mining area of China are used to test the proposed SGI-SF method. The results show that the average root mean square errors (RMSE) in the vertical and horizontal direction of the three-dimensional deformations are approximately 9.28 mm and 13.10 mm, respectively, which are much smaller than mining-induced displacements and can provide support for deformation monitoring in mining areas.

TI  - Spectral-Spatial Weighted Kernel Manifold Embedded Distribution Alignment for Remote Sensing Image Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature distortions of data are a typical problem in remote sensing image classification, especially in the area of transfer learning. In addition, many transfer learning-based methods only focus on spectral information and fail to utilize spatial information of remote sensing images. To tackle these problems, we propose spectral-spatial weighted kernel manifold embedded distribution alignment (SSWK-MEDA) for remote sensing image classification. The proposed method applies a novel spatial information filter to effectively use similarity between nearby sample pixels and avoid the influence of nonsample pixels. Then, a complex kernel combining spatial kernel and spectral kernel with different weights is constructed to adaptively balance the relative importance of spectral and spatial information of the remote sensing image. Finally, we utilize the geometric structure of features in manifold space to solve the problem of feature distortions of remote sensing data in transfer learning scenarios. SSWK-MEDA provides a novel approach for the combination of transfer learning and remote sensing image characteristics. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method is more effective than several state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Global-Scale Consistency of Spaceborne Vegetation Indices, Chlorophyll Fluorescence, and Photosynthesis
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The new TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data provides new opportunities to corroborate and improve global photosynthesis estimates. Here we report the spatiotemporal consistency between TROPOMI SIF and vegetation indices from the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) adjusted (MCD43) and standard MODIS (MOD09) surface reflectance products, estimates of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation by chlorophyll (APAR(chl)) derived from National Centers for Environmental Prediction Reanalysis-2 (NCEP2), MODIS MCD18, and European Reanalysis (ERA5) data, and two GPP products (GPP(VPM) and GPP(MOD17)). We find (a) non-adjusted VIs were more highly correlated with SIF at mid and high latitude than BRDF-adjusted VIs, but were less correlated in the tropics, (b) negligible differences in the correlation between SIF and non-adjusted NIRv and EVI, but BRDF-adjusted NIRv had higher correlations with SIF at mid to high latitude than BRDF-adjusted EVI but lower correlations in the tropics, (c) choice of PAR data set likely to cause substantial differences in global and regional GPP estimates and the correlation between modeled GPP and SIF, (d) SIF was more highly correlated with APAR(chl) at high to mid latitude than EVI but more highly correlated with EVI at lower latitudes, and (e) GPP(VPM) is more highly correlated with SIF than GPP(MOD17), except in sub-Sahara Africa. Our results highlight that spaceborne photosynthesis would likely be improved by using a non-linear response to PAR and that the fundamental differences between the vegetation indices and PAR data sets are likely to yield important differences in global and regional estimates of photosynthesis.

TI  - On the Abundance and Common Properties of Continental, Organized Shallow (Green) Clouds
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Warm convective clouds play a significant role in the earth's energy and water budgets. However, they still pose a challenge in climate research as their feedback to predicted thermodynamic changes is highly uncertain and considered critical to the overall climate system's response. The focus of this study is continental, organized shallow convective clouds that, although they are spread globally and form in a variety of environments, seem to have common properties. One of these properties seems to be their preferred formation over vegetated areas, thus referred hereafter as green Cu. In this article, we present new observations of emerging universality and explore them using a method that combines fine- and coarse-resolution remote-sensing data sets. First, we use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) true-color images to visually classify cloud fields into different classes and identify green Cu fields. We show that the level and type of organization and the properties of these fields (e.g., cloud size distribution and cloud fraction) are similar throughout the world, regardless of their location. Second, we match the corresponding MODIS level-3 cloud properties to the identified cloud classes, and based on this data sets statistics, we develop a detection method for green Cu along ten years of measurements (2003-2012). We examine the geographical distribution and seasonality of this class and show that these fields are highly abundant over many continental areas and indeed mostly in the vicinity of vegetated regions.

TI  - Monitoring the Spatiotemporal Difference in Glacier Elevation on Bogda Mountain from 2000 to 2017
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The difference in glacier surface elevation is a sensitive indicator of climate change and is also important for disaster warning and water supply. In this paper, 25 glaciers on Bogda Mountain, in the eastern Tianshan Mountains, are selected as the study object as they are typical of glaciers in arid or semi-arid areas with importance for water supply. The Repeat Orbit Interferometry (ROI) method is used to survey the surface elevation of these glaciers using Sentinel-1A Radar data from 2017. Using data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), the difference in the glacier surface elevation between 2000 and 2017 is obtained. A scheme to evaluate the accuracy of estimated variations in glacier surface elevation is proposed in this article. By considering the surfaces of lakes in the study region as ideal horizontal planes, the average standard deviation (SD) value of the lake elevation is taken as the error caused by the radar sensor and observing conditions. The SD of the lake elevation is used as an index to evaluate the error in the estimated variation of the glacier surface elevation, and the obtained SD values indicate that the result obtained using the ROI method is reliable. Additionally, the glacier surface elevation variation pattern and a Logarithmic Fitting Model (LFM) are used to reduce the error in high-altitude glacial accumulation areas to improve the estimation of the difference in the glacier surface elevation obtained using ROI. The average SD of the elevation of the 12 lakes is +/- 2.87 m, which shows that the obtained glacier surface elevations are reliable. This article concludes that, between 2000 and 2017, the surface elevation of glaciers on Bogda Mountain decreased by an average of 11.6 +/- 1.3 m, corresponding to an average decrease rate of 0.68 m/a, and glaciers volume decreased by an average of 0.504 km(3). Meanwhile, the surface elevations of the lakes increased by an average of 8.16 m. The decrease of glacier surface elevation leads to the expansion of glacial lakes. From the north slope clockwise to the south slope, the glacier elevation variation showed a decreasing trend, and the elevation variation gradually increased from the south slope to the north slope. With the increase of glacier altitude, the variation of glacier surface elevation gradually changed from negative to positive. The findings of this article suggest that the rate of glacier retreat on Bogda Mountain increased from 2000 to 2017.

TI  - Investigation of deformation patterns by DS-InSAR in a coal resource-exhausted region with spaceborne SAR imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES-X
M3  - Article
AB  - Along with the impact of energy structure adjustment as well as the coal resource exhaustion in the old mining region, the deformation over the abandoned mine region has severely restricted both the reuse of abandoned lands and the sustainable urban development. Therefore, it is essential to conduct the long-term surface deformation observation in the abandoned coal region. In order to overcome the incoherence factors influencing performance of the traditional InSAR time series technique, the new InSAR time series approach integrating the distributed scatter targets (DS) was presented and applied in observation and analysis of surface deformation characteristics in coal resource exhaustion region. With the help of DS identification and corresponding phase optimization, the number of measurement points (MPs) increase from 92,539 to 781,364 in Peibei coal region with Sentinel-1 TOPS imagery, which make up for the deficiency caused by the uneven distribution of few points. Compared to the traditional TS-InSAR method, DS-InSAR results could efficiently improve the deformation identification ability with high reliability in coal regions. The monitoring result reveals that the surface became steady gradually along with the underground mining activities stop, but there is still some instability over the closed goaf because of the unstability of coal pillar and the improving surface loads. Thus the long-term surface monitoring should be carried out in old coal region, and the DS-InSAR would provide an efficient and reliable technical support for surface stability investigation in coal resource exhausted region.

TI  - Simulating Imaging Spectroscopy in Tropical Forest with 3D Radiative Transfer Modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing can contribute to biodiversity monitoring and species composition mapping in tropical forests. Inferring ecological information from canopy reflectance is complex and data availability suitable to such a task is limiting, which makes simulation tools particularly important in this context. We explored the capability of the 3D radiative transfer model DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) to simulate top of canopy reflectance acquired with airborne imaging spectroscopy in a complex tropical forest, and to reproduce spectral dissimilarity within and among species, as well as species discrimination based on spectral information. We focused on two factors contributing to these canopy reflectance properties: the horizontal variability in leaf optical properties (LOP) and the fraction of non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPVf). The variability in LOP was induced by changes in leaf pigment content, and defined for each pixel based on a hybrid approach combining radiative transfer modeling and spectral indices. The influence of LOP variability on simulated reflectance was tested by considering variability at species, individual tree crown and pixel level. We incorporated NPVf into simulations following two approaches, either considering NPVf as a part of wood area density in each voxel or using leaf brown pigments. We validated the different scenarios by comparing simulated scenes with experimental airborne imaging spectroscopy using statistical metrics, spectral dissimilarity (within crowns, within species, and among species dissimilarity) and supervised classification for species discrimination. The simulation of NPVf based on leaf brown pigments resulted in the closest match between measured and simulated canopy reflectance. The definition of LOP at pixel level resulted in conservation of the spectral dissimilarity and expected performances for species discrimination. Therefore, we recommend future research on forest biodiversity using physical modeling of remote-sensing data to account for LOP variability within crowns and species. Our simulation framework could contribute to better understanding of performances of species discrimination and the relationship between spectral variations and taxonomic and functional dimensions of biodiversity. This work contributes to the improved integration of physical modeling tools for applications, focusing on remotely sensed monitoring of biodiversity in complex ecosystems, for current sensors, and for the preparation of future multispectral and hyperspectral satellite missions.

TI  - Assessment of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) for Snowfall Retrieval in High Latitudes Using <i>CloudSat</i> and Machine Learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation retrieval is a challenging topic, especially in high latitudes (HL), and current precipitation products face ample challenges over these regions. This study investigates the potential of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) for snowfall retrieval in HL using CloudSat radar information and machine learning (ML). With all the known limitations, AVHRR observations should be considered for HL snowfall retrieval because 1) AVHRR data have been continuously collected for about four decades on multiple platforms with global coverage, and similar observations will likely continue in the future; 2) current passive microwave satellite precipitation products have several issues over snow and ice surfaces; and 3) good coincident observations between AVHRR and CloudSat are available for training ML algorithms. Using ML, snowfall rate was retrieved from AVHRR's brightness temperature and cloud probability, as well as auxiliary information provided by numerical reanalysis. The results indicate that the ML-based retrieval algorithm is capable of detection and estimation of snowfall with comparable or better statistical scores than those obtained from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and two passive microwave sensors contributing to the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission constellation. The outcomes also suggest that AVHRR-based snowfall retrievals are spatially and temporally reasonable and can be considered as a quantitatively useful input to the merged precipitation products that require frequent sampling or long-term records.

TI  - Comparison of Aerosol Optical Depth from MODIS Product Collection 6.1 and AERONET in the Western United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent observations reveal that dust storms are increasing in the western USA, posing imminent risks to public health, safety, and the economy. Much of the observational evidence has been obtained from ground-based platforms and the visual interpretation of satellite imagery from limited regions. Comprehensive satellite-based observations of long-term aerosol records are still lacking. In an effort to develop such a satellite aerosol dataset, we compared and evaluated the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from Deep Blue (DB) and Dark Target (DT) product collection 6.1 with the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) program in the western USA. We examined the seasonal and monthly average number of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua DB AOD retrievals per 0.1 circle x 0.1 circle from January 2003 to December 2017 across the region's different topographic, climatic, and land cover conditions. The number of retrievals in the southwest United States was on average greater than 37 days per 90 days for all seasons except summer. Springtime saw the highest number of AOD retrievals across the southwest, consistent with the peak season for synoptic-scale dust events. The majority of Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas showed the lowest number of retrievals during the monsoon season. The majority of collocating domains of AOD from the Aqua sensor showed a better correlation with AERONET AOD than AOD from Terra, and the correlation coefficients exhibited large regional variability across the study area. The correlation coefficient between the couplings Aqua DB AOD-AERONET AOD and Terra DB AOD-AERONET AOD ranges from 0.1 to 0.94 and 0.001 to 0.94, respectively. In the majority of the sites that exhibited less than a 0.6 correlation coefficient and few matched data points at the nearest single pixel, the correlations gradually improved when the spatial domain increased to a 50 km x 50 km box averaging domain. In general, the majority of the stations revealed significant correlation between MODIS and AERONET AOD at all spatiotemporal aggregating domains, although MODIS generally overestimated AOD compared to AERONET. However, the correlation coefficient in the southwest United States was the lowest and in stations from a higher latitude was the highest. The difference in the brightness of the land surface and the latitudinal differences in the aerosol inputs from the forest fires and solar zenith angles are some of the factors that manifested the latitudinal correlation differences.

AB  - Spatiotemporal environmental changes lead to disturbances in wild plant habitats, particularly in regions characterized by changeable land use and cover. The present study aims to characterize wild plant habitats in the River Nile region of Dakahlia Governorate using a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating remote sensing, GIS and sampling analyses. Twenty-four stands representing the wild plant habitats in the River Nile region were geographically identified, sampled and analyzed. Water and soil samples were investigated for physical and chemical characteristics. Two calibrated multispectral Landsat images dated 1999 and 2019 were processed to produce LULC, NDSI, NDMI and NDSI to characterize wild plan habitats. The floristic composition showed the presence of 64 species belonging to 53 genera and 28 families. Ecologically, the recorded plant species in the present work can be classified into four main categories, which are separated into three communities according to the TWINSPAN classification. Results showed that the annual loss of agricultural lands (3.98 km(2)) is closely relevant to the annual expansion of urban areas (4.24 km(2)). Although the uncontrolled urban sprawl caused loss of agricultural lands, it leads to the expansion of wild plant habitats, represented mainly by the sparse class and partially by the moderately dense class as obtained from NDVI. The increase in mean values of the moisture (NDMI) from 0.034 in 1999 to 0.64 in 2019 may have arisen from the increase in total areas of wild plant habitats during the investigated period (1999-2019). This might increase the suitability of conditions for wild habitats which induces the proliferation of natural plants.

TI  - Mapping hydrothermal alteration zones using ASTER images in the Arabian-Nubian Shield: A case study of the northwestern Allaqi District, South Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES-X
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to map and differentiate ore-bearing hydrothermal alteration zones at the northwestern part of AllaqiHeiani, we use a combined method of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) image processing, field relationship, mineralogical features, and rock chemical compositions. Hydrothermal alteration zones are identified on the basis of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer data. Propylitic, phyllic, argillic, and silicification zones are recorded in different types of igneous and metamorphic rocks typically with chromite, goethite, ilmenite, galena and gold. Crosta and CEN techniques using ASTER are successfully applied to highlight the hydrothermal alteration zones and the structural elements represented by lithologic contacts and faults/fracture zones. Combining data of lineaments, alteration zones and ore mineralogy studied after obtaining a consequence of each map allowed predicting and mapping areas of probable high mineral resources. According to petrographic and remote sensing studies, types of alteration include sericitization, chloritization, epidotization, kaolinitization, carbonatization and silicification. The results of remote sensing in the study area are confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), petrography, and SEM. In the studied district, there are ophiolitic ultramafic rocks, island-arc assemblage of metasediments, volcaniclastics and metagabbro-diorite, syntectonic granite and dykes. Accordingly, to the present study can identify the most potential areas of mineralization taking us into consideration the overlapping of high lineament density areas with abundant alterations.

TI  - Regional Mapping of Groundwater Potential in Ar Rub Al Khali, Arabian Peninsula Using the Classification and Regression Trees Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of groundwater potential in remote arid and semi-arid regions underneath sand sheets over a very regional scale is a challenge and requires an accurate classifier. The Classification and Regression Trees (CART) model is a robust machine learning classifier used in groundwater potential mapping over a very regional scale. Ten essential groundwater conditioning factors (GWCFs) were constructed using remote sensing data. The spatial relationship between these conditioning factors and the observed groundwater wells locations was optimized and identified by using the chi-square method. A total of 185 groundwater well locations were randomly divided into 129 (70%) for training the model and 56 (30%) for validation. The model was applied for groundwater potential mapping by using optimal parameters values for additive trees were 186, the value for the learning rate was 0.1, and the maximum size of the tree was five. The validation result demonstrated that the area under the curve (AUC) of the CART was 0.920, which represents a predictive accuracy of 92%. The resulting map demonstrated that the depressions of Mondafan, Khujaymah and Wajid Mutaridah depression and the southern gulf salt basin (SGSB) near Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) borders reserve fresh fossil groundwater as indicated from the observed lakes and recovered paleolakes. The proposed model and the new maps are effective at enhancing the mapping of groundwater potential over a very regional scale obtained using machine learning algorithms, which are used rarely in the literature and can be applied to the Sahara and the Kalahari Desert.

TI  - A Seasonal-Window Ensemble-Based Thresholding Technique Used to Detect Active Fires in Geostationary Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article introduces a new algorithm to detect active fires in geostationary remotely sensed data. The algorithm calculated dynamic statistical multispectral thresholds based on, and sensitive to, biogeographical region, subseason, and time-of-day. The spectral characteristics of nonfire and noncloud mid-infrared values were found to vary with biogeographical region, subseason, and time-of-day. These differences were exploited to define a new seasonal Biogeographical Region and Individual Geostationary HHMMSS Threshold (BRIGHT) multivariate adaptive threshold geostationary satellite fire anomaly algorithm. The algorithm was demonstrated on 12 months of daytime data acquired from the geostationary satellite system, the Advanced Himawari Imager (on Himawari-8) over Australia (7.69 million km(2)). The resulting hotspots were compared with those from the existing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) polar-orbiting fire-hotspot algorithm. The intercomparison showed that BRIGHT wildfire hotspots, detected using Himawari-8 and Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation of Australia (IBRA) data, were also detected by MODIS polar-orbiting fire hotspots 88% of the time. While MODIS hotspots were detected by BRIGHT hotspots only 39% of the time; the majority of the undetected MODIS hotspots had low radiative power. BRIGHT provides a new method for the remote sensing of active fires providing reliable observations at spatial and temporal scales useful for fire managers.

TI  - Enhanced Long-term and Snow-based Streamflow Forecasting by Artificial Intelligent Methods Using Satellite Imagery and Seasonal Information
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the simultaneous use of in-situ hydrologic measurements in combination with two different artificial intelligent (AI) methods, namely, Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), for developing enhanced long-term streamflow forecasting models. To enhance the reliability of the proposed models' outputs, a sub-basin method using the regionalization approach is proposed. Furthermore, to accelerate the training process and achieve more accurate handling of seasonal changes, a parameter representing seasonal variations is introduced. The models are applied to the mountainous Talezang basin, southwestern Iran, for which there is a 14-year series of monthly in-situ data records and snow cover area data obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The results indicate that the use of the sub-basin approach significantly improves both AI methods' performances. Moreover, it is deduced that the use of seasonal information and satellite data has a great impact on the model performance and accuracy. Comparing the long-term flow forecasts of both models showed that the ANFIS model is superior to the ANN.

TI  - Spatially Weighted Estimation of Broadacre Crop Growth Improves Gap-Filling of Landsat NDVI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal climate is the main driver of crop growth and yield in broadacre grain cropping systems. With a 40-year record of 30 m resolution images and 16-day revisits, the Landsat satellite series is ideal for producing long-term records of remotely sensed phenology to build understanding of how climate affects crop growth. However, the time-series of Landsat images exhibits gaps caused by cloud cover, which is common in wet periods when crops reach maximum growth. We propose a novel spatial-temporal approach to gap-filling that avoids data fusion. Crop growth curve estimation is used to perform temporal smoothing and incorporation of spatial weights allows spatial smoothing. We tested our approach using Landsat NDVI data acquired for an 8000 ha study area in Western Australia using a train/test approach where 157 available Landsat-7 images between 2013 and 2019 were used to train the model, and 95 at least 80% cloud-free Landsat-8 images from the same period were used to test its performance. We found that compared to nonspatial estimation, use of spatial weights in growth curve estimation improved correlation between observed and predicted NDVI by 75%, MAE by 31% and RMSE by 75%. For cropland, the correlation is improved by 58%, the MAE by 36% and the RMSE by 76%. We conclude that spatially weighted estimation of crop growth curves can be used to fill spatial and temporal gaps in Landsat NDVI for the purpose of within-field monitoring. Our approach is also applicable to other data sources and vegetation indices.

TI  - Trends for rotavirus acute gastroenteritis in children under 5 years old before and after vaccine introduction, Morocco, 2006-2014
T2  - EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN HEALTH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In Morocco, acute gastroenteritis in children is a public health issue. Since 1987, several strategies have been conducted to reduce its burden by the Moroccan Ministry of Health, including the introduction of the anti-rotavirus vaccine into the national immunization programme in 2010.Aims: To evaluate the impact of the anti-rotavirus vaccine in outpatients and inpatients with acute gastroenteritis under 5 years old.Methods: We conducted descriptive studies and a retrospective cohort study using data from the hospital's sentinel surveillance system and the national ambulatory surveillance registry for acute gastroenteritis from 2006 to 2014. This include the period before and after the implementation of the rotavirus (RV) vaccine on children under age 5 years.Results: The decrease in acute gastroenteritis cases was about 5.2%, mainly among children aged 0-11 months. The proportion of acute RV gastroenteritis (RVGE) decreased from 37.0% to 31.1% after the vaccine's introduction; it was statistically significant among the children aged 0-11 months (38.8% to 28.1%; P = 0.009). The proportion of RVGE among inpatients decreased from 97.0% to 91.7% (P = 0.022). Diarrheal disease cases without dehydration increased from 7.8% to 11.1% (P < 0.001); RVGE was 2.3 times more frequent among unvaccinated children. The vaccine effectiveness was estimated at 57%. The proportion of G1P[8] genotype infections decreased after the introduction of the RV vaccine (56% to 40%; P < 0.001), while the G2P[4] genotype became more frequent (13% to 21%; P = 0.015).Conclusions: The introduction of the RV vaccination into the national immunization programme in Morocco has allowed significant reduction in the incidence and severity of RVGE among children under 5 years old.

TI  - Machine Learning Estimation of Fire Arrival Time from Level-2 Active Fires Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Producing high-resolution near-real-time forecasts of fire behavior and smoke impact that are useful for fire and air quality management requires accurate initialization of the fire location. One common representation of the fire progression is through the fire arrival time, which defines the time that the fire arrives at a given location. Estimating the fire arrival time is critical for initializing the fire location within coupled fire-atmosphere models. We present a new method that utilizes machine learning to estimate the fire arrival time from satellite data in the form of burning/not burning/no data rasters. The proposed method, based on a support vector machine (SVM), is tested on the 10 largest California wildfires of the 2020 fire season, and evaluated using independent observed data from airborne infrared (IR) fire perimeters. The SVM method results indicate a good agreement with airborne fire observations in terms of the fire growth and a spatial representation of the fire extent. A 12% burned area absolute percentage error, a 5% total burned area mean percentage error, a 0.21 False Alarm Ratio average, a 0.86 Probability of Detection average, and a 0.82 Sorensen's coefficient average suggest that this method can be used to monitor wildfires in near-real-time and provide accurate fire arrival times for improving fire modeling even in the absence of IR fire perimeters.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Remote Sensed Image Classification with Patchwise Trained ConvNets for Grassland Habitat Discrimination
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study focuses on the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN or ConvNet) to classify a multi-seasonal dataset of Sentinel-2 images to discriminate four grassland habitats in the "Murgia Alta" protected site. To this end, we compared two approaches differing only by the first layer machinery, which, in one case, is instantiated as a fully-connected layer and, in the other case, results in a ConvNet equipped with kernels covering the whole input (wide-kernel ConvNet). A patchwise approach, tessellating training reference data in square patches, was adopted. Besides assessing the effectiveness of ConvNets with patched multispectral data, we analyzed how the information needed for classification spreads to patterns over convex sets of pixels. Our results show that: (a) with an F1-score of around 97% (5 x 5 patch size), ConvNets provides an excellent tool for patch-based pattern recognition with multispectral input data without requiring special feature extraction; (b) the information spreads over the limit of a single pixel: the performance of the network increases until 5 x 5 patch sizes are used and then ConvNet performance starts decreasing.

TI  - JIEN'S PERIODIZATION OF THE HISTORY OF JAPAN: PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERPINNINGS
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the philosophical underpinnings of the periodization of Japanese history proposed by the Tendai monk Jien (1155-1225) in the early 13th century within the framework of Japanese Buddhism. The research is based on the historiosophical writing Gukansho (c. 1221). In Gukansho, Jien linked the idea of historical causation to Buddhism cosmology and offered a periodization of his country's history in terms of Japanese Buddhism. It is well known among Japanologists that Jien divided Japanese history into seven periods according to invisible and visible principles - dori. After a textual analysis of Gukansho, the author has concluded that invisible principles are rules determined by the cosmic world order and visible principles are rules determined by the worldly power and order. The textual analysis allows distinguishing three other periodization schemes depending on various criteria: 1) three traditionally designated epochs (ancient times, recent ancient times, present days); 2) three periods corresponding to the three ages of the deterioration of the Buddhist Doctrine (The True Law, The Semblance Law, The Latter Day of the Law); 3) four periods due to the form of rulership (an emperor, an emperor and a regent, an ex-emperor, an emperor with a shogun and a regent). The author shows that the four classifications do not conflict with each other. They are closely interrelated and organize historical data to legitimize the supreme power of the imperial house, the Fujiwara regency and the military rule. The traditional periodization is a simple scheme reflecting empirical observation. The three other schemes are based on the theoretical framework and shaped by the Buddhist cosmological worldview and the theory of the three ages of Buddhism. These three classifications create a causative context for historical events. They reveal the up-and-down course of Japanese history working towards degeneracy. The four forms of rulership are ways of adjusting to different stages of the deteriorating half of the kalpa. The traditional tripartite periodization is included in this philosophical system by being grounded on the doctrine of the three ages of Buddhism.

TI  - Adaptive coverage sampling of thermocline with an autonomous underwater vehicle
T2  - OCEAN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermocline, which is common in the ocean, has an important influence on marine fisheries, underwater communication, and submarine activities. This study proposes a method for detecting and tracking a thermocline using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), which follows theSense -> Plan -> Actcontrol methodology. The adaptive control of the vehicle ensures that the AUV can cover the target thermocline as it evolves over time and space. Additionally, this method achieves coverage observation of a highly dynamic water column containing multiple thermoclines through the online evaluation of the vertical thermocline distribution. Computer simulations are conducted to illustrate the advantages of this algorithm. In the field tests, an AUV is deployed in the South China Sea under the guidance of the satellite remote sensing data. And the algorithm is run in real time to track the thermoclines with different structures in various environments. At the same time, a series of ship-based conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) stations are built along the predetermined trajectory of the AUV as the cross-validation of this method. The simulation and field test results demonstrate that the method is effective, practical, and can better perceive variations of a thermocline.

TI  - Effect of melt ponds fraction on sea ice anomalies in the Arctic Ocean
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We used deep learning networks to establish a relationship model among MODIS daily surface reflectance product (MOD09GA) and Arctic melt ponds fraction (MPF), ice fraction (IF), and open water fraction (OWF). We applied this model to MODIS 8-day surface reflectance (MOD09A1) to derive Arctic 8-day MPF and SIF (SIF as the sum of IF and MPF). The results demonstrate that our model improved MPF estimation accuracy to an RMSE of 3.7%, compared with previous models. The characteristics of MPF spatiotemporal changes seen in early summer (May-July) indicate that MPF increased first from May-June, reaching its peak around early July, and then decreased. In addition, early summer MPF was significantly negatively correlated with sea ice extent (SIE) in September. We also found that early summer MPF caused sea ice in the Beaufort Sea, the Chukchi Sea, and the East Siberian Sea to move to warm water. Moreover, the movement of sea ice from the marginal sea to the center of the Arctic was shown to be conducive to the reduction of SIE in September. Early summer MPF was also related to Arctic oscillation (AO) during June to July, and significantly positively related to air temperature in the East Siberian and Chukchi Seas in September. As a consequence, these areas produced more open water and absorbed more heat, reducing the extent of sea ice in September, while increasing their air temperatures. The results also show that early summer MPF has a high negative correlation with air temperature in northern China, and MPF can be used to predict air temperature in northern China. These new findings should be investigated in future studies with additional data collection and field observations.

TI  - An Assessment of Forest Fires and CO<sub>2</sub> Gross Primary Production from 1991 to 2019 in Macao (Portugal)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest-fire rates have increased in Southern European landscapes. These fires damage forest ecosystems and alter their development. During the last few decades, an increase in fast-growing and highly fuel-bearing plant species such as bush, Eucalyptus globulus Labill., and Pinus pinaster Ait. has been observable in the interior of Portugal. This study aims to verify this assumption by the quantification of the biomass carbon sink in the forests of the Macao municipality. Maps of fire severity and forest biomass evolution after a wildfire event were produced for the period of 1991 to 2019. To quantify carbon retention in this region, this evolution was correlated with gross primary production (GPP) on the basis of satellite imagery from Landsat 5, Landsat 8, and MODIS MYD17A2H. Results show that wildfires in Macao increased in area and severity with each passing decade due to the large accumulation of biomass promoted by the abandonment of rural areas. Before the large fires of 2003, 2017, and 2019, carbon rates reached a daily maximum of 5.4, 5.3, and 4.7 gC/m(2)/day, respectively, showing a trend of forest-biomass accumulation in the Macao municipality.

TI  - The cultural significance of physics and evolution in Francoist Spain: continuity and development in the autarchic period
T2  - CULTURE & HISTORY DIGITAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Science took on several distinct uses and meanings under Francoism. It was exhibited as a token of intellectual prowess, deployed as a mighty diplomatic tool, applied as a resource for industry, and invoked in support of National Catholicism. However, in order to successfully fulfill all these roles, science had first to be cleansed and purified, for it was historically bound to materialism, atheism, and positivism. Physics had developed a mechanical worldview that precluded spiritual agency, and the theory of evolution had deprived man of his privileged place in nature. Could these developments be reversed? Classical physics would not easily serve the needs of the new National Catholic state, but modern physics might do, acting as a model and a tool for biological reasoning. In this paper we describe the various attempts by Spanish scientists, philosophers, and intellectuals to enlist modern physics and a revised version of evolution in the construction of the new regime. They strove to show their spiritual value, to sever them from a soul-less modernity, and to reinstate them within a grand universal Catholic tradition. We discuss the import of their arguments for the simultaneous debates about time, space, matter, life, and evolution, exploring the affinities and tensions between the inert and the living world.

TI  - The language of conspiracy: A psychological analysis of speech used by conspiracy theorists and their followers on Twitter
T2  - GROUP PROCESSES & INTERGROUP RELATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzes key psychological themes in language used by prominent conspiracy theorists and science advocates on Twitter, as well as those of a random sample of their follower base. We conducted a variety of psycholinguistic analyses over a corpus of 16,290 influencer tweets and 160,949 follower tweets in order to evaluate stable intergroup differences in language use among those who subscribe or are exposed to conspiratorial content and those who are focused on scientific content. Our results indicate significant differences in the use of negative emotion (e.g., anger) between the two groups, as well as a focus, especially among conspiracy theorists, on topics such as death, religion, and power. Surprisingly, we found less pronounced differences in cognitive processes (e.g., certainty) and outgroup language. Our results add to a growing literature on the psychological characteristics underlying a "conspiracist worldview."

TI  - Evaluation of the Performances of Radar and Lidar Altimetry Missions for Water Level Retrievals in Mountainous Environment: The Case of the Swiss Lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radar altimetry is now commonly used to provide long-term monitoring of inland water levels in complement to or for replacing disappearing in situ networks of gauge stations. Recent improvements in tracking and acquisition modes improved the quality the water retrievals. The newly implemented Open Loop mode is likely to increase the number of monitored water bodies owing to the use of an a priori elevation, especially in hilly and mountainous areas. The novelty of this study is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the performances of the past and current radar altimetry missions according to their acquisition (Low Resolution Mode or Synthetic Aperture Radar) and tracking (close or open loop) modes, and acquisition frequency (Ku or Ka) in a mountainous area where tracking losses of the signal are likely to occur, as well as of the recently launched ICESat-2 and GEDI lidar missions. To do so, we evaluate the quality of water level retrievals from most radar altimetry missions launched after 1995 over eight lakes in Switzerland, using the recently developed ALtimetry Time Series software, to compare the performances of the new tracking and acquisition modes and also the impact of the frequency used. The combination of the Open Loop tracking mode with the Synthetic Aperture Radar acquisition mode on SENTINEL-3A and B missions outperforms the classical Low Resolution Mode of the other missions with a lake observability greater than 95%, an almost constant bias of (-0.17 +/- 0.04) m, a RMSE generally lower than 0.07 m and a R most of the times higher than 0.85 when compared to in situ gauge records. To increase the number of lakes that can be monitored and the temporal sampling of the water level retrievals, data acquired by lidar altimetry missions were also considered. Very accurate results were also obtained with ICESat-2 data with RMSE lower than 0.06 and R higher than 0.95 when compared to in situ water levels. An almost constant bias (0.42 +/- 0.03) m was also observed. More contrasted results were obtained using GEDI. As these data were available on a shorter time period, more analyses are necessary to determine their potential for retrieving water levels.

TI  - Examples of Multi-Sensor Determination of Eruptive Source Parameters of Explosive Events at Mount Etna
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-sensor strategies are key to the real-time determination of eruptive source parameters (ESPs) of explosive eruptions necessary to forecast accurately both tephra dispersal and deposition. To explore the capacity of these strategies in various eruptive conditions, we analyze data acquired by two Doppler radars, ground- and satellite-based infrared sensors, one infrasound array, visible video-monitoring cameras as well as data from tephra-fallout deposits associated with a weak and a strong paroxysmal event at Mount Etna (Italy). We find that the different sensors provide complementary observations that should be critically analyzed and combined to provide comprehensive estimates of ESPs. First, all measurements of plume height agree during the strong paroxysmal activity considered, whereas some discrepancies are found for the weak paroxysm due to rapid plume and cloud dilution. Second, the event duration, key to convert the total erupted mass (TEM) in the mass eruption rate (MER) and vice versa, varies depending on the sensor used, providing information on different phases of the paroxysm (i.e., unsteady lava fountaining, lava fountain-fed tephra plume, waning phase associated with plume and cloud expansion in the atmosphere). As a result, TEM and MER derived from different sensors also correspond to the different phases of the paroxysms. Finally, satellite retrievals for grain-size can be combined with radar data to provide a first approximation of total grain-size distribution (TGSD) in near real-time. Such a TGSD shows a promising agreement with the TGSD derived from the combination of satellite data and whole deposit grain-size distribution (WDGSD).

TI  - FEOFAN PROKOPOVICH AND BENEDICT DE SPINOZA THOUGHTS ABOUT GOD AND THE ESSENCE OF NATURE
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 18th century was marked by extremely dynamic changes and reformatting of the European intellectual space, namely by the foundation of new educational institutions representing different denominations, which was reflected in the works of Russian and Western European thinkers. This article aims to conduct a comparative analysis of the philosophical content of the thoughts about God and the essence of Nature expressed by Feofan Prokopovich and Benedict de Spinoza. It is shown that the relationship between the philosophical beliefs of Feofan Prokopovich and Benedict de Spinoza represents a cross-section of the European philosophical landscape of the time when the commonality of initial premises did not at all guarantee similar conclusions; on the contrary, it created favourable conditions for a diversity of philosophical ideas. The conclusion drawn in this article suggests that the views on the essence of Nature and existence of God expressed by Feofan Prokopovich and Benedict de Spinoza if not do not fully coincide, then at least can be considered not contradictory. Besides, the criticism of Spinoza's views in Feofan's works can be fully explained by the religious mind-set that largely influenced Feofan's worldview as opposed to Spinoza.

TI  - Flood Inundation Analysis in Penang Island (Malaysia) Based on InSAR Maps of Land Subsidence and Local Sea Level Scenarios
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Penang Island is an important economic center in Malaysia and most of its population live in the coastal areas. Although previous studies have shown that it is vulnerable to rising sea levels, the combination of sea-level rise and local land subsidence would be devastating. Therefore, the objective of this study is to apply the local land subsidence model to estimate the inundated areas which relate to sea level rise by 2100. Land subsidence is quantified by the SBAS-InSAR technique on the basis of Sentinel-1 radar images for both ascending and descending tracks. For the first time, the geostatistical analyst method is used to merge the different track results and create the land subsidence models, the results show this method can maximize land deformation fields and minimize deformation errors. According to the land deformation results, all of the coastlines in the east of the island have differing medium levels of subsidence, especially in reclaimed lands and building areas. Lastly, the bathtub model is used to quantify the inundated areas by combing regional sea-level rise projection and local land subsidence models under CoastalDEM in 2100 projections. The results of this study indicate land subsidence that would increase 2.0% and 5.9% of the inundated area based on the different scenarios by 2100 projections.

TI  - How BFAST Trend and Seasonal Model Components Affect Disturbance Detection in Tropical Dry Forest and Temperate Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series analysis has gained popularity in forest disturbance monitoring thanks to the availability of satellite and airborne remote sensing images and the development of different time series methods for change detection. Previous research has focused on time series data noise reduction, the magnitude of breakpoints, and accuracy assessment; however, few have looked in detail at how the trend and seasonal model components contribute to disturbance detection in different forest types. Here, we use Landsat time series images spanning 1994-2018 to map forest disturbance in a western Pacific area of Mexico, where both temperate and tropical dry forests have been subject to severe deforestation and forest degradation processes. Since these two forest types have distinct seasonal characteristics, we investigate how trend and seasonal model components, such as the goodness-of-fit (R-2), magnitude of change, amplitude, and model length in a stable historical period, affect forest disturbance detection. We applied the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend Monitor (BFAST) algorithm and after accuracy assessment by stratified random sample points, and we obtained 68% and 86% of user accuracy and 75.6% and 86% of producer's accuracy in disturbance detection, in tropical dry forests and temperate forests, respectively. We extracted the noncorrelated trend and seasonal model components R-2, magnitude, amplitude, length of the stable historical period, and percentage of pixels with NA and tested their effects on disturbance detection employing forest-type specific logistic regression. Our results showed that, for all forests combined, the amplitude and stable historical period length contributed to disturbance detection. While for tropical dry forest alone, amplitude was the main predictor, and for the temperate forest alone, the stable historical period length contributed most to the prediction, although it was not statistically significant. These findings provide insights for improving the results of forest disturbance detection in different forest types.

TI  - BLACK HUMOR IN DANIIL KHARMS'S WORKS
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Daniil Kharms' s works have been a hot topic of research worldwide for several years. The present study discusses Kharms's black humor writings of the 1930s, exposes aesthetic potential and humanistic content of black humor as an avant-garde phenomenon, and defines the role of black humor in the plot of works containing allusions to arrest in secret, hospitals and the life of Soviet children. As paper suggests the themes and subjects of Kharms's black humor are designed to enhance humanistic content. In Kharms's art world of black humor, "purity" is a kind of harmonious world order representing the earth as "a space, filled with madness and fear" on a real level while on an artistic level it functions as the purity of creative mind generating circular compositional structure and using semantic shift and narrative interruption. In other words, purity embodies the real world while belonging to it. The popularity of Kharms may be, firstly, explained by a clear feeling of absurdism and black humor, the root of which is his requirement for humanization of life and firm faith in God. Kharms believed that religion is "ambiguous and amorphous" and should be expressed in some form or object, without which the essence of religiosity would be lost, even if the most reliable authority and firm dogma are there. Thus, overtly inhuman elements which give a false impression of writer's spiritual value, do not express the essence of his worldview, but reflect surrounding senseless reality. Out of dissatisfaction with reality, Kharms uses black humor to respond to the evil and absurdity of life.

TI  - Temporal matching of occurrence localities and forest cover data helps improve range estimates and predict climate change vulnerabilities
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Improved quantification of species' ranges is needed to provide more accurate estimates of extinction risks for conservation planning. Highland tropical biodiversity may be particularly vulnerable to the anthropogenic changes in land cover and climate and is subject to overestimation of geographic range size in IUCN assessments. Here, we demonstrate a novel and practical approach for quantifying inferred range reductions based upon temporal matching of recent species occurrence localities and vegetation data. As an illustration pertinent to montane forest-associated species with limited distribution data, we use Gymnuromys roberti, an endemic Malagasy rodent with a Least Concern conservation status. We estimated climatic suitability and climate change vulnerability using species distribution modeling (SDM). We then determined deforestation tolerance thresholds for the species by temporally matching recent occurrence localities with percent forest cover values from MODIS forest cover layers. Finally, we applied these thresholds in postprocessing SDM-based range estimates. These estimates demonstrate that the lack of sufficient forest cover substantially reduces the species' current estimated range compared with the IUCN range map. Projections to 2050 suggest that there will be a loss of climatic suitability over three quarters of the currently suitable habitat along with increased fragmentation, highlighting the need to include climate change vulnerability assessments as an integral part of conservation planning. Broader application of SDMs could assist practitioners at various stages of conservation planning, stressing the need for improved accessibility of methodologically complex SDM approaches.

TI  - Corn Biomass Estimation by Integrating Remote Sensing and Long-Term Observation Data Based on Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and timely estimation of regional crop biomass at different growth stages is of great importance in guiding crop management decision making. The recent availability of long time series of remote sensing data offers opportunities for crop monitoring. In this paper, four machine learning models, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were adopted to estimate the seasonal corn biomass based on field observation data and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data from 2012 to 2019 in the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin, China. Nine variables were selected with the forward feature selection approach from among twenty-seven variables potentially influencing corn biomass: soil-adjusted total vegetation index (SATVI), green ratio vegetation index (GRVI), Nadir_B7 (2105-2155 nm), Nadir_B6 (1628-1652 nm), land surface water index (LSWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Nadir_B4 (545-565 nm), and Nadir_B3 (459-479 nm). The results indicated that the corn biomass was suitably estimated (the coefficient of determination (R-2) was between 0.72 and 0.78) with the four machine learning models. The XGBoost model performed better than the other three models (R-2 = 0.78, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 2.86 t/ha and mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.86 t/ha). Moreover, the RF model was an effective method (R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 2.91 t/ha and MAE = 1.91 t/ha), with a performance comparable to that of the XGBoost model. This study provides a reference for estimating crop biomass from MOD43A4 datasets. In addition, the research demonstrates the potential of machine learning techniques to achieve a relatively accurate estimation of daily corn biomass at a large scale.

TI  - Estimating VAIA Windstorm Damaged Forest Area in Italy Using Time Series Sentinel-2 Imagery and Continuous Change Detection Algorithms
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping forest disturbances is an essential component of forest monitoring systems both to support local decisions and for international reporting. Between the 28 and 29 October 2018, the VAIA storm hit the Northeast regions of Italy with wind gusts exceeding 200 km h(-1). The forests in these regions have been seriously damaged. Over 490 Municipalities in six administrative Regions in Northern Italy registered forest damages caused by VAIA, that destroyed or intensely damaged forest stands spread over an area of 67,000 km(2). The present work tested the use of two continuous change detection algorithms, i.e., the Bayesian estimator of abrupt change, seasonal change, and trend (BEAST) and the continuous change detection and classification (CCDC) to map and estimate forest windstorm damage area using a normalized burned ration (NBR) time series calculated on three years Sentinel-2 (S2) images collection (i.e., January 2017-October 2019). We analyzed the accuracy of the maps and the damaged forest area using a probability-based stratified estimation within 12 months after the storm with an independent validation dataset. The results showed that close to the storm (i.e., 1 to 6 months November 2018-March 2019) it is not possible to obtain accurate results independently of the algorithm used, while accurate results were observed between 7 and 12 months from the storm (i.e., May 2019-October 2019) in terms of Standard Error (SE), percentage SE (SE%), overall accuracy (OA), producer accuracy (PA), user accuracy (UA), and g(mean) for both BEAST and CCDC (SE < 3725.3 ha, SE% < 9.69, OA > 89.7, PA and UA > 0.87, g(mean) > 0.83).

TI  - Retrieve Ice Velocities and Invert Spatial Rigidity of the Larsen C Ice Shelf Based on Sentinel-1 Interferometric Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Larsen C Ice Shelf (LCIS) is the largest ice shelf in the Antarctica Peninsula, and its state can be considered to be an indicator of local climate change. The goal of this paper is to invert the rigidity of the LCIS based on the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique using Sentinel-1 images. A targeted processing chain is first used to obtain reliable interferometric phase measurements under the circumstance of rapid ice flow. Unfortunately, only the descending data are available, which disallows the corresponding 2-D velocity field to be directly obtained from such measurements. A new approach is thus proposed to estimate the interferometric phase-based 2-D velocity field with the assistance of speckle tracking offsets. This approach establishes an implicit relationship between range and azimuth displacements based on speckle tracking observations. By taking advantage of such a relationship, the equivalent interferometric signals in the azimuth direction are estimated, thereby recovering the interferometric phase-based 2-D ice velocity field of the LCIS. To further investigate the state of the LCIS, the recovered 2-D velocity field is utilized to invert the ice rigidity. The shallow-shelf approximation (SSA) is the core of the reverse model, which is closely dependent on boundary conditions, including kinematic and dynamic conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that the spatial distribution of the rigidity varies approximately from 70 MPa center dot s1/3 to 300 MPa center dot s1/3. This rigidity distribution can reproduce a similar ice flow pattern to the observations.

TI  - The Dynamics of Infectious Diseases Associated With Injection Drug Use in Lawrence and Lowell, Massachusetts
T2  - OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background There are a wide variety of infectious complications of injection drug use. Understanding the trajectory of these complications might inform the development of an early warning system for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) outbreaks that occur regularly among people who inject drugs (PWID). Methods A distributed lag Poisson regression model in the Bayesian setting was used to examine temporal patterns in the incidence of injection-associated infectious diseases and their association with HIV cases in Lawrence and Lowell, Massachusetts between 2005 and 2018. Results Current-month HIV counts are associated with fatal overdoses approximately 8 months prior, cases of infective endocarditis 10 months prior, and cases of skin and soft tissue infections and incision and drainage procedures associated with these infections 12 months prior. Conclusions Collecting data on these other complications associated with injection drug use by public health departments may be important to consider because these complications may serve as input to a sentinel system to trigger early intervention and avert potential outbreaks of HIV.

TI  - HIV Infection a Risk Factor for Death among Hospitalized Persons with Candidemia, South Africa, 2012-2017
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - We determined the effect of HIV infection on deaths among persons >= 18 months of age with culture-confirmed candidemia at 29 sentinel hospitals in South Africa during 2012-2017. Of 1,040 case-patients with documented HIV status and in-hospital survival data, 426 (41%) were HIV-seropositive. The in-hospital casefatality rate was 54% (228/426) for HIV-seropositive participants and 37% (230/614) for HIV-seronegative participants (crude odds ratio [OR] 1.92, 95% CI 1.50-2.47; p<0.001). After adjusting for relevant confounders (n= 907), mortality rates were 1.89 (95% CI 1.38-2.60) times higher among HIV-seropositive participants than HIV-seronegative participants (p<0.001). Compared with HIV-seronegative persons, the stratum-specific adjusted mortality OR was higher among HIV-seropositive persons not managed in intensive care units (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.47-3.52; p<0.001) than among persons who were (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.00-2.43; p = 0.05). Outcomes among HIV-seropositive persons with candidemia might be improved with intensive care.

TI  - JRC study on harvested forest area: resolving key misunderstandings
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - A recent study on forest harvest in the EU (Ceccherini et al. 2020) reported a strong increase in clear-cut harvested area in recent years, based on remote sensing information. This triggered a heated debate and many critical comments. Apart from several fair and constructive criticisms, which were welcome, we found that some comments have been either not based on evidence or affected by serious misunderstandings. Here we clarify some technical aspects that were omitted or misrepresented in the public debate. Overall, the original study used in a scientifically correct way the best information available at that time. After the study was published, a previously undocumented inconsistency in the time series emerged in the original dataset used. After correcting for this inconsistency, updated results confirm an increase in clear-cut harvested area, but not as abrupt as originally reported. Contrary to what many critics say, this information should be seen as complementing and not necessarily contradicting country statistics, because the latter typically refer to total harvest (including thinning, etc.) and not clear-cut only. Finally, it should not be overlooked that the main aim of the original study was to offer a vision for integrating satellite data into the monitoring of forest resources. This was achieved: the JRC study showed the potential (and limitations) for high-resolution satellite maps to track the temporal evolution of clear-cut forest harvest in EU.

TI  - Coccidioidomycosis in llamas and alpacas diagnosed at the University of California, Davis (1990-2016)
T2  - MEDICAL MYCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the predisposition of South American camelids to coccidioidomycosis, we sought to describe the disease presentation in alpacas and llamas and identify potential risk factors for these species. The records of 224 llamas and alpacas that were tested for Coccidioides infection using immunodiffusion serology at the Coccidioidomycosis Serology Laboratory of the University of California, Davis, between 1990 and 2016 were examined; of those, 46 alpacas and 42 llamas had positive test results. The remaining 99 alpacas and 37 llamas were used as control groups. We found that male llamas were at increased risk for Coccidioides infection when compared with female llamas and when compared with male alpacas. South American camelids living within California were at higher risk for infection than camelids living in other states. Alpacas were more likely than llamas to have subclinical infections. We documented five cases of abortion or neonatal mortality attributable to coccidioidomycosis in alpacas. Our study demonstrates that South American camelids are susceptible to Coccidioides infection in areas where the disease is endemic, lending support to the importance of vigilance for this disease in alpacas and llamas and suggesting a possible role for these animals as sentinel species.Lay SummaryWe examined cases of Valley Fever and described the disease and risk factors for llamas and alpacas. Male llamas were at increased risk for infection as were animals living within California. Five alpacas had miscarriages or neonatal deaths as a result of Valley Fever infections.

TI  - A Machine Learning-Based Approach for Surface Soil Moisture Estimations with Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its relation to the Earth's climate and weather and phenomena like drought, flooding, or landslides, knowledge of the soil moisture content is valuable to many scientific and professional users. Remote-sensing offers the unique possibility for continuous measurements of this variable. Especially for agriculture, there is a strong demand for high spatial resolution mapping. However, operationally available soil moisture products exist with medium to coarse spatial resolution only (>= 1 km). This study introduces a machine learning (ML)-based approach for the high spatial resolution (50 m) mapping of soil moisture based on the integration of Landsat-8 optical and thermal images, Copernicus Sentinel-1 C-Band SAR images, and modelled data, executable in the Google Earth Engine. The novelty of this approach lies in applying an entirely data-driven ML concept for global estimation of the surface soil moisture content. Globally distributed in situ data from the International Soil Moisture Network acted as an input for model training. Based on the independent validation dataset, the resulting overall estimation accuracy, in terms of Root-Mean-Squared-Error and R-2, was 0.04 m(3)center dot m(-3) and 0.81, respectively. Beyond the retrieval model itself, this article introduces a framework for collecting training data and a stand-alone Python package for soil moisture mapping. The Google Earth Engine Python API facilitates the execution of data collection and retrieval which is entirely cloud-based. For soil moisture retrieval, it eliminates the requirement to download or preprocess any input datasets.

TI  - SMAP Soil Moisture Product Assessment over Wales, UK, Using Observations from the WSMN Ground Monitoring Network
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is the primary variable regulating the soil temperature (ST) differences between daytime and night-time, providing protection to crop rooting systems against sharp and sudden changes. It also has a number of practical applications in a range of disciplines. This study presents an approach to incorporating the effect of ST for the accurate estimation of SM using Earth Observation (EO) data from NASA's SMAP sensor, one of the most sophisticated satellites currently in orbit. Linear regression analysis was carried out between the SMAP-retrieved SM and ground-measured SM. Subsequently, SMAP-derived ST was incorporated with SMAP-derived SM in multiple regression analysis to improve the SM retrieval accuracy. The ability of the proposed method to estimate SM under different seasonal conditions for the year 2016 was evaluated using ground observations from the Wales Soil Moisture Network (WSMN), located in Wales, United Kingdom, as a reference. Results showed reduced retrieval accuracy of SM between the SMAP and ground measurements. The R-2 between the SMAP SM and ground-observed data from WSMN was found to be 0.247, 0.183, and 0.490 for annual, growing and non-growing seasons, respectively. The values of RMSE between SMAP SM and WSMN observed SM are reported as 0.080 m(3)m(-3), 0.078 m(3)m(-3) and 0.010 m(3)m(-3), with almost zero bias values for annual, growing and non-growing seasons, respectively. Implementation of the proposed scheme resulted in a noticeable improvement in SSM prediction in both R-2 (0.558, 0.440 and 0.613) and RMSE (0.045 m(3)m(-3), 0.041 m(3)m(-3) and 0.007 m(3)m(-3)), with almost zero bias values for annual, growing and non-growing seasons, respectively. The proposed algorithm retrieval accuracy was closely matched with the SMAP target accuracy 0.04 m(3)m(-3). In overall, use of the new methodology was found to help reducing the SM difference between SMAP and ground-measured SM, using only satellite data. This can provide important assistance in improving cases where the SMAP product can be used in practical and research applications.

TI  - Targeted axillary biopsy and sentinel lymph node biopsy for axillary restaging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL TREATMENT AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Accurate restaging of the axilla after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is an important issue to ensure deescalating axillary surgery in patients with initial metastatic nodes. We aimed to present our results of targeted axillary biopsy (TAB) combined with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for axillary restaging after NAC.Methods: In 64 breast cancer patients who underwent NAC, biopsy-proven positive nodes were marked with clips before NAC, and ultrasound-guided wire localization of clip-marked nodes was performed after NAC. Patients underwent TAB and SLNB for post-NAC axilla restaging.Results: Identification rates of post-NAC TAB and SLNB were 98.4% and 87.5%, respectively (P = 0.033). Histopathology revealed a nodal pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of 47% in which axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was avoided. TAB alone and SLNB alone detected residual disease in 29 (85.3%) and 20 (58.8%) patients (P = 0.029), respectively. Whereas rates of up to 97% had been achieved with a combination of TAB and SLNB. The pCR rates after NAC were 64.3% for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive and triple-negative tumors and 13.6% in luminal tumors (P = 0.0002).Conclusion: Pathologic analysis following TAB combined with SLNB revealed the pCR rates to NAC in a considerable number of patients that provided de-escalation of axillary surgery. A combination of SLNB and TAB was found to be an accurate procedure in establishing residual nodal disease. This combined procedure in patients with initially positive nodes was a reliable method for post-NAC axillary restaging.

T2  - BIOMEDICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Arthropod-borne viruses (arbovirus) cause morbidity and mortality of humans and domestic animals worldwide. The percentage of population immunity or susceptibility to these viruses in Ecuador is unknown.Objectives: To investigate the proportion of Ecuadorian populations with IgG antibodies (Abs) (past exposure/immunity) and IgM Abs (current exposure) against Flaviviruses and Alphaviruses, investigate the activity of these viruses in Ecuador.Materials and methods: During 2009-2011, we conducted a serosurvey for selected arboviruses in humans (N=1,842), equines (N=149) and sentinel hamsters (N=84) at two Coastal locations and one in the Amazon basin (Eastern Ecuador), using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and Hemagglutination Inhibition test.Results: From 20.63%-63.61% of humans showed IgG-antibodies for the Flaviviruses: Dengue virus (DENV), Yellow fever virus (YFV) Saint Louis encephalitis virus, and West Nile virus (WNV); from 4.67%-8.63% showed IgG-Abs for the Alphaviruses: Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus and Western equine encephalitis virus. IgM-Abs were found for DENV and WNV. Equine and hamsters showed antibodies to Alphavirus in all locations; two hamsters seroconverted to YFV in the Amazonia.Conclusions: The result shows YFV-vaccination history and suggest the activity arboviruses no included in the current surveillance scheme. Enhanced arbovirus and mosquitoes surveillance, continued YFV-vaccination and evaluation of its coverage/effectiveness are recommended.

TI  - Two Decades Progress on the Application of Remote Sensing for Monitoring Tropical and Sub-Tropical Natural Forests: A Review
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Forest covers about a third of terrestrial land surface, with tropical and subtropical zones being a major part. Remote sensing applications constitute a significant approach to monitoring forests. Thus, this paper reviews the progress made by remote sensing data applications to tropical and sub-tropical natural forest monitoring over the last two decades (2000-2020). The review focuses on the thematic areas of aboveground biomass and carbon estimations, tree species identification, tree species diversity, and forest cover and change mapping. A systematic search of articles was performed on Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar by applying a Boolean operator and using keywords related to the thematic areas. We identified 50 peer-reviewed articles that studied tropical and subtropical natural forests using remote sensing data. Asian and South American natural forests are the most highly researched natural forests, while African natural forests are the least studied. Medium spatial resolution imagery was extensively utilized for forest cover and change mapping as well as aboveground biomass and carbon estimation. In the latest studies, high spatial resolution imagery and machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, were jointly utilized for tree species identification. In this review, we noted the promising potential of the emerging high spatial resolution satellite imagery for the monitoring of natural forests. We recommend more research to identify approaches to overcome the challenges of remote sensing applications to these thematic areas so that further and sustainable progress can be made to effectively monitor and manage sustainable forest benefits.

TI  - Environmental and political implications of underestimated cropland burning in Ukraine
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Open burning is illegal in Ukraine, yet Ukraine has, on average, 300 times more fire activity per year (2001-2019) than most European countries. In 2016 and 2017, 47% of Ukraine was identified as cultivated area, with a total of 70% of land area dedicated to agricultural use. Over 57% of all active fires in Ukraine detected using space-borne Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) during 2016 and 2017 were associated with pre-planting field clearing and post-harvest crop residue removal, meaning that the majority of these fires are preventable. Due to the small size and transient nature of cropland burns, satellite-based burned area (BA) estimates are often underestimated. Moreover, traditional spectral-based BA algorithms are not suitable for distinguishing burned from plowed fields, especially in the black soil regions of Ukraine. Therefore, we developed a method to estimate agricultural BA by calibrating VIIRS active fire data with exhaustively mapped cropland reference areas (42 958 fields). Our study found that cropland BA was significantly underestimated (by 30%-63%) in the widely used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-based MCD64A1 BA product, and by 95%-99.9% in Ukraine's National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. Although crop residue burns are smaller and emit far less emissions than larger wildfires, reliable monitoring of crop residue burning has a number of important benefits, including (a) improving regional air quality models and the subsequent understanding of human health impacts due to the proximity of crop residue burns to urban locations, (b) ensuring an accurate representation of predominantly smaller fires in regional emission inventories, and (c) increasing awareness of often illegal managed open burning to provide improved decision-making support for policy and resource managers.

T2  - SAGE OPEN MEDICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and malignant melanoma are aggressive skin cancers that usually arise in sun-exposed parts of the body. This report describes an 85-year-old man who underwent a wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy for primary MCC and was subsequently found to have metastatic MCC and malignant melanoma within the left inguinal sentinel lymph node. Dual diagnoses of aggressive cutaneous carcinomas, although rare, may become more common in regions of high ultraviolet exposure and an ageing population. Currently, there are no guidelines for treating synchronous MCC and melanoma, however, immunotherapy with PD-1 inhibitors and anti-CTLA-4 receptor antagonists have shown therapeutic effect against these two cancers and should be considered in treatment planning.

TI  - Flood hazard areas assessment at a regional scale in M'zi wadi basin, Algeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Located in the semi-arid areas of Algeria, M'zi wadi basin experienced severe floods that pose a potent threat to the present day. In order to reduce and mitigate flood damage there is a need to develop tools for effective flood hazard management at basin scale, the paper aims to mapping of flood hazard potential areas in M'zi wadi basin, using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach coupled with Geographic Information System (GIS), based on several parameters that are relevant to flood hazard which has been weighted depending to their contributions. The Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model was also used in this study to understanding the hydrological behavior of M'zi wadi basin and to evaluate the efficiency of structural measures in downstream areas of basin. The results show a reasonable agreement with the inundated areas detected by Sentinel-2 imagery. The result of the flooding hazard in M'zi wadi basin reveals that 3%, 0.84%, 67%, 29%, and 0.16% of the catchment is high, very high, moderate, low, and very low flooding hazard areas respectively. The results show also that urban areas and agricultural areas surrounding of the lower portion of M'zi wadi are extremely exposed to flooding. The RRI model simulation results shows that the new dam -under construction-can reduce the magnitude of peak storm runoff only by 7%, and the widening of wadi near to outlet of basin can help to reduce the water level at this segment by 22% compared with results of simulation of naturalized conditions. Flood hazard areas assessment at M'zi wadi basin level can be used by concerned government's department as an excellent supporter of decision-makers during extreme and intense rainfall events in making floodplain management decisions.

TI  - Effects of COVID-19 lockdowns on fine particulate matter concentrations
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic provide an unprecedented opportunity to examine the effects of human activity on air quality. The effects on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are of particular interest, as PM2.5 is the leading environmental risk factor for mortality globally. We map global PM2.5 concentrations for January to April 2020 with a focus on China, Europe, and North America using a combination of satellite data, simulation, and ground-based observations. We examine PM2.5 concentrations during lockdown periods in 2020 compared to the same periods in 2018 to 2019. We find changes in population-weighted mean PM2.5 concentrations during the lockdowns of -11 to -15 mu g/m(3) across China, +1 to -2 mu g/m(3) across Europe, and 0 to -2 mu g/m(3) across North America. We explain these changes through a combination of meteorology and emission reductions, mostly due to transportation. This work demonstrates regional differences in the sensitivity of PM2.5 to emission sources.

TI  - Integration of L-Band Derived Soil Roughness into a Bare Soil Moisture Retrieval Approach from C-Band SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) is a key variable for many environmental studies, including hydrology and agriculture. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in the C-band are widely used nowadays to estimate SSM since the Sentinel-1 provides free-of-charge C-band SAR images at high spatial resolution with high revisit time, whereas the use of L-band is limited due to the low data availability. In this context, the main objective of this paper is to develop an operational approach for SSM estimation that mainly uses data in the C-band (Sentinel-1) with L-bands (ALOS/PALSAR) as additional data to improve SSM estimation accuracy. The approach is based on the use of the artificial neural networks (NNs) technique to firstly derive the soil roughness (Hrms) from the L-band (HH polarization) to then consider the L-band-derived Hrms and C-band SAR data (VV and VH polarizations) in the input vectors of NNs for SSM estimation. Thus, the Hrms estimated from the L-band at a given date is assumed to be constant for a given times series of C-band images. The NNs were trained and validated using synthetic and real databases. The results showed that the use of the L-band-derived Hrms in the input vector of NN in addition to C-band SAR data improved SSM estimation by decreasing the error (bias and RMSE), mainly for SSM values lower than 15 vol.% and regardless of Hrms values. Based on the synthetic database, the NNs that neglect the Hrms underestimate and overestimate the SSM (bias ranges between -8.0 and 4.0 vol.%) for Hrms values lower and higher than 1.5 cm, respectively. For Hrms <1.5 cm and most SSM values higher than 10 vol.%, the use of Hrms as an input in the NNs decreases the underestimation of the SSM (bias ranges from -4.5 to 0 vol.%) and provides a more accurate estimation of the SSM with a decrease in the RMSE by approximately 2 vol.%. Moreover, for Hrms values between 1.5 and 2.0 cm, the overestimation of SSM slightly decreases (bias decreased by around 1.0 vol.%) without a significant improvement of the RMSE. In addition, for Hrms >2.0 cm and SSM between 8 to 22 vol.%, the accuracy on the SSM estimation improved and the overestimation decreased by 2.2 vol.% (from 4.5 to 2.3 vol.%). From the real database, the use of Hrms estimated from the L-band brought a significant improvement of the SSM estimation accuracy. For in situ SSM less than 15 vol.%, the RMSE decreased by 1.5 and 2.2 vol.% and the bias by 1.2 and 2.6 vol.%, for Hrms values lower and higher than 1.5 cm, respectively.

TI  - Spectral deconvolution analysis on Olivine-Orthopyroxene mixtures with simulated space weathering modifications
T2  - RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Olivine and pyroxene are important mineral end-members for studying the surface material compositions of mafic bodies. The profiles of visible and near-infrared spectra of olivine-orthopyroxene mixtures systematically vary with their composition ratios. In our experiments, we combine the RELAB spectral database with new spectral data obtained from some assembled olivine-orthopyroxene mixtures. We found that the commonly-used band area ratio (BAR, Cloutis et al.) does not work well on our newly obtained spectral data. To investigate this issue, an empirical procedure based on fitted results by a modified Gaussian model is proposed to analyze the spectral curves. Following the new empirical procedure, the end-member abundances can be estimated with a 15% accuracy with some prior mineral absorption features. In addition, the mixture samples configured in our experiments are also irradiated by pulsed lasers to simulate and investigate the space weathering effects. Spectral deconvolution results confirm that low-content olivine on celestial bodies is difficult to measure and estimate. Therefore, the olivine abundance of space weathered materials may be underestimated from remote sensing data. This study may be utilized to quantify the spectral relationship of olivine-orthopyroxene mixtures and further reveal their correlation between the spectra of ordinary chondrites and silicate asteroids.

TI  - Retrieval of Summer Sea Ice Concentration in the Pacific Arctic Ocean from AMSR2 Observations and Numerical Weather Data Using Random Forest Regression
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) in summer is a key indicator of global climate change and important information for the development of a more economically valuable Northern Sea Route. Passive microwave (PM) sensors have provided information on the SIC since the 1970s by observing the brightness temperature (T-B) of sea ice and open water. However, the SIC in the Arctic estimated by operational algorithms for PM observations is very inaccurate in summer because the T-B values of sea ice and open water become similar due to atmospheric effects. In this study, we developed a summer SIC retrieval model for the Pacific Arctic Ocean using Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) observations and European Reanalysis Agency-5 (ERA-5) reanalysis fields based on Random Forest (RF) regression. SIC values computed from the ice/water maps generated from the Korean Multi-purpose Satellite-5 synthetic aperture radar images from July to September in 2015-2017 were used as a reference dataset. A total of 24 features including the T-B values of AMSR2 channels, the ratios of T-B values (the polarization ratio and the spectral gradient ratio (GR)), total columnar water vapor (TCWV), wind speed, air temperature at 2 m and 925 hPa, and the 30-day average of the air temperatures from the ERA-5 were used as the input variables for the RF model. The RF model showed greatly superior performance in retrieving summer SIC values in the Pacific Arctic Ocean to the Bootstrap (BT) and Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction STudy (ARTIST) Sea Ice (ASI) algorithms under various atmospheric conditions. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the RF SIC values was 7.89% compared to the reference SIC values. The BT and ASI SIC values had three times greater values of RMSE (20.19% and 21.39%, respectively) than the RF SIC values. The air temperatures at 2 m and 925 hPa and their 30-day averages, which indicate the ice surface melting conditions, as well as the GR using the vertically polarized channels at 23 GHz and 18 GHz (GR(23V18V)), TCWV, and GR(36V18V), which accounts for atmospheric water content, were identified as the variables that contributed greatly to the RF model. These important variables allowed the RF model to retrieve unbiased and accurate SIC values by taking into account the changes in T-B values of sea ice and open water caused by atmospheric effects.

TI  - Radiometric Cross-Calibration of GF-4/PMS Based on Radiometric Block Adjustment
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To obtain more abundant target information, the panchromatic and multispectral sensor (PMS) of the GaoFen-4 (GF-4) satellite utilizes five different integration times. The optimal approach for carrying out the integrated processing of absolute radiometric calibration and radiometric difference minimization of PMS images over these five integration times remains an important issue. Therefore, taking the Dunhuang radiometric calibration site (DRCS) in China as the radiometric-transfer platform and treating the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) as the reference sensors, a new radiometric cross-calibration method of the PMS based on radiometric block adjustment (RBA) is proposed. The validation results show that the proposed method can simultaneously maintain high absolute radiometric calibration consistency with the official calibration coefficients published by the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application (CRESDA) and can reduce the radiometric difference between PMS images over different integration times. In addition, the influences of the distribution of the radiometric control points (RCPs), radiometric tie points (RTPs) filter, spectral band adjustment factor (SBAF) correction, and correction of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) on the calibration results are discussed. The total cross-calibration uncertainty is less than 5.21%.

TI  - Warming as a Driver of Vegetation Loss in the Sonoran Desert of California
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Dryland ecosystems cover large regions of the Earth and have important impacts on global biogeochemistry and the carbon cycle. The plant species that occupy dryland environments have traits that enable them to withstand harsh environmental conditions, and some researchers have hypothesized that dryland vegetation may be comparatively resilient to changing climate, while others have pointed out that dryland vegetation often operates close to the physiological limits of many species, implying a possible vulnerability to warming. Here we use the Landsat archive to analyze vegetation dynamics for part of the Sonoran Desert and adjacent mountains in southern California. We show that large decreases in vegetation cover occurred over the last 34 years (1984-2017), especially across the xeric portions of our study region, where we observed a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) decline of 1.1 +/- 0.3% yr(-1). Changes in precipitation explain most of the year-to-year variation but are unable to fully explain the observed long-term decline in NDVI. Statistical models that combined summer temperature and mean annual precipitation explained more of the spatial and temporal structure of NDVI trends and implicate climate warming as an important driver of declining vegetation cover. The impact of warming contributed to a change in the precipitation-vegetation relationship through time for this desert region, indicating a structural change in ecosystem function during the study period. These results suggest that recent climate change has already had significant impact on these drylands and highlight the potential for future warming to increase risks for dryland ecosystems in other regions.

TI  - Selection of Independent Variables for Crop Yield Prediction Using Artificial Neural Network Models with Remote Sensing Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing the expected crop yield in the current growing season provides valuable information for farmers, policy makers, and food processing plants. One of the main benefits of using reliable forecasting tools is generating more income from grown crops. Information on the amount of crop yielding before harvesting helps to guide the adoption of an appropriate strategy for managing agricultural products. The difficulty in creating forecasting models is related to the appropriate selection of independent variables. Their proper selection requires a perfect knowledge of the research object. The following article presents and discusses the most commonly used independent variables in agricultural crop yield prediction modeling based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). Particular attention is paid to environmental variables, such as climatic data, air temperature, total precipitation, insolation, and soil parameters. The possibility of using plant productivity indices and vegetation indices, which are valuable predictors obtained due to the application of remote sensing techniques, are analyzed in detail. The paper emphasizes that the increasingly common use of remote sensing and photogrammetric tools enables the development of precision agriculture. In addition, some limitations in the application of certain input variables are specified, as well as further possibilities for the development of non-linear modeling, using artificial neural networks as a tool supporting the practical use of and improvement in precision farming techniques.

TI  - The Clinical Relevance of Target Lymph Node Biopsy after Primary Systemic Therapy in Initially Node-Positive Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryCurrently, the optimal axillary surgical approach for breast cancer patients with initial node-positive disease and conversion to clinically node-negative status after primary systemic therapy is unclear. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical impact of removing the initially most suspicious, labeled axillary lymph node in addition to the sentinel lymph node. Metastatic target lymph nodes were found in five out of 63 patients (7.9%), while the sentinel lymph node was either tumor-free or not detected. The removal of the target lymph node influenced the adjuvant systemic therapy in only one case (1.6%). However, complete axillary dissection was indicated in all five cases. Furthermore, with fewer than three sentinel lymph nodes removed, the target lymph node reduced the false-negative rate to less than 10%. We therefore conclude that although the target lymph node has a minor impact on adjuvant systemic therapy, it is relevant for surgical axillary management.Purpose: To assess the impact of the removal of the target lymph node (TLN) on therapy after the completion of primary systemic therapy (PST) in initially node-positive breast cancer patients. Methods: Pooled data analysis of participants of the prospective CLIP- and TATTOO-study at the University of Rostock was performed. Results: A total of 75 patients were included; 63 of them (84.0%) converted to clinically node-negative after PST. Both TLN and sentinel lymph node (SLN) were identified in 41 patients (51.2%). In five out of 63 patients (7.9%), the TLN was metastatic after PST and the SLN was either tumor-free or not detected. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was conducted in all five patients. In one patient, systemic therapy recommendation was influenced by the TLN; adjuvant radiotherapy was influenced by the TLN in zero patients. For patients with fewer than three removed SLNs, the FNR was 28.6% for the SLN biopsy alone and 7.1% for targeted axillary dissection (TAD). Conclusions: Removal of the TLN in addition to the SLN after PST has only minimal impact on the type of adjuvant systemic therapy and radiotherapy. However, the extent of axillary surgery was relevantly affected and FNR was improved by TAD.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Change for Resilient Environment and Sustainable Development in the Ethiopian Rift Valley Region
T2  - Environmental Protection and Natural Resources
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover change (LULCC) are the result of different interacting socio-economic and environmental causes and consequences that have been known since the beginning of agriculture. The study intended to explore the implications and drivers of LULCC in the Ethiopian rift valley region of Gidabo river sub basin from 1986 to 2019. The researchers have triangulated the data from Landsat 5 (TM), and Landsat 8 (OLI) with data obtained from key informants, focus groups and field observation, which is helpful to determine the interaction between the environment and the community. It is also important to mitigate environmental disaster (erosion, landslides, and climate change) and sustainable utilization of natural resources. The LULCC of the past 33 years implied that about 58.4 % of the area was changed to other Land use land cover (LULC) classes. This refers to the fact that about 14% of agroforestry, 2% of the settlement, 1.1% of the forest, and 1% of bare land were expanded at the expense of 10.3% of shrub/woodland, 6.3 % of grassland, and 1% of cropland classes. Therefore, as a result, the highest land cover (46.7%) was observed on the agroforestry system. Participants in group discussion and informant interviews attributed the expansion of agroforestry to the drivers, such as population density, cultural values (Songo, Babbo), traditional beliefs, land policy, and the insecurity resulting from climate change. Whereas, the drivers related to unproductive land, resettlement, urbanisation, and lack of agricultural inputs were considered as threats that will adversely affect the agroforestry system of the area. The study concluded that the high expansion of the agroforestry system has significant contribution to achieve a resilient environment and sustainable development, which integrates the socio-economic and environmental needs of the community. But greater attention should be given to the changes observed in shrub/woodland, grassland, and bare land to enhance environmental protection. (c) IOS-PIB

TI  - Spatio-temporal Variations of Sea Surface Wind in Coral Reef Regions over the South China Sea from 1988 to 2017
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal and interannual variabilities of sea surface wind (SSW) in the South China Sea (SCS), especially in coral reef regions such as Nansha Islands, Xisha Islands, Zhongsha Islands and Dongsha Islands were investigated in detail using the Blended Sea Winds dataset (1988-2017). Annual and monthly variations of SSW and sea surface temperature (SST) in the four zones were investigated. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of wind field was performed to aid in better understanding the different spatial patterns. The results indicate that, as observed in the spatial distribution of the first mode of monthly mean wind speed anomaly, the magnitudes in the four island zones are all negative and are similar to each other, showing that the variations of SSW in the four island zones are consistent. In the second mode, the magnitudes in Nansha Islands are opposite to those in the other three zones. The spatial distribution of the third mode reflects regional differences. The maximum annual SSW appears in Dongsha Islands, and the minimum appears in Nansha Islands. The interannual variations of SSW in all island zones are basically concurrent. The island zones with high SSW mostly have low SST, and vice versa. There may be an inverse relationship between SSW and SST in coral reef regions in the SCS. The multi-year monthly variations of SSW in the island zones present a 'W'-shaped structural variation. Each island undergoes two months of minimum SSW every year, one during March-May (MAM) and the other during September-November (SON). Both months are in monsoon transition periods. During the months with low SSW, high SST appears. The SST peaks almost correspond to the SSW troughs. This further indicates that SSW and SST may have opposite changes in coral reef regions. Coral bleaching events often correspond to years of high SST and low SSW.

TI  - Water Quality Variability and Related Factors along the Yangtze River Using Landsat-8
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) are important indicators to evaluate water environmental quality. Monitoring water quality and its variability can help control water pollution. However, traditional monitoring techniques of water quality are time-consuming and laborious, and can mostly conduct with sample point-to-point at the edge of lakes and rivers. In this study, an empirical (regression-based) model is proposed to retrieve Chl-a, TN, and TP concentrations in the Yangtze River by Landsat-8 images from 2014 to 2020. The spatial-temporal distribution and variability of water quality in the whole Yangtze River are analyzed in detail. Furthermore, the driving forces of water quality variations are explored. The results show that the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the water quality parameters are 25.88%, 4.3%, and 8.37% for Chl-a, TN, and TP concentrations, respectively, and the root mean square errors (RMSE) are 0.475 mu g/L, 0.110 mg/L, and 0.01 mg/L, respectively. The concentrations of Chl-a, TN, and TP in the upstream of the Yangtze River are lower than those in the midstream and downstream. These water quality parameters have a seasonal cycle with a maximum in summer and minimum in winter. The hydrological and meteorological factors such as water level, flow, temperature, and precipitation are positively correlated with Chl-a, TN, and TP concentrations. The larger the impervious surface and cropland area, the greater the cargo handling capacity (CHC), higher ratio of TP to TN will further pollute the water. The methods and results provide essential information to evaluate and control water pollution in the Yangtze River.

TI  - Mapping Land Surface Temperature Developments in Functional Urban Areas across Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unsustainable development paths have reached critical levels in Europe. In recent years, in cities, urbanization has been contributing to the intensification of urban heat islands. To analyze the development of surface urban heat islands (SUHI) in Europe in the last few years, the present study combines the land surface temperature (LST) from MODIS with the urban classes of the CORINE land cover data within 617 functional urban areas (FUAs). Urban and industrial uses have significantly higher LST than green urban areas across all years (about 4 to 6 degrees C), as do agricultural areas within cities. Besides land cover, location also influences LST differences. While, e.g., Bolzano (Italy) shows particularly large LST differences (>6 degrees C) between the core and the commuting zone, this effect is hardly visible in Porto (Portugal) and Madrid (Spain) (<2.5 degrees C). Cities of moderate climates show increasing differences between a city and its commuting zones with rising LST (r = 0.68), i.e., less cooling effects at night.

TI  - First systematic sampling approach to estimating the global population size of the Critically Endangered Blue-throated Macaw <i>Ara glaucogularis</i>
T2  - BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable population size estimates are imperative for effective conservation and management of globally threatened birds like the 'Critically Endangered' Blue-throated Macaw Ara glaucogularis. Endemic to one of South America's largest grassland floodplains, the Llanos de Moxos in northern Bolivia, the species' global population size is uncertain. The region's inaccessibility renders the application of traditional methods for obtaining bird population estimates impracticable or cost prohibitive. We developed a simultaneous, multilocality, double-sampling approach combined with quantitative habitat availability analyses to obtain the first rigorous population size estimate for the Blue-throated Macaw. We established 21 survey areas across its three subpopulations that were visited twice by one team in each subpopulation over a 23-day period in the 2015 dry season and obtained additional count data from two roost sites. We classified suitable habitat (palm forest islands) using Landsat 8 images and CLASlite forest monitoring software. We extrapolated the number of macaws detected (conservative estimate of the total number of macaws [CETN], highest single count [HSC]) per lop ha of suitable habitat in each survey area to the entire area of suitable habitat in all subpopulations combined, corrected for the species' range occupancy of 34.3%. The total number of Bluethroated Macaws detected by survey (CETN) and roost site counts was 137. Across all survey areas, the number of macaws per lop ha of suitable habitat was 4.7 for the first and 4.4 for the second period for CETN and 3.2 and 3.4, respectively, for HSC data. Corresponding global population estimates were 4 26455 (CETN) and 312-329 (HSC) individuals. Other recent research and anecdotal data support these estimates. Although it would be premature to propose downlisting the species to 'Endangered', our findings indicate that it has a larger population and slightly larger range than previously thought, and that the positive effects of conservation actions are now becoming apparent.

TI  - Geological Mapping Using Drone-Based Photogrammetry: An Application for Exploration of Vein-Type Cu Mineralization
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, drone-based photogrammetry was utilized for mapping geology with the objective of mineral exploration in the Shahzadeh Abbas Cu deposit, Kerman province, Iran. Cu mineralization is of vein-type and follows geological structures. A low-cost drone was used to collect geological data. A spatial resolution of 3.26 cm was achieved by considering a flight altitude of 70 m. To reach the accuracy of less than 5 cm, 70% lateral and 80% front image overlaps were applied and 220 temporary ground control points (TGCPs) were used in an area of 2.02 km(2). TGCPs were accurately positioned using DGPS-RTK measurements. Agisoft PhotoScan software was used for photogrammetric processing. The orthophoto product was performed for outlining geological units through visual interpretation. The digital elevation model (DEM) was converted to a hill-shade model in ArcGIS software to extract the geological structures such as faults and dikes. A draft geology map was prepared using orthophoto and hill-shade images to minimize the time and cost of the subsequent field work. Rock sampling was carried out and Cu-bearing veins were specified through field investigations. The geology map was finalized based on field work data and petrology studies. The geological survey indicated that diabase dikes with a northwest-southeast strike often host Cu mineralization in the study area. The position of Cu-bearing dikes was delineated for the next stage of the exploration program. This research demonstrated the time- and cost-effectiveness of using drone-based photogrammetry for preparing base geology maps for the exploration of vein-type mineralization in far districts with rough topography.

TI  - A Machine Learning Approach to Estimate Surface Chlorophyll <i>a</i> Concentrations in Global Oceans From Satellite Measurements
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Various approaches have been proposed to estimate surface ocean chlorophyll a concentrations (Chl, mg m-3) from spectral reflectance measured either in the field or from space, each with its own strengths and limitations. Here, we develop a machine learning approach to reduce the impact of spectral noise and improve algorithm performance at the global scale for multiple satellite sensors. Among several candidates, the support vector regression (SVR) approach was found to yield the best algorithm performance as gauged by several statistical measures against field-measured Chl. While statistically the performance of the SVR is slightly worse than the empirical color index (CI) algorithm proposed in Hu et al. (2012) for Chl < 0.25 mg m-3, its applicability to global waters is much extended, from the CIs 0.01-0.25 mg m-3 (about 75% of the global oceans) to its 0.01-1 mg-3 [about 96% of global oceans according to Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) statistics]. Within this range, not only does the SVR show much improved performance over the traditional band-ratio OCx approaches, but the SVR leads to much reduced image noise and much improved cross-sensor consistency between SeaWiFS and Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Aqua and between MODIS/Aqua and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). Furthermore, compared with the hybrid Ocean CI ( OCI) algorithm currently used by the U.S. NASA as the default algorithm for all mainstream ocean color sensors, the SVR avoids the need to merge two different algorithms for intermediate Chl (band subtraction for CI and band ratio for OCx), thus may serve as an alternative approach for global data processing.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Characteristics and Driving-factors Analysis of Ecological Quality Change in Qinling Mountains of Shaanxi Province: Case Study in Liuba County, Northwest China
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Liuba County, the hinterland of the southern foot of the Qinling Mountains, was selected for this case study. Based on Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI images, the remote-sensing ecological index ( RSEI) was constructed to analyze the spatio-temporal variations of the quality of ecological environment in Liuba County from 1990 to 2020. The geographical detector model was used to attribute the spatial variation of the quality of ecological environment. The results show that, temporally, from 1990 to 2003, the quality of ecological environment in Liuba County showed a large area of slight deterioration, and the area where RSEI grade decreased by one level accounted for 96. 47% of the total degraded area. From 2003 to 2020, the quality of ecological environment in Liuba County showed a large area of minor improvement, and the area where RSEI grade increased by one level accounted for 89. 73% of the total improved area. Spatially, the overall distribution of RSEI grade in Liuba County was medium or better. Areas with poor and inferior RSEI grades were mainly distributed in the bare land at western Liuhou Town and the residential areas in the hills, accounting for less proportion of the study area. The dominant driving factors of the quality of ecological environment in Liuba County were elevation, annual average temperature, and agricultural production. Annual precipitation and roads were the secondary factors. Natural factors and human factors had combined effects on the ecological environment of Liuba County. Human factors such as agricultural production, roads and population pressure were still the critical points to concern for future ecological construction in Liuba County.

TI  - Mapping the maximum extents of urban green spaces in 1039 cities using dense satellite images
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial data of urban green spaces (UGS) are critical for cities worldwide to evaluate their progress towards achieving the urban sustainable development goals on UGS. However, UGS maps at the global scale with acceptable accuracies are not readily available. In this study, we mapped UGS of all 1039 mid- and large-sized cities across the globe in 2015 with dense remote sensing data (i.e. 51 494 Landsat images) and Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Also, we quantified the spatial distribution and accessibility of UGS within the cities. By combining the greenest pixel compositing method and the percentile-based image compositing method, we were able to obtain the maximum extent of UGS in cities while better differentiating UGS from other vegetation such as croplands. The mean overall classification accuracy reached 89.26% (SD = 3.26%), which was higher than existing global land cover products. Our maps showed that the mean UGS coverage in 1039 cities was 38.46% (SD = 20.27%), while the mean UGS accessibility was 82.67% (SD = 22.89%). However, there was a distinctive spatial equity issue as cities in high-income countries had higher coverage and better accessibility than cities in low-income countries. Besides developing a protocol for large-scale UGS mapping, our study results provide key baseline information to support international endeavors to fulfill the relevant urban sustainable development goals.

TI  - Assessment of Poplar Looper (<i>Apocheima cinerarius</i> Erschoff) Infestation on Euphrates (<i>Populus euphratica</i>) Using Time-Series MODIS NDVI Data Based on the Wavelet Transform and Discriminant Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Poplar looper (Apocheima cinerarius Erschoff) is a destructive insect infesting Euphrates or desert poplars (Populus euphratica) in Xinjiang, China. Since the late 1950s, it has been plaguing desert poplars in the Tarim Basin in Xinjiang and caused widespread damages. This paper presents an approach to the detection of poplar looper infestations on desert poplars and the assessment of the severity of the infestations using time-series MODIS NDVI data via the wavelet transform and discriminant analysis, using the middle and lower reaches of the Yerqiang River as a case study. We first applied the wavelet transform to the NDVI time series data in the period of 2009-2014 for the study area, which decomposed the data into a representation that shows detailed NDVI changes and trends as a function of time. This representation captures both intra- and inter-annual changes in the data, some of which characterise transient events. The decomposed components were then used to filter out details of the changes to create a smoothed NDVI time series that represent the phenology of healthy desert poplars. Next the subset of the original NDVI time series spanning the time period when the pest was active was extracted and added to the smoothed time series to generate a blended time series. The wavelet transform was applied again to decompose the blended time series to enhance and identify the changes in the data that may represent the signals of the pest infestations. Based on the amplitude of the enhanced pest infestation signals, a predictive model was developed via discriminant analysis to detect the pest infestation and assess its severity. The predictive model achieved a severity classification accuracy of 91.7% and 94.37% accuracy in detecting the time of the outbreak. The methodology presented in this paper provides a fast, precise, and practical method for monitoring pest outbreak in dense desert poplar forests, which can be used to support the surveillance and control of poplar looper infestations on desert poplars. It is of great significance to the conservation of the desert ecological environment.

AB  - Richard Epstein is not known for his work on health law and policy. But in over 50 years in academics, he has written two books, 63 articles and book chapters, and a staggering number of op-eds and blog postings on a diverse array of health law and policy topics, ranging from medical malpractice and pharmaceuticals to obesity, organ sales, patient dumping, and privacy. This article focuses on Epstein's contribution to three areas of health law and policy: medical malpractice, pharmaceuticals, and health reform. It shows that Epstein's take on all three issues flows directly from his general worldview about the superiority of private judgment and voluntary transactions compared with coercive top-down command and control schemes.

TI  - Spatial Variability and Trends of Marine Heat Waves in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea over 39 Years
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine heatwaves (MHWs) can cause devastating impacts on marine life. The frequency of MHWs, gauged with respect to historical temperatures, is expected to rise significantly as the climate continues to warm. The MHWs intensity and count are pronounced with many parts of the oceans and semi enclosed seas, such as Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMED). This paper investigates the descriptive spatial variability and trends of MHW events and their main characteristics of the EMED from 1982 to 2020 using Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Optimum Interpolation ([NOAA] OI SST V2.1). Over the last two decades, we find that the mean MHW frequency and duration increased by 40% and 15%, respectively. In the last decade, the shortest significant MHW mean duration is 10 days, found in the southern Aegean Sea, while it exceeds 27 days off the Israeli coast. The results demonstrate that the MHW frequency trend increased by 1.2 events per decade between 1982 and 2020, while the MHW cumulative intensity (i(cum)) trend increased by 5.4 degrees C days per decade. During the study period, we discovered that the maximum significant MHW SST event was 6.35 degrees C above the 90th SST climatology threshold, lasted 7 days, and occurred in the year 2020. It was linked to a decrease in wind stress, an increase in air temperature, and an increase in mean sea level pressure.

TI  - MixChannel: Advanced Augmentation for Multispectral Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Usage of multispectral satellite imaging data opens vast possibilities for monitoring and quantitatively assessing properties or objects of interest on a global scale. Machine learning and computer vision (CV) approaches show themselves as promising tools for automatizing satellite image analysis. However, there are limitations in using CV for satellite data. Mainly, the crucial one is the amount of data available for model training. This paper presents a novel image augmentation approach called MixChannel that helps to address this limitation and improve the accuracy of solving segmentation and classification tasks with multispectral satellite images. The core idea is to utilize the fact that there is usually more than one image for each location in remote sensing tasks, and this extra data can be mixed to achieve the more robust performance of the trained models. The proposed approach substitutes some channels of the original training image with channels from other images of the exact location to mix auxiliary data. This augmentation technique preserves the spatial features of the original image and adds natural color variability with some probability. We also show an efficient algorithm to tune channel substitution probabilities. We report that the MixChannel image augmentation method provides a noticeable increase in performance of all the considered models in the studied forest types classification problem.

TI  - Development of Magnetic Particle Distribution Imaging Using Magnetic Field Reconstruction for Biopsy of the Sentinel Lymph Node
T2  - MAGNETOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph-node-draining cancer metastasis. The identification of the sentinel lymph node using magnetic particles and a magnetic sensor has attracted attention in recent years, as this method is less invasive than the conventional method of radiotracer injection. However, the development of a two-dimensional measurement method for sentinel lymph nodes using magnetic nanoparticles remains an issue. In the present study, a method and apparatus for the two-dimensional imaging of magnetic particle distribution were developed to detect a lymph node with magnetic particles concentrated within lymphoid tissues. The method comprises the reconstruction of the magnetic field measured with a high-sensitivity magnetic sensor and with a magnetic detection ability of 2 nT/root Hz at 100 Hz (5 nT/root Hz at 1 Hz). The proposed system measures the two-dimensional magnetic field distribution in an area of up to 25 x 25 mm(2) using a coil generating a 0.77 mT external magnetic field applied to the measurement target. The improved spatial resolution of the images makes it possible to use two-dimensional imaging for diagnostics of breast cancer metastases.

AB  - Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes represent human influences on the natural ecosystem. This study aims to analyse such changes in the eastern part of East Java, a region of +/- 3320.3 km(2). The changes are analysed by comparing two editions of maps (the National Digital Map and Landsat-8). Five subsets are explored to understand the LULC changes caused by the development of: transportation infrastructure; industrial sites; the agricultural sector; tourism; urbanisation; and sub-urbanisation. Regional development from 2000 to 2018 has increased built-up areas by 40.55% (122.5 km(2)), while paddy fields have increased by 71.08%, and forest plantation areas by 16.03%. Conversely, the development has reduced rural areas by 61.06% (860.1 km(2)) and water bodies by 54.02% (44.52 km(2)). The LULC has significantly changed the natural landscape to a human-dominated landscape, which is potentially fragile in the face of the disasters to which the region is prone.

TI  - Effect of COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdown (general holiday) on air quality of Dhaka City
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 has forced the Government of Bangladesh to implement a lockdown during April-May 2020 by restricting people's movement; shutdown of industries and motor vehicles; and closing markets, public places, and schools to contain the virus. This type of strict measures caused an outcome, the reduction of urban air pollution, around the world. The present study aims to investigate the reduction of the concentration of pollutants in the air of Dhaka City and the reduction of the Air Quality Index (AQI). Necessary time-series data of the concentration of PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO have been collected from the archive of the Air Quality Monitoring Station of the US Embassy in Dhaka and Sentinel-5P. The time-series data have been analyzed by descriptive statistics, and AQI was calculated following an appropriate formula suggested by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) based on the criteria pollutants. The study found that the concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO during April-May 2020 have been reduced by 26, 30, 07, and 07%, respectively, compared with the preceding year's concentrations. Moreover, the AQI has also been reduced by about 35% on average during the lockdown period than the same times of the previous year. However, the magnitude of pollution reduction in Dhaka is lower than in other cities and countries globally, including Delhi, Sao Paulo, Wuhan, Spain, Italy, the USA. The main reasons may include, among others, the poor implementation of lockdown (especially in the first week of April and the second fortnight of May), pre-existing pollution, transboundary pollution, incineration of solid waste, etc. This study will help policymakers figure out how to regulate pollution sources and improve the air quality of Dhaka.

TI  - Long-term trends of satellite-based fine-mode aerosol optical depth over the Seto Inland Sea, Japan, over two decades (2001-2020)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution over the Seto Inland Sea (SIS) is among the most severe of any region in Japan and is considered to be affected by both long-range and local pollution. To unravel the long-term trends of aerosol pollution over this region, in this study, measurements from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer instrument onboard the Terra satellite were analyzed over two decades, from 2001 to 2020. Fine-mode aerosol optical depth (AOD(f)) was calculated to estimate the amount of aerosol produced by anthropogenic emissions. The results showed that the AOD(f) over the SIS increased from 2001 to 2004, had a flat trend from 2005 to 2009, and decreased from 2010 to 2020. To clarify the impact of long-range transport from the Asian continent to the SIS, the AOD(f) over the Yellow Sea was also investigated and was found to increase and level off during the 2000s, after which it decreased, especially after 2014. This decrease can be attributed to emission regulations in China. The above analysis suggests that the aerosol pollution status in the SIS during the late 2010s was similar to that during the early 2000s. Over the SIS, the lowest AOD(f) value was found in 2020, with the values in January-March and June-July approximately 30% and 30%-60% lower than the average values during the same periods in 2018-2019, respectively. The reduction found in January-March could be related to the decline in the long-range transport with restrictions on human activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the reduction during June-July could be related to the decline of local emission sources. Considering the large SO2 decline in 2020, regulations on SO2 emitted from ships that started from 1 January 2020 are one possible factor for the improvement of aerosol pollution over the SIS in 2020.

Despite guideline publication, treatment selection remains variable. We hypothesized that receipt of guideline-recommended care would be more common in patients evaluated at academic centers and institutions with high melanoma case volumes and that such therapy would be associated with improved overall survival.Study DesignRetrospective cohort analysis.SettingThe National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2015.MethodsA total of 3500 patients were included. We utilized Kaplan-Meier analysis and logistic and Cox proportional hazard regressions. Survival analysis was performed on inverse probability-weighted cohorts.ResultsThere has been a trend toward evaluation at academic programs at a rate of 1.58% of patients per year (95% CI, 1.06%-2.11%) since 2004. However, the percentage of patients receiving guideline-compliant primary tumor excision and lymph node evaluation has plateaued at approximately 50% since 2012. Guideline-compliant surgical management was more commonly provided to patients evaluated at academic programs than nonacademic programs but only when those institutions had a high melanoma case volume (odds ratio, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.62-2.48). Receipt of guideline-compliant primary tumor excision and lymph node evaluation was associated with improved overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.64-0.76).ConclusionFacility factors affect rates of receipt of guideline-compliant initial surgical management for patients with node-negative Merkel cell carcinoma. Given the survival benefit of such treatment, patients may benefit from care at hospitals with high melanoma case volumes.

TI  - Prior's Turn to Medieval Logic
T2  - KRONOSCOPE-JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF TIME
M3  - Article
AB  - The peculiar aspect of medieval logic, that the truth-value of propositions changes with time, gradually disappeared as Europe exited the Renaissance. In modern logic, it was assumed by W.V.O. Quine that one cannot appreciate modern symbolic logic if one does not take it to be tenseless. A.N. Prior's invention of tense-logic challenged Quine's view and can be seen as a turn to medieval logic. However, Prior's discussion of the philosophical problems related to quantified tense-logic led him to reject essential aspects of medieval logic. This invites an evaluation of Prior's formalisation of tense-logic as, in part, an argument in favour of the medieval view of propositions. This article argues that Prior's turn to medieval logic is hampered by his unwillingness to accept essential medieval assumptions regarding facts about objects that do not exist. Furthermore, it is argued that presentists should learn an important lesson from Prior's struggle with accepting the implications of quantified tense-logic and reject theories that purport to be presentism as unorthodox if they also affirm Quine's view on ontic commitment. In the widest sense: philosophers who, like Prior, turn to the medieval view of propositions must accept a worldview with facts about individuals that, in principle, do not supervene (present tense) on being, for they do not yet exist.

TI  - Comparing Solo Versus Ensemble Convolutional Neural Networks for Wetland Classification Using Multi-Spectral Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are important ecosystems that are linked to climate change mitigation. As 25% of global wetlands are located in Canada, accurate and up-to-date wetland classification is of high importance, nationally and internationally. The advent of deep learning techniques has revolutionized the current use of machine learning algorithms to classify complex environments, specifically in remote sensing. In this paper, we explore the potential and possible limitations to be overcome regarding the use of ensemble deep learning techniques for complex wetland classification and discusses the potential and limitation of various solo convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including DenseNet, GoogLeNet, ShuffleNet, MobileNet, Xception, Inception-ResNet, ResNet18, and ResNet101 in three different study areas located in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada (i.e., Avalon, Gros Morne, and Grand Falls). Moreover, to improve the classification accuracies of wetland classes of bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and shallow water, the results of the three best CNNs in each study area is fused using three supervised classifiers of random forest (RF), bagged tree (BTree), Bayesian optimized tree (BOT), and one unsupervised majority voting classifier. The results suggest that the ensemble models, in particular BTree, have a valuable role to play in the classification of wetland classes of bog, fen, marsh, swamp, and shallow water. The ensemble CNNs show an improvement of 9.63-19.04% in terms of mean producer's accuracy compared to the solo CNNs, to recognize wetland classes in three different study areas. This research indicates a promising potential for integrating ensemble-based learning and deep learning for operational large area land cover, particularly complex wetland type classification.

TI  - A Novel GIS-Based Approach for Automated Detection of Nearshore Sandbar Morphological Characteristics in Optical Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is a valuable tool for coastal management, enabling the possibility to repeatedly observe nearshore sandbars. However, a lack of methodological approaches for sandbar detection prevents the wider use of satellite data in sandbar studies. In this paper, a novel fully automated approach to extract nearshore sandbars in high-medium-resolution satellite imagery using a GIS-based algorithm is proposed. The method is composed of a multi-step workflow providing a wide range of data with morphological nearshore characteristics, which include nearshore local relief, extracted sandbars, their crests and shoreline. The proposed processing chain involves a combination of spectral indices, ISODATA unsupervised classification, multi-scale Relative Bathymetric Position Index (RBPI), criteria-based selection operations, spatial statistics and filtering. The algorithm has been tested with 145 dates of PlanetScope and RapidEye imagery using a case study of the complex multiple sandbar system on the Curonian Spit coast, Baltic Sea. The comparison of results against 4 years of in situ bathymetric surveys shows a strong agreement between measured and derived sandbar crest positions (R-2 = 0.999 and 0.997) with an average RMSE of 5.8 and 7 m for PlanetScope and RapidEye sensors, respectively. The accuracy of the proposed approach implies its feasibility to study inter-annual and seasonal sandbar behaviour and short-term changes related to high-impact events. Algorithm-provided outputs enable the possibility to evaluate a range of sandbar characteristics such as distance from shoreline, length, width, count or shape at a relevant spatiotemporal scale. The design of the method determines its compatibility with most sandbar morphologies and suitability to other sandy nearshores. Tests of the described technique with Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI data show that it can be applied to publicly available medium resolution satellite imagery of other sensors.

TI  - Improved Ship and Wake Detection Using Sentinel-2A Satellite Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is necessary to quickly detect and respond to ship accidents that occur continuously due to the influence of the recently increased maritime traffic. For this purpose, ship detection research is being actively conducted based on satellite images that can be monitored in real time over a wide area. However, there is a possibility that the wake may be falsely detected as a ship because the wake removal is not performed in previous studies that performed ship detection using spectral characteristics. Therefore, in this study, ship detection was performed using SDI (Ship Detection Index) based on the Sentinel-2A satellite image, and the wake was removed by utilizing the difference in the spectral characteristics of the ship and the wake. Probability of detection (POD) and false alarm rate (FAR) indices were used to verify the accuracy of the ship detection algorithm in this study. As a result of the verification, POD was similar and FAR was improved by 6.4% compared to the result of applying only SDI.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MINING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This work illustrates the impact of excessive mining on the precipitation trends and ground water condition of the Ramgarh district over a period of 12 years (2007-2018). The Landsat 8 and Landsat TM- 5 data is processed under Arc-GIS in order to compare the LULC maps. Out of 7 classified classes, the Results obtained indicate the expansion of the mining area, barren land, settlement, and water body by 10.95%, 10.07%, 3.44%, and 0.43%, while a reduction in the forest, fallow, and crop land by 11.24%, 11.31%, and 2.34% respectively. The TRMM 3B43 data is used to trace out the annual precipitation values of 5 selected raster location points through Arc GIS. The annual precipitation under the mining regions (lower Mandu, Ramgarh, Bhurkunda) shows a decreasing trend. The Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator method is used in order to evaluate the ground water pattern in the pre- and post-monsoonal conditions. The Mandu block, the densest mining region of the district with the positive Z values of 1.714 and 0.137 in the pre- and post- monsoon period shows a decrease in the ground water level at the rates of 0.103 m/year and 0.017 m/year, respectively. The continuous rise in the mining activities has created an alarming shift of weather pattern and deteriorated ground water table in Ramgarh.

TI  - An Effective Water Body Extraction Method with New Water Index for Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, play an irreplaceable role in global ecosystems and climate systems. Sentinel-2 imagery provides new high-resolution satellite remote sensing data. Based on the analysis of the spectral characteristics of the Sentinel-2 satellite, a novel water index called the Sentinel-2 water index (SWI) that is based on the vegetation-sensitive red-edge band (Band 5) and shortwave infrared (Band 11) bands was developed. Four representative water body types, namely, Taihu Lake, Yangtze River, Chaka Salt Lake, and Chain Lake, were selected as study areas to conduct a water body extraction performance comparison with the normalized difference water index (NDWI). We found that (1) the contrast value of the SWI was larger than that of the NDWI in terms of various water body types, including purer water, turbid water, salt water, and floating ice, which suggested that the SWI could achieve better enhancement performance for water bodies. (2) An effective water body extraction method was proposed by integrating the SWI and Otsu algorithm, which could accurately extract various water body types with high overall accuracy. (3) The method effectively extracted large water bodies and wide river channels by suppressing shadow noise in urban areas. Our results suggested that the novel method can achieve efficient water body extraction for rapidly and accurately extracting various water bodies from Sentinel-2 data and the novel method has application potential for larger-scale surface water mapping.

TI  - Non-pollution damage hazard of underground mining on reservoir ecological environment
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Abundant coal resources also exist under rivers and oceans besides lands. Underwater mining has a history of more than 100 years. For a long time, all the technological measures in the mining process are to protect the mine itself, and mining engineers seldom consider the non-pollution damage to the ecological environment caused by mining subsidence. Thus, mining under a medium-sized reservoir is selected as a case study in this paper, the damage hazard of underground mining on a reservoir's ecological environment is researched based on reservoir area variations from Landsat remote sensing and subsidence basin volume calculations. The results illustrate the subsidence basins by large-scale mining under a reservoir can alter the original topography of the reservoir bottom, which will form new stagnant water basins, and also a large water area will be dried up. The non-pollution damage is difficult to be recovered and even irreversible, especially for small- and medium-sized reservoirs. The subsidence basin volume was 3.04 x 10(7) m(3) until 2018, which was more than the original reservoir capacity. Most of the water would flow into the subsidence basin and cause the reservoir water to dry up. The essence of non-pollution damage hazard is bottom subsidence caused by underwater mining. Therefore, governments should limit mining activities or close the coal mines for protecting the ecological environment of the reservoir.

TI  - A Comparative Analysis of Retrieval Algorithms of Land Surface Temperature from Landsat-8 Data: A Case Study of Shanghai, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the trend of global warming and urbanization, frequent extreme weather has a severe impact on the lives of citizens. Land Surface Temperature (LST) is an essential climate variable and a vital parameter for land surface processes at local and global scales. Retrieving LST from global, regional, and city-scale thermal infrared remote sensing data has unparalleled advantages and is one of the most common methods used to study urban heat island effects. Different algorithms have been developed for retrieving LST using satellite imagery, such as the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE), Mono-Window Algorithm (MWA), Split-Window Algorithm (SWA), and Single-Channel Algorithm (SCA). A case study was performed in Shanghai to evaluate these existing algorithms in the retrieval of LST from Landsat-8 images. To evaluate the estimated LST accurately, measured data from meteorological stations and the MOD11A2 product were used for validation. The results showed that the four algorithms could achieve good results in retrieving LST, and the LST retrieval results were generally consistent within a spatial scale. SWA is more suitable for retrieving LST in Shanghai during the summer, a season when the temperature and the humidity are both very high in Shanghai. Highest retrieval accuracy could be seen in cultivated land, vegetation, wetland, and water body. SWA was more sensitive to the error caused by land surface emissivity (LSE). In low temperature and a dry winter, RTE, SWA, and SCA are relatively more reliable. Both RTE and SCA were sensitive to the error caused by atmospheric water vapor content. These results can provide a reasonable reference for the selection of LST retrieval algorithms for different periods in Shanghai.

TI  - Cloud-Precipitation Hybrid Regimes and Their Projection onto IMERG Precipitation Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Significance Statement Clouds and precipitation are related in close but complex ways. In this work we attempt to provide a classification of daytime cloud-precipitation co-occurrence and covariability, with emphasis on tropical regions. We achieve such a classification using a k-means clustering algorithm applied to cloud fraction and precipitation intensity histograms, which yields "hybrid" clusters, that is, groups whose members have similar cloud and precipitation properties. These hybrid clusters reveal more detailed features of coincident daytime cloud and precipitation systems than do clusters in which clouds and precipitation are treated separately. Moreover, the realization that precipitation features associated with high and optically thick clouds have very distinct patterns enables hybrid cluster prediction solely on the basis of precipitation information. This has the important implication that rarer cloud observations can be extended to the more frequent (including nighttime) precipitation domain.To better understand cloud-precipitation relationships, we extend the concept of cloud regimes developed from two-dimensional joint histograms of cloud optical thickness and cloud-top pressure from MODIS to include precipitation information. Taking advantage of the high-resolution IMERG precipitation dataset, we derive cloud-precipitation "hybrid" regimes by implementing a k-means clustering algorithm with advanced initialization and objective measures to determine the optimal number of clusters. By expressing the variability of precipitation rates within 1 degrees grid cells as histograms and varying the relative weight of cloud and precipitation information in the clustering algorithm, we obtain several editions of hybrid cloud-precipitation regimes (CPRs) and examine their characteristics. In the deep tropics, when precipitation is weighted weakly, the cloud part centroids of the hybrid regimes resemble their counterparts of cloud-only regimes, but combined clustering tightens the cloud-precipitation relationship by decreasing each regime's precipitation variability. As precipitation weight progressively increases, the shape of the cloud part centroids becomes blunter, while the precipitation part sharpens. When cloud and precipitation are weighted equally, the CPRs representing high clouds with intermediate to heavy precipitation exhibit distinct enough features in the precipitation parts of the centroids to allow us to project them onto the 30-min IMERG domain. Such a projection overcomes the temporal sparseness of MODIS cloud observations associated with substantial rainfall, suggesting great application potential for convection-focused studies for which characterization of the diurnal cycle is essential.

TI  - Technique for inguino-femoral lymph node dissection in vulvar cancer: an international survey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Vulvar cancer is a rare disease and despite broad adoption of sentinel lymph node mapping to assess groin metastases, inguino-femoral lymph node dissection still plays a role in the management of this disease. Inguino-femoral lymph node dissection is associated with high morbidity, and limited research exists to guide the best surgical approach. Objective To determine international practice patterns in key aspects of the inguino-femoral lymph node dissection technique and provide data to guide future research. Methods A survey addressing six key domains of practice patterns in performing inguino-femoral lymph node dissection was distributed internationally to gynecologic oncology surgeons between April and October 2020. The survey was distributed using the British Gynecological Cancer Society, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology, authors' direct links, the UK Audit and Research in Gynecology Oncology group, and Twitter. Results A total of 259 responses were received from 18 countries. The majority (236/259, 91.1%) of respondents reported performing a modified oblique incision, routinely dissecting the superficial and deep inguino-femoral lymph nodes (137/185, 74.1%) with sparing of the saphenous vein (227/258, 88%). Most respondents did not routinely use compression dressings/underwear (169/252 (67.1%), used prophylactic antibiotics at the time of surgery only (167/257, 65%), and closed the skin with sutures (192 74.4%). Also, a drain is placed at the time of surgery by 243/259 (93.8%) surgeons, with most practitioners (144/243, 59.3%) waiting for drainage to be less than 30-50 mL in 24 hours before removal; most respondents (66.3%) routinely discharge patients with drain(s) in situ. Conclusion Our study showed that most surgeons perform a modified oblique incision, dissect the superficial and deep inguino-femoral lymph nodes, and spare the saphenous vein when performing groin lymphadenectomy. This survey has demonstrated significant variability in inguino-femoral lymph node dissection in cases of vulvar cancer among gynecologic oncology surgeons internationally.

TI  - Ice-shelf retreat drives recent Pine Island Glacier speedup
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Speedup of Pine Island Glacier over the past several decades has made it Antarctica's largest contributor to sea-level rise. The past speedup is largely due to grounding-line retreat in response to ocean-induced thinning that reduced ice-shelf buttressing. While speeds remained fairly steady from 2009 to late 2017, our Copernicus Sentinel 1A/B-derived velocity data show a >12% speedup over the past 3 years, coincident with a 19-km retreat of the ice shelf. We use an ice-flow model to simulate this loss, finding that accelerated calving can explain the recent speedup, independent of the grounding-line, melt-driven processes responsible for past speedups. If the ice shelf's rapid retreat continues, it could further destabilize the glacier far sooner than would be expected due to surface- or ocean-melting processes.

TI  - Assessment of Close-Range Remote Sensing Methods for DTM Estimation in a Lowland Deciduous Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital terrain models (DTMs) are important for a variety of applications in geosciences as a valuable information source in forest management planning, forest inventory, hydrology, etc. Despite their value, a DTM in a forest area is typically lower quality due to inaccessibility and limited data sources that can be used in the forest environment. In this paper, we assessed the accuracy of close-range remote sensing techniques for DTM data collection. In total, four data sources were examined, i.e., handheld personal laser scanning (PLShh, GeoSLAM Horizon), terrestrial laser scanning (TLS, FARO S70), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry (UAV(image)), and UAV laser scanning (ULS, LS Nano M8). Data were collected within six sample plots located in a lowland pedunculate oak forest. The reference data were of the highest quality available, i.e., total station measurements. After normality and outliers testing, both robust and non-robust statistics were calculated for all close-range remote sensing data sources. The results indicate that close-range remote sensing techniques are capable of achieving higher accuracy (root mean square error < 15 cm; normalized median absolute deviation < 10 cm) than airborne laser scanning (ALS) and digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) data that are generally understood to be the best data sources for DTM on a large scale.

TI  - Comparison of two algorithms for estimating stand-level changes and change indicators in a boreal forest in Norway
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In Europe, the change in forest cover caused by felling activities, especially clear-cutting, is the most significant driver of forest ecosystem change. Monitoring the magnitude of harvest activities and their spatial and temporal distribution can provide essential change indicators of the pressure on forest ecosystems. Satellite remote sensing offers the means to assess and map indicators of forest change dynamics related to a high spatial-and temporal resolution over large areas cost-effectively and objectively. Large-scale maps of forest cover change over time produced by LandTrendr (LT), a temporal segmentation algorithm, and Global Forest Watch (GFW) are evaluated in a Norwegian boreal environment. Their accuracy to detect change at stand-level and their potential to produce landscape-level spatial and temporal change indicators was assessed against a 20-year historical record of harvest activities in Southern Norway. Data from LT were found to be spatially and temporally more coherent with the reference data than GFW. LT detected 85.4% of the clear-cuts and a decrease in harvest activities between 2001 and 2017, a trend confirmed by the reference data, while GFW detected 63.1% of the clear-cuts and an increase in harvest activities for the same period. It was concluded that LT map of changes (LT-map) provides efficient spatial and temporal indicators of forest change dynamics and performed better than GFW tree cover loss map (GFW-map) to identify and monitor clear-cuts in a Norwegian boreal forest.

M3  - Article
AB  - The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Colorado East River Community Observatory (ER) in the Upper Colorado River Basin was established in 2015 as a representative mountainous, snow-dominated watershed to study hydrobiogeochemical responses to hydrological perturbations in headwater systems. The ER is characterized by steep elevation, geologic, hydrologic and vegetation gradients along floodplain, montane, subalpine, and alpine life zones, which makes it an ideal location for researchers to understand how different mountain subsystems contribute to overall watershed behaviour. The ER has both long-term and spatially-extensive observations and experimental campaigns carried out by the Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area (SFA), led by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and researchers from over 30 organizations who conduct cross-disciplinary process-based investigations and modelling of watershed behaviour. The heterogeneous data generated at the ER include hydrological, genomic, biogeochemical, climate, vegetation, geological, and remote sensing data, which combined with model inputs and outputs comprise a collection of datasets and value-added products within a mountainous watershed that span multiple spatiotemporal scales, compartments, and life zones. Within 5 years of collection, these datasets have revealed insights into numerous aspects of watershed function such as factors influencing snow accumulation and melt timing, water balance partitioning, and impacts of floodplain biogeochemistry and hillslope ecohydrology on riverine geochemical exports. Data generated by the SFA are managed and curated through its Data Management Framework. The SFA has an open data policy, and over 70 ER datasets are publicly available through relevant data repositories. A public interactive map of data collection sites run by the SFA is available to inform the broader community about SFA field activities. Here, we describe the ER and the SFA measurement network, present the public data collection generated by the SFA and partner institutions, and highlight the value of collecting multidisciplinary multiscale measurements in representative catchment observatories.

TI  - Implementation of a standardised and quality-assured enhanced gonococcal antimicrobial surveillance programme in accordance with WHO protocols in Kampala, Uganda
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesThe emergence of multidrug-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) is a major global health threat necessitating response and control measures. NG antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance data from sub-Saharan countries is exceedingly limited. This paper aims to describe the establishment, design and implementation of a standardised and quality-assured gonococcal surveillance programme and to describe the susceptibility patterns of the cultured gonococcal isolates in Kampala, Uganda.MethodsFrom March 2018 to September 2019, using the WHO Enhanced Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (EGASP) protocol, consecutive males with urethral discharge syndrome were recruited from 10 surveillance sites in Kampala City, Uganda, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health. Males completed a questionnaire and provided a urethral swab specimen. Culture, identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (Etest) were performed.ResultsOf the 1013 males recruited, 73.1% (740/1013) had a positive Gram stain and 51.1% (n=518) were culture-positive for NG. Using Etest (458 isolates), the resistance to ciprofloxacin was 99.6%. Most isolates were susceptible to azithromycin, cefoxitin and gentamicin, that is, 99.8%, 98.5% and 92.4%, respectively, and all isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone and cefixime.ConclusionsWe established a standardised, quality-assured WHO EGASP. Using Etest, 458 isolates were characterised, with associated epidemiological surveillance data, in 1.5 years, which by far exceed the minimum 100 isolates per year and country requested in the WHO Global GASP, to detect AMR levels with confidence. These isolates with the epidemiological data can be used to develop population level interventions.

TI  - Surface water dynamics analysis based on sentinel imagery and Google Earth Engine Platform: a case study of Jayakwadi dam
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water is important for the urban and agriculture ecosystem, the accurate and very easy to detect and analysis of the surface water based on the remote sensing data and google earth engine platform. It is a very much important for irrigation and water resource management during the dry period and rabi with summer season. In this paper, we have extracted the surface water analysis from Sentinel-2A images using a new technique of Google Earth Engine (GEE) and machine learning coding. Monitoring the dynamics of surface water is a very helpful to study of the irrigation, and drinking water requirement, which climate change factors most damages on the surface water, natural environmental health and understand the impacts of global changes and human actions on the planning and development of the water resources in the semi-arid region. Currently, so much research has focused on the surface water extraction and dynamic monitoring using remote sensing imagery and softwares. But downloading a big number of remote sensing images are covering that area and then process in the remote sensing and GIS software as per the traditional method. The traditional process is much lengthy, also very time-wasting for such kind of time series dataset analysis. In this view, GEE platform has been given easier to access any satellite data within less time. The GEE is a total cloud-based platform enthusiastic to satellite image data processing based on the machine learning coding. So for many excellent remote sensing image processing coding, algorithms have been integrated in the platform of Google Earth Engine (GEE). These data do not require to save images and collection, which are very easy to doing satellite data processing and effective output capability. The results show that 2019 year has observed that there are increased water area, i.e. 202.4871 km(2) and for the year of 2019, water spread-out area is 410.9113 km(2) in dam. To compare the results of 2015-2019, there is much increase in the water area due to various reasons like pumping, heavy rain, etc. in the Jayakwadi dam. This water can use for various purposes and irrigation water management and drinking purposes during the drought condition. The developed algorithms have given better information and results of water spread-out by google earth engine. The current techniques are reliable, novel, and quick to get the maximum and minimum extent of the surface water. The results can be very useful for the surface water planning and management in the study area.

TI  - Evaluation of optimum PV tilt angle with generated and predicted solar electric data using geospatial open source software in cloud environment
T2  - SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, a novel approach to find out optimum tilt angle using generated and predicted solar data is presented. Here the generated electricity outputs data of the photovoltaics (PVs), installed on the building rooftops at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee, India, have been obtained from the Institute for the past four years (2015-18). Simultaneously, the solar PV output data have been predicted using open source software application, geographic information system (GIS), Perl, global horizontal irradiance (GHI), remote sensing, and cloud computing. The satellite-derived GHI has been obtained from the database developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), United States, and local GHI using a pyranometer to validate the results. In the presented work, tilted GHI has been estimated using modified tilt angle algorithm implemented using Perl in a cloud environment. Further, the usable rooftop area has been digitized on high-resolution WorldView-3 image and calculated using QGIS. In this study, the validation of an optimum tilt angle has been performed by the comparison of the output from the installed solar plant to the predicted solar potential. The processing of optimum tilt angle obtained (19.86 degrees) at IIT Roorkee has been performed using XenCenter server. This helped in processing the computation-intensive tilted GHI at various tilt angles. This approach also helped in providing further expansion plan. The R-2 value between the predicted solar potential and actual generation for this study is 0.82.

TI  - Pure Tubular Carcinoma of the Breast: Is Axillary Staging Necessary?
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pure tubular carcinoma (PTC) is a rare and well-differentiated tumor of the breast with high survival and low local recurrence rate. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is routinely used but still bears 5% risk of lymphedema. This study aims to investigate axillary involvement rate and necessity of axillary staging in clinically early PTCs. Thirty-seven PTCs in 36 patients between 2010 and 2017 were evaluated retrospectively. Histopathological features, sentinel lymph node detection rate, axillary involvement, and adjuvant treatments were recorded. Median pathological tumor size was 8 (3-18) mm. Median follow-up was 58 (21-106) months. Three patients had multi-focal and one patient had multi-centric tumor. While none of the tumors exhibited lymphovascular invasion, all tumors presented ER+ and Her-2 negative. Thirty-three tumors presented PR+. Median Ki-67 was 6% (1-16%). Histologic grade was low except one patient, whereas nuclear grade was low in 12 (32%) patients and intermediate in 25 (68%) patients. SLNB was positive in two patients in whom both were micro-metastases. Thirteen tumors (35%) were found to have a tumor size of >= 10 mm, whereas 24 (65%) tumors were found to be < 1 cm. While axillary metastasis was not detected in patients with tumor < 1 cm, axillary involvement ratio was 15% in the patients with tumor PTC >= 1 cm. SLNB can be omitted for patients in whom PTC < 1 cm. However, SLNB is still recommended in suspicion of mixed tubular carcinoma or other types of invasive carcinomas, or PTC >= 1 cm in diameter.

TI  - A Preliminary Damage Assessment Using Dual Path Synthetic Aperture Radar Analysis for the M 6.4 Petrinja Earthquake (2020), Croatia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 29 December 2020, an earthquake with a magnitude of M 6.4 hit the central part of Croatia. The earthquake resulted in casualties and damaged buildings in the town of Petrinja (similar to 6 km away from the epicenter) and surrounding areas. This study aims to characterize ground displacement and to estimate the location of damaged areas following the Petrinja earthquake using six synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images (C-band) acquired from both ascending and descending orbits of the Sentinel-1 mission. Phase information from both the ascending (Sentinel-1A) and descending (Sentinel-1B) datasets, acquired from SAR interferometry (InSAR), is used for estimation of ground displacement. For damage mapping, we use histogram information along with the RGB method to visualize the affected areas. In sparsely damaged areas, we also propose a method based on multivariate alteration detection (MAD) and naive Bayes (NB), in which pre-seismic and co-seismic coherence maps and geocoded intensity maps are the main independent variables, together with elevation and displacement maps. For training, approximately 70% of the data are employed and the rest of the data are used for validation. The results show that, despite the limitations of C-band SAR images in densely vegetated areas, the overall accuracy of MAD+NB is similar to 68% compared with the results from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS).

TI  - A Scoping Review of Nature, Land, and Environmental Connectedness and Relatedness
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - The importance of nature and the environment in relation to human health is coalescing, as demonstrated by the increased research that attempts to measure nature connectedness and relatedness. These findings align with constructs of cultural connectedness that assess for land connectedness as part of Indigenous ways of knowing. From an Indigenous worldview, relationships with the environment are critical to wellbeing. The purpose of this comprehensive systematic scoping literature review was two-fold: (1) identify and summarize existing measures of land, nature, and/or environmental connectedness, relatedness, and attitudes and (2) evaluate the psychometric properties of these scales. In total, 1438 articles were retrieved from select databases including PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL (EBSCO), and Academic Search Complete (EBSCO). The final searches and application of the inclusion/exclusion criteria resulted in 57 unique articles and 38 scales categorized as connectedness and relatedness scales (n = 9 scales), attitudinal and values-based scales (n = 16 scales), cultural and spiritually based scales (n = 9 scales), and paradigm-based scales (n = 4 scales) (articles could be placed in multiple categories). Psychometric properties and general outcomes associated with nature-related scales are reported, with implications for future education, research, practice, and policy.

TI  - "Spiritual heirs of the great Protestants who gave their lives for Ireland": Expanding Irish American Nationalist Landscapes, 1919-1922
T2  - JOURNAL OF AMERICAN ETHNIC HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Overshadowed by more numerous Catholic immigrant compatriots, Irish Protestants receive scant attention in histories of post-colonial Irish settlement. This neglected dimension of the ethnic history is addressed here through a nationalist organization that supported Ireland's independence cause from an explicitly Protestant worldview. Protestant Friends of Ireland (PFI) operations reveal a more diverse and complex ethnic landscape than the historical record suggests. Despite their distancing from cultural roots across the Atlantic, ethnic Irish communities maintained interest in Ireland's political status. This article argues that the short duration of Protestant Friends campaigns between 1919 and 1922 belies their scale and impact. Ethnic contemporaries witnessed an extensive Protestant nationalist presence in PFI crusading and active recollection of Protestant Irish patriots. PFI connections embraced by Ireland's polarizing political principal, Eamon de Valera, assume a central role in this account, while the confluence of events in 1921 signaled a transition for America's Irish.

TI  - Detection of Change Points in Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites Time Series Using Multi-Sensor Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing community has extensively used Pseudo-Invariant Calibration Sites (PICS) to monitor the long-term in-flight radiometric calibration of Earth-observing satellites. The use of the PICS has an underlying assumption that these sites are invariant over time. However, the site's temporal stability has not been assured in the past. This work evaluates the temporal stability of PICS by not only detecting the trend but also locating significant shifts (change points) lying behind the time series. A single time series was formed using the virtual constellation approach in which multiple sensors data were combined for each site to achieve denser temporal coverage and overcome the limitation of dependence related to a specific sensor. The sensors used for this work were selected based on radiometric calibration uncertainty and availability of the data: operational land imager (Landsat-8), enhanced thematic mapper (Landsat-7), moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (Terra and Aqua), and multispectral instrument (Sentinel-2A). An inverse variance weighting method was applied to the Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance time series to reveal the underlying trend. The sequential Mann-Kendall test was employed upon the weighted TOA reflectance time-series recorded over 20 years to detect abrupt changes for six reflective bands. Statistically significant trends and abrupt changes have been detected for all sites, but the magnitude of the trends (maximum of 0.215% change in TOA reflectance per year) suggest that these sites are not changing substantially over time. Hence, it can be stated that despite minor changes in all evaluated PICS, they can be used for radiometric calibration of optical remote sensing sensors. The new approach provides useful results by revealing underlying trends and providing a better understanding of PICS' stability.

TI  - Paradigm of Geological Mapping of the Adiyaman Fault Zone of Eastern Turkey Using Landsat 8 Remotely Sensed Data Coupled with PCA, ICA, and MNFA Techniques
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A principal and independent component analysis (PCA and ICA) and a minimum noise fraction analysis (MNFA) were applied in this study to Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images along the Adiyaman fault zone in Eastern Turkey. These analyses indicated that the lithologic units, fault patterns, and the morphological and structural features can be mapped highly accurately by using spectral-matching techniques in regions where rocks are well exposed. An inspection of all possible band combinations indicated that the PCA 134 and 231 and the ICA 132 band combinations give the best false color composite images for identifying the lithological units and contacts. The findings of the MNFA band combinations show that the MNFA 521 band combination also is robust for discriminating the lithological units, particularly Quaternary clastic units (colluvium/alluvium). MNFA band 1 alone provides the best image for tracing the tectonic and structural elements in the study area. The new up-to-date lithologic map of the Adiyaman fault zone we produced upon the interpretation of the processed OLI images reveals several river channels that are offset and beheaded by the Adiyaman fault, which verifies its Quaternary activity. This study demonstrated that, when used with the OLI data, the PCA, ICA, and MNFA are very powerful for lithological and structural mapping in actively deforming tectonic zones and hence can be applied to other regions elsewhere in the world where the climate is arid to semiarid, and the vegetation cover is scarce.

TI  - Remote Sensing of the Carbonate Content in Irrigated Soils of the Dry Steppe Zone in Volgograd Oblast
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Data on the spatial distribution of calcium carbonates (CaCO3) in the surface layer and in the profiles of irrigated soils at two key plots of the Svetloyarsk irrigation system in Volgograd oblast are presented. The key plots are located in different natural areas of the dry-steppe zone: the Yergeni Upland and the Caspian Lowland. The fields at both plots are characterized by patchiness on satellite images both for the bare soil surface and for the vegetation cover. One of the main reasons for the patchiness on the image is the different content of carbonates in the surface soil layer. Two mechanisms of the appearance of carbonates near the surface of irrigated soils have been established. The first mechanism is related to the cutting of the soils of arching areas of micro- and mesotopography in the course of surface leveling during the construction of irrigation systems with the exposure of calcareous horizons in the middle part of the soil profile and the movement of the cut material, including carbonates, to neighboring areas. The second mechanism is the ascending migration of soil solutions to the surface layer with the deposition of carbonates during the long period of irrigation in a dry hot climate. The combined use of remote sensing data and ground-based field surveys of soils along transects that intersect areas with different patchiness and spectral brightness of the images makes it possible to identify soils with different contents of carbonates in the plow horizon.

TI  - Satellite DEM Improvement Using Multispectral Imagery and an Artificial Neural Network
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The digital elevation model (DEM) is crucial for various applications, such as land management and flood planning, as it reflects the actual topographic characteristic on the Earth's surface. However, it is quite a challenge to acquire the high-quality DEM, as it is very time-consuming, costly, and often confidential. This paper explores a DEM improvement scheme using an artificial neural network (ANN) that could improve the German Aerospace's TanDEM-X (12 m resolution). The ANN was first trained in Nice, France, with a high spatial resolution surveyed DEM (1 m) and then applied on a faraway city, Singapore, for validation. In the ANN training, Sentinel-2 and TanDEM-X data of the Nice area were used as the input data, while the ground truth observation data of Nice were used as the target data. The applicability of iTanDEM-X was finally conducted at a different site in Singapore. The trained iTanDEM-X shows a significant reduction in the root mean square error of 43.6% in Singapore. It was also found that the improvement for different land covers (e.g., vegetation and built-up areas) ranges from 20 to 65%. The paper also demonstrated the application of the trained ANN on Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where the ground truth data are not available; for cases such as this, a visual comparison with Google satellite imagery was then utilized. The DEM from iTanDEM-X with 10 m resolution categorically shows much clearer land shapes (particularly the roads and buildings).

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The land cover map is a very important data that is used as a basis for decision-making for land policy and environmental policy. The land cover map is mapped using remote sensing data, and the classification results may vary depending on the acquisition time of the data used even for the same area. In this study, to overcome the classification accuracy limit of single-period data, multi-series satellite images were used to learn the difference in the spectral reflectance characteristics of the land surface according to seasons on a U-Net model, one of the deep learning algorithms, to improve classification accuracy. In addition, the degree of improvement in classification accuracy is compared by comparing the accuracy of single-period data. Seoul, which consists of various land covers including 30% of green space and the Han River within the area, was set as the research target and quarterly Sentinel-2 satellite images for 2020 were aquired. The U-Net model was trained using the sub-class land cover map mapped by the Korean Ministry of Environment. As a result of learning and classifying the model into single-period, double-series, triple-series, and quadruple-series through the learned U-Net model, it showed an accuracy of 81%, 82% and 79%, which exceeds the standard for securing land cover classification accuracy of 75%, except for a single-period. Through this, it was confirmed that classification accuracy can be improved through multi-series classification.

TI  - The Use of InSAR Phase Coherence Analyses for the Monitoring of Aeolian Erosion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aeolian erosion occurring in sand deserts causes significant socio-economical threats over extensive areas through mineral dust storm generation and soil degradation. To monitor a sequence of aeolian erosion in a sand desert area, we developed an approach fusing a set of remote sensing data. Vegetation index and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) phase coherence derived from space-borne optical/SAR remote sensing data were used. This scheme was applied to Kubuqi Desert in Inner Mongolia where the effects of activity to combat desertification could be used to verify the outcome of the approach. We first established time series phase coherence and conducted a functional operation based on principal component analysis (PCA) to remove uncorrelated noise. Then, through decomposition of vegetation effect, where a regression model together with the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was employed, we estimated surface migration caused by aeolian interaction, that is, the aeolian erosion rate (AER). AER metrics were normalized and validated by additional satellite and ground data. As a result, the spatiotemporal migration of the target environment, which certainly induced dust storm generation, was traced and analyzed based on the correlations among surface characteristics. It was revealed that the derived AER successfully monitored the surface changes that occurred before and after the activities to combat desertification in the target area. Employing the established observation scheme, we expect a better understanding of the aeolian process in sand deserts with enhanced spatio-temporal resolution. In addition, the scheme will be beneficial for the evaluation of combating desertification activities and early warning of dust storm generations.

TI  - An Implementation of OTB Extension to Produce TOA and TOC Reflectance of LANDSAT-8 OLI Images and Its Product Verification Using RadCalNet RVUS Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis Ready Data (ARD) for optical satellite images represents a pre-processed product by applying spectral characteristics and viewing parameters for each sensor. The atmospheric correction is one of the fundamental and complicated topics, which helps to produce Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) and Top-of-Canopy (TOC) reflectance from multi-spectral image sets. Most remote sensing software provides algorithms or processing schemes dedicated to those corrections of the Landsat-8 OLI sensors. Furthermore, Google Earth Engine (GEE), provides direct access to Landsat reflectance products, USGS-based ARD (USGS-ARD), on the cloud environment. We implemented the Orfeo ToolBox (OTB) atmospheric correction extension, an open-source remote sensing software for manipulating and analyzing high-resolution satellite images. This is the first tool because OTB has not provided calibration modules for any Landsat sensors. Using this extension software, we conducted the absolute atmospheric correction on the Landsat-8 OLI images of Railroad Valley, United States (RVUS) to validate their reflectance products using reflectance data sets of RVUS in the RadCalNet portal. The results showed that the reflectance products using the OTB extension for Landsat revealed a difference by less than 5% compared to RadCalNet RVUS data. In addition, we performed a comparative analysis with reflectance products obtained from other open-source tools such as a QGIS semi-automatic classification plugin and SAGA, besides USGS-ARD products. The reflectance products by the OTB extension showed a high consistency to those of USGS-ARD within the acceptable level in the measurement data range of the RadCalNet RVUS, compared to those of the other two open-source tools. In this study, the verification of the atmospheric calibration processor in OTB extension was carried out, and it proved the application possibility for other satellite sensors in the Compact Advanced Satellite (CAS)-500 or new optical satellites.

TI  - A Comparison between Multiple Satellite AOD Products Using AERONET Sun Photometer Observations in South Korea: Case Study of MODIS, VIIRS, Himawari-8, and Sentinel-3
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Because aerosols have different spectral characteristics according to the size and composition of the particle and to the satellite sensors, a comparative analysis of aerosol products from various satellite sensors is required. In South Korea, however, a comprehensive study for the comparison of various official satellite AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) products for a long period is not easily found. In this paper, we aimed to assess the performance of the AOD products from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite), Himawari-8, and Sentinel-3 by referring to the AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) sun photometer observations for the period between January 2015 and December 2019. Seasonal and geographical characteristics of the accuracy of satellite AOD were also analyzed. The MODIS products, which were accumulated for a long time and optimized by the new MAIAC (Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction) algorithm, showed the best accuracy (CC 0.836) and were followed by the products from VIIRS and Himawari-8. On the other hand, Sentinel-3 AOD did not appear to have a good quality because it was recently launched and not sufficiently optimized yet, according to ESA (European Space Agency). The AOD of MODIS, VMS, and Himawari-8 did not show a significant difference in accuracy according to season and to urban vs. non-urban regions, but the mixed pixel problem was partly found in a few coastal regions. Because AOD is an essential component for atmospheric correction, the result of this study can be a reference to the future work for the atmospheric correction for the Korean CAS (Compact Advanced Satellite) series.

TI  - Ecological and Economic Principles of Use and Reproduction of Natural Recreational Resources in the Context of the Postmodern Consciousness
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article highlights the importance of the worldview (postmodern) aspect in solving the problems of using and recreating Ukrainian natural recreational resources on the example of the Carpathian macro-region. It shows that ecological, economic and social principles of the use of natural recreational resources, issues of their protection, especially in the Carpathian macro-region as the main natural tourist destination of Ukraine, remain insufficiently studied. The purpose of the study is the theoretical and methodological justification of ecological and economic principles of use and reproduction of natural recreational resources and the development of practical recommendations for their implementation, taking into account the trends and contradictions of the postmodern consciousness.The scheme of realization of process of reproduction of natural recreational resources which provides such unity of economic, social and ecological components for maintenance of sustainable development of the market of recreational services is offered. There are two areas of ecological and economic principles of reproduction of natural recreational resources: intra-industry, which characterizes their reproduction within the recreational sphere of the economy and intersectoral, which relates to recreationally attractive natural resources, which at the time of study are subject to economic activities in other areas. The article proves that the above-mentioned directions of recreating natural recreational resources will be effective under the conditions of transforming the postcolonial consciousness in the region's residents and the users of its recreational potential.

TI  - Plot-Based Classification of Macronutrient Levels in Oil Palm Trees with Landsat-8 Images and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm crops are essential for ensuring sustainable edible oil production, in which production is highly dependent on fertilizer applications. Using Landsat-8 imageries, the feasibility of macronutrient level classification with Machine Learning (ML) was studied. Variable rates of compost and inorganic fertilizer were applied to experimental plots and the following nutrients were studied: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca). By applying image filters, separability metrics, vegetation indices (VI) and feature selection, spectral features for each plot were acquired and used with ML models to classify macronutrient levels of palm stands from chemical foliar analysis of their 17th frond. The models were calibrated and validated with 30 repetitions, with the best mean overall accuracy reported for N and K at 79.7 +/- 4.3% and 76.6 +/- 4.1% respectively, while accuracies for P, Mg and Ca could not be accurately classified due to the limitations of the dataset used. The study highlighted the effectiveness of separability metrics in quantifying class separability, the importance of indices for N and K level classification, and the effects of filter and feature selection on model performance, as well as concluding RF or SVM models for excessive N and K level detection. Future improvements should focus on further model validation and the use of higher-resolution imaging.

TI  - Gogol's Dead Souls in the Literary Interpretation of Mikhail Bulgakov
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the urgent issue of a contemporary work of art interacting with the text of a classical work. The subject-matter of the study is the intertextual game strategy in the artistic interpretation of Gogol's poem Dead Souls performed by Mikhail Bulgakov. The material of the study is Bulgakov's two texts (the feuilleton "The Adventures of Chichikov" and the play Dead Souls) and Gogol's Dead Souls (the original work), The Government Inspector, St. Petersburg tales, and the cycle Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka. The methodology of the article is based on the concept of dialogism belonging to Mikhail Bakhtin and on the hermeneutic phenomenology of Paul Ricoeur. Also, the article uses the methodology of "The Open Work" theory by Umberto Eco, based on the ideas of Yuri Lotman about a classical text that generates meanings and needs an interpreter. To analyze literary texts, the principles of literary hermeneutics, receptive aesthetics, structural, semiotic, cultural, and historical methods are used. The feuilleton "The Adventures of Chichikov" by Bulgakov is an intertextual game interpretation of Gogol's Dead Souls, and it is based on the use of specific techniques that Gogol employed in his poetics. Relying on the devices of Gogol's stylistic grotesque, Bulgakov combines poetic and formal words, which highlights the absurdity of the developing Soviet "newspeak" and the absurdity of the Soviet ideology. The appeal to the image of the rogue Chichikov and the theme of devilry allows us to correlate Bulgakov's feuilleton with a number of rogue novels of the 1920s (Ilya Ehrenburg's The Extraordinary Adventures of Julio Jurenito and His Disciples, Aleksey N. Tolstoy's The Adventures of Nevzorov, or Ibicus). Bulgakov's play Dead Souls, being as close as possible to its pretext, is more grotesque in character, which is explained by the specific worldview of the modernist writer. The game potential of the play, which is realized at all the levels of the text (semantic, stylistic, communicative, pragmatic ones), conveys a special atmosphere of Gogol's artistic world and builds a situation of dialogue between the minds of two time-separated writers. Creating the feuilleton "The Adventures of Chichikov" and the play Dead Souls, Bulgakov fills the well-known literary frame with a new content that corresponds to the ethical and aesthetic priorities of his time. Bulgakov's appeal to Gogol's poetics of grotesque creates a special style, consonant with the post-revolutionary era of ideological deformations that gave rise to the phenomenon of the Soviet "newspeak". Developing the theme of devilry that is cross-cutting for Gogol, Bulgakov conveys the atmosphere of the social and historical chaos of the 1920s. In addition, through the strategy of artistic interpretation, Bulgakov the artist reflects on the fate of his great predecessor and his works.

TI  - Epidemiology and genetic characterization of respiratory syncytial virus in children with acute respiratory infections: Findings from the influenza sentinel surveillance network in Central African Republic, 2015 to 2018
T2  - HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and aims Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the main viral pathogens causing acute respiratory infections in children under 5 years of age but has seldom been studied in Central African Republic (CAF). Taking advantage of the national influenza surveillance network in CAF, this study aimed at providing the first insights into RSV prevalence and seasonality over 4 years of surveillance and the clinical manifestations of RSV in this population in CAF. Methods A total of 3903 children under 5 years matching the influenza-like illness (ILI, 68.5%) or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI, 31.5%) case definitions were recruited from January 2015 to December 2018. The presence of RSV viral RNA in nasopharyngeal samples was assessed by RT-PCR, followed by RSV-A and RSV-B typing and Sanger sequencing on a subset of samples. Phylogenetic analyses were carried on partial G protein sequences. Associations between RSV and demographic or clinical manifestations were investigated by statistical analyses. Results RSV prevalence was significantly higher in infants <6 months (13.4%), in hospitalized children (13.3% vs 5.5%) and in male patients (9.5% vs 6.4%). An overall prevalence of RSV of 8.0% in the period of 2015 to 2018 was shown, with significant annual (6.4%-10.6%) and seasonal (12.7% in rainy season vs 3.0% in dry season) fluctuations. While RSV seasons in 2015, 2016, and 2018 were relatively similar, 2017 showed deviations from the overall patterns with significantly higher RSV circulation and an outbreak peak 3 to 5 months earlier. Concomitant circulation of RSV-A and RSV-B with an alternating predominance of RSV-A and RSV-B strains and temporal RSV-A genotype replacement from NA1 to ON1 was observed. Conclusion This study represents the first in-depth epidemiological analysis of RSV in CAF and provides first insights into RSV genetic diversity and seasonality in the country.

TI  - Forward link outage performance of aeronautical broadband satellite communications
T2  - FRONTIERS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-throughput satellites (HTSs) play an important role in future millimeter-wave (mmWave) aeronautical communication to meet high speed and broad bandwidth requirements. This paper investigates the outage performance of an aeronautical broadband satellite communication system's forward link, where the feeder link from the gateway to the HTS uses free-space optical (FSO) transmission and the user link from the HTS to aircraft operates at the mmWave band. In the user link, spot beam technology is exploited at the HTS and a massive antenna array is deployed at the aircraft. We first present a location-based beamforming (BF) scheme to maximize the expected output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the forward link with the amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol, which turns out to be a phased array. Then, by supposing that the FSO feeder link follows Gamma-Gamma fading whereas the mmWave user link experiences shadowed Rician fading, we take the influence of the phase error into account, and derive the closed-form expression of the outage probability (OP) for the considered system. To gain further insight, a simple asymptotic OP expression at a high SNR is provided to show the diversity order and coding gain. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to confirm the validity of the theoretical analysis and reveal the effects of phase errors on the system outage performance.

TI  - "Hoffmann's Text" in the Works of Russian Symbolists
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article aims to distinguish between the theory of intertextuality (R. Barthes, J. Kristeva) and the theory of supertexts (V.N. Toporov, N.E. Mednis, N.A. Kuzmina) in the concept "Hoffmann's text of Russian literature". The hypothesis is that "Hoffmann's text" was formed in the first half of the 19th century in the works of A. Pogorelsky, N. Gogol, F. Dostoevsky, and others, and it consists of motifs, images, and stylistic techniques typical for the German writer, a mythologized image of the writer himself and his characters. In the Silver Age, symbolists express the totality of Hoffmann's problems, images and stylistic techniques in the form of an ideological and thematic "Hoffmann's complex". The complex includes a synthesis of arts, romantic irony and grotesque, psychologism, thematization of the problem of mechanization of life and man realized in the images-symbols of a mask, a doll, a puppet, a double, and a mirror, and is characterized by the integrity of the reproduced content. Awareness of "Hoffmann's complex" as a whole and its reinterpretation is oserved in the works of V. Bryusov, A. Blok, A. Bely, F. Sologub, Z. Gippius, D. Merezhkovsky, and others. In works of small and medium genres, one of the elements of the complex is used: doubleness (A. Bely's "Story #2"), mirroring (Z. Gippius' Mirrors, V. Bryusov's In the Mirror), animating the inanimate (L. Andreev's "Thought"). In the symbolist novel, "Hoffmann's complex" is presented systemically (F. Sologub's The Petty Demon, A. Bely's Petersburg). An important aspect of the article is the analysis of the transformation of "Hoffmann's complex" in the works of symbolists. The technique of "animating the inanimate" also applies to abstract concepts (silence, lies, thought). The image of a mirror symbolizes a departure from reality (Z. Gippius' Mirrors, A. Bely's Petersburg). The mask and costume gain power over the person. Hoffmann's doubleness is manifested in symbolists' works in the reception of the "doubling of reality" (V. Bryusov's "Flat", A. Bely's Petersburg). The synthesis of arts is reflected in the attempt to connect the word with music (A. Bely's Symphonies, Petersburg). Following Hoffmann, symbolists base their worldview on "destructive" irony. "Hoffmann's complex" is also becoming a key element in the dramatic art of the Silver Age. Hoffmann's irony and grotesque are transformed into self-irony and self-fertility in the comic plays of V. Solovyov. The idea of synthesis of arts formed the basis of the "musical" organization of narration in A. Bely's Symphonies. "Hoffmann's complex" is fully revealed in the dramatic works of A. Blok (The Puppet Show, The Rose and the Cross). Symbolist dramas of Andreev enrich the complex with new techniques (abstract concepts as acting characters). Russian literature and literary life were influenced by the active functioning of "Hoffmann's complex" at the turn of the 20th century.

TI  - Surgical treatment and fertility perservation in endometrial cancer
T2  - RADIOLOGY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background. Endometrial cancer (EC) represents a high health burden in Slovenia and worldwide. The incidence is increasing due to lifestyle and behavioural risk factors such as obesity, smoking, oestrogen exposure and aging of the population. In many cases, endometrial cancer is diagnosed at an early stage due to obvious signs and symptoms. The standard treatment is surgery with or without adjuvant therapy, depending on the stage of the disease and the risk of recurrence. However, treatment modalities have changed in the last decades, considerably in the extent of lymphadenectomy.Conclusions. The gold standard of treatment for is surgery, which may be the only treatment modality in the early stages of low-grade tumours. In recent years, a minimally invasive approach with sentinel node biopsy (SNB) has been proposed. A conservative approach with hormonal treatment is used if fertility preservation is desired. If EC is in advance stage, high-risk histology, or high grade, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of both is recommended.

TI  - PROPAGATION ANALYSIS OF PU RADIONUCLIDES AS A RESULT OF FIRE INCIDENTS IN THE EXCLUSION ZONE OF THE CHERNOBYL NPP IN APRIL 2020
T2  - EAST EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In consequence of nuclear accidents that have occurred in various parts of the world, radioactive contamination of the environment is observed. The risks of spreading pollution can increase during floods, fires and some natural disasters. The lack of effective measures that aimed at eliminating possible sources of fire in the meadow zone and forest lands in the Chernobyl exclusion zone (ChEZ) leads to a high risk of fire emergence. The temporal and spatial distribution of fires shows that they occur throughout the ChEZ, including in the most contaminated areas. The risk of fires increases with climate change and measures to prevent them should be considered in emergency programs. ChEZ area is contaminated with long-lived radionuclides such as Cs-137, Sr-90, Pu isotopes (Pu-238, Pu239 + 240, Pu-241) and Am-241. As a result of forest fires radionuclides contained in wood and underlying surface are carried out into the atmosphere along with smoke. Diseases arising under the influence of ionizing radiation from Pu and 241Am isotopes pose a serious problem for human health. To assess of the spatial distribution of Pu isotopes and Am-241 we used data on forest fires that occurred in the Chernobyl zone in April 2020. To evaluat. the dynamics of the release of radioactive substances into the atmosphere during fire incidents on the ChEZ territory, the following software products were used: NASA WorldView, HYSPLIT program. The HYSPLIT program allows to reconstruct the trajectories of radionuclide propagation in the atmosphere using meteorological data and to obtain a reliable picture of the distribution of radionuclides in the study area. The maps of the volumetric activity of Pu isotopes in the air and the fallout on the soil as a result of fires were obtained. It was found that the radioactivity due to the presence of this element in the air and during the fallout of radioactive particles on the soil is low (it reaches 1.0E-7...0.1 Bq/m(3) in the air, 1.0E-6...1 Bq/m(2) on the soil). The analysis of the propagation of Pu isotopes as a result of the movement of air masses in the places of fires in the exclusion zone of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the associated dangers for the population and the environment has been carried out.

M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the study is to try to make sense of the changes in photography. The problem of research is the lack of a position in modern cultural studies on the essence of photography. The problem is methodological.The aim of the study is to study approaches to photography and their evolution. Research methods are associated with philosophical and cultural analysis of the problem.There are several approaches to studying photography. The author chooses those of them that will reveal the problem of changing the relationship to the essence of photography in the cultural and philosophical aspect. Susan Sontag says that photography takes on the importance of social ritual and is perceived as an instrument of self-approval. Andre Rouille defines the place of photography in modern culture and speaks of it as a certain cultural phenomenon, art technology. Here, Rouille contrasts his theoretical grounds with the views of Roland Barth. Rouille says that photography has universality, a total manifestation in culture, Bart, on the contrary, claims that photography is an object, the photograph itself contains an object that the photograph displays.Based on different views on the problem of the essence of photography, the author proposed a number of figure of merit by which it will be possible to trace the evolution of scientific approaches to the study of photography. Thus, three main figure of merit were developed, the first of which considers photography as part of culture. Photography becomes woven into the modern cultural layer, thanks to technological innovations. It ceases to be perceived as a separate document, but is seen by each user as an integral part of everyday life. The new digital culture dictates changes in the field of visual language. On the other hand, photography also remains part of art, this is the second criterion. The creative methods of artists, photographers are expanding significantly in modern art, photography is becoming part of many artistic practices. The third criterion is related to the philosophical understanding of the essence of photography. Many researchers aim to identify the primary basis of the photographic image.The findings of the study are related to the fact that photography is experiencing essential changes in connection with the advent of digital culture. Photography takes on the shade of a social element, which allows it to be part of a person's everyday culture. There is a significant transition from a document to a certain element of public relations. Its active manifestation in mass culture, social networks speaks of the importance of photography for modern culture. Ideas about photography are associated with the socio-cultural context of its existence. Susan Sontag in the second half of the 20th century spoke of photography as an integral part of social relations, today photography is perceived as a tool for constructing the worldview of modern man, it is said about her influence on aesthetics, the formation of a different reality.

TI  - Framework for Spatial and Temporal Monitoring of Urban Forest and Vegetation Conditions: Case Study Zagreb, Croatia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forest and vegetation conditions are an important variable in urban ecosystem management decision-making. However, it is difficult to evaluate and monitor solely on the basis of field measurements. Remote sensing technologies can greatly contribute to the faster extraction and mapping of vegetation health status indicators, on the basis of which agronomy and forestry experts can draw conclusions about the condition of urban vegetation in larger areas. A new remote sensing-based urban forest and vegetation cover monitoring framework is presented and applied to a case study of the city of Zagreb, Croatia. In this study, Sentinel-2 multi-temporal imagery was used to derive and analyze the current state of urban forest cover. Vegetation indices (NDVI, RVI, and GRVI) were calculated. K-means unsupervised classification of the vegetation indices was conducted. In this way, the dimensionality of the vegetation indices was reduced, while all the data contained in it were used to represent their graded values. Vegetation that was in a poor condition stood out better that way. Finally, PCA-based change detection was performed on the vegetation indices graded values, and a map of change was produced. These results need to be interpreted and validated by foresters and agronomists in further research.

M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are one of the key indicators of present and past climatic variations, which responses in the form of retreat or advancement. The frontal characteristics of glaciers constitute the important aspect of glaciological studies and the data obtained gives overall pictures about behaviour of glacier and effect of climate. Due to limitation of satellite data and difficulty in demarcation of actual glacier termini on satellite images, the ground-based monitoring of glaciers fronts and their comparative study with past satellite images were carried out on three glaciers viz. Miyar, Takdung and Uldhampu glaciers, situated in Miyar basin, Lahaul & Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh. This paper presents recessional parameters of glaciers based on field survey and historical satellite images. The studies indicate that the snout of Miyar, Takdung and Uldhampu glaciers have retreated by 1205 m (1962-2017), 270 m (1989-2017) and 130 m (1989-2017) by vacating an area of 0.76, 0.063 and 0.035 square kilometre respectively. Climatic data from 1989-2002 was utilized to correlate recessional trend of all studied glaciers, the precipitation and temperature data supports the given retreat trend by rise in average temperature and lowering precipitation values over data range.

TI  - Reconstructing the Coles Creek Settlement System: The View from the Hinterlands
T2  - MIDCONTINENTAL JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Archaeological investigations in the Lower Mississippi Valley continue to demonstrate a penchant for studying mound-and-plaza sites at the expense of the less conspicuous villages and hamlets where the majority of the populace is presumed to have resided. Acknowledging this bias, this article contributes a comparative study of 10 nonmound Terminal Woodland period Coles Creek sites. Following a site-by-site discussion, a preliminary characterization of the complete Late Woodland settlement system is presented, focusing on site size, site layout, and immediate environment. The results underscore the importance of determining whether Coles Creek communities were organized as part of a settlement hierarchy or heterarchy, which has far-ranging implications that affect how we interpret everything from subsistence economics and sociopolitical organization to meanings, beliefs, and worldview of the residents of this region during late prehistory.

TI  - A Quantitative Validation of Multi-Modal Image Fusion and Segmentation for Object Detection and Tracking
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In previous works, we have shown the efficacy of using Deep Belief Networks, paired with clustering, to identify distinct classes of objects within remotely sensed data via cluster analysis and qualitative analysis of the output data in comparison with reference data. In this paper, we quantitatively validate the methodology against datasets currently being generated and used within the remote sensing community, as well as show the capabilities and benefits of the data fusion methodologies used. The experiments run take the output of our unsupervised fusion and segmentation methodology and map them to various labeled datasets at different levels of global coverage and granularity in order to test our models' capabilities to represent structure at finer and broader scales, using many different kinds of instrumentation, that can be fused when applicable. In all cases tested, our models show a strong ability to segment the objects within input scenes, use multiple datasets fused together where appropriate to improve results, and, at times, outperform the pre-existing datasets. The success here will allow this methodology to be used within use concrete cases and become the basis for future dynamic object tracking across datasets from various remote sensing instruments.

TI  - <i>Prevotella melaninogenica</i>, a Sentinel Species of Antibiotic Resistance in Cystic Fibrosis Respiratory Niche?
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance and abundance of strict anaerobic bacteria in the respiratory microbiota of people with cystic fibrosis (PWCF) is now established through studies based on high-throughput sequencing or extended-culture methods. In CF respiratory niche, one of the most prevalent anaerobic genera is Prevotella, and particularly the species Prevotella melaninogenica. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibiotic susceptibility of this anaerobic species. Fifty isolates of P. melaninogenica cultured from sputum of 50 PWCF have been included. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using the agar diffusion method. All isolates were susceptible to the following antibiotics: amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem and metronidazole. A total of 96% of the isolates (48/50) were resistant to amoxicillin (indicating beta-lactamase production), 34% to clindamycin (17/50) and 24% to moxifloxacin (12/50). Moreover, 10% (5/50) were multidrug-resistant. A significant and positive correlation was found between clindamycin resistance and chronic azithromycin administration. This preliminary study on a predominant species of the lung "anaerobiome" shows high percentages of resistance, potentially exacerbated by the initiation of long-term antibiotic therapy in PWCF. The anaerobic resistome characterization, focusing on species rather than genera, is needed in the future to better prevent the emergence of resistance within lung microbiota.

TI  - The Rotavirus Surveillance System in Yemen: Evaluation Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Rotavirus (RV) kills over 185,000 children <5 years every year and is responsible for over one-third of all child diarrheal deaths worldwide. The Rotavirus Surveillance System (RVSS) in Yemen was launched in 2007 at five sentinel sites to monitor the impact of the vaccine on RV morbidity and mortality. Objective: This study aimed to determine the usefulness of the RVSS, assess its performance, and identify the strengths and weaknesses of its implementation. Methods: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's updated guidelines on evaluating a public health surveillance system were used to evaluate the RVSS. In this assessment, qualitative indicators, such as usefulness, flexibility, stability, simplicity, and acceptability, were assessed through in-depth interviews with stakeholders at the central level and semistructured questionnaires with the sentinel site coordinators. The indicators for quantitative attributes-sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), completeness, and timeliness-were assessed by reviewing the results of laboratory samples and a random sample of case report forms. The scores for the indicators were expressed as poor (<60%), average (60% to <80%), and good (>= 80%). Results: The overall usefulness score of the RVSS was 73%, indicating an average rank. The RVSS was rated as having good flexibility (91%) and stability (81%), and average simplicity (77%) and acceptability (76%). In terms of quantitative attributes, the system was poor for sensitivity (16%), average for PPV (73%), and good for completeness (100%) and timeliness (100%). Conclusions: Although the system attributes were flexible, stable, capable of providing quality data, and performing timely data reporting, some attributes still needed improvements (eg, usefulness, simplicity, acceptability, and PPV). There is a need for a gradual replacement of donor funds with government funds to ensure sustainability. The RVSS in Yemen strongly requires a progressive increase in the number of sites in governorates and sensitivity enhancement.

TI  - Multitemporal Mapping of Post-Fire Land Cover Using Multiplatform PRISMA Hyperspectral and Sentinel-UAV Multispectral Data: Insights from Case Studies in Portugal and Italy
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires have affected global forests and the Mediterranean area with increasing recurrency and intensity in the last years, with climate change resulting in reduced precipitations and higher temperatures. To assess the impact of wildfires on the environment, burned area mapping has become progressively more relevant. Initially carried out via field sketches, the advent of satellite remote sensing opened new possibilities, reducing the cost uncertainty and safety of the previous techniques. In the present study an experimental methodology was adopted to test the potential of advanced remote sensing techniques such as multispectral Sentinel-2, PRISMA hyperspectral satellite, and UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) remotely-sensed data for the multitemporal mapping of burned areas by soil-vegetation recovery analysis in two test sites in Portugal and Italy. In case study one, innovative multiplatform data classification was performed with the correlation between Sentinel-2 RBR (relativized burn ratio) fire severity classes and the scene hyperspectral signature, performed with a pixel-by-pixel comparison leading to a converging classification. In the adopted methodology, RBR burned area analysis and vegetation recovery was tested for accordance with biophysical vegetation parameters (LAI, fCover, and fAPAR). In case study two, a UAV-sensed NDVI index was adopted for high-resolution mapping data collection. At a large scale, the Sentinel-2 RBR index proved to be efficient for burned area analysis, from both fire severity and vegetation recovery phenomena perspectives. Despite the elapsed time between the event and the acquisition, PRISMA hyperspectral converging classification based on Sentinel-2 was able to detect and discriminate different spectral signatures corresponding to different fire severity classes. At a slope scale, the UAV platform proved to be an effective tool for mapping and characterizing the burned area, giving clear advantage with respect to filed GPS mapping. Results highlighted that UAV platforms, if equipped with a hyperspectral sensor and used in a synergistic approach with PRISMA, would create a useful tool for satellite acquired data scene classification, allowing for the acquisition of a ground truth.

TI  - Mapping the Extent of Mangrove Ecosystem Degradation by Integrating an Ecological Conceptual Model with Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic and natural disturbances can cause degradation of ecosystems, reducing their capacity to sustain biodiversity and provide ecosystem services. Understanding the extent of ecosystem degradation is critical for estimating risks to ecosystems, yet there are few existing methods to map degradation at the ecosystem scale and none using freely available satellite data for mangrove ecosystems. In this study, we developed a quantitative classification model of mangrove ecosystem degradation using freely available earth observation data. Crucially, a conceptual model of mangrove ecosystem degradation was established to identify suitable remote sensing variables that support the quantitative classification model, bridging the gap between satellite-derived variables and ecosystem degradation with explicit ecological links. We applied our degradation model to two case-studies, the mangroves of Rakhine State, Myanmar, which are severely threatened by anthropogenic disturbances, and Shark River within the Everglades National Park, USA, which is periodically disturbed by severe tropical storms. Our model suggested that 40% (597 km(2)) of the extent of mangroves in Rakhine showed evidence of degradation. In the Everglades, the model suggested that the extent of degraded mangrove forest increased from 5.1% to 97.4% following the Category 4 Hurricane Irma in 2017. Quantitative accuracy assessments indicated the model achieved overall accuracies of 77.6% and 79.1% for the Rakhine and the Everglades, respectively. We highlight that using an ecological conceptual model as the basis for building quantitative classification models to estimate the extent of ecosystem degradation ensures the ecological relevance of the classification models. Our developed method enables researchers to move beyond only mapping ecosystem distribution to condition and degradation as well. These results can help support ecosystem risk assessments, natural capital accounting, and restoration planning and provide quantitative estimates of ecosystem degradation for new global biodiversity targets.

TI  - Comparison of Multi-angle TerraSAR-X Staring Mode Image Registration Method through Coarse to Fine Step
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the recent increase in available high-resolution (< similar to 1 m) satellite SAR images, the demand for precise registration of SAR images is increasing in various fields including change detection. The registration between high-resolution SAR images acquired in different look angle is difficult due to speckle noise and geometric distortion caused by the characteristics of SAR images. In this study, registration is performed in two stages, coarse and fine, using the x-band SAR data imaged at staring spotlight mode of TerraSAR-X. For the coarse registration, a method combining the adaptive sampling method and SAR-SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) is applied, and three rigid methods (NCC: Normalized Cross Correlation, Phase Congruency-NCC, MI: Mutual Information) and one non-rigid (Gefolki: Geoscience extended Flow Optical Flow Lucas-Kanade Iterative), for the fine registration stage, was performed for performance comparison. The results were compared by using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and FSIM (Feature Similarity) index, and all rigid models showed poor results in all image combinations. It is confirmed that the rigid models have a large registration error in the rugged terrain area. As a result of applying the Gefolki algorithm, it was confirmed that the RMSE of Gefolki showed the best result as a 1 similar to 3 pixels, and the FSIM index also obtained a higher value than 0.02 similar to 0.03 compared to other rigid methods. It was confirmed that the mis-registration due to terrain effect could be sufficiently reduced by the Gefolki algorithm.

TI  - Accuracy improvement of DEM Using Ground Coordinates Package
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to correct the provided RPC and DEM generated from the high-resolution satellite images, the acquisition of the ground control point (GCP) must be preceded. This task is a very complicate that requires field surveys, GPS surveying, and image coordinate reading corresponding to GCPs. In addition, since it is difficult to set up and measure a GCP in areas where access is difficult or impossible (tidal flats, polar regions, volcanic regions, etc.), an alternative method is needed. In this paper, we propose a 3D surface matching technique using only the established ground coordinate package, avoiding the ground-image-location survey of the GCP to correct the DEM produced from WorldView-2 satellite images and the provided RPCs. The location data of the public control points were obtained from the National Geographic Information Institute website, and the DEM was corrected by performing 3D surface matching with this package. The accuracy of 3-axis translation and rotation obtained by the matching was evaluated using pm-measured GPS checkpoints. As a result, it was possible to obtain results within 2 m in the plane location and 1 m in height.

TI  - Early Estimation of Rice Cultivation in Gimje-si Using Sentinel-1 and UAV imagery
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice production with adequate level of area is important for decision making of rice supply and demand policy. It is essential to grasp rice cultivation areas in advance for estimating rice production of the year. This study was carried out to classify paddy rice cultivation in Gimje-si using sentinel-1 SAR (synthetic aperture radar) and UAV imagery in early July. Time-series Sentinel-1A and 1B images acquired from early May to early July were processed to convert into sigma naught (dB) images using SNAP (SeNtinel application platform, Version 8.0) toolbox provided by European Space Agency. Farm map and parcel map, which are spatial data of vector polygon, were used to stratify paddy field population for classifying rice paddy cultivation. To distinguish paddy rice from other crops grown in the paddy fields, we used the decision tree method using threshold levels and random forest model. Random forest model, trained by mainly rice cultivation area and rice and soybean cultivation area in UAV image area, showed the best performance as overall accuracy 89.9%, Kappa coefficient 0.774. Through this, we were able to confirm the possibility of early estimation of rice cultivation area in Gimje-si using UAV image.

TI  - Estimation and Compensation of Turbulent Tropospheric Delay in High-Resolution SAR Image
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a typical propagation error, tropospheric delay has been fully considered during synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry and differential interferometry, while the influence on the SAR imaging process is just concerned in advanced configurations, e.g., staring mode, high-resolution, geosynchronous/geostationary (GEO) SAR. In this article, a comprehensive model of turbulent tropospheric delay (TTD), involving atmospheric sciences and fluid mechanics, is introduced, and the influence of which on high-resolution SAR is analyzed. In order to compensate for the influence of TTD in advanced SAR missions, the autofocus method used in motion error compensation is extended, and a 2-D phase error estimation and compensation algorithm is proposed. Subsequently, the simulation experiments of both dot-matrix targets and TerraSAR-X data are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Conclusions and prospects are reached in the end.

TI  - The Modified Normalized Urban Area Composite Index: A Satelliate-Derived High-Resolution Index for Extracting Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and efficient extraction of urban areas is of great significance for better understanding of urban sprawl, built environment, economic activities, and population distribution. Night-Time Light (NTL) data have been widely used to extract urban areas. However, most of the existing NTL indexes are incapable of identifying non-luminous built-up areas. The high-resolution NTL imagery derived from the Luojia 1-01 satellite, with low saturation and the blooming effect, can be used to map urban areas at a finer scale. A new urban spectral index, named the Modified Normalized Urban Areas Composite Index (MNUACI), improved upon the existing Normalized Urban Areas Composite Index (NUACI), was proposed in this study, which integrated the Human Settlement Index (HSI) generated from Luojia 1-01 NTL data, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Landsat 8 imagery, and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI). Our results indicated that MNUACI improved the spatial variability and differentiation of urban components by eliminating the NTL blooming effect and increasing the variation of the nighttime luminosity. Compared to urban area classification from Landsat 8 data, the MNUACI yielded better accuracy than NTL, NUACI, HSI, and the EVI-Adjusted NTL Index (EANTLI) alone. Furthermore, the quadratic polynomial regression analysis showed the model based on MNUACI had the best R-2 and Root-Mean Square Error (RMSE) compared with NTL, NUACI, HSI, and EANTLI in terms of estimation of impervious surface area. It is concluded that MNUACI could improve the identification of urban areas and non-luminous built-up areas with better accuracy.

TI  - Ecological Functions and Human Activity Interference Evaluation in Ecological Protection Redline for Urban Environment
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The influences of ecological protection redlines on urban sustainable development can significantly vary from place to place with distinct ecological functions and human activity interference. However, recent research lacks the evaluation of ecological functions and human activity interference in ecological protection redline areas near urban areas. This article presents an evaluation method consisting of two evaluation criteria systems: an ecological function evaluation criteria system based on conserving water resources and soil and maintaining biodiversity and a human activity interference evaluation criteria system based on the human activity impact index, population and road network density, and the intensity of tourism activity and livelihood sewage discharge. This evaluation method was verified in Zoige County, China, by using remote sensing data to evaluate ecological functions and human activity interference in the ecological redline area for an urban environment. This evaluation method is one of the preliminary studies of urban sustainable development planning, and the result could provide a basis for the formulation of urban sustainable development strategy.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - A new single-stage deep convolution detection network is proposed to solve the complex background problem of night light remote sensing. Firstly, a classification network is designed by extracting high-dimensional features and then selecting features, and the influence of different channel number networks of noise reduction is studied. A prior box matching of gray-scale energy is proposed,inputting a low-noise and high-quality matching box into SSD detection network, and the idea of integral diagram is used to simplify the calculation. By adding sequential connection and dense connection to improve the global semantic module, the cross layered information interaction of the network is introduced, and its attention map comprehensively considers the high and low receptive fields to effectively distinguish small targets and background noise. Experimental results of the night light remote sensing data set show that the designed network has advantages over the rest single-stage network, which has a better detection effect of the building area under the complex background.

TI  - Tracking the spatio-temporal change of planting area of winter wheat-summer maize cropping system in the North China Plain during 2001-2018
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Discriminating winter wheat-summer maize distribution is fundamental for agricultural water resources management in the North China Plain (NCP) which confronts severe conflicts between food production and agricultural water scarcity. However, how the planting area changed since 2000 is still unclear. Therefore, the winter wheat-summer maize from 2001 to 2018 was identified by using the maximum likelihood algorithm of supervised classification based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) product. Three schemes with different temporal resolutions of MODIS data and sample categories were compared to obtain the most reasonable identification results. The results reveal that using 16-day 0.0025 degrees MODIS NDVI data and six sample categories including winter wheat-summer maize, winter wheat-rice, spring maize, cotton, other one cropping systems and other double cropping systems is an effective way for tracking the variation of winter wheat-summer maize distribution. The winter wheat-summer maize planting area showed an insignificant increasing trend at a rate of 34.2 km2/year (p = 0.955, CV = 7.49%) during 2001-2018, while it decreased at the rate of -5065.2 km2/year (p = 0.074) after 2012. Spatially, the planting area shrunk in northern NCP, the piedmont plain of the Taihang Mountains, the west of dry sub-humid zone and the southwest part of the NCP, accounting for 58.6% of the counties during 2001-2018; while 17.3% of the counties significantly expanded winter wheat-summer maize in the irrigation district along the Yellow River in Shandong province, the southeast of Hebei Plain and the central humid zone. Our results provide fundamental information for quantifying the change of crop water consumption and optimizing crop water resource allocation.

T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology, a regular and periodic phenomenon in nature, is an important indicator for natural environment, especially climate change. The study of spatiotemporal variations of vegetation phenology is of great significance for monitoring the changes of terrestrial vegetation. In this study, the Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filtering method was used to reconstruct time-series MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data in the Qinling Mountains from 2001 to 2018. The dynamic threshold method was used to extract the spring phenological parameter (start of growth season, SOS). The correlation between multi-year mean SOS and interannual variation with altitude and slope was analyzed. The results showed that SOS was delayed by 1.82 d with every 100 m increase in altitude in the Qinling Mountains. The interannual change trends of SOS mainly concentrated in 0-5 d.(10 a)(-1). The pixels with delaying trend were mainly distributed in low-altitude regions, with the delaying degree being gradually decreased with the elevation. The interannual change trend of SOS in high-altitude regions was more complex than that in lower-altitude regions. The multi-year average SOS in the northern slope was approximately 2.9 d earlier than that of the southern slope, whereas the southern slope had a more significant advancing trend. The interannual change trends of SOS in both north and south slopes showed a delaying trend in low-altitude, with little difference between north and south slopes. The advancing trend in middle and high altitude was significantly different.

TI  - Advanced geosynchronous radiation imager thermal infrared channel-to-channel co-registration algorithm based on cloud information and phase correlation
T2  - OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The channel-to-channel co-registration is an important performance metric for The Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) of Fengyun-4A (FY-4A), Chinese geostationary meteorological satellite, and large co-registration errors can have a direct impact upon the reliability of the imager's quantitatively-derived products that rely on combinations of multiple thermal infrared (TIR) channels. Affected products include the cloud mask, fog, and sandstorm. The AGRI Imager TIR channel-to-channel co-registration algorithm based on cloud information and phase correlation is proposed, which allows a systematic calculation of the co-registration error between AGRI TIR channel image pairs. Firstly, the TIR images are preprocessed to obtain the cloud information spatial distribution images. Secondly, the co-registration error is calculated by fitting the low-frequency portion of the phase difference spectrum image of preprocessed image pairs. Finally, the error of the relative misalignment image is compensated in the frequency domain to achieve co-registration. The proposed algorithm is an area-based approach that does not rely on a set of fixed control points that may be impacted by clouds' presence. In fact, the cloud is the effective information in the algorithm and there is enough cloud information in the AGRI image pairs to calculate the co-registration error. The in-orbit TIR images of AGRI are processed. The results show that the proposed algorithm has better robustness and can better achieve co-registration between TIR image pairs with high precision on the sub-pixel level.

TI  - Slip Model of the 2020 Yutian (Northwestern Tibetan Plateau) Earthquake Derived From Joint Inversion of InSAR and Teleseismic Data
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar and teleseismic P-wave data were combined to investigate the source rupture characteristics of the 2020 Mw 6.3 Yutian, China, earthquake. We first utilized the near-field displacements together with 29 broadband teleseismic P waveforms to investigate the uniform slip model by using a Bayesian bootstrap optimization nonlinear inversion method to resolve the nucleation point location, origin time and fault geometrical parameters. Based on these results, the kinematic rupture process of the earthquake was inverted. We conclude that the 2020 Yutian earthquake occurred on a west-dipping blind normal fault with a dip of similar to 60 degrees at the junction of Bayan Har block (BHB) and western Kunlun block (WKB). The rupture nucleation point was located at longitude = 82.435 degrees E, latitude = 35.619 degrees N, and a depth of 6.377 km, making it shallower than estimated from other point source inversions. The earthquake started at 21:05:20 UTC on June 25, 2020 and was delayed by similar to 2.07 s compared with GeoForschungsZentrum. The rupture lasted for similar to 12 s, with a total seismic moment of similar to 3.28 x 10(18) Nm, corresponding to a moment magnitude of 6.3. The slip was mainly confined between similar to 3.0 and 9.0 km in depth and the peak slip was similar to 1.40 m, which occurred at a depth of similar to 6.377 km. The slip was predominantly normal slip with slight right-lateral strike-slip components, which agrees with the southeastward movement of the BHB relative to the WKB.Plain Language Summary The June 25, 2020 Mw 6.3 Yutian earthquake occurred on a normal fault within the northwestern Tibetan Plateau, a region characterized by EW extension. Because the rough focal mechanism solutions and source locations based on seismic wave data reported by several institutes are different, they cannot be used to create a reliable fault model for inverting the kinematic rupture process of this moderate earthquake. The initial rupture point and origin time, which are the prior information needed for revealing the slip characteristics, are also unclear. To resolve these rupture parameters, both Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar and teleseismic P-wave data were collected. We found that the rupture mainly occurred in the shallow part of a similar to 60 degrees west-dipping normal fault, the nucleation point was near the point of maximum slip, and the slip lasted similar to 12 s and extended northward and southward. Our research has important significance for understanding earthquake disasters and deformation mechanisms of faults within the northwestern Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Geodetic Observation and Modeling of the Coseismic and Postseismic Deformations Associated With the 2020 Mw 6.5 Monte Cristo Earthquake
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2020 Mw 6.5 Monte Cristo earthquake occurred in the northeastern Mina deflection of the central Walker Lane Belt (WLB) in Nevada, USA. The Mina deflection represents a typical stepover zone that transfers the dextral slip in the northern Eastern California Shear Zone onto the dextral faults in the central WLB. The Monte Cristo earthquake provides a rare opportunity to investigate the strain accumulation and stress transition mechanisms in the WLB. In this study, ascending and descending Sentinel-1 images were utilized to generate coseismic and early postseismic deformations associated with this earthquake. Combined with global positioning system measurements, these images were inverted for the coseismic slip and afterslip of the Monte Cristo earthquake. The preferred coseismic slip model suggests that the causative fault is characterized by two fault segments with southward dips of 64 degrees and 79 degrees. The coseismic rupture was dominated by sinistral slip with obvious normal slip components in the western segment of the source fault. The coseismic slip was mainly concentrated in the 3-12 km depth range and decreased at shallower depths, suggesting a moderate amount of shallow coseismic slip deficit. Rapid afterslip was mainly confined to the 0-3 km depth range, largely compensating for the shallow slip deficit caused by the mainshock. The widely distributed normal slips in the northeastern Mina deflection revealed by the Monte Cristo earthquake suggest the transtensional model is more applicable due to its ability to account for the slip transition kinematics in the Mina deflection.

T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is often a direct control on herbaceous plants but has been underappreciated on the alpine grassland phenology in response to climate change. In the present study, we used satellite data of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and LST products to study the land surface phenology (LSP) of alpine grasslands in response to LST changes in the Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB), which is on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Our results showed that LSP, including the start (SOS), end (EOS), and length (GSL) of the growing season, presented high spatial heterogeneity and had significant correlation with landform elevations. Both averaged SOS and EOS across QLB were advanced from 2001 to 2017, but the greater advancement of SOS compared to that of EOS led to an overall prolonged GSL. Daytime LST (LSTd) and nighttime LST (LSTn) had the contrasting effects on SOS (i.e., SOS can be delayed with the increase in LSTd, while it can be advanced with the increase in LSTn). However, increase in LSTd and LSTn in August had the same advancing effect on EOS. Moreover, LSTd played the dominant role in controlling the grassland phenology. Specifically, an 1 degrees C increase in the LSTd in the nongrowing season (i.e., from previous October to April) significantly postponed the SOS by 2.2 d and advanced the EOS by 1.1 d in August. This study highlights the utility and biological relevance of LST in research of grassland phenology and differential impacts of daytime and nighttime LST on grassland phenology.

TI  - Identifying variable changes in wetlands and their anthropogenic threats bordering the Yellow Sea for water bird conservation
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As critical habitats for migratory birds in the East Asia-Australasia Flyway, coastal wetlands bordering the Yellow Sea have experienced prominent losses and threats triggered by human activities. In this study, the spatially and temporally variable changes in wetland extent and anthropogenic threats bordering the Yellow Sea from 1978 to 2018 were examined by utilizing Landsat observations. A fishnet and an anthropogenic threat index (ATI) were applied to document the patterns of wetland changes and anthropogenic threats and further to reveal their interactions. The results indicated that natural wetlands bordering the Yellow Sea have undergone consistent losses during the past four decades, with a net decline rate of 17.2% (7361.2 km(2)). The ATI pattern suggested that direct anthropogenic threats from agriculture and urbanization distributed like a new Great Wall affecting the natural wetlands along the coastline, while built-up land consistently expanded on each side of the three countries (China, North Korea, and South Korea). The spatial distribution of bird number, night light data, and major ports, as well as the Landsat images, demonstrated that notable anthropogenic threats have affected coastal wetlands and biodiversity. Given these comparative findings, the study is expected to support policy optimization and international corporations in coastal wetland management to achieve the twin goals of biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic development.

TI  - An Improved Global Land Anthropogenic Aerosol Product Based on Satellite Retrievals From 2008 to 2016
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant levels of aerosols originate from anthropogenic activities, markedly influencing regional air quality and, consequently, human health. Generally, fine-mode aerosol optical depth (fAOD) data are used to evaluate the concentration of anthropogenic aerosols. Although the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides fine-mode fraction (FMF) data that can be used to produce fAOD products, these data remain highly uncertain over land, in terms of global validation, relative to Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements. To overcome this limitation, we developed an improved global land-scale fAOD product combining the lookup table-spectral deconvolution algorithm (LUT-SDA), generalized additive model (GAM), and MODIS Collection 6.1 aerosol products. Validation of the improved product revealed that over 63% of the fAOD values are within an expected error (EE) envelope of +/-(0.05 + 15%), with strong positive correlations (R-2 = 0.65) and low bias (root-mean-square error = 0.185; mean absolute error = 0.104) compared to AERONET-observed fAOD values. Furthermore, the fAOD developed eliminates the multiple zeroes in the MODIS FMF-based fAODs. In the improved fAOD product, eastern China and northern India exhibit the highest 9-year-mean fAOD loading, with values generally exceeding 0.6. The improved global land fAOD product provides a new avenue with which to obtain data on anthropogenic aerosols and can also be useful in aerosol-climate interaction research.

TI  - Assessment of FY-2G Atmospheric Motion Vector Data and Assimilating Impacts on Typhoon Forecasts
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) have produced positive impacts on global weather forecasts, but few studies have evaluated the impacts of AMV data from the Fengyun (FY) geostationary satellite series, especially from FY-2G and FY-4, on typhoon forecasts in a regional model. In this study, the qualities of FY-2G and Himawari-8 AMV data are comparatively evaluated with several preprocesses (e.g., height assignment, quality control, channel merging, thinning, and observation error assignment) employed, and a super typhoon (Typhoon Hato, which occurred in 2017) is selected to assess the forecasting performances with the AMV data assimilated in the Weather Research and Forecasting data assimilation (WRFDA) system. The results show that the AMV data from Himawari-8 are better overall than those from FY-2G, with smaller RMSEs and biases for full wind speeds, and the preprocesses improve the qualities of these two geostationary satellite AMV data sets, as they both depict the same general atmospheric circulations. On the other hand, assimilation of AMV data improves the forecasts of environmental fields, resulting in the simulated track and intensity being closer to the observations. Generally, assimilating FY-2G AMV data has comparably positive impacts with Himawari-8 AMVs, and the AMV data retrieved from multiple channels provide even better forecasts. Experiments involving another typhoon case are also performed to further provide evidence that the derived AMV data from the Fengyun geostationary satellite series have value in the operational applications.

TI  - A Novel Method for Polarization Orientation Angle Estimation Over Steep Terrain and Comparison of Deorientation Algorithms
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes a novel polarization orientation angle (POA) estimation algorithm for steep terrain by applying physical scattering characteristics of natural surface. The algorithm extends the range of POA from [-45 degrees, 45 degrees] to (-90 degrees, 90 degrees] and achieves consistent estimation with the widely used circular polarization algorithm (CPA) and minimum cross-polarization algorithm (MXPA) over flat area, but avoids the POA wrapping caused by the restriction of CPA and MXPA over precipitous area. Besides, detailed comparison among these deorientation algorithms is presented for clarifying their relations and analyzing the wrapping and unwrapping issue of POA. Both simulated data of Bragg scattering model and PolSAR data of L-band ALOS PALSAR and P-band NASA/JPL AIRSAR are used to substantiate the proposals.

AB  - Paddy rice agriculture plays an important role in food security and has a considerable influence on natural systems. In the context of climate change, understanding the nature and drivers of shifts in the northern limit of paddy rice (NLPR) is crucial for adaptation strategies and food security. However, quantitative studies on the effect of climate change on paddy rice distribution shifts have not been well performed. Here, we mapped the NLPR in China using Landsat imagery from 1984 to 2013, analyzed the latitudinal and elevational dynamics of the NLPR using Fishnet analysis, and explored the factors driving the changes in rice area across the NLPR regions using a linear regression model. Our results show that between 1984 and 2013, the NLPR shifted 24.93 km northward (the greatest movement was 88.01 km occurring at approximately 133 degrees E) and elevational limits increased by 39.15 m (the greatest movement was 117.08 m occurring at approximately 129 degrees E). While socioeconomic factors (e.g. benefits, policies, irrigation, and mulch) played significant roles in rice area changes, the changes in rice area across the NLPR regions had the strongest positive association with the increase in the previous temperature, indicating that rice cultivation in the NLPR regions has moved to higher latitudes over the 30 year study period to adapt to climate change. Our study highlighted that quantifying the interactions between climate change and crop production systems can facilitate a better understanding of the human responses to changes in the growing conditions in the face of climate change and ensuring regional and global food security.

TI  - Ex Post Analysis of Water Supply Demand in an Agricultural Basin by Multi-Source Data Integration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we present a new methodology integrating data from multiple sources, such as observations from the Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites, with information gathered in field campaigns and information derived from different public databases, in order to characterize the water demand of crops (potential and estimated) in a spatially and temporally distributed manner. This methodology is applied to a case study corresponding to the basin of the Longavi River, located in south-central Chile. Potential and estimated demands, aggregated at different spatio-temporal scales, are compared to the streamflow of the Longavi River, as well as extractions from the groundwater system. The results obtained allow us to conclude that the availability of spatio-temporal information on the water availability and demand pairing allows us to close the water gap-i.e., the difference between supply and demand-allowing for better management of water resources in a watershed.

TI  - The 2020 Hpakant Jade Mine Disaster, Myanmar: A multi-sensor investigation for slope failure
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A quarry failure along the slopes of the Wai Khar open-pit jade mine in Hpakant, Myanmar has led to the deaths of at least 172 jade miners on 2 July 2020. This paper conducts a systematic investigation of the incident by integrating data from multiple sensors, including high-resolution optical imagery, Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, unmanned aerial system (UAS) footage, SRTM and ALOS digital elevation models (DEMs), soil moisture product from multi-spectral Landsat-8 satellite and precipitation records from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS). Optical imagery, UAS footage and DEMs allow us to build a comprehensive mapping of tailing areas and quarry scarps from 2010 and reconstruct the 2D pit geometry prior to failure. Deformation signals from multi-temporal SAR interferometry (MTInSAR), soil moisture variations and precipitation trends further allow us to identify possible failure causes. To evaluate the quality of deformation obtained from different distributed-scatterer phase estimators, we develop an empirical mapping function based on areal fraction values to facilitate the comparison of temporal coherence values that are differently formulated in each phase estimator. The comparison shows that phase linking algorithm outperforms the small baseline subset method in terms of signal recovery and phase reliability. Our investigation points out that the mining site is under aggressive mining cycles that are exacerbated by frequent, uncontrolled landslides. Seepage failure, which involves the expulsion of water from rapidly compacting tailings, may be a critical factor in the 2020 incident. Instead of extreme weather, the failure had occurred under normal to drier conditions. This means that the sliding planes were already in a critical state, which is evident from the accelerated deformation around the collapse area since the beginning of 2020. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations to improve mining site regulations and management practices for safer open-pit mining in Myanmar and probably in similar contexts outside Myanmar.

TI  - On Decision-Analytical Support for Wicked Policy Issues
T2  - RISK ANALYSIS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Lempert and Turner contribute importantly to the design of decision-analytical tools for wicked policy issues by acknowledging the centrality of socially determined and often irreconcilable worldviews. Their point of departure is application of the DMDU approach (decision making under deep uncertainty) separately for each contending worldview as postulated by cultural theory. This allows stakeholders to maintain solidarity with their social or organizational value communities, an important consideration or even prerequisite for robust policy compromises. Drawing from a codesign process in Italy, this commentary suggests that the Lempert and Turner multiworldview approach can be useful for aiding stakeholder deliberation by representing alternative problem framings or worldviews, displaying the implications of acting on one framing when viewed from the others, and identifying compromise solutions robust across the framings. The challenge is to operationalize the Lempert and Turner approach, a challenge well worth pursuing given the increasingly intractable and "wicked" nature of today's policy issues.

TI  - Altering urban greenspace patterns and heat stress risk in Hanoi city during Master Plan 2030 implementation
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hanoi City has been greatly reshaped owing to its ?Master Plan by 2030 and a vision to 2050 by Decision 1259/ QD-TTg of Vietnam? (called Hanoi Master Plan thereafter). This Hanoi Master Plan results in multi-challenges for the Hanoi City in terms of conserving urban greenspace (UGS). This study pursues to (1) investigate the changing environmental spatial patterns of UGS, (2) identity the areas at high risk due to heat stress based on abnormal land surface temperature (LST) distribution and demographic vulnerability, and (3) suggest mitigation strategies to the authorities by using the proposed UGS management platform. Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) data was used to examine the evolution of UGS in relation to LST derived from Landsat 8 OLI thermal band that was subsequently utilized to create heat stress risk patterns. The study region is the inner Hanoi City. The UGS was investigated during the timeframe from Oct. 2016 to Oct. 2018. Accuracy assessment was performed by using Google Earth and field survey data. Results showed that UGS in inner Hanoi City is much declined by 1.3% for woodland and by 4.4% for shrub land, while grass-cover is increased by 2.4% in recent 2 years. Overall accuracies are of 96% and 88% with Kappa coefficients of 0.92 and 0.78 for land cover classification in 2018 and 2016, respectively. Urban heat stress index patterns showed a higher risk in the central inner-city areas of dense residential regions characterized by dense built-up. The identification of environmental heat stress risk patterns provides useful information for calling more attention of urban planners, authorities and health organizations.

TI  - Fractional Vegetation Cover Estimation Algorithm for FY-3B Reflectance Data Based on Random Forest Regression Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important land surface vegetation parameter, fractional vegetation cover (FVC) has been widely used in many Earth system ecological and climate models. In particular, high-quality and reliable FVC products on the global scale are important for the Earth surface process simulation and global change studies. Recently, the FengYun-3 (FY-3) series satellites, which are the second generation of Chinese meteorological satellites, launched with the polar orbit and provide continuous land surface observations on a global scale. However, there is rare studying on the FVC estimation using FY-3 reflectance data. Therefore, the FY-3B reflectance data were selected as the representative data to develop a FVC estimation algorithm in this study, which would investigate the capability of the FY-3 reflectance data on the global FVC estimation. The spatial-temporal validation over the regional area indicated that the FVC estimations generated by the proposed algorithm had reliable continuities. Furthermore, a satisfactory accuracy performance (R-2 = 0.7336, RMSE = 0.1288) was achieved for the proposed algorithm based on the Earth Observation LABoratory (EOLAB) reference FVC data, which provided further evidence on the reliability and robustness of the proposed algorithm. All these results indicated that the FY-3 reflectance data were capable of generating a FVC estimation with reliable spatial-temporal continuities and accuracy.

TI  - Comparison of DEM accuracies generated from different stereo pairs over a plateau mountainous area
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital elevation models (DEMs) can be quickly and conveniently generated using very high resolution (VHR) satellite stereo images. Previous studies have evaluated and compared DEM accuracy based on VHR satellite stereo pairs collected by different satellite sensors. However, few studies analyzed the accuracy of a DEM based on stereo image pairs from a satellite with the same orbit and different orbits for a region with significant topographic fluctuations in the plateau area. Referring to former studies, this paper had two objectives: to generate a digital elevation model (DEM) and evaluate its horizontal and vertical accuracy over a plateau area with high relief; and to study the mapping capability of multiorbit and multitemporal stereo pair images in the plateau mountainous region. To achieve these objectives, we collected the 2015 Worldview-2 stereo image pair and another three WorldView-2 images acquired in 2013, 2014, and 2015. First, the 2015 DEM was obtained using a strict physical model based on along-track stereo image pairs, and the reliability of the DEM was verified with field data. Then, the images obtained in 2013, 2014, and 2015 were combined into different-orbit stereo image pairs, DEMs were produced using rational function models, and the DEMs were verified using field data and the 2015 DEM as standards. The results showed that the relief degree has a particular influence on the DEM, and the precision of the DEM decreases as the topographic relief increases. Off-nadir angles can also influence DEM accuracy, with a larger angle corresponding to a lower DEM accuracy. The research also shows that the DEM obtained from four sets of experiments meets the accuracy requirement of a 1:5,000 digital elevation map, digital line graphic (DLG), and digital orthophoto map (DOM). Among these four groups of DEMs, the one based on the 2015 stereo pairs with the same satellite achieved the highest precision.

TI  - Nightlight as a Proxy of Economic Indicators: Fine-Grained GDP Inference Around Mainland China via Attention-Augmented CNN from Daytime Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The official method of collecting county-level GDP values in the Chinese Mainland relies mainly on administrative reporting data and suffers from high costs of time, money, and human labor. To date, a series of studies have been conducted to generate fine-grained maps of socioeconomic indicators from the easily accessed remote sensing data and achieved satisfactory results. This paper proposes a transfer learning framework that regards nightlight intensities as a proxy of economic activity degrees to estimate county-level GDP around the Chinese Mainland. In the framework, paired daytime satellite images and nightlight intensity levels were applied to train a VGG-16 architecture, and the output features at a specific layer, after dimensional reduction and statistics calculation, were fed into a simple regressor to estimate county-level GDP. We trained the model with data of 2017 and utilized it to predict county-level GDP of 2018, achieving an R-squared of 0.71. Furthermore, the results of gradient visualization confirmed the validity of the proposed framework qualitatively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that county-level GDP values around the Chinese Mainland have been estimated from both daytime and nighttime remote sensing data relying on attention-augmented CNN. We believe that our work will shed light on both the evolution of fine-grained socioeconomic surveys and the application of remote sensing data in economic research.

TI  - C-CNN: Contourlet Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extracting effective features is always a challenging problem for texture classification because of the uncertainty of scales and the clutter of textural patterns. For texture classification, spectral analysis is traditionally employed in the frequency domain. Recent studies have shown the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) when dealing with the texture classification task in the spatial domain. In this article, we try combining both approaches in different domains for more abundant information and proposed a novel network architecture named contourlet CNN (C-CNN). The network aims to learn sparse and effective feature representations for images. First, the contourlet transform is applied to get the spectral features from an image. Second, the spatial-spectral feature fusion strategy is designed to incorporate the spectral features into CNN architecture. Third, the statistical features are integrated into the network by the statistical feature fusion. Finally, the results are obtained by classifying the fusion features. We also investigated the behavior of the parameters in contourlet decomposition. Experiments on the widely used three texture data sets (kth-tips2-b, DTD, and CUReT) and five remote sensing data sets (UCM, WHU-RS, AID, RSSCN7, and NWPU-RESISC45) demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms several well-known classification methods in terms of classification accuracy with fewer trainable parameters.

TI  - Fusion of China ZY-1 02D Hyperspectral Data and Multispectral Data: Which Methods Should Be Used?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - ZY-1 02D is China's first civil hyperspectral (HS) operational satellite, developed independently and successfully launched in 2019. It can collect HS data with a spatial resolution of 30 m, 166 spectral bands, a spectral range of 400 similar to 2500 nm, and a swath width of 60 km. Its competitive advantages over other on-orbit or planned satellites are its high spectral resolution and large swath width. Unfortunately, the relatively low spatial resolution may limit its applications. As a result, fusing ZY-1 02D HS data with high-spatial-resolution multispectral (MS) data is required to improve spatial resolution while maintaining spectral fidelity. This paper conducted a comprehensive evaluation study on the fusion of ZY-1 02D HS data with ZY-1 02D MS data (10-m spatial resolution), based on visual interpretation and quantitative metrics. Datasets from Hebei, China, were used in this experiment, and the performances of six common data fusion methods, namely Gram-Schmidt (GS), High Pass Filter (HPF), Nearest-Neighbor Diffusion (NND), Modified Intensity-Hue-Saturation (IHS), Wavelet Transform (Wavelet), and Color Normalized Sharping (Brovey), were compared. The experimental results show that: (1) HPF and GS methods are better suited for the fusion of ZY-1 02D HS Data and MS Data, (2) IHS and Brovey methods can well improve the spatial resolution of ZY-1 02D HS data but introduce spectral distortion, and (3) Wavelet and NND results have high spectral fidelity but poor spatial detail representation. The findings of this study could serve as a good reference for the practical application of ZY-1 02D HS data fusion.

TI  - AN UNDERWORLD TAILORED TO TOURISTS: A DRAGON, A PHOTO-MODEL, AND A BIOINDICATOR
T2  - JOURNAL OF CAVE AND KARST STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The history of studies of a subterranean tailed amphibian, known as the olm or proteus (Proteus anguinus), is a colorful indicator of the changing view of the world beneath our feet. Throughout history, the underground has been presented as other worldly inhabited by life not of this world. At first, caves were the habitat of ghosts and spirtits, and then as a symbol for hell with all its attributes. The olm, in light of this prominant worldview, is discussed here, in which its status changed from that of a mythical dragon, to a photo-model, to a biological indicator of environmental health. The mix of these roles, with which the modern notion of this animal is presented, is mostly generated by the experience of tour-guides in Postojna Cave in Slovenia. For a long time, Postojna was the only place that the wider public recognized as a home for proteus. This clearly shows the need to analyze the popular media constructions of environment.

TI  - Comparison of Satellite and Drone-Based Images at Two Spatial Scales to Evaluate Vegetation Regeneration after Post-Fire Treatments in a Mediterranean Forest
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The evaluation of vegetation cover after post-fire treatments of burned lands is important for forest managers to restore soil quality and plant biodiversity in burned ecosystems. Unfortunately, this evaluation may be time consuming and expensive, requiring much fieldwork for surveys. The use of remote sensing, which makes these evaluation activities quicker and easier, have rarely been carried out in the Mediterranean forests, subjected to wildfire and post-fire stabilization techniques. To fill this gap, this study evaluates the feasibility of satellite (using LANDSAT8 images) and drone surveys to evaluate changes in vegetation cover and composition after wildfire and two hillslope stabilization treatments (log erosion barriers, LEBs, and contour-felled log debris, CFDs) in a forest of Central Eastern Spain. Surveys by drone were able to detect the variability of vegetation cover among burned and unburned areas through the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI), but gave unrealistic results when the effectiveness of a post-fire treatment must be evaluated. LANDSAT8 images may be instead misleading to evaluate the changes in land cover after wildfire and post-fire treatments, due to the lack of correlation between VARI and vegetation cover. The spatial analysis has shown that: (i) the post-fire restoration strategy of landscape managers that have prioritized steeper slopes for treatments was successful; (ii) vegetation growth, at least in the experimental conditions, played a limited influence on soil surface conditions, since no significant increases in terrain roughness were detected in treated areas.

T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is prepared on the base of works by K.F. Karjalainen, A. Kannisto, V.N. Chernetsov, E.I. Rombandeeva, R.K. Bardina, I.N. Gemuev, A.I. Sagalaev, A.V. Baulo. Based on the classification of Karjalainen, the author refers the ancestral (family), village and territorial spirits to the local spirits. By their origin, they are famous ancestors, founders of villages, former personal spirits, and sons of the supreme god Numi-Torum. The list of local spirits fixed on the rivers Severnaya Sosva with Ob region, Lyapin / Sygva, Lozva, Pelym, Tavda, Vagilsk, and Konda is given. They are linked to specific loci: villages, forest areas, or water basins. This localization is of two kinds: both the location of the spirit itself and the territory of its worship. These signs do not always coincide.Different variants of the spatial boundaries of worship of a concrete spirit are revealed among the Mansi people. In some cases, only one spirit is worshipped in a village, in other words, it has here "sole" space. In other cases, when different local spirits are worshipped in the same village, their space is common. An even wider area "belongs" to the spirits worshipped in several villages (loci). The most extensive areas of worship were formed by the territorial ancestor spirits.Most of the local spirits were related to each other. This is most clearly demonstrated by the significant territorial spirits whish are considered the children of Numi-Torum - Polum- Torum, Nyaras-Nay-Ekva, Tagt-Kotil-Ojka, Aj-As-Ojka, and Nyor-Ojka. In turn, the children of these original patron spirits dispersed to different parts of the Mansi land, becoming the guardians of both the area and the people living in it. These are the naj-otyrs that helped people to settle where they now live. They are the masters of loci (villages, towns) and are subordinate to one of the most senior original patron spirits. Thus, the sons of Tagt-Kotil-Ojka are the patron spirits in several villages on the Severnaya Sosva River, as well as on the Manya River. Seven bogatyr brothers from the Lozva River made military campaigns over the Sosva River. The ties between the naj-otyrs were often of a warlike nature. They conquered other people's territories and became patron spirits there.The materials presented in the article draw a general picture of the representations about local spirits (ancestral spirits) among different groups of the Mansi people. The basis of these representations is the general Mansi worldview concept about the origin of these characters, about their structure and relationships. The extensive list of ancestral spirits demonstrates, on the one hand, their localization and, on the other hand, the wide spatial area of worship of the most significant of them.

TI  - Evaluation of ICEYE Microsatellites Sensor for Surface Motion Detection-Jakobshavn Glacier Case Study
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The marine-terminating glaciers are one of the biggest contributors to global sea-level rise. Research on this aspect of the effects of global climate change is developing nowadays in several directions. One of them is monitoring of glaciers movements, especially with satellite data. In addition to well-known analyzes based on radar data from available satellites, the possibility of studying glacier displacements from new sensors, the so-called microsatellites need to be studied. The main purpose of research was evaluation of the possibility of applying new high-resolution ICEYE radar data to observe glacier motion. Stripmap High mode were used to obtain velocities for the Jakobshavn glacier with an Offset-Tracking method. Obtained results were compared with displacements obtained from the Sentinel-1 data. The comparative analysis was performed on displacements in range and azimuth directions and for maximum velocity values. Moreover, correlation plots showed that in different parts of glaciers, a comparison of obtained velocities delivers different correlation coefficients (R-2) in a range from 0.52 to 0.97. The analysis showed that the scale of movements is similar from both sensors. However, Sentinel-1 data present underestimation of velocities comparing to ICEYE data. The biggest deviations between results were observed around the maximum velocities, near the Kangia Ice Fjord Bay. In the analysis the amplitude information was used as well. This research presents that data from the ICEYE microsatellites can be successfully used for monitoring glacial areas and it allows for more precise observations of displacement velocity field.

TI  - Effects of Topography on Planted Trees in a Headwater Catchment on the Chinese Loess Plateau
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) is known for its complex topography of hills and gullies, and lots of human land-use management activities have been put into practice to sustain the soil, water and other natural resources. Afforestation has been widely applied on the CLP and it's important to understand the effects of topography on these planted trees. However, the coarse spatial resolution of remote sensing data makes it insensitive to local topography, and the traditional in-situ measurements would consume vast amounts of time and resources. In this study, a small headwater catchment of the CLP was selected to study the effects of topography on the planted trees. Low altitude unmanned aerial vehicle based light detection and ranging (UAV-based LiDAR) technology was utilized to obtain high-resolution topography and vegetation structure data. Results showed that the middle transition zone (mid-transition, slope > 45 degrees) was an important boundary of topography in the gully area of the CLP. In the forested catchment, the area of the mid-transition zone had the lowest of tree density, canopy coverage and leaf area index due to steep slope gradient. The tall trees ten to twenty meters high were concentrated in the downhill area, which had the highest canopy coverage and leaf area index. Elevation had significant linear relationships with canopy coverage and leaf area index (p < 0.001), which revealed the impact of topography on the forest indexes of the afforestation catchment. We concluded that the high-resolution LiDAR technology facilitated the research of topography and forest interactions in land surface.

TI  - A Combined Unmixing Framework for Impervious Surface Mapping on Medium-Resolution Images with Visible Shadows
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral unmixing methods with medium-resolution remote sensing images have become the main approach to mapping urban impervious-surface information. However, as more tall buildings appear, numerous visible shadows exist in medium-resolution images; these have usually been ignored in previous research, but they seriously affect accuracy. To solve this problem, we propose a combined unmixing framework to extract impervious surface in nonshadow and shadow areas, using linear and nonlinear unmixing models, respectively. First shadow is separated from nonshadow. Then a nonlinear unmixing method is selected to map impervious surface in shadow, which is more suitable to the complex imaging environment in shadow, and a classic linear unmixing model in nonshadow. Through experimental tests, the proposed combined unmixing framework is shown to effectively reduce error in two study areas compared with classical unmixing methods.

TI  - A Novel Query Strategy-Based Rank Batch-Mode Active Learning Method for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An informative training set is necessary for ensuring the robust performance of the classification of very-high-resolution remote sensing (VHRRS) images, but labeling work is often difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. This makes active learning (AL) an important part of an image analysis framework. AL aims to efficiently build a representative and efficient library of training samples that are most informative for the underlying classification task, thereby minimizing the cost of obtaining labeled data. Based on ranked batch-mode active learning (RBMAL), this paper proposes a novel combined query strategy of spectral information divergence lowest confidence uncertainty sampling (SIDLC), called RBSIDLC. The base classifier of random forest (RF) is initialized by using a small initial training set, and each unlabeled sample is analyzed to obtain the classification uncertainty score. A spectral information divergence (SID) function is then used to calculate the similarity score, and according to the final score, the unlabeled samples are ranked in descending lists. The most "valuable" samples are selected according to ranked lists and then labeled by the analyst/expert (also called the oracle). Finally, these samples are added to the training set, and the RF is retrained for the next iteration. The whole procedure is iteratively implemented until a stopping criterion is met. The results indicate that RBSIDLC achieves high-precision extraction of urban land use information based on VHRRS; the accuracy of extraction for each land-use type is greater than 90%, and the overall accuracy (OA) is greater than 96%. After the SID replaces the Euclidean distance in the RBMAL algorithm, the RBSIDLC method greatly reduces the misclassification rate among different land types. Therefore, the similarity function based on SID performs better than that based on the Euclidean distance. In addition, the OA of RF classification is greater than 90%, suggesting that it is feasible to use RF to estimate the uncertainty score. Compared with the three single query strategies of other AL methods, sample labeling with the SIDLC combined query strategy yields a lower cost and higher quality, thus effectively reducing the misclassification rate of different land use types. For example, compared with the Batch_Based_Entropy (BBE) algorithm, RBSIDLC improves the precision of barren land extraction by 37% and that of vegetation by 14%. The 25 characteristics of different land use types screened by RF cross-validation (RFCV) combined with the permutation method exhibit an excellent separation degree, and the results provide the basis for VHRRS information extraction in urban land use settings based on RBSIDLC.

TI  - Multiscale Cloud Detection in Remote Sensing Images Using a Dual Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation by convolutional neural networks (CNN) has advanced the state of the art in pixel-level classification of remote sensing images. However, processing large images typically requires analyzing the image in small patches, and hence, features that have a large spatial extent still cause challenges in tasks, such as cloud masking. To support a wider scale of spatial features while simultaneously reducing computational requirements for large satellite images, we propose an architecture of two cascaded CNN model components successively processing undersampled and full-resolution images. The first component distinguishes between patches in the inner cloud area from patches at the clouds boundary region. For the cloud-ambiguous edge patches requiring further segmentation, the framework then delegates computation to a fine-grained model component. We apply the architecture to a cloud detection data set of complete Sentinel-2 multispectral images, approximately annotated for minimal false negatives in a land-use application. On this specific task and data, we achieve a 16% relative improvement in pixel accuracy over a CNN baseline based on patching.

TI  - Study of Climate Impact on Vegetation Cover in Kherson Oblast (Ukraine) Using Normalized Difference and Enhanced Vegetation Indices
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is a convenient tool for the study of vegetation cover conditions and dynamics using normalized difference and enhanced vegetation indices. Determination of the connection between weather and vegetation indices plays an important role in better understanding peculiarities of ecosystems reaction to changing climate conditions. The study devoted to the evaluation of annual and long-term dynamics under vegetation cover conditions, and its reaction to the climate factor, was performed through the establishment of the link between remote sensing information (smoothed time series data on normalized and enhanced vegetation indices) and results of on-land hydrometeorological observations for air temperature and precipitation amounts in Kherson oblast of Ukraine during the period from 2012 to 2019 by the means of linear regression analysis of the data. The values of the studied vegetation indices (Terrain MODIS NDVI and MODIS EVI 250 m smoothed time series) were calculated and generalized by the means of GDAL raster analysis toolkit in QGIS 3.10. Statistical data processing was performed using BioStat v7 software. It was found that there is a strong tendency towards the enhancement of vegetation in the region year by year. Climate has strong effect on the vegetation, and the main input belongs to air temperature, while precipitation amounts cannot be considered as a driving force of changes in the growth of vegetation. Enhanced vegetation index seems to be more reliable for the estimation of vegetation cover conditions in comparison to normalized difference vegetation index.

TI  - Macrophages/Microglia in the Glioblastoma Tumor Microenvironment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The complex interaction between glioblastoma and its microenvironment has been recognized for decades. Among various immune profiles, the major population is tumor-associated macrophage, with microglia as its localized homolog. The present definition of such myeloid cells is based on a series of cell markers. These good sentinel cells experience significant changes, facilitating glioblastoma development and protecting it from therapeutic treatments. Huge, complicated mechanisms are involved during the overall processes. A lot of effort has been dedicated to crack the mysterious codes in macrophage/microglia recruiting, activating, reprogramming, and functioning. We have made our path. With more and more key factors identified, a lot of new therapeutic methods could be explored to break the ominous loop, to enhance tumor sensitivity to treatments, and to improve the prognosis of glioblastoma patients. However, it might be a synergistic system rather than a series of clear, stepwise events. There are still significant challenges before the light of truth can shine onto the field. Here, we summarize recent advances in this field, reviewing the path we have been on and where we are now.

TI  - A Sequential Approach for Sentinel-1 TOPS Time-Series Co-Registration Over Low Coherence Scenarios
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the coming era of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) big data, the in-orbit Sentinel-1 mission will provide unprecedented data with an increasing volume. As a fundamental step of time-series analysis for such large and growing amount data, terrain observation by progressive scans (TOPS) co-registration still presents a relative challenge: 1) low coherence scenarios may degrade the estimate accuracy and 2) unprecedented and growing data volume increases the computational burden. To overcome both limitations, this article presents a sequential approach for TOPS time-series co-registration, with an emphasis on the enhanced spectral diversity (ESD) estimate accuracy over low coherence scenes. We first employ double sample over the burst overlap region to improve the statistical proprieties of sample covariance matrix, followed by ESD phase estimation using a phase linking algorithm. Then, we carry out the sequential co-registration on each mini-stack without the necessity for reprocessing the entire stack by introducing a data compression technique. Using synthetic data and real Sentinel-1 TOPS data over densely vegetated areas in the Yunan-Kweichow plateau, we fully evaluate the performance of presented approach and compare the results with those obtained from the state-of-the-art techniques. We found that the sequential approach can provide better time-series co-registration accuracy over low coherence scenes with the moderate computational efficiency.

TI  - Flash flood modeling in the data-poor basin: A case study in Matina River Basin
T2  - TROPICAL CYCLONE RESEARCH AND REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecasting flooding hazards is a very effective non-engineering measure for flood control. Presently, the commonly used forecasting method in simulating flash flood events is through a watershed hydrological model. Many Asia-Pacific countries like the Philippines are prone to frequent hydrometeorological hazards such as tropical cyclones, resulting in frequent heavy rainfall events. However, most rivers in the many basins lack water flow observation data, which makes it challenging to use lumped and data-driven models for flash flood forecasting. With the continuous progress of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, the physically-based distributed hydrological model (PBDHMs) has rapidly advanced. PBDHMs can directly determine the model parameters according to the underlying surface characteristics from remotely-sensed data, which makes it possible for flood forecasting in areas with little to virtually no data. In this study, the Matina River basin in Davao City was selected as a case study in simulating a small data-poor basin in the region. The Liuxihe model was used to formulate a forecasting scheme and simulated the past flash flood events. The results show that there is a good correspondence between the past heavy rainfall events and their corresponding simulated river discharges. The results conform to the hydrological regularities, which can be used for flood forecasting and can serve as a baseline for the development of a flood forecasting system in the rivers of Davao City and elsewhere.

TI  - Extracting Road Traffic Volume in the City before and during covid-19 through Video Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous, automatic measurements of road traffic volume allow the obtaining of information on daily, weekly or seasonal fluctuations in road traffic volume. They are the basis for calculating the annual average daily traffic volume, obtaining information about the relevant traffic volume, or calculating indicators for converting traffic volume from short-term measurements to average daily traffic volume. The covid-19 pandemic has contributed to extensive social and economic anomalies worldwide. In addition to the health consequences, the impact on travel behavior on the transport network was also sudden, extensive, and unpredictable. Changes in the transport behavior resulted in different values of traffic volume on the road and street network than before. The article presents road traffic volume analysis in the city before and during the restrictions related to covid-19. Selected traffic characteristics were compared for 2019 and 2020. This analysis made it possible to characterize the daily, weekly and annual variability of traffic volume in 2019 and 2020. Moreover, the article attempts to estimate daily traffic patterns at particular stages of the pandemic. These types of patterns were also constructed for the weeks in 2019 corresponding to these stages of the pandemic. Daily traffic volume distributions in 2020 were compared with the corresponding ones in 2019. The obtained results may be useful in terms of planning operational and strategic activities in the field of traffic management in the city and management in subsequent stages of a pandemic or subsequent pandemics.

AB  - Simple SummaryIn this study, the effectiveness of One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) in combination with ex vivo SLN mapping is compared with conventional histology including immunohistochemistry. OSNA lymph node evaluation has been performed in 41 gastric cancer cases. It showed a high effectiveness with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rates of 85.4%, 93.5%, and 92.4%, respectively The LN status could be predicted in 40 cases and led to upstaging in three cases (14%). The OSNA method proved its potential to increase the sensitivity of metastases detection.Background: In this study, the effectiveness of One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) in combination with ex vivo SLN mapping is compared with conventional histology including immunohistochemistry. Methods: LNs were retrieved from gastrectomy specimens in an unfixed state. After ex vivo SLN mapping using methylene-blue, LNs were sliced to provide samples for histology and OSNA. Results: In total, 334 LNs were retrieved in the fresh state from 41 patients. SLN detection was intended in 40 cases but was successful in only 29, with a correct LN status prediction in 23 cases (79%). Excluding one case out of 41 with a failure likely caused by a processing error, OSNA showed a high effectiveness with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rates of 85.4%, 93.5%, and 92.4%, respectively. The LN status could be predicted in all but one case, in which the single positive LN was not eligible for OSNA testing. Moreover, OSNA evaluation led to upstaging from N0 to N+ in three cases (14%). Conclusion: The ex vivo SLN protocol used resulted in a relatively poor detection rate. However, the OSNA method was not hampered by this detection rate and proved its potential to increase the sensitivity of metastases detection.

TI  - SURFACE WAVE BREAKING CAUSED BY INTERNAL SOLITARY WAVES Effects on Radar Backscattering Measured by SAR and Radar Altimeter
T2  - OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Breaking surface waves play a key role in the exchange of momentum, heat, and gases between the atmosphere and the ocean. Waves break at the ocean's surface at high or medium wind speeds or in the absence of wind due to shoaling of the seafloor. However, surface waves also break due to interactions with internal solitary waves (ISWs). In this paper, we revisit surface wave breaking caused by ISWs and how ISWs are manifested in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by the TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1 satellites and in high-resolution radar altimeter data acquired by the SAR altimeter (SRAL) onboard the Sentinel-3A satellite. X-band TerraSAR-X images acquired at low wind speeds suggest that meter-scale surface breaking waves resulting from large-scale ISWs are associated with large modulations in backscatter at HH and VV polarizations that cannot be explained by present theories. Furthermore, Sentinel-1 C-band SAR satellite images acquired at moderate to high wind speeds also exhibit large radar signatures from surface wave breaking at VV and VH cross-polarizations. Finally, new observations from the Sentinel-3 SRAL altimeter show clear evidence of significant wave height (SWH) variations along the propagation paths of ISWs. The SWH signatures are unique in showing that the surface wave energy does not return to its unperturbed level after an ISW passes, most likely because intense meter-scale wave breaking results in surface wave energy dissipation. In summary, these results show that surface wave breaking contributes significantly to radar remote sensing of ISWs.

TI  - Atmospheric Trends of CO and CH<sub>4</sub> from Extreme Wildfires in Portugal Using Sentinel-5P TROPOMI Level-2 Data
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Large forest fires have repeatedly affected Europe, in particular the Mediterranean countries. It is now crucial to continue the effort to feed the several layers of prediction models and understand how wildfire spreads in order to develop modern preventative and mitigation methods. The present study evaluates the performance of Sentinel 5-P TROPOMI for the monitoring of carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4) during extreme fire events in Portugal, focusing on the Monchique (2018) and Vila de Rei/Macao (2019) wildfires, which devastated 27,154 ha and 9249 ha, respectively. The spatial distribution and trend of CO and CH4 prior to, during, and following the fire event were accessed and linked with in situ data in a qualitative and quantitative exploration. Large CO plumes were observed with CO columns exceeding 4.5 x 10(18) and 6 x 10(18) molecules/cm(2) on 21 July 2019, and 7 August 2018, respectively. CO distribution profiles after consecutive digital processing steps showed the ability to follow CO fluctuations according to the fire spread. Furthermore, statistically significant differences were found between CO emissions inside and outside the burning area in both fire events. Finally, the CO2 estimated through CO column data presented an emission of 7.6 x 10(19) molecules/cm(2) for the uppermost emission day on 7 August 2018. Although CH4 monitoring is still unwavering to draw exact conclusions, the CO patterns during extreme fire events show promising and consistent data when compared with in situ data.

TI  - Empirical Estimation of Nutrient, Organic Matter and Algal Chlorophyll in a Drinking Water Reservoir Using Landsat 5 TM Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study was to develop empirical models from Landsat 5 TM data to monitor nutrient (total phosphorus: TP), organic matter (biological oxygen demand: BOD), and algal chlorophyll (chlorophyll-a: CHL-a). Instead of traditional monitoring techniques, such models could be substituted for water quality assessment in aquatic systems. A set of models were generated relating surface reflectance values of four bands of Landsat 5 TM and in-situ data by multiple linear regression analysis. Radiometric and atmospheric corrections improved the satellite image quality. A total of 32 compositions of different bands of Landsat 5 TM images were considered to find the correlation coefficient (r) with in-situ measurement of TP, BOD, and CHL-a levels collected from five sampling sites in 2001, 2006, and 2010. The results showed that TP, BOD, and CHL-a correlate well with Landsat 5 TM band reflectance values. TP (r = -0.79) and CHL-a (r = -0.79) showed the strongest relations with B1 (Blue). In contrast, BOD showed the highest correlation with B1 (Blue) (r = -0.75) and B1*B3/B4 (Blue*Red/Near-infrared) (r = -0.76). Considering the r values, significant bands and their compositions were identified and used to generate linear equations. Such equations for Landsat 5 TM could detect TP, BOD, and CHL-a with accuracies of 67%, 65%, and 72%, respectively. The developed empirical models were then applied to all study sites on the Paldang Reservoir to monitor spatio-temporal distributions of TP, BOD, and CHL-a for the month of September using Landsat 5 TM images of the year 2001, 2006, and 2010. The results showed that TP, BOD, and CHL-a decreased from 2001 to 2006 and 2010. However, S3 and S4 still have water quality issues and are influenced by climatic and anthropogenic factors, which could significantly affect reservoir drinking water quality. Overall, the present study suggested that the Landsat 5 TM may be appropriate for estimating and monitoring water quality parameters in the reservoir.

TI  - The applicability of the ACOSOG Z0011 Criteria to breast cancer patients in Hong Kong
T2  - CHINESE CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The ACOSOG Z0011 trial demonstrated safe omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) receiving breast conservative surgery, followed by whole breast irradiation and adjuvant systemic treatment. This study aims to evaluate the exportability of the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria in an Asian/Chinese cohort residing in Hong Kong.Methods: Retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database in a University affiliated tertiary breast centre was performed from June 2014 to May 2019. All breast cancer patients with no palpable adenopathy before surgery, one or more positive sentinel lymph nodes on histological examination and no prior neoadjuvant systemic treatment were recruited. Patients were grouped as eligible or ineligible according to the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria. The eligible group was compared with the sentinel alone group in the ACOSOG Z0011 cohort.Results: Two hundred and forty-eight patients were recruited into the study. Sixty patients (24%) met the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria and could potentially avoid ALND. A higher percentage of clinical T2 tumors were observed in our eligible group than in the ACOSOG Z0011 trial (P=0.002). The histological subtype, tumor grade, estrogen receptor (ER)/progestogen receptor (PR) status and lymphovascular invasion status did not differ. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of SLN micrometastasis and macrometastasis between the two groups.Conclusions: This study demonstrated clinical similarities between our eligible cohort and the ACOSOG Z0011 cohort, which confirms exportability of the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria to a subset of population in Hong Kong.

TI  - Studying the Feasibility of Assimilating Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope Imagery into the SAFY Crop Model to Predict Within-Field Wheat Yield
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial information embedded in a crop model can improve yield prediction. Leaf area index (LAI) is a well-known crop variable often estimated from remote-sensing data and used as an input into crop models. In this study, we evaluated the assimilation of LAI derived from high-resolution (both spatial and temporal) satellite imagery into a mechanistic crop model, a simple algorithm for yield estimate (SAFY), to assess the within-field crop yield. We tested this approach on spring wheat grown in Israel. Empirical LAI models were derived from the biophysical processor for Sentinel-2 LAI and spectral vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope images. The predicted grain yield obtained from the SAFY model was compared against the harvester's yield map. LAI derived from PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 fused images achieved higher yield prediction (RMSE = 69 g/m(2)) accuracy than that of Sentinel-2 LAI (RMSE = 88 g/m(2)). Even though the spatial yield estimation was only moderately correlated to the ground truth (R-2 = 0.45), this is consistent with current studies in this field, and the potential to capture within-field yield variations using high-resolution imagery has been demonstrated. Accordingly, this is the first application of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 images conjointly used to obtain a high-density time series of LAI information to model within-field yield variability.

TI  - Effects of multiple stressors on northern leopard frogs in agricultural wetlands
T2  - PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural and anthropogenic stressors, including parasites and pesticides, may induce oxidative stress in animals. Measuring oxidative stress responses in sentinel species that are particularly responsive to environmental perturbations not only provides insight into host physiology but is also a useful readout of ecosystem health. Newly metamorphosed northern leopard frogs (Lithobates pipiens), a sentinel species, were collected from agricultural and non-agricultural wetlands exposed to varying concentrations of the herbicide atrazine. Significant effects of certain parasites' abundance and their interaction with atrazine exposure on frog oxidative stress were identified. Specifically, increased protein levels were detected in frogs infected with echinostome metacercariae. In addition, the nematode Oswaldocruzia sp. was significantly associated with increased thiol concentration and catalase activity. Significant parasite x atrazine interactions were observed for atrazine exposure and the abundance of Oswaldocruzia sp. on thiol, as thiol concentrations increased with parasite abundance at low atrazine localities and decreased in high atrazine wetlands. In addition, a significant interaction between the abundances of Oswaldocruzia sp. and gorgoderid trematodes on thiol concentrations was observed. These findings demonstrate that studies of oxidative stress on animals in natural ecosystems should account for the confounding effects of parasitism, particularly for amphibians in agricultural landscapes.

TI  - Party Animals? Extreme Partisan Polarization and Dehumanization
T2  - POLITICAL BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - The affective, identity based, and often negative nature of partisan polarization in the United States has been a subject of much scholarly attention. Applying insights from recent work in social psychology, we employ three novel large-N, broadly representative online surveys, fielded over the course of 4 years, across two presidential administrations, to examine the extent to which this brand of polarization features a willingness to apply dehumanizing metaphors to out-partisans. We begin by looking at two different measures of dehumanization (one subtle and one more direct). This uncovers striking, consistent observational evidence that many partisans dehumanize members of the opposing party. We examine the relationship between dehumanization and other key partisan intensity measures, finding that it is most closely related to extreme affective polarization. We also show that dehumanization "predicts" partisan motivated reasoning and is correlated with respondent worldview. Finally, we present a survey experiment offering causal leverage to examine openness to dehumanization in the processing of new information about misdeeds by in- and out-partisans. Participants were exposed to identical information about a melee at a gathering, with the partisanship of those involved randomly assigned. We find pronounced willingness by both Democrats and Republicans to dehumanize members of the out-party. These findings shed considerable light on the nature and depth of modern partisan polarization.

TI  - Air-Sea Interaction in the Central Mediterranean Sea: Assessment of Reanalysis and Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air-sea heat fluxes are essential climate variables, required for understanding air-sea interactions, local, regional and global climate, the hydrological cycle and atmospheric and oceanic circulation. In situ measurements of fluxes over the ocean are sparse and model reanalysis and satellite data can provide estimates at different scales. The accuracy of such estimates is therefore essential to obtain a reliable description of the occurring phenomena and changes. In this work, air-sea radiative fluxes derived from the SEVIRI sensor onboard the MSG satellite and from ERA5 reanalysis have been compared to direct high quality measurements performed over a complete annual cycle at the ENEA oceanographic observatory, near the island of Lampedusa in the Central Mediterranean Sea. Our analysis reveals that satellite derived products overestimate in situ direct observations of the downwelling short-wave (bias of 6.1 W/m(2)) and longwave (bias of 6.6 W/m(2)) irradiances. ERA5 reanalysis data show a negligible positive bias (+1.0 W/m(2)) for the shortwave irradiance and a large negative bias (-17 W/m(2)) for the longwave irradiance with respect to in situ observations. ERA5 meteorological variables, which are needed to calculate the air-sea heat flux using bulk formulae, have been compared with in situ measurements made at the oceanographic observatory. The two meteorological datasets show a very good agreement, with some underestimate of the wind speed by ERA5 for high wind conditions. We investigated the impact of different determinations of heat fluxes on the near surface sea temperature (1 m depth), as determined by calculations with a one-dimensional numerical model, the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM). The sensitivity of the model to the different forcing was measured in terms of differences with respect to in situ temperature measurements made during the period under investigation. All simulations reproduced the true seasonal cycle and all high frequency variabilities. The best results on the overall seasonal cycle were obtained when using meteorological variables in the bulk formulae formulations used by the model itself. The derived overall annual net heat flux values were between +1.6 and 40.4 W/m(2), depending on the used dataset. The large variability obtained with different datasets suggests that current determinations of the heat flux components and, in particular, of the longwave irradiance, need to be improved. The ENEA oceanographic observatory provides a complete, long-term, high resolution time series of high quality in situ observations. In the future, more similar sites worldwide will be needed for model and satellite validations and to improve the determination of the air-sea exchange and the understanding of related processes.

TI  - SPECIFIC FEATURES OF THE POSTSECULAR SOCIETY IN RUSSIA
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The author believes that the postsecular society in Russia has a number of features that distinguish it from the European model. The specifics of the postsecular society in Russia are determined by the form of Soviet secularization and the cultural and sociopolitical context within which the transition to postsecularity was taking place. The author considers Soviet secularization through the concept of political religion, the essence of which is the sacralisation of social and political phenomena and the replacement of the transcendental sacred with the immanent. The results of Soviet secularization were different from those of Western secularization. In particular, legal worldview pluralism, which had become the norm for Western secular societies, was not possible in Soviet society, no "market of religions" emerged, etc. The weakening and collapse of the Soviet regime determined the context in which Russian society was transitioning to a postsecular state, and this context was different from that in Europe. The author identifies the following features of the postsecular society in Russia. (1) Acute polemics related to the presence of religion in secular spheres (education, science, army, etc.). More often, there is no dialogue between the bearers of secular and religious worldviews, but their confrontation, which is complicated by explicit or implicit government intervention. (2) Convergence between the state and the dominant religious organisation, the Russian Orthodox Church. In Western societies, the postsecular activization of religious organisations does not lead to a stronger connection between the state and any religious groups. (3) Religion has been revived in Russia not so much to perform its own religious function - to save the soul, but to solve a number of worldly tasks - ideological, cultural and identificational. The postsecular Russian Orthodoxy reminds a secular religion. 4) Russia's transition to a postsecular state was due to: a change in the policy of the authorities towards religion; a transition from suppression to religious freedom, which was later replaced by a policy of supporting traditional religions and restricting all others; the fall of the Soviet regime and its political religion; the formation of a new state and the problem of its legitimisation; anomie and a crisis of values in society, which is used to having the only official worldview supported by the state. These factors, along with the legacy of Soviet secularization, predetermined the form of religious revival and the characteristics of the Russian postsecular society.

TI  - Estimating and Monitoring Land Surface Phenology in Rangelands: A Review of Progress and Challenges
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP) has been extensively explored from global archives of satellite observations to track and monitor the seasonality of rangeland ecosystems in response to climate change. Long term monitoring of LSP provides large potential for the evaluation of interactions and feedbacks between climate and vegetation. With a special focus on the rangeland ecosystems, the paper reviews the progress, challenges and emerging opportunities in LSP while identifying possible gaps that could be explored in future. Specifically, the paper traces the evolution of satellite sensors and interrogates their properties as well as the associated indices and algorithms in estimating and monitoring LSP in productive rangelands. Findings from the literature revealed that the spectral characteristics of the early satellite sensors such as Landsat, AVHRR and MODIS played a critical role in the development of spectral vegetation indices that have been widely used in LSP applications. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) pioneered LSP investigations, and most other spectral vegetation indices were primarily developed to address the weaknesses and shortcomings of the NDVI. New indices continue to be developed based on recent sensors such as Sentinel-2 that are characterized by unique spectral signatures and fine spatial resolutions, and their successful usage is catalyzed with the development of cutting-edge algorithms for modeling the LSP profiles. In this regard, the paper has documented several LSP algorithms that are designed to provide data smoothing, gap filling and LSP metrics retrieval methods in a single environment. In the future, the development of machine learning algorithms that can effectively model and characterize the phenological cycles of vegetation would help to unlock the value of LSP information in the rangeland monitoring and management process. Precisely, deep learning presents an opportunity to further develop robust software packages such as the decomposition and analysis of time series (DATimeS) with the abundance of data processing tools and techniques that can be used to better characterize the phenological cycles of vegetation in rangeland ecosystems.

TI  - Advancing Maritime Transparent Cirrus Detection Using the Advanced Baseline Imager "Cirrus" Band
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe a quantitative evaluation of maritime transparent cirrus cloud detection, which is based on Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16 (GOES-16) and developed with collocated Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) profiling. The detection algorithm is developed using one month of collocated GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) channel-4 (1.378 mu m) radiance and CALIOP 0.532-mu m column-integrated cloud optical depth (COD). First, the relationships between the clear-sky 1.378-mu m radiance, viewing/solar geometry, and precipitable water vapor (PWV) are characterized. Using machine-learning techniques, it is shown that the total atmospheric pathlength, proxied by airmass factor (AMF), is a suitable replacement for viewing zenith and solar zenith angles alone, and that PWV is not a significant problem over ocean. Detection thresholds are computed using the channel-4 radiance as a function of AMF. The algorithm detects nearly 50% of subvisual cirrus (COD < 0.03), 80% of transparent cirrus (0.03 < COD < 0.3), and 90% of opaque cirrus (COD > 0.3). Using a conservative radiance threshold results in 84% of cloudy pixels being correctly identified and 4% of clear-sky pixels being misidentified as cirrus. A semiquantitative COD retrieval is developed for GOES ABI based on the observed relationship between CALIOP COD and 1.378-mu m radiance. This study lays the groundwork for a more complex, operational GOES transparent cirrus detection algorithm. Future expansion includes an overland algorithm, a more robust COD retrieval that is suitable for assimilation purposes, and downstream GOES products such as cirrus cloud microphysical property retrieval based on ABI infrared channels.

TI  - Mapping American lobster (<i>Homarus americanus</i>) habitat for use in marine spatial planning
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine spatial planning (MSP) is a management tool that could help mitigate the conflict that exists between the American lobster (Homarus americanus) fishery and the net-pen salmon aquaculture industry in the Canadian Maritime provinces. We developed adult American lobster species distribution models (SDMs) for use in MSP in Liverpool, Nova Scotia, through remote sensing data collection methods. A single-beam echo sounder was used to collect bathymetry and seafloor substrate data, and an aerial drone collected lobster presence data through the georeferenced photography of lobster trap buoys. The SDMs display trends in lobster presence likelihood that correspond with established patterns of habitat selection in adult lobsters. The areas where lobsters are predicted to have the highest likelihood of presence are sections of hard and rocky substrate, though that association is confounded by depth. The uncertainty of the SDMs was quantitatively assessed and the importance of explicitly analysing the effects of scale and resolution of spatial data are highlighted.

TI  - Diversity and impacts of key grassland and forage arthropod pests in China and New Zealand: An overview of IPM and biosecurity opportunities
T2  - NEOBIOTA
M3  - Review
AB  - For both New Zealand and China, agriculture is integral to the economy, supporting primary production in both intensive and extensive farming systems. Grasslands have important ecosystem and biodiversity functions, as well providing valuable grazing for livestock. However, production and persistence of grassland and forage species (e.g. alfalfa) is not only compromised by overgrazing, climate change and habitat fragmentation, but from a range of pests and diseases, which impose considerable costs on growers in lost production and income. Some of these pest species are native, but increasingly, international trade is seeing the rapid spread of exotic and invasive species. New Zealand and China are major trading partners with significant tourist flow between the two countries. This overview examines the importance of grass-lands and alfalfa in both countries, the current knowledge on the associated insect pest complex and bio-control options. Identifying similarities and contrasts in biology and impacts along with some prediction on the impact of invasive insect species, especially under climate change, are possible. However, it is suggested that coordinated longitudinal ecological research, carried out in both countries using sentinel grass and forage species, is critical to addressing gaps in our knowledge of biology and impact of potential pests, along with identifying opportunities for control, particularly using plant resistance or biological control.

TI  - Temporal Trends in COVID-19 Incidence in Two Healthcare Worker Cohorts
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Health care workers (HCWs) experience increased occupational risk of contracting COVID-19, with temporal trends that might inform surveillance. Methods: We analyzed data from a Veterans Affairs hospital-based COVID-19 worker telephone hotline collected over 40 weeks (2020). We calculated the proportion of COVID-19+ cases among persons-under-investigation (PUIs) for illness compared to rates from a nearby large university-based health care institution. Results: We observed 740 PUIs, 65 (8.8%) COVID-19+. Time trends were similar at the study and comparison hospitals; only for the first of 10 four-week observation periods was the ratio for observed to expected COVID-19+ significant (P < 0.001). Discussion: These data suggest that employee health COVID-19+ to PUI ratios could be utilized as a barometer of community trends. Pooling experience among heath care facilities may yield insights into occupational infectious disease outbreaks.

TI  - The SciPop Scale for Measuring Science-Related Populist Attitudes in Surveys: Development, Test, and Validation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Populism typically pits political elites against "the virtuous people." A distinct variant of populism ("science-related populism") extends beyond politics, targeting academic elites and suggesting they ignore people's common sense and will. Individual endorsement of such a worldview ("science-related populist attitudes") has been conceptualized but not yet measured. Hence, we developed the SciPop Scale, a survey instrument to measure science-related populist attitudes. We tested 17 survey items in a first representative survey and developed an 8-item scale. We then tested German, French, and Italian versions of this scale in a second representative survey, employing confirmatory factor analysis, Item Response Theory, and external validity tests. Findings show that the SciPop Scale is a robust and reliable measure of populist demands toward science.

AB  - This study focuses on exploring spatio-temporal changes in land use and land cover over Bandipora district of Jammu and Kashmir, India. There is significant decreases in agriculture, dense forest, and water body over the region with positive changes in the built-up area, aquatic vegetation, horticulture, marshy land, pasture, plantation, and sparse forest. It is interesting to note that Asia's largest fresh water lake "Wular" which has witnessed a large scale change in its ecosystem falls in the study area. Land use and land cover maps were explored using on screen digitisation generated from series of Landsat data (1979, 2001 and 2018). Environmental parameters like precipitation (both rain and snowfall), temperature and black carbon were analysed in order to relate with land-use and land-cover changes in the study area. Results report decreases of about 23%, 25%, 12%, 60% in agriculture, dense forest, scrub, water body, respectively from 1979 to 2018 in the study area Furthermore, increases of about 59%, 58%, 254%, 17% are reported in horticulture, sparse forest, built up and aquatic vegetation, respectively. Decrease in agriculture is attributed to decreased precipitation over study area. A decadal decrease of about 0.5% in precipitation is reported in the study area. Increased horticulture and dependency of population over forest significantly resulted in increased black carbon. This study reports a decadal increase of about 2.2% nm in black carbon in the study area. Reduction in precipitation affected Wular lake by shrinking its fresh water coverage. The fresh water area of the lake is decreased by 75% during 1979 to 2018. As one of the source of water for lake is precipitation in the form of (rain and snow), significant reduction in fresh water of Wular lake poses significant socio-economic impact on the population of study area. Present study highlights the importance of effective government policies for mitigating the impact of significant land use and land cover changes over Bandipora district.

TI  - Application assessment of GRACE and CHIRPS data in the Google Earth Engine to investigate their relation with groundwater resource changes (Northwestern region of Iran)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GROUNDWATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, drought has become a global issue, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. It is without doubt that the identification and monitoring of the drought phenomenon can help to reduce the damages that would occur. In addition, rain is one of the factors which directly affect the water levels of underground water reservoirs. This research applied a linear gradient regression method developed on the basis of GRACE, CHIRPS, and data from monitoring wells to investigate the groundwater storage changes. These data have been analyzed on the Google Earth Engine platform. In order to conduct temporal and spatial analyses, the water levels of the aquifer were generated from the monitoring wells and zoned into five classes. Also, the amount of water storage and rain from the year 2003 to 2017 in the West Azerbaijan Province were investigated using the GRACE satellite and the CHIRPS data, respectively. The results obtained from the GRACE satellite data show that the average water level in the underground reservoirs in Iran had started to decrease since 2008 and reached its peak in 2016 with an average decrease of 16 cm in that year. The average annual decline of groundwater level in the studied time period was 5 cm. A chart developed from the CHIRPS annual rainfall data indicates that the biggest decline in rainfall occurred in 2008, and the declining trend has remained steady. Linear analyses were made on GRACE with CHIRPS results and monitoring wells data separately, from which the correlation coefficients are between 86% and 97%, showing generally high correlations. Furthermore, the results obtained from the zoning of the aquifer showed that in the period of 2004 to 2016, due to the decrease in rainfall and the excessive withdrawal of groundwater, the water levels also decreased.

TI  - Incorporating Persistent Scatterer Interferometry and Radon Anomaly to Understand the Anar Fault Mechanism and Observing New Evidence of Intensified Activity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) monitors surface change and displacement over a large area with millimeter-level precision and meter-level resolution. Anar fault, with a length of similar to 200 km, is located in central Iran. Recent seismological studies on the fault indicated that it is approaching the end of its seismic cycle. Although a large earthquake is imminent, the mechanism of the fault is not well understood. Therefore, understanding and discovering the mechanism of Anar fault remains a challenge. Here, we present an approach of displacement fault analysis utilizing a combination of InSAR data obtained from the persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) method and 178 Sentinel-1 images (ascending and descending) (2017-2020). We incorporated groundwater samples from 40 wells, radon concentration anomaly mapping, Global Positioning System (GPS), and 3D displacement measurement acquired over four years (2016-2020). We investigated and monitored the deformation of the fault plate's behavior over the last three years (2017-2020) to explore new evidence and signature of displacement. The results show that the time series analysis in the fault range has an increasing displacement rate in all dimensions. We observed that the line-of-sight (LOS) displacement rate varied from 15 mm to 5 mm per year. Our calculations show that the E-W, N-S, and vertical displacement rates of the fault blocks are 2 mm to 2 mm, 6 mm to 6 mm, and 2 mm to 4 mm per year, respectively. An anomaly map of the radon concentration shows that the complete alignment of the high concentration ranges with the fault strike and the radon concentration increased on average from 23.85 Bq/L to 25.30 Bq/L over these three years. Therefore, we predict rising the radon concentration is due to the increase in activity which resulted in a deformation. Finally, our findings show that the Anar fault is an oblique and right-lateral strike-slip with a normal component mechanism. We validated the proposed method and our results by comparing the GPS field data and PSI measurements. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the PSI measurement is estimated to be 0.142 mm. Based on the supporting evidence and signature, we conclude that the Anar fault activity increased between 2017 and 2020.

TI  - Patient Characteristics and Utilization Patterns of Short-Acting Recombinant Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) Biosimilars Compared to Their Reference Product
T2  - DRUGS-REAL WORLD OUTCOMES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Data on short-acting recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) biosimilar utilization from claims data in the USA are limited. Objective To evaluate patient baseline characteristics and utilization patterns for short-acting G-CSF products with particular focus on the assessment of filgrastim biosimilar usage relative to the originator product. Patients and methods We examined filgrastim, filgrastim-sndz, and tbo-filgrastim use among adult patients between January 2012 and March 2019 across the five health-plan research partners in the BBCIC Distributed Research Network. The publicly available Sentinel System analytic toolkit was used to perform the distributed analyses. Results We evaluated over 38 million eligible health-plan members representing more than 88 million person-years of data. We identified 45,204 incident treatment episodes, including 33,118 episodes with filgrastim, 6525 episodes with filgrastim-sndz, and 5,561 episodes with tbo-filgrastim. We observed that the demographic and clinical characteristics of users were comparable across products. While total use of all filgrastim products remained consistent, the proportion of incident episodes of the originator filgrastim steadily decreased since 2014, with filgrastim-sndz and tbo-filgrastim making up the difference. Utilization for the G-CSF biosimilar, filgrastim-sndz, increased from 40 (1%) of 6823 total filgrastim product episodes in 2015, to 2486 (44%) of a total 5668 episodes of filgrastim products in 2018 (partial data for 2018). Conclusion New episodes of short-acting biosimilar filgrastim products have increased over time while the overall number of new users remained flat. Although barriers to biosimilar use in oncology have been noted, uptake has begun and continues to grow.

TI  - Soil Organic Matter Prediction Model with Satellite Hyperspectral Image Based on Optimized Denoising Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the hyperspectral sensors and exploit the potential of satellite hyperspectral data for predicting soil properties, we took MingShui County as the study area, which the study area is approximately 1481 km(2), and we selected Gaofen-5 (GF-5) satellite hyperspectral image of the study area to explore an applicable and accurate denoising method that can effectively improve the prediction accuracy of soil organic matter (SOM) content. First, fractional-order derivative (FOD) processing is performed on the original reflectance (OR) to evaluate the optimal FOD. Second, singular value decomposition (SVD), Fourier transform (FT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) are used to denoise the OR and optimal FOD reflectance. Third, the spectral indexes of the reflectance under different denoising methods are extracted by optimal band combination algorithm, and the input variables of different denoising methods are selected by the recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm. Finally, the SOM content is predicted by a random forest prediction model. The results reveal that 0.6-order reflectance describes more useful details in satellite hyperspectral data. Five spectral indexes extracted from the reflectance under different denoising methods have a strong correlation with the SOM content, which is helpful for realizing high-accuracy SOM predictions. All three denoising methods can reduce the noise in hyperspectral data, and the accuracies of the different denoising methods are ranked DWT > FT > SVD, where 0.6-order-DWT has the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.84, RMSE = 3.36 g kg(-1), and RPIQ = 1.71). This paper is relatively novel, in that GF-5 satellite hyperspectral data based on different denoising methods are used to predict SOM, and the results provide a highly robust and novel method for mapping the spatial distribution of SOM content at the regional scale.

AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) intensified by the conversion of natural resources for food purpose, urbanization, and other socioeconomic benefits as affected forest reserves and made them undergo rapid, wide-ranging changes. This study examined the use of GIS and remote sensing techniques to gain a quantitative understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of LULC. Maximum likelihood classifier approach was used to detect LULC changes in the study area of 1989 to 2019 using three Landsat images from 1989, 2004 and 2019. The observed changes were indicative of a decrease in the expanse of the forested area of (1989 to 2004), with 1989 having (89.2%) and 2004 (74.1%) with a differential range loss of (-15.1%), and a differential annual rates of deforestation of (-1.236436715). During the following 15 years (2004 to 2019) the annual rate of deforestation has increased to (1.303364215) with year 2019 recording (90.1%). The overall annual deforestation rate in the forested area of the studied period (1989-2019) is 0.033464, which implies that there is a percentage gain in forest. It is observed in this study that the highest deforestation rate was registered between 1989 and 2004. Non-forest occupied 10.8% in 1989 increasing in year 2004 by25.9% with a positive annual rate of change (5.831312231) and negative annual rate of change (-6.411388077) between 2004 to 2019, meaning there was loss in non-forest cover. The overall annual deforestation rate in the non -forested area of the studied period (1989-2019) is-0.29004. According to this evolution, the annual rate of deforestation was estimated to be (0.033464%) for the three defined periods in the forested area. So therefore to avoid drivers leading to changes in land use land cover stressing the complexity that is related to sustainable management of protected areas, urgent action is necessary to reduce loss of biodiversity due to deforestation and land degradation.

TI  - Zoomorphic Metaphors "Livestock" in Russian and Galician Language Pictures of the World
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyses zoomorphic metaphors with the naming units "livestock". The universal and specific features of the representation of these zoomorphic metaphors are determined in the compared languages. Names of domestic animals belonging to the sub-group "livestock" have been considered in order to determine the peculiarities of the associative and symbolic links of animals' appearance, behaviour, and way of life with the particular appearance and personality, behaviour and way of life of a person in Russian and Galician linguistic consciousness, to identify the set of animal metaphors characterising a person, which are significant in the view of culture, paradigms and stereotypes of linguistic consciousness, as well as value priorities of Russian and Galician linguacultures, similarities and differences between the two cultures of different types. The study is built on a semantically grounded zoonym classification, which is based not only on phenotypic traits of animals, but also on their functional role in people's life. Characteristics of domestic animals, their behavior and environment forming a basis for metaphorical reinterpretation have been analysed in the context of a comparative analysis of linguistic metaphors, figurative comparisons, idioms with a zoonym component. Metaphorisation results from the perception of the animal world through the worldview of people, their acquired social experience and subjective evaluation of animal behaviour and habits. The analysis of zoomorphic metaphors related to the "livestock" subgroup in Russian and Galician linguacultures shows that, in the centre-periphery structure of zoomorphic metaphorical naming, some of the dominant features of the animal are marked. This feature is developed according to association in the system of linguocultural axiological references. The variability of features attributed to animals and the stereotypical attitude towards them are conditioned by the specific worldview of native speakers. Universal associations that are the basis of zoomorphic metaphors in the compared languages largely correlate with the general characteristics of the animal. The most relevant features for both languages that are represented in the figurative name are behaviour and inner qualities, physical characteristics and mental abilities. Features related to appearance and activity are less frequent. The differences are revealed in the choice of the basis for modelling a metaphorical image, in the repertoire of evaluative meanings, as well as in the degree of productivity of the development of metaphorical meanings. The coincidence of the features in the Russian and Galician languages can be explained by animal domestication, their area of distribution, as well as common subjects of mythological texts. More complex metaphorical comparisons are predominantly nationally marked.

TI  - Examining Land Use/Land Cover Change and Its Prediction Based on a Multilayer Perceptron Markov Approach in the Luki Biosphere Reserve, Democratic Republic of Congo
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Villages within the Luki Biosphere Reserve and the surrounding cities have undergone rapid demographic growth and urbanization that have impacted the reserve's natural landscape. However, no study has focused on the spatiotemporal analysis of its land use/land cover. The present research aims at providing a comprehensive analysis of land use/land cover change in the Luki Biosphere Reserve from the year 1987 to 2020, and to predict its future change for the year 2038. Landsat images were classified in order to provide land use/land cover maps for the years 1987, 2002, 2017 and 2020. Based on these maps, change detection, gradient direction, and landscape metric analyses were performed. In addition, land use/land cover change prediction was carried out using the Multilayer Perceptron Markov model. The results revealed significant land use/land cover changes in the Luki Biosphere Reserve during the study period. Indeed, tremendous changes in the primary forest, which lost around 17.8% of its total area, were noted. Other classes, notably savannah, secondary forest, built-up area, fallow land and fields had gained 79.35, 1150.36, 67.63, 3852.12 hectares, respectively. Based on the landscape metric analysis, it was revealed that built-up areas and fallow land and fields experienced an aggregation trend, while other classes showed disaggregation and fragmentation trends. Analysis further revealed that village expansion has significantly affected the process of land use/land cover change in the Luki Biosphere Reserve. However, the prediction results revealed that the primary forest will continue to increase while built-up area, fallow land and fields will follow a trend similar to a previous one. As for secondary forest and savannah, the forecast revealed a decrease of the extent during the period extending from 2020 to 2038. The present findings will benefit the decision makers, particularly in the sustainable natural resources management of the Luki Biosphere Reserve.

TI  - Choice of LECS Procedure for Benign and Malignant Gastric Tumors
T2  - JOURNAL OF GASTRIC CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Laparoscopic endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) refers to the endoscopic dissection of the mucosal or submucosal layers with laparoscopic seromuscular resection. We recommend a treatment algorithm for the LECS procedure for gastric benign tumors according to the protruding type. In the exophytic type, endoscopic-assisted wedge resection can be performed. In the endophytic type, endoscopic-assisted wedge resection of the anterior wall is relatively easy to perform, and endoscopic-assisted transgastric resection, laparoscopicassisted intragastric surgery, or single-incision intragastric resection in the posterior wall and esophagogastric junction (EG Jx) can be attempted. We propose an algorithm for the LECS procedure for early gastric cancer according to the tumor location. The endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) procedure can be adapted for all areas of the stomach, and single-incision ESD can be performed in the mid to high body and the EG Jx. In full-thickness gastric resection, laparoscopy-assisted endoscopic full-thickness resection can be adapted for the entire area of the stomach, but it cannot be applied to the pyloric and EG Jx. In conclusion, surgeons need to select the LECS procedure according to tumor type, tumor location, the surgeon's individual experience, and the situation of the institution while also considering the advantages and disadvantages of each procedure.

TI  - How Much Can We See from a UAV-Mounted Regular Camera? Remote Sensing-Based Estimation of Forest Attributes in South American Native Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data collection from large areas of native forests poses a challenge. The present study aims at assessing the use of UAV for forest inventory on native forests in Southern Chile, and seeks to retrieve both stand and tree level attributes from forest canopy data. Data were collected from 14 plots (45 x 45 m) established at four locations representing unmanaged Chilean temperate forests: seven plots on secondary forests and seven plots on old-growth forests, including a total of 17 different native species. The imagery was captured using a fixed-wing airframe equipped with a regular RGB camera. We used the structure from motion and digital aerial photogrammetry techniques for data processing and combined machine learning methods based on boosted regression trees and mixed models. In total, 2136 trees were measured on the ground, from which 858 trees were visualized from the UAV imagery of the canopy, ranging from 26% to 88% of the measured trees in the field (mean = 45.7%, SD = 17.3), which represented between 70.6% and 96% of the total basal area of the plots (mean = 80.28%, SD = 7.7). Individual-tree diameter models based on remote sensing data were constructed with R-2 = 0.85 and R-2 = 0.66 based on BRT and mixed models, respectively. We found a strong relationship between canopy and ground data; however, we suggest that the best alternative was combining the use of both field-based and remotely sensed methods to achieve high accuracy estimations, particularly in complex structure forests (e.g., old-growth forests). Field inventories and UAV surveys provide accurate information at local scales and allow validation of large-scale applications of satellite imagery. Finally, in the future, increasing the accuracy of aerial surveys and monitoring is necessary to advance the development of local and regional allometric crown and DBH equations at the species level.

TI  - COVID-19 and Policy Impacts on the Bangladesh Rice Market and Food Security
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This research employs a partial equilibrium model to estimate the short- and long-run effects of COVID-19 and rice policies on Bangladesh's rice market and food security. We also analyze the impact of relevant policies in terms of their effectiveness in mitigating stresses stemming from a hypothetical pandemic with a COVID-19-like impact. The results indicate that the effect of COVID-19 on Bangladeshi food security during FY 2019/20 was mixed, as the indicators of food availability improved by 5%, and decreased by 17% for food stability, relative to what they would have been otherwise. Policy simulation results indicate that a higher import tariff improves self-sufficiency status, but undermines rice availability and accessibility by bending the market toward a restrictive trade regime. Results also indicate that unlike stock enhancement policy, closing the existing yield gap improves rice availability, accessibility, and moderates the depressing effect of a future event with repercussions similar to COVID-19, although the yield policy appears more speculative and could be too costly. The insights generated contribute to the understanding of policies that aim to achieve sustainable development goals related to aggregate food security, and build resilience against future shocks akin to COVID-19.

TI  - Evaluating Trends in Novel Psychoactive Substances Using a Sentinel Population of Electronic Dance Music Festival Attendees
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Electronic dance music (EDM) festivals have become a popular venue for recreational drug use, including the use of traditional stimulants like 3,4-methylenendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and novel psychoactive substances (NPS). Using this cohort of people who use drugs recreationally, this study sought to collect biological specimens and self-reported drug use data from EDM festival attendees in the United States to monitor regional and temporal trends related to NPS use and turnover between 2014 and 2017. Oral fluid samples were collected at three United States EDM festival locations, including Miami, Florida (2014 to 2017); Tampa, Florida (2017) and Atlanta, Georgia (2017). Samples were screened by liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Over the 4 years, 1,233 oral fluid samples were collected. With respect to self-reported drug use, 63% of respondents reported medicinal and/or recreational drug use within the last week. When comparing 4 years of data from Miami (2014 to 2017), NPS trends showed the disappearance of alpha-PVP after 2014 followed by a significant increase in ethylone positivity in 2015 and rapid decrease in 2016. Dibutylone was identified for the first time in Miami 2016, and N-ethyl pentylone was identified for the first time in Miami 2017. Additionally, 3,4-methylenendioxymethamphetamine positivity steadily increased from 2014 to 2017. A comparison across study sites (Miami, Tampa and Atlanta) and specific trends with respect to novel simulant use are described within. Using this opportunistic approach of monitoring drug trends, we have found that peak positivity of novel stimulants usually is within a year of their first detection. Understanding the dynamics of NPS drug markets will allow laboratories to plan for resource allocation and scope updates within a timely fashion to assist with the detection and confirmation of these emerging substances in samples submitted for forensic analysis.

TI  - Actual Evapotranspiration from UAV Images: A Multi-Sensor Data Fusion Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral imaging using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has changed the pace of precision agriculture. Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from the very high spatial resolution of UAV images over agricultural fields can help farmers increase their production at the lowest possible cost. ETa estimation using UAVs requires a full package of sensors capturing the visible/infrared and thermal portions of the spectrum. Therefore, this study focused on a multi-sensor data fusion approach for ETa estimation (MSDF-ET) independent of thermal sensors. The method was based on sharpening the Landsat 8 pixels to UAV spatial resolution by considering the relationship between reference ETa fraction (ETrf) and a Vegetation Index (VI). Four Landsat 8 images were processed to calculate ETa of three UAV images over three almond fields. Two flights coincided with the overpasses and one was in between two consecutive Landsat 8 images. ETrf was chosen instead of ETa to interpolate the Landsat 8-derived ETrf images to obtain an ETrf image on the UAV flight. ETrf was defined as the ratio of ETa to grass reference evapotranspiration (ETr), and the VIs tested in this study included the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI). NDVI performed better under the study conditions. The MSDF-ET-derived ETa showed strong correlations against measured ETa, UAV- and Landsat 8-based METRIC ETa. Also, visual comparison of the MSDF-ET ETa maps was indicative of a promising performance of the method. In sum, the resulting ETa had a higher spatial resolution compared with thermal-based ETa without the need for the Albedo and hot/cold pixels selection procedure. However, wet soils were poorly detected, and in cases of continuous cloudy Landsat pixels the long interval between the images may cause biases in ETa estimation from the MSDF-ET method. Generally, the MSDF-ET method reduces the need for very high resolution thermal information from the ground, and the calculations can be conducted on a moderate-performance computer system because the main image processing is applied on Landsat images with coarser spatial resolutions.

TI  - The use of sentinel skin islands for monitoring buried and semi-buried micro-vascular flaps. Part I: Summary and brief description of monitoring methods
T2  - BIOMEDICAL PAPERS-OLOMOUC
M3  - Article
AB  - Micro-vascular flaps have been used for the repair of challenging defects for over 45 years.The risk of failure is reported to be around 5-10% which despite medical and technical advances in recent years remains essentially unchanged. Precise, continuous, sensitive and specific monitoring together with prompt notification of vascular compromise is crucial for the success of the procedure. In this review, we provide a classification and brief description of the reported methods for monitoring the micro-vascular flap and a summary of the benefits over direct visual monitoring. Over 40 different monitoring techniques have been reported but their comparative merits are not always obvious. One looks for early detection of a flap's compromise, improved flap salvage rate and a minimal false-positive or false-negative rate. The cost-effectiveness of any method should also be considered.Direct visualisation of the flap is the method most generally used and still seems to be the simplest, cheapest and most reliable method for flap monitoring. Considering the alternatives, only implantable Doppler ultrasound probes, near infrared spectroscopy and laser Doppler flowmetry have shown any evidence of improved flap salvage rates over direct visual monitoring.

TI  - The use of sentinel skin islands for monitoring buried and semi-buried micro-vascular flaps. Part II: Clinical application
T2  - BIOMEDICAL PAPERS-OLOMOUC
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the high success rate of micro-vascular flaps, anastomosis compromise occurs in 5-10% and that can lead to flap failure. Reliable monitoring of the flap is therefore of similar importance to that of the precise surgical procedure itself. Multiple methods have been reported for monitoring of the flap vitality, the first one being direct visual monitoring. In buried flaps direct visualisation is not feasible or is unreliable. In these cases we can extend the buried flap to expose a segment of it to act as a monitoring sentinel. For the purpose of this review we used our clinical experience as a starting point, and for the extended information and expertise we conducted a search of the PubMed database. Over 40 monitoring techniques have been reported to-date. Direct visual monitoring is still generally used method with a reliability of up to 100% and an overall success rate of up to 99%.Direct visualisation remains as the simplest, cheapest and yet a very reliable method of flap monitoring. In this review we provide a description of various possible techniques for externalising part of a buried flap, define the tissues that can be used for this purpose and we summarise the procedures that should be followed to achieve the best reliability and validity of monitoring the skin island.

TI  - Ocean Optical Properties of Equatorial Pacific Reef Habitat
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal areas around Palau Island and Tonga Island, near the Pacific equator, consist of coral reefs, mangrove and seaweed. In particular, understanding the optical properties of sea surface water in coral reef habitats helps improve the accuracy of remote sensing based habitat mapping and identify tropical ecosystem characteristics. Here, we collected spectral characteristics of sea surface water of Palau Island and Tonga Island and analyzed the concentration of suspended matters, absorption coefficient, and remote sensing reflectance to understand the seawater characteristics of the coral reef habitats. Based on the results of the suspended matter concentration analysis, we developed and verified an empirical algorithm to derive the concentration from satellite data using remote sensing reflectance of three bands, 555,625,660 nm, showed a high determinant coefficient,0 .98. In conclusion, coral reef habitats in tropical regions are characterized by CASE-I water in terms of the marine optics with oligotrophic properties, and require monitoring using continuous collection and analysis of field data.

TI  - Surface Change Detection in the March 5 Youth Mine Using Sentinel-1 Interferometric SAR Coherence Imagery
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Open-pit mines require constant monitoring as they can cause surface changes and environmental disturbances. In open-pit mines, there is little vegetation at the mining site and can be monitored using InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) coherence imageries. In this study, activities occurring in mine were analyzed by applying the recently developed InSAR coherence-based NDAI (Normalized Difference Activity Index). The March 5 Youth Mine is a North Korean mine whose development has been expanded since 2008. NDAI analysis was performed with InSAR coherence imageries obtained using Sentinel-1 SAR images taken at 12-day intervals in the March 5 Youth Mine. First, the area where the elevation decreased by about 75.24 m and increased by about 9.85 m over the 14 years from 2000 was defined as the mining site and the tailings piles. Then, the NDAI images were used for time series analysis at various time intervals. Over the entire period (2017-2019), average mining activity was relatively active at the center of the mining area. In order to find out more detailed changes in the surface activity of the mine, the time interval was reduced and the activity was observed over a 1-year period. In 2017, we analyzed changes in mining operations before and after artificial earthquakes based on seismic data and NDAI images. After the large-scale blasting that occurred on 30 April 2017, activity was detected west of the mining area. It is estimated that the size of the mining area was enlarged by two blasts on 30 September 2017. The time-averaged NDAI images used to perform detailed time-series analysis were generated over a period of 1 year and 4 months, and then composited into RGB images. Annual analysis of activity confirmed an active region in the northeast of the mining area in 2018 and found the characteristic activity of the expansion of tailings piles in 2019. Time series analysis using NDAI was able to detect random surface changes in open-pit mines that are difficult to identify with optical images. Especially in areas where in situ data is not available, remote sensing can effectively pertorm mining activity analysis.

TI  - Coordinating Effect of VEGFC and Oleic Acid Participates to Tumor Lymphangiogenesis
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary In cancer, the lymphatic system is hijacked by tumor cells that escape from primary tumor and metastasize to the sentinel lymph nodes. Tumor lymphangiogenesis is stimulated by the vascular endothelial growth factors-C (VEGFC) after binding to its receptor VEGFR-3. However, how VEGFC cooperates with other molecules to promote lymphatic neovessel growth has not been fully determined. Here, we showed that tumor lymphangiogenesis developed in tumoral lesions and in their surrounding adipose tissue (AT). Interestingly, lymphatic vessel density correlated with an increase in circulating free fatty acids (FFA) in the lymph from tumor-bearing mice. We showed that adipocyte-released FFA are uploaded by lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) to stimulate their sprouting. Lipidomic analysis identified the monounsaturated oleic acid (OA) as the major circulating FFA in the lymph in a tumoral context. OA transporters FATP-3, -6 and CD36 were only upregulated on LEC in the presence of VEGFC showing a collaborative effect of these molecules. OA released from adipocytes is taken up by LECs to stimulate the fatty acid beta-oxidation, leading to increased adipose tissue lymphangiogenesis. Our results provide new insights on the dialogue between tumors and adipocytes via the lymphatic system and identify a key role for adipocyte-derived FFA in the promotion of lymphangiogenesis, revealing novel therapeutic opportunities for inhibitors of lymphangiogenesis in cancer.

TI  - Developing an SDSS for optimal sustainable roof covering planning based on UHI variation at neighborhood scale
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, academics have paid special attention to global warming, because it has several issues such as urban heat island (UHI) related to the quality of life. For this purpose, a spatial decision support system (SDSS) has been developed to investigate the effect of parcels' roof covering type on surface heat island (SHI) values and its variation at the neighborhood scale in Tehran, Iran. This SDSS, as the innovation of the present research, consists of two main steps including estimating the UHI value in the study area and adopting the optimum set of parcels to change their roofs' cover with three types of vegetation, high-albedo material, and flagstone. The first step is accomplished by aggregating various indices related to land cover obtained from Landsat 8 images. The aggregation is done by linear regression method (LRM) with an RMSE and R-2 equal to 0.942 and 0.897, respectively. Then, the genetic algorithm was used to select the optimal subset, including 10% of the parcels in the area, to change their roof covering type based on minimizing the UHI's variation. The standard deviation obtained after the changes improved from 13.222 to 10.781 degrees C. The results indicate that to control UHI in the center of the region, it is necessary to inhibit UHI effects at the boundary of the study area with vegetation roof covering since flagstone and high-albedo materials have local effects on controlling the UHI effects.

TI  - Increasing Resolution of Seismic Hazard Mapping on the Example of the North of Middle Russian Highland
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The standard problem of engineering geophysics, solved for road and house building and other construction types, is in the localization of areas with increased mobility in the upper part of a geological cross-section and in the parameterization of this mobility in terms of seismic intensity. There is a standard approach, according to which researchers assess the elastic strength characteristics of the core to a depth of about 30 m, implement the accumulation of seismogram observations, simulate accelerograms for particular conditions and, taking into account the data of complex geophysical methods, calculate the increment of seismic intensity as one of the parameters of a seismic hazard. The final result of this approach has the form of a seismogenic hazard map and a set of recommendations including the consideration of identified areas with a significant increasing seismic intensity increment, due to the peculiarities of the geological structure of polygons. This result is reliable, but very expensive, and requires the development of primary estimations of the rock massif with reduced resistance to external loads, which would optimize the efforts in engineering drilling and in field geophysical measurements in order to densify their spatial grid in the vicinity of a priori known positions with an increased seismogenic hazard. In addition, relatively sparse grids of wells, as well as local geophysical profiles laid under conditions of a complicated landscape, do not accurately localize risky areas in order to focus the attention of builders on strengthening the specific part of raised constructions. Following the wishes of our customers and relying on long-term testing of our interpretational developments, we formed an approach to primary hazard forecasting based on remote sensing data and digital elevation models, which can be classified as data with relatively free access. This article presents the results of research which was based on these free-of-charge data and which was developed in the field of construction of ground engineering structures for agricultural purposes, where one of the factors of mobility in the upper part of a cross-section is intensive karstification. Basically, the construction area according to the general seismic zoning maps is seismologically passive, though the relatively fast dynamics of karst determines the relevance of the detailed seismic zoning. The results of our interpretations are verified by deep geological and structural reconstructions based on wave analogies. The representativeness of the final forecast was confirmed by subsequent seismic assessments, which is related to the scientific novelty of the presented article. The authors' technology for the qualitative and quantitative interpretation of remote sensing data and digital elevation models with high resolution provides the opportunity to increase the spatial resolution of seismic microzonation forecasts, implemented by standard geophysical methods, and it determines the practical significance of completed research.

TI  - A fuzzy mathematical model for evaluation of rock-fracture and structural complexity: application for Southern Atlas in Tunisia
T2  - ACTA GEODAETICA ET GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present paper, a fuzzy model of assessment is proposed according the framework of fuzzy mathematical theory to estimate the complexity of rock fractures and geological structures. We established the fuzzy evaluation model and decided a trapezoidal membership function using the fuzzy mathematics. Dataset acquisition is integrated with an advanced technique of coupling multiscale fracture data obtained from both high-resolution satellite imagery and field data. Five parameters were selected, including qualitative and quantitative data from different scales, namely fractal dimension, fracture length, fracture intensity, the intersection angle between fractures and beddings and the fracture density. The weight of each factor is obtained with the principle that the relative value of the complexity index is larger and the weight is significant. This model was applied to the complexity assessment of the southwestern Tunisia. The rank of complexity of each sub-area in the study region is from strong to weak. The result shows that Jebal Orbata and Jebal Chamsi have the strongest complexity due to their position beside the 140 dextral strike-slip Gafsa fault. The east and central zone of the region of investigation has the weakest complexity.

TI  - Spatial Modeling of Potential Lobster Harvest Grounds in Palabuhanratu Bay, West Java, Indonesia
T2  - FISHES
M3  - Article
AB  - Palabuhanratu Bay is a location in the southern part of Java Island with a high lobster population. Based on field observation, the lobster population in Palabuhanratu Bay is dominated by Panulirus homarus (green sand lobster), Panulirus versicolor (bamboo lobster), Panulirus penicillatus (black lobster), and Panulirus ornatus (pearl lobster). This study aimed to develop a spatial model using satellite-derived data to predict potential lobster harvest grounds in Palabuhanratu Bay. The Earth observational satellite data used were multispectral Landsat 8-SR imagery, and information about chlorophyll-a, salinity, total suspended solids (TSSs), sea surface temperature (SST), and distance from the coastline was extracted. Multiple linear regression was applied to build the prediction model, which was validated using 10-fold cross-validation. The result of the lobster harvest prediction model agreed with the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and adjusted R-2 values of 0.326 and 0.708, respectively. The distribution of lobsters was strong at the following preferred ranges: chlorophyll-a: 1.1-1.7 mg/m(3); salinity: 20.2-23.7 ppt; TSS: 40-56.4 mg/L; SST: 29.5-29.9 degrees C; and distance from the coastline: 500-4700 m. In this study, the habitats of four species of lobsters and their relationships with satellite-derived parameters were evaluated.

TI  - Can Landsat Thermal Imagery and Environmental Data Accurately Estimate Water Temperatures in Small Streams?
T2  - JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to monitor water temperature is important for assessing changes in riverine ecosystems resulting from climate warming. Direct in situ water temperature collection efforts provide point samples but are cost-prohibitive for characterizing stream temperatures across large spatial scales, especially for small, remote streams. In contrast, satellite thermal infrared imagery may provide a spatially extensive means of monitoring riverine water temperatures; however, researchers do not have a good understanding of the accuracy of these remotely sensed temperatures for small streams. Here, we investigated the utility of Landsat 8 thermal infrared imagery and both local and regional environmental variables to estimate subsurface temperatures in high-latitude small streams (2-30 m wetted width) from a test watershed in southcentral Alaska. Our results suggested that Landsat-based surface temperatures were biased high, and the degree of bias varied with hydrological and meteorological factors. However, with limited instream validation work, results indicated it is possible to reconstruct average in situ water temperatures for small streams at regional scales using a regression modelling framework coupled with publicly available Landsat or air temperature information. Generalized additive models built from stream stage information from a single gage and air temperatures from a single weather station in the drainage fit to a limited set of in situ temperature recordings could estimate average stream temperatures at the watershed level with reasonable accuracy (root mean square error 2.4 degrees C). Landsat information did track closely with regional air temperatures and we could also incorporate it into a regression model as a substitute for air temperature to estimate in situ stream temperatures at watershed scales. Importantly, however, while average watershed-scale stream temperatures may be predictable, site-level estimates did not improve with the use of Landsat information or other local covariates, indicating that additional information may be necessary to generate accurate spatially explicit temperature predictions for small order streams.

TI  - COVID-19 Pandemic and Conspiracy Beliefs: Psychological Antecedents, Consequences, Possibilities for Correction
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The coronavirus pandemic is accompanied by the active introduction of conspiracy theories into the mass consciousness, that is, concepts that explain the causes and extent of the pandemic by the action of certain groups of people. The article discusses three main questions: what factors provoke the appearance of conspiracy beliefs in people; how these beliefs affect behavior related to the coronavirus pandemic; how to counter conspiracy theories. A person's acceptance of conspiracy beliefs related to COVID-19 is facilitated by a variety of socio-demographic and psychological factors: gender, age, educational level, financial situation, current psychological state of a person; one's stable individual psychological characteristics (personality traits, worldview beliefs, style of thinking, features of the cognitive sphere and attitudes); features of social identity. Conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 affect various behavioral responses associated with the pandemic: compliance with hygiene and social distancing norms, purchasing behavior, adherence to pseudoscientific practices for the prevention and treatment of coronavirus infection. The specificity of the influence of various types of conspiracy beliefs on people's behavior associated with the pandemic was found. Some types of conspiracy beliefs are more likely to inhibit the implementation of prevention recommendations than others. This indicates that conspiracy beliefs should not be viewed as a whole, but in a differentiated way. The influence of conspiracy beliefs on following "anti-COVID" recommendations is mediated by intermediate variables such as a subjective assessment of the danger of COVID-19, trust in science, and a sense of helplessness. Two main strategies for countering conspiracy theories have been identified: preventive, implemented before the appearance of conspiracy information, and reactive, carried out after information about such theories appears in the media and social networks. Various options for implementing a preventive strategy are considered: limiting the dissemination of information about COVID-19 conspiracy theories, preventive refutation of such theories, and the formation of skills in people to detect inaccurate information. The factors of the effectiveness of the reactive countermeasure strategy are considered: the type of tactics for refuting the conspiracy theory, characteristics of the source of inaccurate information about the theory, the structure of the refuting message, the frequency of repetition of inaccurate information and the time elapsed between its appearance and refutation, the degree and direction of the recipient's cognitive activity, their views and beliefs.

TI  - Increase in Storm Activity in the Kara Sea from 1979 to 2019: Numerical Simulation Data
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind wave modeling (WAVEWATCH III model) is used to analyze the storm activity in the Kara Sea for the period from 1979 to 2019. The NCEP/CFSR/CFSv2 reanalysis data used as forcing. Simulations realized on the nonstructural grid with a resolution of 700 m to 10 km. The quality of wind wave simulation is assessed through a comparison with direct measurements and satellite data. The storm wave frequencies are analyzed separately for each year. It is found that storms with waves more than 3 m are observed on average about 30 times a year. The frequency of storms with waves more than 3-5 m increased twofold from 1979 to 2019. The increase in the storm frequency is due to a decrease in the sea ice cover extent. Analysis of the seasonal variations in storm activity shows that the largest amount of storms is observed from July to December. A strong positive trend in the frequency of storms is observed from October to December. Storms in January, February, and March have been observed since 2005 due to the absence of ice, which contributes significantly to the ultimate increase in the storm frequency.

TI  - Classification of fires in coal waste dumps based on Landsat, Aster thermal bands and thermal camera in Polish and Ukrainian mining regions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A self-heating intensity index (SHII) based on the highest (pixel max.) and lowest (pixel min.) values taken from satellite thermal maps of burning coal waste dumps are proposed. The index enables the classification of such fires in Ukrainian- and Polish coal waste dumps. Both in Ukraine and in Poland, varying thermal intensities during 1985-2019 are revealed, using the SHII and following thermal intensity threshold values, namely, extreme thermal activity (> 7), advanced (3-7), moderate (3-1.5), initial (1.5-1), no activity (< 1). The SHII shows decreasing thermal activity in the selected Ukrainian coal waste dumps during 2017-2019. It aids in reconstructing the thermal history of the dumps. Analysis of satellite images revealed a large number of burning coal waste dumps in the Donetsk Coal Basin (Ukraine) with high thermal activity. Such burning likely reflects large amounts of organic matter and sulphides in the dumped material subjected to self-heating and self-burning processes, lack of compaction of the coal waste and/or high methane contents. Comparison of SHII values calculated from satellite- and drone thermal-camera images were compared to show that SHII from drone thermal images have much higher values than those from satellite images; the former have better resolution. Thus, SHII from Landsat- and drone images should be used separately in dump heating studies.

TI  - Surgical procedures in melanoma: recommended deep and lateral margins, indications for sentinel lymph node biopsy, and complete lymph node dissection
T2  - ITALIAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Surgery is the main treatment for cutaneous melanoma including the primary melanoma as well as lymph node metastases. The recommended margins have changed over time. Similarly, indications for sentinel lymph node biopsy and complete lymph node dissection are constantly evolving if knowledge on the biological behavior of melanomas increases. The current guidelines and the most relevant literature were reviewed to provide an update on the existing recommendations for surgical management of melanoma. Wide excision margins are evidenced-based but not for all situations. Melanoma in situ requires 0.5-1 cm with increasing evidence for 1 cm particularly those presenting on the head-and-neck in the setting of chronic sun damage. Invasive melanomas need 1-2 cm margins, 2 cm for tumors thicker than 2 mm and some large tumors with > 1-2 mm thickness and with a lentiginous growth pattern. Lentigo maligna, subungual melanoma, and acral lentiginous melanoma require surgical techniques with complete circumferential peripheral margin assessment. Sentinel lymph node biopsy provides relevant information for melanoma staging. Therefore, it is consistently recommended for melanomas > 1-4 mm and highly recommended for melanomas >4 mm, >0.8-1.0 mm or <= 0.8 mm with additional risk factors. Complete lymph node dissection has high morbidity and no impact on survival and is restricted to regional control for clinically detected metastasis. Although the trend is to reduce progressively the recommended surgical margins, further evidence is needed to clarify its role in patients' survival. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is important for establishing a prognosis especially upon considering adjuvant therapy; complete lymph node dissection is only relevant for regional disease control.

TI  - Detecting Multi-Decadal Changes in Seagrass Cover in Tauranga Harbour, New Zealand, Using Landsat Imagery and Boosting Ensemble Classification Techniques
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass provides a wide range of essential ecosystem services, supports climate change mitigation, and contributes to blue carbon sequestration. This resource, however, is undergoing significant declines across the globe, and there is an urgent need to develop change detection techniques appropriate to the scale of loss and applicable to the complex coastal marine environment. Our work aimed to develop remote-sensing-based techniques for detection of changes between 1990 and 2019 in the area of seagrass meadows in Tauranga Harbour, New Zealand. Four state-of-the-art machine-learning models, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB), and CatBoost (CB), were evaluated for classification of seagrass cover (presence/absence) in a Landsat 8 image from 2019, using near-concurrent Ground-Truth Points (GTPs). We then used the most accurate one of these models, CB, with historic Landsat imagery supported by classified aerial photographs for an estimation of change in cover over time. The CB model produced the highest accuracies (precision, recall, F-1 scores of 0.94, 0.96, and 0.95 respectively). We were able to use Landsat imagery to document the trajectory and spatial distribution of an approximately 50% reduction in seagrass area from 2237 ha to 1184 ha between the years 1990-2019. Our illustration of change detection of seagrass in Tauranga Harbour suggests that machine-learning techniques, coupled with historic satellite imagery, offers potential for evaluation of historic as well as ongoing seagrass dynamics.

TI  - The impact of sentinel lymph node sampling versus traditional lymphadenectomy on the survival of patients with stage IIIC endometrial cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To investigate the survival of patients with lymph node positive endometrial carcinoma by type of surgical lymph node assessment. Methods Patients diagnosed between January 2012 and December 2015 with endometrial carcinoma and uterine confined disease and nodal metastases on final pathology who underwent minimally invasive hysterectomy were identified in the National Cancer Database. Patients who had sentinel lymph node biopsy alone or underwent systematic lymphadenectomy were selected. Overall survival was evaluated following generation of Kaplan-Meier curves and compared with the log rank test. A Cox model was constructed to evaluate survival after controlling for confounders. Results A total of 1432 patients were identified: 1323 (92.4%) and 109 (7.6%) underwent systematic lymphadenectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy only, respectively. The rate of adjuvant treatment was comparable between patients who had sentinel lymph node biopsy alone and systematic lymphadenectomy (83.5% vs 86.6%, p=0.39). However, patients who had sentinel lymph node biopsy were less likely to receive chemotherapy alone (13.6% vs 36.6%, p<0.001) and more likely to receive radiation therapy alone (19.8% vs 5.4%, p<0.001) compared with patients who had systematic lymphadenectomy. There was no difference in overall survival between patients who had sentinel lymph node biopsy alone and systematic lymphadenectomy (p=0.27 from log rank test), and 3 year overall survival rates were 82.2% and 79.4%, respectively (p>0.05). After controlling for confounders, there was no difference in survival between the systematic lymphadenectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy alone groups (hazard ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 1.45). Conclusions Performance of sentinel lymph node biopsy alone was not associated with an adverse impact on survival in patients with lymph node positive endometrial cancer.

TI  - Sustainability of Recycling Waste Picker Sustainopreneurs for Prevention and Mitigation of Municipal Solid Waste in Swat
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the role of waste picker sustainopreneurs (WPS) by examining their recycling contributions in a special case of District Swat, Pakistan. Using a transformative worldview, this study acknowledges their contributions to recycling. The study envisages how entrepreneurial agency works in unanticipated ways where the poorest of the poor enterprise without resources demonstrate unexpected agency to improve the environment. An inductive research design in conjunction with grounded theory was used to analyze data from 37 interviews in three tehsils of District Swat. The recycling sector uses primitive measures, which are completely informal, self-organized, and self-controlled. Surprisingly, we discovered that informal recycling contributes unfavorably to waste, energy, and food (WEF) security due to intermixing and adulteration, as well as acts as a gray channel for illicit practices that have taken advantage of tax amnesty in the area until 2023. The uncontrolled welding of half cut and nose cut car parts has skyrocketed the motorization index and CO2 emissions; however, it has also resulted in alternative sources of livelihoods, as these accidental environmentalists had found modern sources of income. This is similar to low-tech innovation and business creation that takes advantage of tax holidays due to the special status of District Swat. The study highlights the most and least valuable recyclables and identifies the gray channel markets of spare parts, metal recycling, counterfeit products, fuel intermixing, and adulteration. The study contributes by untangling the understanding of a legal gambit of tax amnesty as a critical pre-policy input as well as advocates for rights of invisible stakeholders of waste management in Pakistan.

In a celebrated nehiyaw (Cree) fashion, storytelling and language are used as examples of a non-linear and sometimes complicated journey back to self, culture, nature and healing. Against the background of being kidnapped, imprisoned in a religious institution, and robbed of all-things nehiyaw (Cree), this article offers a sense of Joseph Naytowhow's journey back to intimacy, love, and affection which aids in one's search for emotional safety. Joseph utilizes nehiyawihtwawin (Cree worldview and culture) knowledge tools such as dreaming to aid in his journey back to nehiyawihtwawin (Cree culture) and nehiyawewin (Cree language). From a residential school internee to a leader and emerging Elder, he notes the importance of mentors in a relational approach to healing. This article provides an invitation through "the sunrise song" to "Wake up!" and create a more respectful and reciprocal world of internal wholeness.

TI  - Characteristics of Atmospheric Aerosols Over the UAE Inferred From CALIPSO and Sun Photometer Aerosol Optical Depth
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study provides insights on the composition and variability of atmospheric aerosols over the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by analyzing the atmospheric conditions together with 14 years (2006-2019) of aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved from CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) satellite, and 7 years of AOD measured from the ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET).We found that mineral dust is the most prevailing aerosol subtype. In addition, polluted dust and polluted continental aerosols are observed mostly in the cold season. The AOD is higher in spring and summer, when the atmospheric conditions are more favorable to the occurrence of dust events. Moreover, there is another peak in winter associated with dust storms triggered by mid-latitude baroclinic systems. In summer's daytime, extinction coefficients in excess of 0.2 km(-1) are observed up to 3-4 km above the surface, as a result of the warmer and windier conditions. In the cold season and at night, the dust layers are confined to the lower atmosphere below 2 km. On a climatological time scale, we found that the AOD over the UAE has been decreasing since 2009, possibly due to the increasing trend in precipitation and changes in land use.This study highlights the large contribution of dust aerosols to the total aerosol load over the UAE and stresses on the need to account for mineral dust aerosols in climate-air pollution related studies as well as weather and air quality forecasts.

TI  - Comparison of Lightning Detection Between the FY-4A Lightning Mapping Imager and the ISS Lightning Imaging Sensor
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lightning Mapping Imager (LMI) onboard Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) is the first Chinese lightning detection sensor in geostationary orbit. This study presents the lightning characteristics observed by the FY-4A LMI in its first year, and then observations from the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) onboard the International Space Station (ISS) are used to validate the performance of the LMI sensor. LMI lightning events are defined by the pixel's luminosity exceeding the threshold radiance. During the first year of operation, LMI events revealed a reasonable geographical distribution. The diurnal cycles of LMI event/background/threshold radiance are in general agreement with the later afternoon peaks in previous findings. However, the LMI events that occurred around the LIS flash time and in the LMI observation field-of-view show a slightly delayed peak at around 1900 LST. This peak can be shifted closer to LIS's results after removing LMI events with event radiance lower than 300 mu J sr(-1) m(-2) mu m(-1), suggesting that a larger threshold radiance value is needed to qualify some of these LMI events. Finally, LIS lightning groups were matched with LMI lightning events using different temporal and spatial collocation criteria. The detection efficiency is defined by the fraction of LIS groups detected by LMI to assess LMI's performance. The LMI detection efficiency relative to LIS was found to be regionally dependent and lower in the daytime than at nighttime. These results contribute to applications of LMI lightning observations in storm research and provide suggestions for further algorithm improvement.

TI  - Impact of Meteorological Factors on Thermokarst Lake Changes in the Beilu River Basin, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China (2000-2016)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in weather conditions have a significant impact on thermokarst lakes, such as the sub-lake permafrost thawing caused by global warming. Based on the analysis of Landsat sensor images by ENVI TM 5.3 software, the present study quantitatively determined the area of the thermokarst lakes and the area of the single selected thermokarst lake in the Beilu River Basin from 2000 to 2016. In an effort to explore the reason for changes in the area of thermokarst lakes, this work used Pearson correlation to analyze the relationship between the area of thermokarst lakes and precipitation, wind speed, average temperature, and relative humidity as obtained from the weather station Wudaoliang. Furthermore, this study used multiple linear regression to comprehensively study the correlation between the meteorological factors and changes in the thermokarst lake area. In this case, the total lake-area changes and the single-area changes exhibited unique patterns. The results showed that the total lake area and the single selected lake area increased year by year. Furthermore, the effects of the four meteorological factors defined above on the total area of typical thermokarst lakes are different from the effects of these factors on the single selected thermokarst lake. While the total area of specific thermokarst lakes exhibited a time lag in their response to the four factors, the surface area of the selected thermokarst lake responded to these factors on time. The dominant meteorological factor contributing to total lake area variations of typical thermokarst lakes is the increasing annual average temperature. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the total area and the annual average temperature is 0.717, suggesting a statistically significant correlation between the two factors. For the selected thermokarst lake, the surface area is related to annual average temperature and wind speed. As a result, wind speed and average temperature could infer the variation law on the thermokarst lake due to the linear fitting equation between area and significant meteorological factors.

TI  - Impact assessment of a satellite data infrastructure Application to the management of forest clear-cuts in France
T2  - REVUE D ECONOMIE REGIONALE ET URBAINE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes an exploratory framework for assessing the economic impacts of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) based on the example of the GEOSUD SDI and clear-cutting maps related to forest management. The valuation is based on an online survey covering the Ministry of Agriculture services in charge of controlling clear-cutting operations carried out by forest operators. The approach developed crosses two complementary points of view. On the one hand, it is based on an economic logic to estimate certain effects at the scale of the value chain related to the production and the use of satellite imagery and derived thematic products and services. The main effects measured concerned the cost and productivity savings, the added value created at the scale of the value chain linked to these clear-cut maps. In total, it appears that for one euro invested in the operation of the SDI (excluding initial investment), the added value created directly and indirectly amounts to a maximum of (SIC)63 and the transaction costs avoided to (SIC)24. On the other hand, it is also part of a management logic to understand the effects of IDGS linked to innovation processes at the level of a community of practice. SDI enable coordination and pooling gains to be made in order to co-construct knowledge leading to new products and/or processes. The study showed that nearly two-thirds of the structures surveyed observed qualitative effects in terms of networking and a strengthening of skills linked to the training and support services offered by the GEOSUD platform. Qualitative effects on the properties of forest policies and more generally on territorial development dynamics are also considered.

T2  - PLOS BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 1.6 million Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests were administered daily in the United States at the peak of the epidemic, with a significant focus on individual treatment. Here, we show that objective-driven, strategic sampling designs and analyses can maximize information gain at the population level, which is necessary to increase situational awareness and predict, prepare for, and respond to a pandemic, while also continuing to inform individual treatment. By focusing on specific objectives such as individual treatment or disease prediction and control (e.g., via the collection of population-level statistics to inform lockdown measures or vaccine rollout) and drawing from the literature on capture-recapture methods to deal with nonrandom sampling and testing errors, we illustrate how public health objectives can be achieved even with limited test availability when testing programs are designed a priori to meet those objectives.

TI  - Evaluation of Orbital Drift Effect on Proba-V Surface Reflectances Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal consistency of space-borne observations is an essential requirement for studying inter-annual changes and trends of satellite-derived biophysical products. The Proba-V mission, launched in 2013, was designed to ensure the continuity of the SPOT-VEGETATION long-term data record of global daily observations for land applications. The suitability of Proba-V to provide a temporally consistent data record is, however, potentially jeopardized by the orbital drift effect, which is known to induce spurious trends in time series. The aim of this paper is therefore to evaluate, for the first time, the orbital drift effect on Proba-V surface reflectance time series at 1 km resolution. In order to reliably identify such an effect, a two-fold approach is adopted. A simulation study is first defined to predict the temporal anomalies induced by the drifting illumination conditions. The numerical simulations are used as a benchmark to predict the impact of the drift for a range of sun-viewing angles. Real observations are then analyzed over a large set of land sites, globally spread and spanning a wide range of surface and environmental conditions. The surface anisotropy is characterized using the Ross-Thick Li-Sparse Reciprocal (RTLSR) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model. Both the simulation and the analysis of real observations consistently show that the orbital drift induces distinct and opposite trends in the two sides of the sensor across-track swath. Particularly, a positive drift is estimated in backward and a negative one in the forward scattering direction. When observations from all angular conditions are retained, these opposite trends largely compensate, with no remaining statistically significant drifts in time series of surface reflectances or Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). As such, the Proba-V archive at 1 km resolution can be reliably used for inter-annual vegetation studies.

TI  - Inter-Comparison of Methods for Chlorophyll-a Retrieval: Sentinel-2 Time-Series Analysis in Italian Lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Different methods are available for retrieving chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in inland waters from optical imagery, but there is still a need for an inter-comparison among the products. Such analysis can provide insights into the method selection, integration of products, and algorithm development. This work aims at inter-comparison and consistency analyses among the Chl-a products derived from publicly available methods consisting of Case-2 Regional/Coast Colour (C2RCC), Water Color Simulator (WASI), and OC3 (3-band Ocean Color algorithm). C2RCC and WASI are physics-based processors enabling the retrieval of not only Chl-a but also total suspended matter (TSM) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), whereas OC3 is a broadly used semi-empirical approach for Chl-a estimation. To pursue the inter-comparison analysis, we demonstrate the application of Sentinel-2 imagery in the context of multitemporal retrieval of constituents in some Italian lakes. The analysis is performed for different bio-optical conditions including subalpine lakes in Northern Italy (Garda, Idro, and Ledro) and a turbid lake in Central Italy (Lake Trasimeno). The Chl-a retrievals are assessed versus in situ matchups that indicate the better performance of WASI. Moreover, relative consistency analyses are performed among the products (Chl-a, TSM, and CDOM) derived from different methods. In the subalpine lakes, the results indicate a high consistency between C2RCC and WASI when aCDOM(440) < 0.5 m(-1), whereas the retrieval of constituents, particularly Chl-a, is problematic based on C2RCC for high-CDOM cases. In the turbid Lake Trasimeno, the extreme neural network of C2RCC provided more consistent products with WASI than the normal network. OC3 overestimates the Chl-a concentration. The flexibility of WASI in the parametrization of inversion allows for the adaptation of the method for different optical conditions. The implementation of WASI requires more experience, and processing is time demanding for large lakes. This study elaborates on the pros and cons of each method, providing guidelines and criteria on their use.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Analysis of Urban Landscape Change in the City of Bucharest, Romania
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper investigates the urban landscape changes for the last 50 years in Bucharest, the capital city of Romania. Bucharest shows a complex structural transformation driven by the socialist urban policy, followed by an intensive real-estate market development. Our analysis is based on a diachronic set of high-resolution satellite imagery: declassified CORONA KH-4B from 1968, SPOT-1 from 1989, and multisensor stacked layers from Sentinel-1 SAR together with Sentinel-2MSI from 2018. Three different datasets of land cover/use are extracted for the reference years. Each dataset reveals its own urban structure pattern. The first one illustrates a radiography of the city in the second part of the 20th century, where rural patterns meet the modern ones, while the second one reveals the frame of a city in a full process of transformation with multiple constructions sites, based on the socialist model. The third one presents an image of a cosmopolitan city during an expansion process, with a high degree of landscape heterogeneity. All the datasets are included in a built-up change analysis in order to map and assess the spatial transformations of the city pattern over 5 decades. In order to quantify and map the changes, the Built-up Change Index (BCI) is introduced. The results highlight a particular situation linked to the policy development visions for each decade, with major changes of about 50% for different built-up classes. The GIS analysis illustrates two major landscape transformations: from the old semirural structures with houses surrounded by gardens from 1968, to a compact pattern with large districts of blocks of flats in 1989, and a contemporary city defined by an uncontrolled urban sprawl process in 2018.

TI  - A Process-Based Model Integrating Remote Sensing Data for Evaluating Ecosystem Services
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems provide multiple services interacting in complex ways. However, most ecosystem services (ESs) models (e.g., InVEST and ARIES) ignored the relationships among ESs. Process-based models can overcome this limitation, and the integration of ecological models with remote sensing data could greatly facilitate the investigation of the complex ecological processes. Therefore, based on the Carbon and Exchange between Vegetation, Soil, and Atmosphere (CEVSA) models, we developed a process-based ES model (CEVSA-ES) integrating remotely sensed leaf area index to evaluate four important ESs (i.e., productivity provision, carbon sequestration, water retention, and soil retention) at annual timescale in China. Compared to the traditional terrestrial biosphere models, the main innovation of CEVSA-ES model was the consideration of soil erosion processes and its impact on carbon cycling. The new version also improved the carbon-water cycle algorithms. Then, the Sobol and DEMC methods that integrated the CEVSA-ES model with nine flux sites comprising 39 site-years were used to identify and optimize parameters. Finally, the model using the optimized parameters was validated at 26 field sites comprising 135 site-years. Simulation results showed good fits with ecosystem processes, explaining 95%, 92%, 76%, and 65% interannual variabilities of gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, net ecosystem productivity, and evapotranspiration, respectively. The CEVSA-ES model performed well for productivity provision and carbon sequestration, which explained 96% and 81% of the spatial-temporal variations of the observed annual productivity provision and carbon sequestration, respectively. The model also captured the interannual trends of water retention and soil erosion for most sites or basins.

TI  - New snow metrics for a warming world
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow is Earth's most climatically sensitive land cover type. Traditional snow metrics may not be able to adequately capture the changing nature of snow cover. For example, April 1 snow water equivalent (SWE) has been an effective index for streamflow forecasting, but it cannot express the effects of midwinter melt events, now expected in warming snow climates, nor can we assume that station-based measurements will be representative of snow conditions in future decades. Remote sensing and climate model data provide capacity for a suite of multi-use snow metrics from local to global scales. Such indicators need to be simple enough to "tell the story" of snowpack changes over space and time, but not overly simplistic or overly complicated in their interpretation. We describe a suite of spatially explicit, multi-temporal snow metrics based on global satellite data from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and downscaled climate model output for the U.S. We describe and provide examples for Snow Cover Frequency (SCF), Snow Disappearance Date (SDD), At-Risk Snow (ARS), and Frequency of a Warm Winter (FWW). Using these retrospective and prospective snow metrics, we assess the current and future snow-related conditions in three hydroclimatically different U.S. watersheds: the Truckee, Colorado Headwaters, and Upper Connecticut. In the two western U.S. watersheds, SCF and SDD show greater sensitivity to annual differences in snow cover compared with data from the ground-based Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) network. The eastern U.S. watershed does not have a ground-based network of data, so these MODIS-derived metrics provide uniquely valuable snow information. The ARS and FWW metrics show that the Truckee Watershed is highly vulnerable to conversion from snowfall to rainfall (ARS) and midwinter melt events (FWW) throughout the seasonal snow zone. In comparison, the Colorado Headwaters and Upper Connecticut Watersheds are colder and much less vulnerable through mid- and late-century.

TI  - Sensitivity analysis of the satellite infrared hyper-spectral atmospheric sounder GIIRS on FY-4A
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensitivity is an important radiation performance index of remote sensor. In this paper,the sensitivity concept of infrared hyper-spectral sounding is extended from the sounder noise sensitivity to the atmospheric parameter sensitivity and the surface temperature error sensitivity for the on-orbit application of sounder. The corresponding sensitivity calculation models and their relations are introduced. These models are applied to the sensitivity evaluation of the first infrared hyper-spectral atmospheric sounder on geostationary meteorological satellite FY-4A GIIRS. With the sounder test data and the atmospheric historical statistical data,we obtained the quantitative variation characteristics of the atmospheric parameter sensitivities (atmospheric temperature, water vapor, ozone, CO2, CH4 and N2O), the surface temperature error sensitivity and the sounder noise sensitivity with the channel. The physical mechanisms of these characteristics are analyzed. The results show that,as a whole,the sensitivities of atmospheric temperature,water vapor and ozone are much higher than that of the sounder noise and surface temperature error,while the sensitivities of CO2, CH4 and N2O are submerged by the sounder noise sensitivity and the surface temperature error sensitivity. The study lays a foundation for the signal-to-noise ratio evaluation of infrared hyper-spectral atmospheric parameters detection,and is helpful for the optimization of infra. red hyper-spectral atmospheric sounding channels.

TI  - Changes in Coastal Agricultural Land Use in Response to Climate Change: An Assessment Using Satellite Remote Sensing and Household Survey Data in Tien Hai District, Thai Binh Province, Vietnam
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the agricultural land-use changes in the coastal areas of Tien Hai district, Thai Binh province, in 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020, using Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 data. We used the object-oriented classification method with the maximum likelihood algorithm to classify six types of land uses. The series of land-use maps we produced had an overall accuracy of more than 80%. We then conducted a spatial analysis of the 5-year land-use change using ArcGIS software. In addition, we surveyed 150 farm households using a structured questionnaire regarding the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and land uses, as well as farmers' adaptation and responses. The results showed that from 2005 to 2020, cropland decreased, while aquaculture land and forest land increased. We observed that the most remarkable decreases were in the area of rice (485.58 ha), the area of perennial crops (109.7 ha), and the area of non-agricultural land (747.35 ha). The area of land used for aquaculture and forest increased by 566.88 ha and 772.60 ha, respectively. We found that the manifestations of climate change, such as extreme weather events, saltwater intrusion, drought, and floods, have had a profound impact on agricultural production and land uses in the district, especially for annual crops and aquaculture. The results provide useful information for state authorities to design land-management strategies and solutions that are economic and effective in adapting to climate change.

TI  - Investigation of climate, land cover and lake level pattern changes and interactions using remotely sensed data and wavelet analysis
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Urmia -a hypersaline lake in northwest of Iran-has lost perceptible amount of its waterbody since mid '90s. Reasons behind this catastrophe could be categorized as climatic factors and anthropogenic activities. To investigate pattern changes and interactions of the components involved in this dramatic water loss, precipita-tion (P), discharge (Q), temperature (T), sea surface temperature (SST) alongside satellite images of vegetation cover (VC) from 1990 to 2019 were used for pattern and interaction analysis, including trend and seasonality detection. Owing to the fact that this endorheic lake in extremis is located between East Azerbaijan (EA) and West Azerbaijan (WA) provinces, additionally it was aimed to juxtapose changes in the aforementioned variables assembled from these two provinces. To monitor changes in VC, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series for two pilot sub-watersheds from EA and WA provinces were calculated using remotely sensed images. Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test revealed that amongst all variables, Q in both sub-watersheds has been intensely decreased in 99% confidence level. Moreover, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) of Q exhibited drastic de-escalations in terms of annual and semi-annual periodicities. VC and urbanization in both sub-watersheds showed significant increasing trends, whereas VC in WA province showed a higher level of trend. Fairly stable P in terms of trend and periodicity alongside intensification in VC concluded intense exploitations of Q which is the other main inflow into this lake. Wavelet coherence transformation (WTC) between all considered variables and Lake Urmia's WL revealed the great impacts of Q, T and SST variables on the lake's WL fluctuations and seasonality. The impact of T and SST on WL fluctuations did not illustrate perceptible changes throughout the study period (i.e., before and after lake's desiccation). The impact of Q on the lake's WL, however, has moved to larger frequency bands with increased phase-lags, and thus, it could be concluded that the intense reduction of the lake's WL is in proportion to intense reduction of rivers discharge to this lake; leaving transparent traces of anthropogenic impacts on Lake Urmia's tragedy.

TI  - The Evolution of the Literary Embodiment of One Plot: "The Alley of Forgotten Faces" and <i>Time and Place</i> by Yuri Trifonov
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the plot Yuri Trifonov twice repeated in his creative practice: the story "The Alley of Forgotten Faces" (1970) and the chapter "The Lane Behind the Belorussky Station" from the novel Time and Place (1980). The aim of the work is to identify transformation points in the ways of transmitting a single story related to the memory of the time when the characters worked at an aircraft factory during the war. The factory, being a "place of memory" (P. Nora), provokes two types of recollection: a collision with the lane in the story becomes an incentive for the hero's accidentally recall, while the novel reveals the main character's conscious memory attitude as a reflexive strategy. Different attitudes dictate two ways of representing a single plot, expressed at different levels of text poetics. Thus, the image of the main character of the story is based on the opposition I-then/Inow, where I-then disappears from memory "forever". This changes fundamentally in the novel: Trifonov, renouncing the opposition, introduces two narrators, whose constant change creates a polyphonic three-dimensional image that refutes the idea of the totality of disappearance. These attitudes are reflected in the reconstruction of the temporal context: if the character of the story focuses on then-perception, passing the memory about people and events through the prism of the "present" by detecting the value dominant of individual time, which is closed in time, the chapter of the novel focuses on the representation of historical time. The phrase "we made radiators for airplanes" repeated many times in the chapter becomes a marker of historical time, revealing its ontological nature, its "equalizing" and unifying function in relation to individual life manifestations. Depiction of the central episodes of both texts are subordinated to the attitudes of random and conscious recollection. When placed in the context of the final novel, events in the story, depicted through variations of extinction (the motif of the disappearance of illusions, the motif of premonition of disappearance), discover the expansion of artistic potential: two narrative voices break down the total space of the novel into the reality of a certain moment of life and the reality of a general context of Time and Place, which allows the characters to see different situations both in the moment of direct residence, and from a distance (the position of "tense being-out" according to Bakhtin). This contributes to adding the level of "doubled" reflection implicitly expressed by the hero himself and explicitly formulated by the second narrator to the event-factual level; the former level indicates the author's worldview that fundamentally changed over the decade, which was expressed through the changed poetics of his later texts.

TI  - Estimation of winter soil cover by vegetation before spring-sown crops for mainland France using multispectral satellite imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter soil cover by vegetation is associated with multiple benefits. In this study, winter soil cover rate before spring-sown crops was estimated for mainland France from multispectral imagery. For 67% and 84% of the area under spring-sown crops for years 2018 and 2019, soil cover during the previous winter was estimated through the computation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), using Sentinel-2 multispectral images. At country scale, winter soil cover rate before spring-sown crops was estimated between 37% and 48% for 2018 and between 31% and 43% for 2019, depending on the NDVI threshold for a soil to be considered covered by at least 50% of vegetation. Spatial patterns were relatively similar between the two years studied, highlighting strong heterogeneities between French departments. Cropping systems may explain some of these heterogeneities, as it has been shown that there is a large variability in the soil cover rate between spring-sown crops, but also depending on the previous crop. Winter soil cover rate was higher for crops associated with livestock production, such as maize silage (between 59% and 74% of plots covered before this crop). It was also shown that winter soil cover could be ensured by other means than cover crops: temporary grasslands were the previous crop with the highest soil cover, probably due to late ploughing. For these reasons, mixed systems combining livestock and crop productions may be a solution to increase winter soil cover before spring-sown crops.

T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article aims to study of one of the relevant issues in the field of the contemporary post-history, namely, the virtualization of society. The latter is considered as a result of the postmodern worldview and the simulative nature of knowledge about social reality. The subject of the research involves the forms of virtual culture reflected in today's Ukrainian society. Given the specifics of the identified issue, the author of the article draws attention to the specific methodological apparatus of the research. The narrative background of the research, as well as the principle of historicism, allows one to consider virtualization as a process of modelling social reality using computer technologies, whose image or prototype is a historical reality. It is important to note that the virtualization of society has a historical conditionality, which makes it possible to consider it as the next stage of the historical and cultural development of society. At the same time, the modern type of culture is a virtual culture, whose main creator and consumer is human. Its main feature is a pronounced innovative character. The main forms of Ukrainian society virtualization are focused on virtual communities and virtual states. Importantly, each of them mimics the social reality, whose prototype is an image characterizing the cultural identity of society.

TI  - Effect of Using Multi-Year Land Use Land Cover and Monthly LAI Inputs on the Calibration of a Distributed Hydrologic Model
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective management of water resources entails the understanding of spatiotemporal changes in hydrologic fluxes with variation in land use, especially with a growing trend of urbanization, agricultural lands and non-stationarity of climate. This study explores the use of satellite-based Land Use Land Cover (LULC) data while simultaneously correcting potential evapotranspiration (PET) input with Leaf Area Index (LAI) to increase the performance of a physically distributed hydrologic model. The mesoscale hydrologic model (mHM) was selected for this purpose due to its unique features. Since LAI input informs the model about vegetation dynamics, we incorporated the LAI based PET correction option together with multi-year LULC data. The Globcover land cover data was selected for the single land cover cases, and hybrid of CORINE (coordination of information on the environment) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) land cover datasets were chosen for the cases with multiple land cover datasets. These two datasets complement each other since MODIS has no separate forest class but more frequent (yearly) observations than CORINE. Calibration period spans from 1990 to 2006 and corresponding NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency) values varies between 0.23 and 0.42, while the validation period spans from 2007 to 2010 and corresponding NSE values are between 0.13 and 0.39. The results revealed that the best performance is obtained when multiple land cover datasets are provided to the model and LAI data is used to correct PET, instead of default aspect-based PET correction in mHM. This study suggests that to minimize errors due to parameter uncertainties in physically distributed hydrologic models, adequate information can be supplied to the model with care taken to avoid over-parameterizing the model.

T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The incidence of detected ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) continues to increase and now accounts for 14% of all breast cancer, and 20%-25% of screen-detected cases. Treatment trends of DCIS are important in order to inform the ongoing debate about possible overdiagnosis and overtreatment, but have not been investigated for over a decade in Australia and New Zealand. Against this background, we aimed to describe the temporal trends in management of DCIS in Australian and New Zealander women.Methods Using the BreastSurgANZ Quality Audit (BQA) database, we conducted a descriptive study of the trends of management of DCIS in Australia and New Zealand from 2007 to 2016. We assessed the frequency of surgical treatments, adjuvant therapies, and axillary surgery conducted in women with pure DCIS.Results There were 17 883 cases of pure DCIS in 2007-2016 in Australia and New Zealand recorded in the BQA database. The treatment patterns were consistent with no changes over time. The most common surgical treatment was breast-conserving surgery (66%), followed by mastectomy (37%), and 36% of women with DCIS received sentinel node biopsy (SNB).Conclusion The clinical management of women diagnosed with DCIS in Australia and New Zealand, appears stable over time. A substantial proportion of women with DCIS receive SNB and this aspect of surgical care warrants further exploration to determine whether it represents appropriate care. These results, alongside the outcomes of the ongoing clinical trials on the management of DCIS, will help inform if any changes to best practice treatment are required.

Uncontrolled urban development, especially along the lake shore, puts environmental pressure on Lake Victoria and its local ecosystem. This study sought to monitor the extent and impacts of urban development (as measured by population growth and built-up land use/land cover) in the Lake Victoria basin, Kenya, between 1978 and 2018. Remote sensing and GIS-based land use/land cover classification was conducted to extract change in built-up areas from Landsat 3, 4, 5 and 8 satellite imagery obtained for the month of January at intervals of ten years. Change in population distribution and density was analysed based on decadal census data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics between 1979 and 2019. A statistical regression model was then estimated to relate population growth to built-up area expansion. Results indicate that the basin's built-up area has expanded by 97% between 1978 and 2018 while the population increased by 140% between 1979 and 2019. Urban development was attributed to the rapidly increasing population in the area as seen in a positive statistical correlation (R-2=0.5744) between increase in built-up area and population growth. The resulting environmental pressure on the local ecosystem has been documented mainly in terms of degradation of lake water quality, eutrophication and aquatic biodiversity loss. The study recommends the enactment and implementation of appropriate eco-sensitive local legislation and policies for sustainable urban and rural land use planning in the area. This should aim to control and regulate urban expansion especially in the immediate shoreline areas of the lake and associated riparian zones.

TI  - Nitrogen Dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) Level Changes during the Control of COVID-19 Pandemic in Thailand
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The first case of COVID-19 infection was confirmed in Thailand on January 13, 2020; since then, work from home and lockdown measures have slowed the spread of COVID-19. A more stringent, curfew regulation was imposed on April 3, 2020. Under these measures, the activities of businesses, transportation, and industrial sectors were reduced or temporally closed. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the changes in the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) level in the whole of Thailand and specifically in the Bangkok metropolitan area. The concentrations of tropospheric NO2 were extracted from the Sentinel-5P satellite data. The Google Earth Engine JavaScript API was used to retrieve and calculate the NO2 data. Python was also used to extract NO2 values from the output raster data. The results showed that the level of NO2 increased by 47.4% during the COVID-19 pandemic in the whole of Thailand; NO2 declined by 4.8% in the Bangkok metropolitan area, but there was no significant difference compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic. NO2 level during curfew regulation declined by 9.5% in the whole of Thailand and decreased by 20.1% in the Bangkok metropolitan area. After comparing the same time duration in 2019 and 2020 on a monthly basis, the results revealed that NO2 level in 2020 declined by 9.1% and 9.8% for the whole of Thailand and Bangkok metropolitan area, respectively. Our findings support that these measures can temporarily reduce NO2 levels. Once all sectors resume as normal, we concern that the NO2 emissions will rebound. Hence, the challenge after the COVID-19 pandemic is how to improve and protect our environment while restoring the economy, which is a crucial issue that policymakers should fully address.

TI  - Leveraging the NEON Airborne Observation Platform for socio-environmental systems research
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - During the 21st century, human-environment interactions will increasingly expose both systems to risks, but also yield opportunities for improvement as we gain insight into these complex, coupled systems. Human-environment interactions operate over multiple spatial and temporal scales, requiring large data volumes of multi-resolution information for analysis. Climate change, land-use change, urbanization, and wildfires, for example, can affect regions differently depending on ecological and socioeconomic structures. The relative scarcity of data on both humans and natural systems at the relevant extent can be prohibitive when pursuing inquiries into these complex relationships. We explore the value of multitemporal, high-density, and high-resolution LiDAR, imaging spectroscopy, and digital camera data from the National Ecological Observatory Network's Airborne Observation Platform (NEON AOP) for Socio-Environmental Systems (SES) research. In addition to providing an overview of NEON AOP datasets and outlining specific applications for addressing SES questions, we highlight current challenges and provide recommendations for the SES research community to improve and expand its use of this platform for SES research. The coordinated, nationwide AOP remote sensing data, collected annually over the next 30 yr, offer exciting opportunities for cross-site analyses and comparison, upscaling metrics derived from LiDAR and hyperspectral datasets across larger spatial extents, and addressing questions across diverse scales. Integrating AOP data with other SES datasets will allow researchers to investigate complex systems and provide urgently needed policy recommendations for socio-environmental challenges. We urge the SES research community to further explore questions and theories in social and economic disciplines that might leverage NEON AOP data.

TI  - Mapping Potential Areas for Conservation Under Forest Carbon Credit Eligibility in a Natural Protected Area in Northern Mexico
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Emerging carbon markets are posing new challenges for stakeholders. In order to operationalize the selection of feasible areas to promote above-ground carbon capture and quantify its potential as claimed in the norm NMX-AA-173-SCFI-2015, a methodology may be proposed. Above-ground tree biomass geospatial estimates at the pixel level, neighboring land cover, and legal information were combined in order to obtain the potential for above-ground carbon capture. Forest above-ground tree carbon capture estimates were conducted under the assumption that forest cover in bare soil land will be recovered to the most conserved neighboring vegetation type. This approach may be used in other situations around the world where potential carbon estimates are required to design forest carbon capture projects considering native vegetation type.

TI  - Rice Paddy Soil Seedbanks Composition in a Mediterranean Wetland and the Influence of Winter Flooding
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil seedbanks are defined in composition and quantity by many environmental factors inherent to a specific area, and they can be an indicator of the potential problems of weeds in crops. In Valencia (Spain), rice is cultivated with continuous flooding during the growing season, and after harvesting, many of the paddy fields are flooded again during the winter. This study investigates the paddy fields' soil seedbank composition in this Mediterranean paddy area and the effect of winter flooding on the soil seedbank. Multispectral images from the Sentinel-2 satellite were used to characterise the water level of paddies in winter. Satellite images facilitated the characterisation of winter flooding in fields. Soil samples from sixty-nine points distributed over 15,000 ha of paddies were used to determine the composition of the seedbank plots. The data were spatially represented by geographic information systems. The species that contributed most to the paddy seedbank were Cyperus difformis L., an important rice weed in the Mediterranean area, and other rice weeds such as Echinochloa sp. and Leptochloa fusca subspecies. Other species with a great contribution to the seedbank are species that develop in paddy fields that produce a large quantity of small seeds, such as Lemna sp., Polypogon monspeliensis (L.) Desf., and Nasturtium officinale R. Br. These species interfere little or do not interfere with the rice crop. The study revealed that in general, flooding reduced seedbank density with differences between species. Furthermore, the influence of winter flooding on the different plant species obtained as well as their distribution maps are a further step in this protected area from the point of view of weed management in rice crop, as well as in the management of this Mediterranean wetland.

TI  - Flood modeling of Sungai Pinang Watershed under the impact of urbanization
T2  - TROPICAL CYCLONE RESEARCH AND REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has been a worldwide development trend, which regulates river courses, impervious surfaces and drainage systems. Urbanization causes hydrological effects, including increased runoff volumes, peak discharges and flow concentrations. This manuscript selects the Malaysian Sungai Pinang watershed as a case study to illustrate these land use, channel and flooding changes of Asian coastal cities. The Landsat satellite remote sensing images were first used to estimate the land use/land cover changes of the Sungai Pinang watershed by using SVM algorithm, and the results shows the urbanization was very rapid in the past decades, with the urbanization rate reached 46.41% in 2018 based on the build area rate. River channel characteristics also changed significantly, from natural river to concrete channel. Some flood resilience measures for coastal cities experiencing urbanization are also proposed for development and flood mitigation. Moreover, a flood forecasting model of the Sungai Pinang watershed is established herein. The simulation results of the Liuxihe model constructed in this study conforms to hydrological regularities and can provide a technical reference for flood control and disaster reduction. However, it is necessary to pay attention to the uncertainty of the forecast results. (C) 2021 The Shanghai Typhoon Institute of China Meteorological Administration.

TI  - Jitter Detection and Image Restoration Based on Continue Dynamic Shooting Model for High-Resolution TDI CCD Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although time delay integration charge-coupled devices (TDI CCDs) have been widely used in high-resolution spaceborne optical cameras, they are sensitive to satellite jitter: the images obtained by them are affected by both distortion and blur. Therefore, according to the multistage integral imaging characteristics of TDI CCDs, this article not only proposes a continue dynamic shooting model (CDSM) to reflect the real push-broom mode of the satellite but also presents a method containing jitter detection and image restoration based on it. In the presented method, the CDSM subdivides the TDI CCD integration intervals. The subdivision number of CDSM is determined by the proposed integral transformation function (ITF). Then, it feeds back into the ITF and also contributes to the point spread function (PSF) estimation. Among the abovementioned, ITF defines the relationship between the parallax images and the jitter curve, and aims to improve the jitter detection performance. Finally, an adaptive image restoration based on context is conducted, which combines time, space, and spectrum information. Besides the simulated images, multispectral images of GaoFen-1 02 satellite were also adopted to validate the performance of the presented method. Experimental results indicate that the accuracy of the jitter detection is increased, and the geometric and radiometric qualities of restored images are also improved.

TI  - Assessment of land-use and land-cover changes in Pangari watershed area (MS), India, based on the remote sensing and GIS techniques
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we focus on the assessment of land-use and land-cover change detection mapping to the effective planning and management policies of environment, land-use policy and hydrological system in the study area. In this study the soil and water conservation project has been applied during the five years and after five years what changes have been found in the land-use and land-cover classes and vegetation. In this view, this land-use and land-cover mapping is a more important role to decide the policy for watershed planning and management project in the semiarid region. In an emerging countries, fast industrialization and urbanization impose a significant threat to the natural atmosphere. The remote sensing and GIS techniques are crucial roles in the study of land-use and land-cover mapping during the years of 2007, 2014, and 2017. The main objective of this is to prepare the land-use and NDVI maps in the years of 2008, 2014 and 2017; these maps have prepared from satellite data using the supervised classification method. A normalized difference vegetation index map (NDVI) was done by using Landsat 8 and LISS-III satellite data. NDVI values play a major role in monitoring the vegetation and variation in land-use and land-cover classes. In these maps, four types of land are divided into four classes as agriculture, built-up, wasteland, and water body. The results of study show that agriculture land of 18.71% (158.24 Ha), built-up land of 0.62% (5.31 Ha), wasteland of 40.33% (341.02 Ha), and water body land of 17.39% (147 Ha) are increased. Land-use and land-cover maps and NDVI values show that agriculture land of 22.97% (194.29 Ha), 5.46% (14.59 Ha), and 0.08% (0.22 Ha) decreases during the years of 2008, 2014, and 2017. The results directly indicate that the supervised classification method has been the accurate identified feature in the land-use map classes. This classification method has been given the better accuracy (95%) from spatiotemporal satellite data. The accuracy was also tally with ground-truth and Google earth information. These results can be a very useful for the land-use policy, watershed planning, and management with natural resources, animals, and ecological systems.

TI  - Overview and Prospective of Satellite Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Concentration Retrieval Algorithms Suitable for Coastal Turbid Sea Waters
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN EARTH SCIENCE SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has been accelerating in coastal waters recently; therefore, the importance of coastal environmental monitoring is also increasing. Chlorophyll-a concentration, an important marine variable, in the surface layer of the global ocean has been retrieved for decades through various ocean color satellites and utilized in various research fields. However, the commonly used chlorophyll-a concentration algorithm is only suitable for application in clear water and cannot be applied to turbid waters because significant errors are caused by differences in their distinct components and optical properties. In addition, designing a standard algorithm for coastal waters is difficult because of differences in various optical characteristics depending on the coastal area. To overcome this problem, various algorithms have been developed and used considering the components and the variations in the optical properties of coastal waters with high turbidity. Chlorophyll-a concentration retrieval algorithms can be categorized into empirical algorithms, semi-analytic algorithms, and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms mainly use the blue-green band ratio based on the reflective spectrum of sea water as the basic form. In constrast, algorithms developed for turbid water utilizes the green-red band ratio, the red-near-infrared band ratio, and the inherent optical properties to compensate for the effect of dissolved organisms and suspended sediments in coastal area. Reliable retrieval of satellite chlorophyll-a concentration from turbid waters is essential for monitoring the coastal environment and understanding changes in the marine ecosystem. Therefore, this study summarizes the pre-existing algorithms that have been utilized for monitoring turbid Case 2 water and presents the problems associated with the mornitoring and study of seas around the Korean Peninsula. We also summarize the prospective for future ocean color satellites, which can yield more accurate and diverse results regarding the ecological environment with the development of multi-spectral and hyperspectral sensors.

M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, United States Geological Survey (USGS) distributed Landsat 8 Collection 2 Level 2 Science Product (L2SP). This paper aims to derive land surface temperature from L2SP and to validate it. Validation is made by comparing the land surface temperature with the one calculated from Landsat 8 Collection 1 Level 1 Terrain Precision (L1TP) and the one from Automated Synoptic Observing System (ASOS). L2SP is calculated from Landsat 8 Collection 2 Level 1 data and it provides land surface temperature to users without processing surface reflectance data. Landsat 8 data from 2018 to 2020 is collected and ground sensor data from eight sites of ASOS are used to evaluate L2SP land surface temperature data. To compare ground sensor data with remotely sensed data, 3x3 grid area data near ASOS station is used. As a result of analysis with ASOS data, L2SP and L1TP land surface temperature shows Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.971 and 0.964, respectively. RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of two results with ASOS data is 4.029 degrees C, 5.247 degrees C respectively. This result suggests that L2SP data is more adequate to acquire land surface temperature than L1TP. If seasonal difference and geometric features such as slope are considered, the result would improve.

TI  - Interpretation of Aerosol Effects on Precipitation Susceptibility in Warm Clouds Inferred from Satellite Measurements and Model Evaluation over Northeast Asia
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation susceptibility (S-o), a parameter of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interaction over Northeast Asia during the Korea-United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) campaign, was analyzed using the Clouds from Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer Extended (CLAVR-x) satellite data and WRF-Chem model. As Northeast Asia is one of the areas with the highest aerosol emissions, this study is expected to explore more elaborate aerosol-cloud linkages. Our results obtained from satellite data showed that S-o increased as the atmospheric condition became stable and humid, and the shift of the water conversion process to precipitation occurred in the LWP range of 300-500 g m(-2). The S-o exhibited a maximum value of 0.61 at an LWP of 350 g m(-2), where the dominance of the cloud water conversion process changed from autoconversion to accretion. In the aerosol-cloud relation, the susceptibility of the cloud-drop effective radius showed a negative response to the cloud droplet number concentration (N-d) regardless of the environmental conditions, whereas the LWP versus N-d relationship was highly dependent on the meteorological conditions. The WRF-Chem produced higher S-o values than those of the satellite data by factors of 2.4-3.3; the simulated results exhibited differences in shape, range, and amplitude. The overestimation of S-o was mainly due to the high precipitation rate under low-LWP conditions as compared to the satellite observations. This result is associated with the initiation and intensity of precipitation, considering both autoconversion and accretion. Our modeling results were verified during KORUS-AQ, which implied that the aerosol-cloud relationship might be elucidated by improved microphysical parameterization schemes based on more detailed measurements such as aircraft-based observations.

TI  - A Geostatistical Approach to Map Near-Surface Soil Moisture Through Hyperspatial Resolution Thermal Inertia
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal inertia has been applied to map soil water content exploiting remote sensing data in the short and long wave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Over the last years, optical and thermal cameras were sufficiently miniaturized to be loaded onboard of unmanned aerial systems (UASs), which provide unprecedented potentials to derive hyperspatial resolution thermal inertia for soil water content mapping. In this study, we apply a simplification of thermal inertia, the apparent thermal inertia (ATI), over pixels where underlying thermal inertia hypotheses are fulfilled (unshaded bare soil). Then, a kriging algorithm is used to spatialize the ATI to get a soil water content map. The proposed method was applied to an experimental area of the Alento River catchment, in southern Italy. Daytime radiometric optical multispectral and day and nighttime radiometric thermal images were acquired via a UAS, while in situ soil water content was measured through the thermo-gravimetric and time domain reflectometry (TDR) methods. The determination coefficient between ATI and soil water content measured over unshaded bare soil was 0.67 for the gravimetric method and 0.73 for the TDR. After interpolation, the correlation slightly decreased due to the introduction of measurements on vegetated or shadowed positions ( r2 = 0.59 for gravimetric method; r2 = 0.65 for TDR). The proposed method shows promising results to map the soil water content even over vegetated or shadowed areas by exploiting hyperspatial resolution data and geostatistical analysis.

TI  - Urban Forests as Main Regulator of the Evaporative Cooling Effect in Cities
T2  - AGU ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Higher temperatures in urban areas expose a large fraction of the human population to potentially dangerous heat stress. Green spaces are promoted worldwide as local and city-scale cooling strategies but the amount, type, and functioning of vegetation in cities lack quantification and their interaction with urban climate in different settings remains a matter of debate. Here we use state-of-the-art remote sensing data from 145 city clusters to disentangle the drivers of surface urban heat islands (SUHI) intensity and quantify urban-rural differences in vegetation cover, species composition, and evaporative cooling. We show that nighttime SUHIs are affected mostly by abiotic factors, while daytime SUHIs are highly correlated with vegetation characteristics and the wetness of the background climate. Magnitude and seasonality of daytime SUHIs are controlled by urban-rural differences in plant transpiration and leaf area, which explain the dependence of SUHIs on wetness conditions. Leaf area differences are caused primarily by changes in vegetation type and a loss of in-city forested areas, highlighting the importance of maintaining "natural reserves" as a sustainable heat mitigation policy.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation of aerosols in ENSO events over Western India using satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial variation of the average aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 555 nm obtained from the multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer satellite sensor over India for 2000-2016 illustrates that Western India shows a relatively lower aerosol loading compared with the northern and eastern parts of India. Among the seasonal variations of the average AOD, spring shows a higher aerosol loading, particularly over Jodhpur (0.518) and Kota (0.518), and fall shows the least. In spring, these variations may be due to the meteorological conditions that bring a large quantity of dust and other types of aerosols in the atmosphere of Western India. Temporal variation of AOD indicates that in 2006, abrupt change in AOD (<0.2) was observed over all the cities. Among all cities, Mumbai shows strong increasing trends during 2000-2016 with a Sen's slope of 0.009. Overall, the study concludes that compared with La Nina years, El Nino years correspond to a higher aerosol loading over Western India, primarily over Surat (0.357), Mumbai (0.349) and Jodhpur (0.334).

TI  - Eddy Induced Trapping and Homogenization of Freshwater in the Bay of Bengal
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater from rivers influences Indian summer monsoon rainfall and tropical cyclones by stratifying the upper layer and warming the subsurface ocean in the Bay of Bengal (BoB). Here, we use in situ and satellite data with reanalysis to showcase how river water experiences a significant increase in salinity on sub-seasonal timescales. This involves the trapping and homogenization of freshwater by a cyclonic eddy in the Bay. Using a specific example from 2015, river water is shown to enter an eddy along its attracting manifolds within a period of 2 weeks. This leads to the formation of a highly stratified subsurface layer within the eddy. When freshest, the eddy has the largest sea-level anomaly, spins fastest, and supports strong lateral gradients in salinity. Subsequently, observations reveal a progressive increase in salinity inside the eddy within a month. In particular, salty water spirals in, and freshwater is pulled out across the eddy boundary. Lagrangian experiments elucidate this process, whereby horizontal chaotic mixing provides a mechanism for the rapid increase in surface salinity. A salinity budget also suggests that horizontal advection explains much of the change in mixed layer salinity. Further, the adjustment of this freshwater eddy triggers submesoscale dynamics which appear to be an integral part of the process of salinity homogenization. This pathway is distinct from vertical diffusive mixing and is likely to be important for the evolution of salinity in the BoB.Plain Language Summary Freshwater from monsoonal rivers flowing into the Bay of Bengal (BoB) is of paramount importance in regional oceanography and atmosphere-ocean interactions. The river water forms a thin layer (of the order of meters) on the Bay's surface, and capturing its evolution has proved to be a challenging problem. Recent fine-scale ocean modeling efforts indicate that vertical diffusion plays an important role in increasing river water salinity in the Bay on seasonal timescales. Here, using observations, satellite data, and reanalysis, we show that river water can experience a significant increase in salinity within weeks. In particular, freshwater gets trapped in an eddy off the west coast of north Bay, resulting in large near-surface lateral and vertical salinity gradients. Over the next month, both in situ and reanalysis data show that these gradients relax along with the progressive increase in salinity by horizontal mixing of fresh and salty water across the eddy boundary. Apart from the identification of this pathway which highlights eddy-freshwater interactions, high-resolution satellite data suggests that dynamical processes at scales of. (1-10 km) need to be understood and resolved to properly capture the observed homogenization of low salinity river water in the BoB.

TI  - Evaluation of Semantic Segmentation Methods for Land Use with Spectral Imaging Using Sentinel-2 and PNOA Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use classification using aerial imagery can be complex. Characteristics such as ground sampling distance, resolution, number of bands and the information these bands convey are the keys to its accuracy. Random Forest is the most widely used approach but better and more modern alternatives do exist. In this paper, state-of-the-art methods are evaluated, consisting of semantic segmentation networks such as UNet and DeepLabV3+. In addition, two datasets based on aircraft and satellite imagery are generated as a new state of the art to test land use classification. These datasets, called UOPNOA and UOS2, are publicly available. In this work, the performance of these networks and the two datasets generated are evaluated. This paper demonstrates that ground sampling distance is the most important factor in obtaining good semantic segmentation results, but a suitable number of bands can be as important. This proves that both aircraft and satellite imagery can produce good results, although for different reasons. Finally, cost performance for an inference prototype is evaluated, comparing various Microsoft Azure architectures. The evaluation concludes that using a GPU is unnecessarily costly for deployment. A GPU need only be used for training.

TI  - Records of the andean bear <i>Tremarctos ornatus</i> (Carnivora: Ursidae) in the Southern Subandino of Bolivia
T2  - Acta Zoologica Lilloana
M3  - Article
AB  - In this note, five documented records are reported between the years 2014 and 2020 about the presence of the Andean bear (Tremarctos ornatus) in the South Sub-Andean of Bolivia within the limits of the Andean Bear Conservation Units (UCO) Carrasco-Amboro-Tariquia proposed for Bolivia. The records are supported by photographs presented in this note and short videos uploaded in the BioData virtual catalog (https://biodata.bio/). In addition, different records of the presence of the Andean bear were documented through interviews with local residents, and studying of records of observations of Shell Bolivia workers during hydrocarbon prospecting studies carried out in the departments of Tarija and Chuquisaca between 2013 and 2018. We also recorded oral reports about the Guarani culture referring to the perception, attitude and worldview patterns of this community in relation to the Andean bear. Our updated records strengthen the information on the distribution of the species in southern Bolivia.

TI  - PSMD-Net: A Novel Pan-Sharpening Method Based on a Multiscale Dense Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pan sharpening is used to fuse a low-resolution multispectral (MS) image and a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image to obtain a high-resolution MS image. This article proposes PSMD-Net, an end-to-end pan-sharpening method based on a multi-scale dense network. A shallow feature extraction layer (SFEL) extracts the shallow features from the original images, and these are used as an input to a global dense feature fusion (GDFF) network to learn the global features for image reconstruction. A multiscale dense block (MDB) is designed to fully extract the spatial and spectral information from the shallow features in the GDFF network. In the proposed network, multiple MDBs are stacked to extract rich, multi-scale dense hierarchical features, and a global dense connection (GDC) is designed to allow direct connections from the state of the current MDB to all subsequent MDBs to extract more advanced features. The extracted hierarchical features are sent to the global feature fusion layer (GFFL) to adaptively learn the global features for image reconstruction. Finally, global residual learning (GRL) is adopted to force the network to pay more attention to the changing part of the image. We perform experiments on simulated and real data from WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 satellites. Visual and quantitative assessment results demonstrate that PSMD-Net yields higher-resolution fusion images than the state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Anaphylactic Reaction Rates to Blue Dyes Used for Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: The primary objective of this study was to quantify the risk of anaphylaxis to blue dyes used in SLNB for cancer. Secondary outcomes included the identification of factors that may influence this risk. Summary of Background Data: Blue dyes are widely used to help identify sentinel lymph nodes in oncological surgery. The rate of severe allergic reactions to blue dyes remains a controversial topic, with the true incidence and influencing factors uncertain. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to identify all studies which report on the incidence of severe adverse reactions and anaphylaxis to blue dyes (patent blue, isosulfan blue, methylene blue, and indigo carmine), when used for SLNB. Collected data included cancer and dye type, volume, and method of injection. Incidence was estimated using the arcsine method of statistical analysis. Results: One hundred nine studies documenting 94 episodes of anaphylaxis in a total of 61,951 SLNB procedures, resulting in a weighed anaphylaxis rate of 0.061%. SLNB for breast cancer carries an anaphylaxis risk of 0.083%, with the risk markedly lower in melanoma surgery (0.0043%). Low dye volume (<2 mL) and intradermal injection are both associated with lower rates of anaphylaxis (0.031% and 0.0068%). Isosulfan blue seems to be the most anaphylactogenic amongst blue dyes with a rate of 0.16%. There were no reported cases of death in this cohort. Conclusion: Anaphylaxis to blue dyes in SLNB is rare. Methylene blue, patent blue, lower dye volumes, and intradermal administration are all associated with a lower incidence of anaphylaxis.

TI  - Validation of Sentinel-3 SLSTR Land Surface Temperature Retrieved by the Operational Product and Comparison with Explicitly Emissivity-Dependent Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential climate variable (ECV) for monitoring the Earth climate system. To ensure accurate retrieval from satellite data, it is important to validate satellite derived LSTs and ensure that they are within the required accuracy and precision thresholds. An emissivity-dependent split-window algorithm with viewing angle dependence and two dual-angle algorithms are proposed for the Sentinel-3 SLSTR sensor. Furthermore, these algorithms are validated together with the Sentinel-3 SLSTR operational LST product as well as several emissivity-dependent split-window algorithms with in-situ data from a rice paddy site. The LST retrieval algorithms were validated over three different land covers: flooded soil, bare soil, and full vegetation cover. Ground measurements were performed with a wide band thermal infrared radiometer at a permanent station. The coefficients of the proposed split-window algorithm were estimated using the Cloudless Land Atmosphere Radiosounding (CLAR) database: for the three surface types an overall systematic uncertainty (median) of -0.4 K and a precision (robust standard deviation) 1.1 K were obtained. For the Sentinel-3A SLSTR operational LST product, a systematic uncertainty of 1.3 K and a precision of 1.3 K were obtained. A first evaluation of the Sentinel-3B SLSTR operational LST product was also performed: systematic uncertainty was 1.5 K and precision 1.2 K. The results obtained over the three land covers found at the rice paddy site show that the emissivity-dependent split-window algorithms, i.e., the ones proposed here as well as previously proposed algorithms without angular dependence, provide more accurate and precise LSTs than the current version of the operational SLSTR product.

TI  - Crop Nitrogen Retrieval Methods for Simulated Sentinel-2 Data Using In-Field Spectrometer Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen (N) is one of the key nutrients supplied in agricultural production worldwide. Over-fertilization can have negative influences on the field and the regional level (e.g., agro-ecosystems). Remote sensing of the plant N of field crops presents a valuable tool for the monitoring of N flows in agro-ecosystems. Available data for validation of satellite-based remote sensing of N is scarce. Therefore, in this study, field spectrometer measurements were used to simulate data of the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites developed for vegetation monitoring by the ESA. The prediction performance of normalized ratio indices (NRIs), random forest regression (RFR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR) for plant-N-related traits was assessed on a diverse real-world dataset including multiple crops, field sites and years. The plant N traits included the mass-based N measure, N concentration in the biomass (N-conc), and an area-based N measure approximating the plant N uptake (NUP). Spectral indices such as normalized ratio indices (NRIs) performed well, but the RFR and GPR methods outperformed the NRIs. Key spectral bands for each trait were identified using the RFR variable importance measure and the Gaussian processes regression band analysis tool (GPR-BAT), highlighting the importance of the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region for estimation of plant N-conc-and to a lesser extent the NUP. The red edge (RE) region was also important. The GPR-BAT showed that five bands were sufficient for plant N trait and leaf area index (LAI) estimation and that a surplus of bands effectively reduced prediction performance. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) was performed on all traits simultaneously, showing the dominance of the LAI in the mixed remote sensing signal. To delineate the plant-N-related traits from this signal, regional and/or national data collection campaigns producing large crop spectral libraries (CSL) are needed. An improved database will likely enable the mapping of N at the agro-ecosystem level or for use in precision farming by farmers in the future.

TI  - TRUST AS AN IRRATIONAL COMPONENT OF RATIONALITY: ROLE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF PERSONAL IDENTITY
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of substantiating trust as a component of modern scientific rationality is caused by the need to search for regulatory mechanisms, which are relevant to the specifics of modern social development. Scientific rationality, which was constructed within the limits of Kant's "pure mind", requires adaptation to new conditions. "Rhizome", "risk", "nomadism", " fluidity" and other similar characteristics of the modern society, first of all, have a negative resonance for cultural and personal identities and cause their crisis. The article raises the question of searching for mechanisms of social development that would be able to see not only rationally verified social practices, but also irrational moments of social dynamics. The article proposes to consider trust as one of such mechanisms. The category "trust-based rational type of scientific rationality" is introduced. To explore the role of trust in maintaining personal identity is a current interest. The modern deconstructivist processes in philosophy initiate a rethinking of the style of mind that provoked the past (classical) socio-ontological constructions through scientific instrumental rationality. The constructions were aimed at a stationary social space, were created according to strict logic, and captured the universal, absolute, rationally verified and reduced schemes of life. The metaphysics of such an ontology was set by the imperious arche-limit that conditioned the identification of social artifacts and the identification of the person as well. Today, this view is concretized by sociocultural processes and is actualized in the categories "crisis", "chaos", "risk", "fluidity", " rhizome", etc. The ontological instability of the modern world raises the question: Is it possible to trust the world if it is in constant motion and change? The problem of trust is raised, despite the fact that trust is not manifested in a rational way. Trust is a key characteristic of personal identity since it allows a person to live in an unstable and constantly changing world. Trust complements the rational mind with a sensory component, which allows rational thoughts to be empathetic to the world and to understand it. The authors of this article refer to the recognized world authorities P. Ricoeur and J. Habermas to validate this idea. These philosophers write about the complementarity of the rational and sensual levels of attitude to the world, and about attention to the rational and irrational structures of consciousness (understanding, intuition, trust, etc.). However, is it correct to conclude that a rational style of mind admits irrational constructions and motives? It is necessary to argue the complementarity of rational-logical and irrational-understanding structures of mind. The category "emotional intelligence" is emerging in modern philosophical literature. Rational and irrational structures of mind are the referent of this category. Trust is an irrational structure and it complements the universal constructions of mind through the ability of understanding. Mind, which complementarily includes the structures of trust and understanding, is a new type of rationality. It is "trust-based rational type of scientific rationality" or " understanding rationality". The final part of the article discusses education, which is directly related to the formation of personal identity. Modern education does not pay attention to the formation of trust as the key structure of the worldview.On the contrary, education pays great attention to the formation of such personal competencies as entrepreneurship and the ability to commerce. All this requires careful consideration and humanitarian expert examination.

TI  - Patterned Bruises From Abusive Squeezing
T2  - PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bruising is the most common presentation of child physical abuse. Many patterns of abusive bruising result in positive or negative imprints of the implement used (eg, fingertips in "grab mark" contusions or hand in slap injury). However, bruising may also form along the lines of greatest anatomical stress (eg, gluteal cleft or pinna bruising). Bruising due to abusive squeezing also forms along lines of greatest anatomical stress, resulting in a negative imprint of the flexural folds of the hand. Four cases of children with this unique pattern of bruising due to abusive squeezing are presented. Recognition of these bruises as inflicted represents an opportunity for early identification and intervention in cases of child physical abuse.

TI  - Using Multi-Resolution Satellite Data to Quantify Land Dynamics: Applications of PlanetScope Imagery for Cropland and Tree-Cover Loss Area Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Planet constellation of satellites represents a significant advance in the availability of high cadence, high spatial resolution imagery. When coupled with a targeted sampling strategy, these advances enhance land-cover and land-use monitoring capabilities. Here we present example regional and national-scale area-estimation methods as a demonstration of the integrated and efficient use of mapping and sampling using public medium-resolution (Landsat) and commercial high resolution (PlanetScope) imagery. Our proposed method is agnostic to the geographic region and type of land cover and change, which is demonstrated by applying the method across two very different geographies and thematic classes. Wheat extent is estimated in Punjab, Pakistan, for the 2018/2019 growing season, and tree-cover loss area is estimated over Peru for 2017 and 2018. We used a time series of PlanetScope imagery to classify a sample of 5 x 5 km blocks for each region and produce area estimates of 55,947 km(2) (+/- 9.0%) of wheat in Punjab and 5398 km(2) (+/- 9.1%) of tree-cover loss in Peru. We also demonstrate the use of regression estimation utilizing population information from Landsat-based maps to reduce standard errors of the sample-based estimates. Resulting regression estimates have SEs of 3.6% and 5.1% for Pakistan and Peru, respectively. The combination of daily global coverage and high spatial resolution of Planet imagery improves our ability to monitor crop phenology and capture ephemeral tree-cover loss and degradation dynamics, while Landsat-based maps provide wall-to-wall information to target the sample and increase precision of the estimates through the use of regression estimation.

TI  - Linking Past and Present Land-Use Histories in Southern Amazonas, Peru
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzes remotely sensed data sources to evaluate land-use history within the Peruvian department of Amazonas and demonstrates the utility of comparing present and past land-use patterns using continuous datasets, as a complement to the often dispersed and discrete data produced by archaeological and paleoecological field studies. We characterize the distribution of ancient (ca. AD 1-1550) terracing based on data drawn from high-resolution satellite imagery and compare it to patterns of deforestation between 2001 and 2019, based on time-series Landsat data. We find that the patterns reflected in these two datasets are statistically different, indicating a distinctive shift in land-use, which we link to the history of Inka and Spanish colonialism and Indigenous depopulation in the 15th through 17th centuries AD as well as the growth of road infrastructure and economic change in the recent past. While there is a statistically significant relationship between areas of ancient terracing and modern-day patterns of deforestation, this relationship ultimately explains little (6%) of the total pattern of modern forest loss, indicating that ancient land-use patterns do not seem to be structuring modern-day trajectories of land-use. Together, these results shed light on the long-term history of land-use in Amazonas and their enduring legacies in the present.

TI  - ASSESSING HABITAT SUITABILITY FOR THE COMMON POCHARD, Aythya ferina (ANSERIFORMES, ANATIDAE) AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES IN OREL' RIVER VALLEY, UKRAINE
T2  - Ekologia (Bratislava)
M3  - Article
AB  - The habitat suitability for the Common Pochard, a duck species in decline, was studied in the middle reaches of the Orel' River, Central Ukraine, in 2015-2017. The ducks were counted on their breeding grounds with the use of the ground survey technique. The positions of individual birds were estimated by GPS and plotted on the Google Earth map. The Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) was applied to assess the habitat suitability. Sentinel-2 image was used to extract 13 ecogeographical variables and to get two measures of the ecological niche (marginality and specialization). The ENFA procedure was applied twice at landscape and sub-landscape levels to describe the habitat selection across sequential spatial scales. Both the axes of marginality and specialization of the ecological niche of the species proved to be significantly different from the random alternatives. At landscape level, the distribution may be predicted with the use of Aerosol/Coastal, Vegetation and Hydrothermal Composite indices (marginality) and Modified Normalized Difference Water (MNDW) Index along with several vegetation indices (specialization). At sub-landscape level, MNDW played a crucial role. The importance of MNDW is mediated by the preference for the wetlands with the stretches of open water which are used by the ducks to initiate flight safely and to optimize diving possibilities. The ENFA is a reliable tool for the assessment of the habitat suitability and for setting the conservation priorities for the Common Pochard.

TI  - RUSSIAN ARTHOUSE FILMS OF THE EARLY XXI CENTURY: FEATURES OF ARTISTIC STYLE
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemporary Russian theater and cinema are approving a new aesthetic paradigm that implements such principles of postmodernism as deconstruction, relativism, a mixture of various types, genres, and stylistic devices. The purpose of this article is to identify the most characteristic stylistic features of Russian arthouse films of the 21st century. The author's task was to show that this style is not something radically new, as some art critics and cultural experts try to present.Using the methods of hermeneutic, art history and comparative analysis, the author identifies the methods and techniques of creating a special art space that are characteristic of modern Russian arthouse. These are combining real and conditional, concrete and symbolic, psychology and parable, recognition of everyday realities and explicit functionality of the characters.Based on the idea expressed by a number of scientists that there is much in common between the state of the modern world (that is, what is now called postmodernism) and the public consciousness of the Middle Ages, the author of the article puts forward a hypothesis about the similarity of the stylistic techniques of the Russian arthouse with the aesthetics of the Middle Ages. First of all, arthouse films bring closer to the literature and art of the Middle Ages such a characteristic as hybridism, i.e. combining different styles in one work, in particular, combining a realistic image with a parable form and symbols and an artistic interpretation of space as a background that weakly interacts with characters. First of all, Russian arthouse films brings closer to the literature and art of the Middle Ages such a characteristic as hybridism, i.e. combining different styles in one work, using, along with a realistic depiction of the parable form and symbols and artistic interpretation of space as a background that weakly interacts with characters.One of the reasons for the emergence of a new aesthetic interpretation of art space in modern Russian literature and cinema was the radical changes that took place in Russia in the 1990s. The disappearance from the world map of a huge country called the USSR and the loss of familiar landmarks and stereotypes could not but affect the worldview of artists, writers and filmmakers trying to artistically comprehend what is happening.The conclusion that follows from the analysis is that many principles of the aesthetics of postmodernism were reflected in the style of the arthouse films of 21st century, with the exception of such traits inherent in the best postmodern examples as humor, irony, game element and non-linearity of narration. The coexistence of real and clearly conditional art space in such films contributes to the fact that the cinematic texture contradicts conditional situations and characters, causing the viewer to feel art inorganic.Analyzing the perception of art films by experts and the audience, the author concludes that the assessments of art critics and viewers are largely diverging for the same reason: viewers mostly perceive author films as works of a realistic style but can not find in them psychological characteristics of the heroes and the motivation of their actions, i. e. the traits inherent in realism; experts evaluate these films based on the presence of the elements of symbolism and metaphorism and metaphysical and universal image of reality.

TI  - Some Peculiarities of Arable Soil Organic Matter Detection Using Optical Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing only provides information about the very thin surface layer of soil. Rainfall splash alters soil surface properties and its spectral reflectance. We analyzed the impact of rainfall on the success of soil organic matter (SOM) content (% by mass) detection and mapping based on optical remote sensing data. The subject of the study was the arable soils of a test field located in the Tula region (Russia), their spectral reflectance, and Sentinel-2 data. Our research demonstrated that rainfall negatively affects the accuracy of SOM predictions based on Sentinel-2 data. Depending on the average precipitation per day, the R(2)cv of models varied from 0.67 to 0.72, RMSEcv from 0.64 to 1.1% and RPIQ from 1.4 to 2.3. The incorporation of information on the soil surface state in the model resulted in an increase in accuracy of SOM content detection based on Sentinel-2 data: the R(2)cv of the models increased up to 0.78 to 0.84, the RMSEcv decreased to 0.61 to 0.71%, and the RPIQ increased to 2.1 to 2.4. Further studies are necessary to identify how the SOM content and composition of the soil surface change under the influence of rainfall for other soils, and to determine the relationships between rainfall-induced SOM changes and soil surface spectral reflectance.

TI  - Distance Learning and Globalization Processes in the Postmodern World
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes distance learning and educational processes, such as education, pedagogical technologies, methods and upbringing in the context of globalization trends in the postmodern world. The new technologies, which have prompted and eventually led to globalization processes, indicate the need to master these new technologies since teaching today requires one to apply one's professional results efficiently. The trend of education is globalization, which seems inevitable under a dramatically changing educational reality. Global education is defined as one of the areas in the development of current pedagogical theory and practice. It aims to prepare learners for professional activities in a changing and increasingly interdependent world. Indeed, globalization lies in implementing and using internet technologies in education. Recognizing the multiplicity of meanings and views, the postmodern society is entering a state of crisis. It is because the Covid-19 pandemic and, consequently, new living conditions associated with it, require a new worldview. In this regard, education reforms are becoming a priority, given that the 21st century is the age of information and nanotechnologies. Information technology is a prerequisite for teacher training today. At the same time, informatization of education is impossible without creating, using and developing informational and educational environments, which in turn should enable the realization of an intellectually developed individual embodying the necessary professional qualities.

TI  - Fundamental Statistical Concepts in Clinical Trials and Diagnostic Testing
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores basic statistical concepts of clinical trial design and diagnostic testing, or how one starts with a question, formulates it into a hypothesis on which a clinical trial is then built, and integrates it with statistics and probability, such as determining the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (type I error) and the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false (type II error). There are a variety of tests for different types of data, and the appropriate test must be chosen for which the sample data meet the assumptions. Correcting type I error in the presence of multiple testing is needed to control the error's inflation. Within diagnostic testing, identifying false-positive and false-negative results is critical to understanding the performance of a test. These are used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of a test along with the test's negative predictive value and positive predictive value. These quantities, specifically sensitivity and specificity, are used to determine the accuracy of a diagnostic test using receiver-operating-characteristic curves. These concepts are briefly introduced to provide a basic understanding of clinical trial design and analysis, with references to allow the reader to explore various concepts at a more detailed level if desired.

TI  - Sensitivity and areal differentiation of vegetation responses to hydrothermal dynamics on the northern and southern slopes of the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi province
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinling Mountains, located at the junction of warm temperate and subtropical zones, serve as the boundary between north and south China. Exploring the sensitivity of the response of vegetation there to hydrothermal dynamics elucidates the dynamics and mechanisms of the main vegetation types in the context of changes in temperature and moisture. Importance should be attached to changes in vegetation in different climate zones. To reveal the sensitivity and areal differentiation of vegetation responses to hydrothermal dynamics, the spatio-temporal variation characteristics of the normalized vegetation index (NDVI) and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) on the northern and southern slopes of the Qinling Mountains from 2000 to 2018 are explored using the meteorological data of 32 meteorological stations and the MODIS NDVI datasets. The results show that: 1) The overall vegetation coverage of the Qinling Mountains improved significantly from 2000 to 2018. The NDVI rise rate and area ratio on the southern slope were higher than those on the northern slope, and the vegetation on the southern slope improved more than that on the northern slope. The Qinling Mountains showed an insignificant humidification trend. The humidification rate and humidification area of the northern slope were greater than those on the southern slope. 2) Vegetation on the northern slope of the Qinling Mountains was more sensitive to hydrothermal dynamics than that on the southern slope. Vegetation was most sensitive to hydrothermal dynamics from March to June on the northern slope, and from March to May (spring) on the southern slope. The vegetation on the northern and southern slopes was mainly affected by hydrothermal dynamics on a scale of 3-7 months, responding weakly to responding weakly to hydrothermal dynamics on a scale of 11-12 months. 3) Some 90.34% of NDVI and SPEI was positively correlated in the Qinling Mountains. Spring humidification in most parts of the study area promoted the growth of vegetation all the year round. The sensitivity of vegetation responses to hydrothermal dynamics with increasing altitude increased first and then decreased. Elevations of 800 to 1200 m were the most sensitive range for vegetation response to hydrothermal dynamics. The sensitivity of the vegetation response at elevations of 1200-3000 m decreased with increasing altitude. As regards to vegetation type, grass was most sensitive to hydrothermal dynamics on both the northern and southern slopes of the Qinling Mountains; but most other vegetation types on the northern slope were more sensitive to hydrothermal dynamics than those on the southern slope.

TI  - Total Ozone Columns from the Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI) Using the DOAS Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global measurements of total ozone are necessary to evaluate ozone hole recovery above Antarctica. The Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI) onboard GaoFen 5, launched in May 2018, was developed to measure and monitor the global total ozone column (TOC) and distributions of other trace gases. In this study, some of the first global TOC results of the EMI using the differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) method and validation with ground-based TOC measurements and data derived from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) observations are presented. Results show that monthly average EMI TOC data had a similar spatial distribution and a high correlation coefficient (R >= 0.99) with both OMI and TROPOMI TOC. Comparisons with ground-based measurements from the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre also revealed strong correlations (R > 0.9). Continuous zenith sky measurements from zenith scattered light differential optical absorption spectroscopy instruments in Antarctica were also used for validation (R = 0.9). The EMI-derived observations were able to account for the rapid change in TOC associated with the sudden stratospheric warming event in October 2019; monthly average TOC in October 2019 was 45% higher compared to October 2018. These results indicate that EMI TOC derived using the DOAS method is reliable and has the potential to be used for global TOC monitoring.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The lower portion of Ganga River is wide and braided with numerous fluvial islands and sandbars. This paper investigated the spatial and temporal variation of fluvial islands and sandbars in the Ganga River from Bhagalpur to Farakka during 1955-2019. Historical topographic maps and Landsat data from 1955 to 2019 have been used for the study. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) followed by the classification of the image has been used to produce water and non-water area. Accuracy assessment of the classified image has been done through an error matrix and attained overall accuracy, ranging from 86 to 94%. Islands and sandbars have experienced considerable variation in due course of time. Island at the confluence of the Kosi river has expanded manifold. Areas of attached sandbars have increased with an increase in meander in the river. A sandbar has developed in front of Farakka Barrage, which has now transformed into a vegetated island. This paper also analyzed the correlation between morphological parameters (width, braiding index (BI), sinuosity index (SI)) and hydrological factors (annual maximum discharge and annual high-water level) influencing variation in the area of islands. The result shows a strong correlation between the width of the river and the BI, whereas the weak correlation between the SI and BI. The area of islands and sandbars was inversely related to annual maximum discharge as well as maximum water level. Although variation in the island is a function of several natural factors, the construction of Farakka barrage plays an increasingly important role behind this variation.

TI  - A Robust Methodology for Assessing the Effectiveness of Site Adaptation Techniques for Calibration of Solar Radiation Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
M3  - Article
AB  - The abundant spatial and temporal availability of solar energy has been fueling many researches and have been the reason for the proliferation of solar energy applications in the past decades. Many of these applications involve heavy investments and thus require highly accurate and reliable long-term average solar data for efficient deployment of solar energy technologies. Since ground stations are costly, site-specific, scarce and cannot provide long-term solar data, satellite-derived data is the next best alternative. However, satellite models are often unable to capture the complex local climatological variations of a given site. As such, short-term high precision solar ground measurements are used to train the satellite model so as to improve the accuracy of long-term solar estimates. There exist several site adaptation techniques to perform this task. However, to the knowledge of the researchers, no comparative study has been conducted to establish which site adaptation technique is the most effective. In this study, a robust methodology has been proposed to compare the effectiveness of four site adaptation techniques for monthly and yearly data sets using novel key performance indicators. Ground measurements from 12 stations in the tropical islands of Mauritius, Rodrigues, and Agalega were used to adapt satellite data obtained from HelioClim-3 database using different techniques. Three new nonlinear site adaptation techniques have been proposed: adjustment technique (Technique 2), compensation technique (Technique 3), and relationship technique (Technique 4). The first part of the study showed that 67-100% of the data sets were best approximated with sixth-order polynomials for the three nonlinear techniques. The second part revealed that Technique 1 (linear method) and Technique 2 were most appropriate for maximum and average data sets, respectively. The results were such that Technique 2 and Technique 1 provided best approximations for77.9-83.3% and 40.7-58.3% of average and maximum data sets, respectively. In the third part of the study, only Technique 2 provided remarkable improvements for all statistical metrics with respect to the original monthly data sets (113-118 data sets). The analysis reported 57.6-89.9%, 49.8-68.0%, 67.4-87.3%, 53.8-63.1%, 45.0-64.0%, 7.7-9.6% and 2.7-4.7% mean improvements for mean bias error (MBE), mean absolute bias error (MABE), mean percentage error (MPE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe (NSE), and coefficient of determination (COD), respectively, for Technique 2. Similar results were observed for yearly average data sets while the appreciation was shared among all four techniques for yearly maximum data sets, with Technique 1 having a slight advantage.

TI  - Exploring the Use of Vegetation Indices for Validating Crop Transpiration Fluxes Computed with the MOHID-Land Model. Application to Vineyard
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The success of an irrigation decision support system (DSS) much depends on the reliability of the information provided to farmers. Remote sensing data can expectably help validate that information at the field scale. In this study, the MOHID-Land model, the core engine of the IrrigaSys DSS, was used to simulate the soil water balance in an irrigated vineyard located in southern Portugal during three growing seasons. Modeled actual basal crop coefficients and transpiration rates were then compared with the corresponding estimates derived from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed from Sentinel-2 imagery. On one hand, the hydrological model was able to successfully estimate the soil water balance during the monitored seasons, exposing the need for improved irrigation schedules to minimize percolation losses. On the other hand, remote sensing products found correspondence with model outputs despite the conceptual differences between both approaches. With the necessary precautions, those products can be used to complement the information provided to farmers for irrigation of vine crop, further contributing to the regular validation of model estimates in the absence of field datasets.

In a few cases, both the models have shown overestimation of the volume scattering from the highly-dense building instead of even-bounce scattering. Deorientation process helped to reduce the overestimation of the volume scattering but didn't accomplish completely. This paper addressed this issue by the insertion of PolInSAR coherence in the existing decomposition models. The coherence varies with features based on its temporal and volume decorrelation, hence forest results in low coherence compared to permanent scatterers helps to characterize the man-made and natural features. This paper experimented with a proposed model on the RADARSAT-2 dataset of Uttarakhand as a case study. Volume scattering was modified and extracted based on different coherence parameter assumptions. Finally, the first optimal band with spatial and temporal baseline coefficients as 1 and 0.6 thresholds gave a more reliable outcome. For qualitative analysis, the scattering mechanisms of features from different models were compared. In the proposed model, closely spaced buildings exhibited 54% and 26% dominance in the even and odd-bounce scattering while volume scattering reduced to 18%. Whereas Freeman-Durden and Yamaguchi's model has shown dominance in volume nearly 98% and 50% while even and odd-bounce scattering were less than 1% in Freeman-Durden model and 39% and 11% in Yamaguchi's model. Forest shows dominance in the volume scattering higher than 60% in the Freeman-Durden and the proposed models whereas 35% in the Yamaguchi's model. Therefore, the proposed methodology successfully fused polarimetry and interferometry to overcome the ambiguity in scattering.

TI  - Identifying High-Risk Tumors within AJCC Stage IB-III Melanomas Using a Seven-Marker Immunohistochemical Signature
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Immunotherapy and targeted therapy are widely accepted for stage III and IV melanoma patients. Clinical investigation of adjuvant therapy in stage II melanoma has already started. Therefore, methods for relapse prediction in lower stage melanoma patients apart from sentinel node biopsies are much needed to guide (neo)adjuvant therapies. Gene scores such as the "DecisionDx-Melanoma" and the "MelaGenix" score can help assist therapy decisions. However, a seven-marker immunohistochemical signature could add valuable feasibility to the biomarker toolbox. Background: We aim to validate a seven-marker immunohistochemical signature, consisting of Bax, Bcl-X, PTEN, COX-2, (loss of) ss-Catenin, (loss of) MTAP and (presence of) CD20, in an independent patient cohort and test clinical feasibility. Methods: We performed staining of the mentioned antibodies in tissue of 88 primary melanomas and calculated a risk score for each patient. Data were correlated with clinical parameters and outcome (recurrence-free, distant metastasis-free and melanoma-specific survival). Results: The seven-marker signature was able to identify high-risk patients within stages IB-III melanoma patients that have a significantly higher risk of disease recurrence, metastasis, and death. In particular, the high sensitivity of relapse prediction (>94%) in sentinel negative patients (stages IB-IIC) was striking (negative predictive value of 100% for melanoma-specific survival and distant metastasis-free survival, and 97.5% for relapse-free survival). For stage III patients (positive nodal status), the negative predictive value was 100% with the seven-marker signature. Conclusions: The seven-marker signature can help to further select high-risk patients in stages IIB-C but also in earlier stages IB-IIA and be a useful tool for therapy decisions in the adjuvant and future neo-adjuvant settings. Stage III patients with measurable lymph node disease classified as high-risk with the seven-marker signature are potential candidates for neoadjuvant immunotherapy.

M3  - Article
AB  - Tuhonotanga relates to one's physical and spiritual embeddedness to the surrounding world, including to culture, to kin, and to Father Sky and Mother Earth. Kanien'keha:ka researcher Alicia Ibarra-Lemay from the community of Kahnawa:ke, interviewed Maori psychotherapist Donny Riki from Aotearoa, to explore her practice of healing in relation to her own connections to the Ngapuhi and the Ngati Paoa. As granddaughter to Ina Tepapatahi, Patara Te Tuhi, Puahaere, and Haora Tipakoinaki, Donny carries the responsibility for healing in the sense of helping her people find their way back home after 186 years of colonial violence and rule in her homeland of Aotearoa. This chapter discusses the way she works with tangata whaiora (Maori people, seekers of wellness) and how the process of healing is conceptualized in her Maori worldview.

TI  - Multi-Hazard WebGIS Platform for Coastal Regions
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured ApplicationMonitoring and forecasting platforms such as MOSAIC can support real-time response and alert, contribute to emergency assessment and risk management for multiple hazards in coastal regions, performing new safety comprehensive approaches for these areas.The combined action of waves, surges and tides can cause flooding, erosion and dune and structure overtopping in many coastal regions. Addressing emergency and risk management in these areas require a combination of targeted campaigns and real-time data that measure all phenomena at stake and can be used to develop comprehensive monitoring platforms. These monitoring platforms can support the development of prediction tools that address all hazards in an integrated way. Herein, we present a methodology focused on multi-hazard coastal alert and risk, and its implementation in a tailored WebGIS platform. The MOSAIC platform offers a one-stop-shop capacity to access in-situ and remote sensing data, and hydrodynamic and morphodynamic predictions, supported by numerical models: SCHISM and XBeach. Information is structured on a local observatory scale, with regional forcings available for the correct interpretation of local hazards effects. This implementation can be further applied and extended to other coastal zones. The MOSAIC platform also provides access to a detailed database of past hazardous events, organized along several risk indicators, for the western coast of Portugal. The combination of features in the platform provides a unique repository of hazard information to support end-users for both emergency and long term risk planning actions.

TI  - ARCHETYPES OF BORIS SMOTROV'S WORKS AS A TOOL FOR NATIONAL SELF-IDENTIFICATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL IN CHAOTIC CONDITIONS OF THE TURN OF THE 21ST CENTURY
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper discusses the works of Moscow artist Boris Smotrov. It provides a general analysis of the tools of his artistic style as well as the data on his main vectors of creative activity (painting, poster graphics). The author dwells on the master's works in the field of painting, focusing on national themes. The study distinguishes dominant blocks of the painter's works (landscape, thematic painting), detects specifics of the artistic language, methods of working with color, his mastering of the line and pays attention to the interaction of painting and graphics in B. Smotrov's creative baggage and his decorative manner. The paper addressees the main archetypes in the works of Smotrov (firebird, cow, apple, spring, Maslenitsa, etc.). The propensity for allegorical language is explained by his competent use of artistic means of creating a poster. The author analyzes individual features of B. Smotrov's work with color, the creation of his own author's "patchwork" style as a result of creative transformation and rethinking of the influence of various styles and manners of individual artists, from A. Matisse to K. Petrov-Vodkin. The art of the master acts as an effective tool for debunking myths about the cheap popular character of Russian national motifs, and for combating superficial perceptions of them. The paper highlights worldview universals in culture as well as main problems of the art of the turning periods, one of which includes the creative path of B. Smotrov. The author pays special attention to the works of B. Smotrov as a tool for national self-identification of a creative person in conditions of cultural chaos at the turn of the century since they are on display at personal and collective exhibitions not only in Russia, but also in Austria, China, Korea, the United States and stored not only in Russian museums (Moscow, Perm, Tula), but also in private collections in China, USA, Switzerland. The study comes to the conclusion that "patchwork style" by Boris Smotrov is a quintessence of the Russian in his works.

TI  - Methodology for the Definition of Durum Wheat Yield Homogeneous Zones by Using Satellite Spectral Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main questions facing precision agriculture is the evaluation of different algorithms for the delineation of homogeneous management zones. In the present study, a new approach based on the use of time series of satellite imagery, collected during two consecutive growing seasons, was proposed. Texture analysis performed using the Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) was used to integrate and correct the sum of the vegetation indices maps (NDVI and MCARI2) and define the homogenous productivity zones on ten durum wheat fields in southern Italy. The homogenous zones identified through the method that integrates the GLCM indices with the spectral indices studied showed a greater accuracy (0.18-0.22 Mg ha(-1) for n-ary sumation NDVIs + GLCM and 0.05-0.49 Mg ha(-1) for n-ary sumation MCARI2s + GLCM) with respect to the methods that considered only the sum of the indices. Best results were also obtained with respect to the homogeneous zones derived by using yield maps of the previous year or vegetation indices acquired in a single day. Therefore, the survey methods based on the data collected over the entire study period provided the best results in terms of estimated yield; the addition of clustering analysis performed with the GLCM method allowed to further improve the accuracy of the estimate and better define homogeneous productivity zones of durum wheat fields.

TI  - Screening of Eurasian Tundra Reindeer for Viral Sequences by Next-Generation Sequencing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Reindeer husbandry is essential for the livelihood and culture of indigenous people in the Arctic. Parts of the herding areas are also used as pastures for farm animals, facilitating potential transmission of viruses between species. Following the Covid-19 pandemic, viruses circulating in the wild are receiving increased attention, since they might pose a potential threat to human health. Climate change will influence the prevalence of infectious diseases of both humans and animals. The aim of this study was to detect known and previously unknown viruses in Eurasian tundra reindeer. In total, 623 nasal and 477 rectal swab samples were collected from reindeer herds in Fennoscandia, Iceland, and Eastern Russia during 2016-2019. Next-generation sequencing analysis and BLAST-homology searches indicated the presence of viruses of domesticated and wild animals, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine papillomavirus, alcephaline herpesvirus 1 and 2, deer mastadenovirus B, bovine rotavirus, and roe deer picobirnavirus. Several viral species previously found in reindeer and some novel species were detected, although the clinical relevance of these viruses in reindeer is largely unknown. These results indicate that it should be possible to find emerging viruses of relevance for both human and animal health using reindeer as a sentinel species.

TI  - Calculation of land subsidence and changes in soil moisture and salinity using remote sensing techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the Iranian plains which have experienced land subsidence, there is an indicator, in addition to its high rate of subsidence, soil salinity, and proximity to the centers of population, transportation routes, and infrastructures in Varamin plain, which has raised serious concerns about this center of land subsidence. Excessive use of groundwater and aquifers and lack of optimal cultivation patterns decrease soil fluidity, leading to land subsidence, increased soil salinity, and reduced surface moisture and soil moisture to a depth of 1-2 m. The subsidence phenomenon also disrupts water storage in underground aquifers, making it difficult to reduce the volume of the reservoir and break the soil layers and fill the pores of the water sediment into the lower layers, and store water in the reservoirs. It cannot reach the underground, which is one of the main reasons for the decrease in soil moisture and the increase in soil salinity. In this study, the changes in the land subsidence during the 2014-2020 time period, were evaluated by Sentinel-1 satellite imagery and SNAP software. The soil electrical conductivity, soil surface moisture content, and soil moisture content in the depth of 1-2 m were calculated by Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, Landsat 8 satellite, and FLDAS data in the GEE platform, respectively. The results showed that the increase in land subsidence has raised soil salinity covering area and its intensity. As a result, moisture reduction is observed in different depths in recent years.

TI  - Native and Non-Native Egg Parasitoids Associated with Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (<i>Halyomorpha halys</i> [Stal, 1855]; Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in Western Slovenia
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Halyomorpha halys, the brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), is an invasive pest causing serious damage to agricultural production. Managing this pest species is challenging because of its wide host range and lack of effective control measures. Biological control of H. halys through natural enemies seems to be the most environmentally friendly and sustainable solution. Extensive knowledge of the native egg parasitoid fauna is needed prior to the introduction of a biological control program. The main purpose of the study, carried out in the Goriska region of Western Slovenia, was to detect egg parasitoid species associated with H. halys and to evaluate their impact on the pest population under local environmental conditions. High species richness was identified during the study, and five egg-parasitoids were recorded for the first time in Slovenia. The native species Anastatus bifasciatus dominated in urban and suburban areas, while the non-native Trissolcus mitsukurii prevailed in agricultural areas. Rapid recruitment of native parasitoids, the presence of an effective alien parasitoid species in the region and increasing overall parasitism rates are very encouraging results and valuable information for future activities regarding the biological control of H. halys in Slovenia. Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), native to East Asia, has become a globally invasive pest, as a serious threat to agricultural production and a notorious nuisance pest in urban areas. Considerable efforts have been made so far to develop effective pest control measures to prevent crop damage. Biological control of this invasive stink bug by egg parasitoids has proven to be the most environmentally sustainable long-term solution. Knowledge of the native egg parasitoid fauna is of key importance when implementing a biological control program. Therefore, the main objective of our study was to detect egg parasitoid species associated with H. halys in the Goriska region (Western Slovenia) and to evaluate their impact on the pest population under field conditions. In the years 2019 and 2020, around 4600 H. halys eggs were collected in the wild and more than 3400 sentinel eggs were exposed to detect parasitoids in the field. Five egg-parasitoid species emerged from H. halys eggs: Anastatus bifasciatus (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae), Telenomus sp., Trissolcus basalis, Trissolcus mitsukurii (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) and Ooencyrtus telenomicida (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), all of them are new records for Slovenia. The native species, An. bifasciatus, dominated in urban and suburban areas, while non-native Tr. mitsukurii prevailed in agricultural areas. Overall parasitism rates of naturally laid eggs by the parasitoid species complex in 2019 and 2020 was 3.0 and 14.4%, respectively. Rapid recruitment of native parasitoids, early detection of an effective alien parasitoid species and increasing overall parasitism rates are very encouraging results, which need to be followed and verified in future research.

TI  - Tropospheric Correction of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferograms Using a High-Resolution Weather Model Validated by GNSS Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) is a space geodetic technique used for mapping deformations of the Earth's surface. It has been developed and used increasingly during the last thirty years to measure displacements produced by earthquakes, volcanic activity and other crustal deformations. A limiting factor to this technique is the effect of the troposphere, as spatial and temporal variations in temperature, pressure, and relative humidity introduce significant phase delays in the microwave imagery, thus "masking" surface displacements due to tectonic or other geophysical processes. The use of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models as a tropospheric correction method in InSAR can tackle several of the problems faced with other correction techniques (such as timing, spatial coverage and data availability issues). High-resolution tropospheric modelling is particularly useful in the case of single interferograms, where the removal of the atmospheric phase screen (and especially the highly variable turbulent component) can reveal large-amplitude deformation signals (as in the case of an earthquake). In the western Gulf of Corinth, prominent topography makes the removal of both the stratified and turbulent atmospheric phase screens a challenging task. Here, we investigate the extent to which a high-resolution WRF 1-km re-analysis can produce detailed tropospheric delay maps of the required accuracy by coupling its output (in terms of Zenith Total Delay or ZTD) with the vertical delay component in GNSS measurements. The model is operated with varying physical parameterization in order to identify the best configuration, and validated with GNSS zenithal tropospheric delays, providing a benchmark of real atmospheric conditions. We correct sixteen Sentinel-1A interferograms with differential delay maps at the line-of-sight (LOS) produced by WRF re-analysis. In most cases, corrections lead to a decrease in the phase gradient, with average root-mean-square (RMS) and standard deviation (SD) reductions in the wrapped phase of 6.0% and 19.3%, respectively. Results suggest a high potential of the model to reproduce both the long-wavelength stratified atmospheric signal and the short-wave turbulent atmospheric component which are evident in the interferograms.

TI  - Assessment of Deep Learning Techniques for Land Use Land Cover Classification in Southern New Caledonia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use (LU) and land cover (LC) are two complementary pieces of cartographic information used for urban planning and environmental monitoring. In the context of New Caledonia, a biodiversity hotspot, the availability of up-to-date LULC maps is essential to monitor the impact of extreme events such as cyclones and human activities on the environment. With the democratization of satellite data and the development of high-performance deep learning techniques, it is possible to create these data automatically. This work aims at determining the best current deep learning configuration (pixel-wise vs. semantic labelling architectures, data augmentation, image prepossessing, horizontal ellipsis ), to perform LULC mapping in a complex, subtropical environment. For this purpose, a specific data set based on SPOT6 satellite data was created and made available for the scientific community as an LULC benchmark in a tropical, complex environment using five representative areas of New Caledonia labelled by a human operator: four used as training sets, and the fifth as a test set. Several architectures were trained and the resulting classification was compared with a state-of-the-art machine learning technique: XGboost. We also assessed the relevance of popular neo-channels derived from the raw observations in the context of deep learning. The deep learning approach showed comparable results to XGboost for LC detection and over-performed it on the LU detection task (61.45% vs. 51.56% of overall accuracy). Finally, adding LC classification output of the dedicated deep learning architecture to the raw channels input significantly improved the overall accuracy of the deep learning LU classification task (63.61% of overall accuracy). All the data used in this study are available on line for the remote sensing community and for assessing other LULC detection techniques.

TI  - Dynamics of Daytime Land Surface Temperature (LST) Variabilities in the Middle East Countries During 2001-2018
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Middle East is an area characterized by strong gradients in meteorological conditions and varied land cover. As a result, some of the hottest places in the world as well as very cold areas can be found in this region. The objective of this paper is to quantitatively assess land surface temperature (LST) variations in the countries of the Middle East to estimate the trends and determine whether relationships suggesting the impact of climate change can be observed. Spatiotemporal variability of LST was investigated through the analysis of MODIS Terra LST images (MOD11A2) from 2001 to 2018. The LST differences in both daytime series and seasonal and international means were assessed. The analyses showed that in spring (MAM), about 20,000 km(2) of the study area has an LST higher than 50 degrees C, whereas 3700 km(2) has LST lower than 0 degrees C. In summer (JJA), about 1 million km(2) has LST higher than 50 degrees C. In the fall (SON), about 5 million km(2) of the study area has a land surface temperature higher than 30 degrees C, with about 11 km(2) hotter than 50 degrees C, whereas 320 km(2) has LST lower than 0 degrees C. In winter (DJF), the hottest countries are Yemen, Oman, and Saudi Arabia, with 44.7, 41.8, and 39.8 degrees C, respectively, whereas the lowest LST values were recorded in Turkey, Iran, and Iraq, with -19.5, -18.1, and -10.5 degrees C, respectively. An upward trend in the minimum and a downward trend in the maximum value of the winter LST suggest that winters in the Middle East countries such as Iran, Israel, and Jordan have become milder during the considered period. Negative trends in the spring LST in Bahrain and Oman and the summer LST in Bahrain and Qatar suggest that these seasons in those countries became colder during the study period.

TI  - Monitoring the Spatiotemporal Trajectory of Urban Area Hotspots Using the SVM Regression Method Based on NPP-VIIRS Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban area hotspots are considered to be an ideal proxy for spatial heterogeneity of human activity, which is vulnerable to urban expansion. Nighttime light (NTL) images have been extensively employed in monitoring current urbanization dynamics. However, the existing studies related to NTL images mainly concern detection of urban areas, leaving inner spatial differences in urban NTL luminosity poorly explored. In this study, we propose an innovative approach to explore the spatiotemporal trajectory of urban area hotspots using monthly Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) NTL images. Firstly, multi-temporal VIIRS NTL intensity was decomposed by time-series analysis to obtain annual stable components after data preprocessing. Secondly, the support vector machine (SVM) regression model was utilized to identify urban area hotspots. In order to ensure the model accuracy, the grid search and cross-validation method was integrated to achieve the optimized model parameters. Finally, we analyzed the spatiotemporal migration trajectory of urban area hotspots by the center of gravity method (i.e., shift distance and angle of urban area hotspot centroid). The results indicate that our method successfully captured urban area hotspots with a regression coefficient over 0.8. Meanwhile, the findings give an intuitive understanding of coupling interaction between urban area hotspots and socioeconomic indicators. This study provides important insights for further decision-making regarding sustainable urban planning.

TI  - The Expected Impact of Marine Energy Farms Operating in Island Environments with Mild Wave Energy Resources-A Case Study in the Mediterranean Sea
T2  - INVENTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A particularity of island areas is that they are subjected to strong sea state conditions that can have a severe impact on the beach stability, while on the other hand, they rely mainly on diesel combustion for electricity production which in the long run is not a sustainable solution. The aim of this work is to tackle these two issues, by assessing the impact of a hybrid marine energy farm that may operate near the north-western part of Giglio Island in the Mediterranean Sea. As a first step, the most relevant environmental conditions (wind and waves) over a 27-year time interval (January 1992-December 2018) were identified considering data coming from both ERA5 and the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative for Sea State. An overview of the electricity production was made by considering some offshore wind turbines, the results showing that even during the summertime when there is a peak demand (but low wind resources), the demand can be fully covered by five wind turbines defined each by a rated power of 6 MW. The main objective of this work is to assess the coastal impact induced by a marine energy farm, and for this reason, various layouts obtained by varying the number of lines (one or two) and the distance between the devices were proposed. The modelling system considered has been already calibrated in the target area for this type of study while the selected device is defined by a relatively low absorption property. The dynamics of various wave parameters has been analysed, including significant wave height, but also parameters related to the breaking mechanics, and longshore currents. It was noticed that although the target area is naturally protected by the dominant waves that are coming from the south-western sector, it is possible to occur extreme waves coming from the north-west during the wintertime that can be efficiently attenuated by the presence of the marine energy farm.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of IMERG GPM Products during Tropical Storm Imelda
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical Storm Imelda struck the southeast coastal regions of Texas from 17-19 September, 2019, and delivered precipitation above 500 mm over about 6000 km(2). The performance of the three IMERG (Early-, Late-, and Final-run) GPM satellite-based precipitation products was evaluated against Stage-IV radar precipitation estimates. Basic and probabilistic statistical metrics, such as CC, RSME, RBIAS, POD, FAR, CSI, and PSS were employed to assess the performance of the IMERG products. The products captured the event adequately, with a fairly high POD value of 0.9. The best product (Early-run) showed an average correlation coefficient of 0.60. The algorithm used to produce the Final-run improved the quality of the data by removing systematic errors that occurred in the near-real-time products. Less than 5 mm RMSE error was experienced in over three-quarters (ranging from 73% to 76%) of the area by all three IMERG products in estimating the Tropical Storm Imelda. The Early-run product showed a much better RBIAS relatively to the Final-run product. The overall performance was poor, as areas with an acceptable range of RBIAS (i.e., between -10% and 10%) in all the three IMERG products were only 16% to 17% of the total area. Overall, the Early-run product was found to be better than Late- and Final-run.

TI  - Assessment of CHADFDM satellite-based input dataset for the groundwater recharge estimation in arid and data scarce regions
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquifer natural recharge estimations are a prerequisite for understanding hydrologic systems and sustainable water resources management. As meteorological data series collection is difficult in arid and semiarid areas, satellite products have recently become an alternative for water resources studies. A daily groundwater recharge estimation in the NW part of the Lake Chad Basin, using a soil-plant-atmosphere model (VisualBALAN), from ground- and satellite-based meteorological input dataset for non-irrigated and irrigated land and for the 2005-2014 period is presented. Average annual values were 284 mm and 30 degrees C for precipitation and temperature in ground-based gauge stations. For the satellite-model-based Lake Chad Basin Flood and Drought Monitor System platform (CHADFDM), average annual precipitation and temperature were 417 mm and 29 degrees C, respectively. Uncertainties derived from satellite data measurement could account for the rainfall difference. The estimated mean annual aquifer recharge was always higher from satellite- than ground-based data, with differences up to 46% for dryland and 23% in irrigated areas. Recharge response to rainfall events was very variable and results were very sensitive to: wilting point, field capacity and curve number for runoff estimation. Obtained results provide plausible recharge values beyond the uncertainty related to data input and modelling approach. This work prevents on the important deviations in recharge estimation from weighted-ensemble satellite-based data, informing in decision making to both stakeholders and policy makers.

TI  - A Burned Area Mapping Algorithm for Sentinel-2 Data Based on Approximate Reasoning and Region Growing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 (S2) multi-spectral instrument (MSI) images are used in an automated approach built on fuzzy set theory and a region growing (RG) algorithm to identify areas affected by fires in Mediterranean regions. S2 spectral bands and their post- and pre-fire date (Delta(post-pre)) difference are interpreted as evidence of burn through soft constraints of membership functions defined from statistics of burned/unburned training regions; evidence of burn brought by the S2 spectral bands (partial evidence) is integrated using ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators that provide synthetic score layers of likelihood of burn (global evidence of burn) that are combined in an RG algorithm. The algorithm is defined over a training site located in Italy, Vesuvius National Park, where membership functions are defined and OWA and RG algorithms are first tested. Over this site, validation is carried out by comparison with reference fire perimeters derived from supervised classification of very high-resolution (VHR) PlanetScope images leading to more than satisfactory results with Dice coefficient > 0.84, commission error < 0.22 and omission error < 0.15. The algorithm is tested for exportability over five sites in Portugal (1), Spain (2) and Greece (2) to evaluate the performance by comparison with fire reference perimeters derived from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) database. In these sites, we estimate commission error < 0.15, omission error < 0.1 and Dice coefficient > 0.9 with accuracy in some cases greater than values obtained in the training site. Regression analysis confirmed the satisfactory accuracy levels achieved over all sites. The algorithm proposed offers the advantages of being least dependent on a priori/supervised selection for input bands (by building on the integration of redundant partial burn evidence) and for criteria/threshold to obtain segmentation into burned/unburned areas.

TI  - BVR<sub>c</sub>I<sub>c</sub> Observations, Third-body Orbital Study, and Analysis of the UV Leo-type, Pre-W UMA Binary V642 Virginis
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - V642 Vir is a polar spotted, well-detached, UV Leo-type, low-mass, pre-WUMa (T1 similar to 4250K, similar to K6V) eclipsing binary. It was observed in 2020 April, May, and June at the Dark Sky Observatory in North Carolina, USA with the 0.81 m reflector of Appalachian State University. A total of 88 timings were used in our 22-year period study which included 12 Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) timings. The O - C plots show a low-amplitude oscillation of residuals that points to the existence of an orbiting third body, a dwarf of minimum mass, 0.15 M (circle dot) in an eccentric orbit (e = 0.41), with an orbital period of 20.07 yr. The odd light curves of V642 Virginis indicate that it has polar spots similar to UV Leo and the recently published V1023 Per. Its present large polar spot region indicates that it must have a strong magnetic field and that it is synchronously rotating. The BVRcIc simultaneous Wilson-Devinney Program solution gives a detached binary (primary and secondary components are underfilling their respective Roche Lobes, with 76% and 78% fill outs respectively). The cool spot region models near the pole of the primary component (centered at 10 degrees colatitude) and is angled toward the secondary component. Its large radius (68 degrees) and T-fact (T-spot/T-surface = 0.69) also attest to the conclusion of the strength of the magnetic field. The small Delta T in the components (similar to 318 K) and mass ratio near unity (0.9542 +/- 0.0005) show that the stars are similar in spectral type (secondary similar to K9V). The inclination is high, similar to 86.87 +/- 0.04 degrees, yet there is no time of constant light due to the two stars' essentially equal radii.

TI  - Wounds, Antimicrobial Resistance and Challenges of Implementing a Surveillance System in Myanmar: A Mixed-Methods Study
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wound infections with drug-resistant bacteria lead to higher mortality and morbidity and increased healthcare costs. We aimed to describe the spectrum of bacterial pathogens, isolated from wound cultures in Yangon General Hospital in 2018, and their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns and to understand the challenges in implementing an AMR surveillance system in Myanmar. We conducted a concurrent mixed-methods study involving analysis of surveillance data and in-depth interviews with nine key personnel involved in AMR surveillance. Of 1418 wound specimens processed, 822 (58%) were culture-positive. The most common Gram-positive bacteria were coagulase-negative staphylococci (23.3%) and Staphylococcus aureus (15.1%). Among Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli (12.5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.1%) were common. Staphylococcus aureus isolates were resistant to penicillin (98%), oxacillin (70%) and tetracycline (66%). Escherichia coli showed resistance to ampicillin (98%). Lack of dedicated and trained staff (microbiologist, technician, data entry operator), lack of computers at sentinel sites and non-uniform and non-standardized data capture formats were the major challenges in implementing AMR surveillance. These challenges need to be addressed urgently. We also recommend periodic analysis and sharing of antibiograms at every hospital to inform the treatment regimens used in wound management.

TI  - Simplified and Advanced Sentinel-2-Based Precision Nitrogen Management of Wheat
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study compares simplified and advanced precision nitrogen (N) fertilization approaches for winter wheat relying on Sentinel-2 NDVI, grain yield maps, and protein content. Five N fertilization treatments were compared: (1) a standard rate, calculated by a typical N balance (Flat-N); (2) a variable rate calculated using a simplified linear model, adopting a proportional strategy (NDVI directly related) (Var-N-dir); (3) a variable rate calculated using a simplified linear model, adopting a compensative strategy (NDVI inversely related) (Var-N-inv); (4) a variable rate calculated using the AgroSat model (Var-N-Agrosat); and (5) a variable rate calculated applying the Agricolus model (Var-N-Agricolus). The study was carried out in four fields over two cropping seasons with a randomized blocks design. Results indicate that the weather remains the main factor influencing yield, as it typically happens in a rainfed crop. No substantial differences in crop yield were observed among the N fertilization models within each year and experimental location. However, in the more favorable season, the low-input direct model (Var-N-dir) resulted as the best choice, providing the higher NUE (nitrogen use efficiency) value. In the less favorable season, results showed a better performance of the advanced models (Var-N-Agricolus and Var-N-Agrosat), which limited yield losses and reduced intra-field variability, with relevant importance given to the increasing frequency of abnormal climate phenomena. In general, all these VRT approaches allowed reduction of the excess of fertilizers, preservation of the environment, and saving money.

TI  - Evaluation of the AVHRR surface reflectance long term data record between 1984 and 2011
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term data record (LTDR) from the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) provides daily surface reflectance with global coverage from the 1980s to present day, making it a unique source of information for the study of land surface properties and their long-term dynamics. Surface reflectance is a critical input for the generation of products such as vegetation indices, albedo, and land cover. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to quantify its uncertainties to better understand how they might propagate into downstream products. Due to the prolonged length of the surface reflectance LTDR and previous unavailability of a well calibrated reference, no comprehensive evaluation of the complete record has been reported so far. Recently, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) began production of surface reflectance datasets from the Landsat 4-8 satellites, which provide a suitable reference against which the LTDR can be compared to. In this study, we evaluate the LTDRV5 between 1984 and 2011 using surface reflectance data from the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM5) Collection-1 as a reference. Data from TM5 was obtained from over 740,000 globally distributed scenes which gave a representative set of land surface types and atmospheric conditions. Differences due to observation geometry were accounted for using the Vermote-Justice-Breon (VJB) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) normalization method to adjust the AVHRR surface reflectance to TM5 observation conditions; the spectral response differences were minimized using spectral band adjustment factors (SBAFs) derived from the Earth Observing One (EO-1) Hyperion atmospherically corrected hyperspectral spectra. The performance of the AVHRR record is reported in terms of the accuracy, precision, and uncertainty (APU). Results show that the LTDR performance is close or within the combined uncertainty specification of 0.071 rho + 0.0071, where rho is the estimated reflectance.

TI  - Evaluating policy coherence: A case study of peatland forests on the Kampar Peninsula landscape, Indonesia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Conflicting policies relating to the management of multi-sectoral, multi-level and multi-actor forest uses often result in ineffective policy implementation. Methods for assessing policy coherence, however, are limited and often require an extensive evidence base which is not always available. In Indonesia, this has often led to conflicts between government agencies and other forest stakeholders. Businesses, NGOs and local communities struggle to comply with all of the conflicting or overlapping regulations that relate to the use of forested landscapes. Even if they succeed, the cost of implementation can be excessive. Improved methods for assessing policy coherence could assist governments and other stakeholders to navigate policy complexity and to avoid the potentially high costs of policies that are antagonistic to one another. We propose an audit of policy coherence at the landscape scale as a way of addressing this problem. We test this idea with an experimental policy audit on the Kampar Peninsula, a peat landscape in Pelalawan district, Riau Province, Indonesia. Indonesia has participated in the UN global peat initiative since 2015 and has created a peat protection policy to control the exploitation of peat with regulation No 57/2016. This regulation and the various instruments devolved from it has been a source of confusion and conflict among stakeholders. We applied commonly accepted performance auditing standards to assess the coherence, effectiveness and efficiency of regulations from other sectors and in different jurisdictions with the new peat regulation No 57/2016 and its derivatives. To aid our audit assessment, we overlaid radar and Landsat images to depict delineations of peat protection and cultivation zones according to different legislation. Our audit revealed incoherent mapping of peat protection zones on the Kampar Peninsula, which has led to ineffective and inefficient implementation of policies. We then propose three alternative protection and cultivation scenarios to that proposed by the government. Our results show that any of these alternative scenarios would provide a policy that is not only more coherent, but that also would result in more effective and efficient policy implementation. This policy audit method should have wide potential application for auditing best practice and policy effectiveness in complex landscapes across the globe and should have immediate application in helping to resolve the current issues on the Kampar Peninsular.

TI  - Solving the fourth-corner problem: forecasting ecosystem primary production from spatial multispecies trait-based models
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecasting productivity and stress across an ecosystem is complicated by the multiple interactions between competing species, the unknown levels of intra- and interspecific trait plasticity, and the dependencies between those traits within individuals. Integrating these features into a trait-based quantitative framework requires a conceptual and quantitative synthesis of how multiple species and their functional traits interact and respond to changing environments, a challenge known in community ecology as the "fourth-corner problem." We propose such a novel synthesis, implemented as an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model. This allows us to (1) simultaneously model trait-trait and trait-environment relationships by explicitly accounting for both intra- and interspecific trait variabilities in a single analysis using all available data types, (2) quantify the strength of the trait-environment relationships, (3) identify trade-offs between multiple traits in multiple species, and (4) faithfully propagate our modeling uncertainties when making species-specific and community-wide trait predictions, reducing false confidence in our spatial prediction results. We apply this integrated approach to the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, a sentinel ecosystem impacted simultaneously by both climate change and multiple types of human exploitation. The Sundarbans presents extensive variability in environmental variables, such as salinity and siltation, driven by changing seawater levels from the south and freshwater damming from the north. We find that tree species growing under stress have a typical functional response to the environmental drivers with inter-specific variability around this average, and the amount of variability is further contingent upon the nature and magnitude of the environmental drivers. Our model captures the retreat in traits related to resource acquisition and a plastic enhancement of traits related to resource conservation, both clear indications of stress. We predict that, if historical increases in salinity and siltation are maintained, one-third of whole-ecosystem productivity will be lost by 2050. Our integrated modeling approach bridges community and ecosystem ecology through simultaneously modeling trait-environment correlations and trait-trait trade-offs at organismal, community, and ecosystem levels; provides a generalizable foundation for powerful modeling of trait-environment linkages under changing environments to predict their consequences on ecosystem functioning and services; and is readily applicable across the Earth's ecosystems.

TI  - Polychlorinated Quaterphenyl Concentrations in the Blood and Their Patterns in Subjects Examined for a Possible Diagnosis of Yusho from FY 2009 to 2019
T2  - Fukuoka Acta Medica
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 1985, blood concentrations of polychlorinated quaterphenyls (PCQs), which are congeners that accumulate in the bodies of typical Yusho patients in the same way as PCBs, have been monitored by the Study Group for Yusho. We present here the tendencies and characteristics of blood PCQ concentrations in subjects examined for a possible diagnosis of Yusho from FY 2009 to 2019. The peak patterns of PCBs in the blood tended to be close to those of a typical Yusho patient as the blood PCQ concentration increased. The result of the secular change of PCQ concentration in a typical Yusho patient, suggested that lipophilic PCQ congeners were hardly excreted even in high-exposure cases. Almost all of the blood PCQ concentrations in subjects born after the rice oil poisoning incident were as with those of healthy individuals. Therefore we concluded that PCQ congeners had hardly transferred from Yusho patients to the next generation. The usefulness of blood PCQ concentration as a diagnostic criterion for Yusho is still unchanged, and a continuous follow-up survey will be important in the future.

TI  - Detection of Changes in Arable Chernozemic Soil Health Based on Landsat TM Archive Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When soils are used for a long period of time as arable land, their properties change. This can lead to soil degradation and loss of fertility, as well as other important soil biosphere functions. Obtaining data on the trends in arable soil conditions over large areas using traditional field survey methods is expensive and time-consuming. Currently, there are large archives of satellite data that can be used to monitor the status of arable soils. The analysis of changes in the color of the surface of arable chernozem soils of the Belgorod region, for the period from 1985 to the present, has been carried out based on the analysis of Landsat TM5 satellite data and information about the spectral reflectance of the soils of the region. It is found that, on most parts of arable lands of the region, the color of the soil surface has not changed significantly since 1985. Color changes were revealed on 11% of the analyzed area. The greatest changes are connected with the humus content and moisture content of soils. The three most probable reasons for the change of humus content in an arable horizon of soils are as follows: the dehumidification of soils during plowing; the reduction of the humus content due to water erosion; and the increase in humus content due to changes in the land-use system of the region in recent years. The change in soil moisture regime has mainly been found in arable lands in river valleys, most likely conditioned by the natural evolution of soils. Trends of increasing soil moisture are prevalent. The revealed regularities testify to the high stability of arable soils in the region during the last few decades.

TI  - Recent advances in the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma: our case cohort
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Decades of research into the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma have proven it to be a 'tough nut to crack', and its incidence has continued to increase over the last 30 years. Surgery remains a gold standard for early-stage melanoma with five-year survival of 98% for stage I disease, and 90% for stage II. Nonetheless, patients with stage III disease are at a higher risk, resulting in local recurrence as well as distant metastasis. Research regarding the control of metastatic malignant melanoma of the head and neck has evolved. Currently the search is on to understand metastatic malignant melanoma as a heterogeneous disease both at the molecular and clinical level. This paper focuses on the latest systemic therapy for metastatic disease of the head and neck, including cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and target therapy. The new eighth edition of tumour staging, and the sequelae for malignant melanoma, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), surgical intervention, and its benefits and shortfalls, are discussed. Also, the outcome of our cohort series of patients with metastatic cutaneous malignant melanoma who were treated with systemic combination therapy in Dorset is presented.Crown Copyright (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

TI  - A GLOBAL ECOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION OF COASTAL SEGMENT UNITS TO COMPLEMENT MARINE BIODIVERSITY OBSERVATION NETWORK ASSESSMENTS
T2  - OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new data layer provides Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) labels for global coastal segments at 1 km or shorter resolution. These characteristics are summarized for six US Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) sites and one MBON Pole to Pole of the Americas site in Argentina. The global coastlines CMECS classifications were produced from a partitioning of a 30 m Landsat-derived shoreline vector that was segmented into 4 million 1 km or shorter segments. Each segment was attributed with values from 10 variables that represent the ecological settings in which the coastline occurs, including properties of the adjacent water, adjacent land, and coastline itself. The 4 million segments were classified into 81,000 coastal segment units (CSUs) as unique combinations of variable classes. We summarize the process to develop the CSUs and derive summary descriptions for the seven MBON case study sites. We discuss the intended application of the new CSU data for research and management in coastal areas.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns in Data Availability of the Sentinel-5P NO<sub>2</sub> Product over Urban Areas in Norway
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its comparatively high spatial resolution and its daily repeat frequency, the tropospheric nitrogen dioxide product provided by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor platform has attracted significant attention for its potential for urban-scale monitoring of air quality. However, the exploitation of such data in, for example, operational assimilation of local-scale dispersion models is often complicated by substantial data gaps due to cloud cover or other retrieval limitations. These challenges are particularly prominent in high-latitude regions where significant cloud cover and high solar zenith angles are often prevalent. Using the example of Norway as a representative case for a high-latitude region, we here evaluate the spatiotemporal patterns in the availability of valid data from the operational TROPOMI tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) product over five urban areas (Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim, Stavanger, and Kristiansand) and a 2.5 year period from July 2018 through November 2020. Our results indicate that even for relatively clean environments such as small Norwegian cities, distinct spatial patterns of tropospheric NO2 are visible in long-term average datasets from TROPOMI. However, the availability of valid data on a daily level is limited by both cloud cover and solar zenith angle (during the winter months), causing the fraction of valid retrievals in each study site to vary from 20% to 50% on average. A temporal analysis shows that for our study sites and the selected period, the fraction of valid pixels in each domain shows a clear seasonal cycle reaching a maximum of 50% to 75% in the summer months and 0% to 20% in winter. The seasonal cycle in data availability shows the inverse behavior of NO2 pollution in Norway, which typically has its peak in the winter months. However, outside of the mid-winter period we find the TROPOMI NO2 product to provide sufficient data availability for detailed mapping and monitoring of NO2 pollution in the major urban areas in Norway and see potential for the use of the data in local-scale data assimilation and emission inversions applications.

TI  - The connection between forest degradation and urban energy demand in sub-Saharan Africa: a characterization based on high-resolution remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Charcoal is a key energy source for urban households in sub-Saharan Africa and charcoal production is the main cause of forest degradation across the region. We used multitemporal high-resolution remote sensing optical imagery to quantify the extent and intensity of forest degradation associated with charcoal production and its impact on forest carbon stocks for the main supplying area of an African capital. This analysis documents the advance of forest degradation and quantifies its aboveground biomass removals over a seven-year period, registering that, between 2013 and 2016, the average annual area under charcoal production was 103 km(2) and the annual aboveground biomass removals reached 1081 000 (SD = 2461) Mg. Kiln densities in the study area rose to 2 kilns-ha, with an average of 90.7 Mg ha(-1) of extracted aboveground biomass. Charcoal production was responsible for the degradation of 55.5% of the mopane woodlands in the study area between 2013 and 2019. We estimated post-disturbance recovery times using an ecosystem model calibrated for the study area. The simulations showed that recovery times could require up to 150 years for current aboveground biomass extraction rates. The results of the remote sensing analysis and the simulations of the ecosystem model corroborate the unsustainability of the present patterns of charcoal production. The detailed characterization of the spatial and temporal patterns of charcoal production was combined with household survey information to quantify the impact of the urban energy demand of the Maputo urban area on forest carbon stocks. The analysis shows that Maputo charcoal demand was responsible for the annual degradation of up to 175.3 km(2) and that the contribution of the study area to this demand fluctuated between 75% and 33% over the study period. The extent, advance pace and distance from urban centers documented in this study support the idea that forest degradation from charcoal production cannot merely be considered a peri-urban process. The intensity of the aboveground biomass (AGB) removals and its contribution to forest carbon stocks changes is significant at the national and regional levels.

TI  - A Geo-Spatial Analysis for Characterising Urban Sprawl Patterns in the Batticaloa Municipal Council, Sri Lanka
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban sprawl related to rapid urbanisation in developed and developing nations affects sustainable land use. In Sri Lanka, urban areas have mostly expanded in a rather spontaneous, unplanned manner (based on the current settlers' subjective movement) rather than conforming to the local government's development plan. This growth inevitably leads to uncontrolled urban sprawl in many Sri Lankan cities, including Batticaloa. So far, Sri Lanka's planners or researchers have not yet tackled the sprawling developments in this city. Understanding the different forms and patterns of urban sprawl is the key to address sprawling growth. This study aims to identify the characteristics of urban sprawl in the Batticaloa municipal council using Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing technology. Landsat satellite images for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020 as well as 2002, 2011, and 2019 population data were used and analysed using ArcGIS' maximum likelihood classification tool and the density function, respectively, to delineate the characteristics of urban sprawl. The results revealed that low-density development, leapfrog development, commercial ribbon development, and scattered growth are the influencing characteristics of urban sprawl in the Batticaloa municipality. These characteristics were found mainly in the urban edge of the city and have led to urban sprawl. The finding provides knowledge into recognising the characteristics of urban sprawl with empirical evidence. It affords a clear direction for future studies of urban sprawl in rapidly growing cities that are numerous in Sri Lanka, and the identified characteristics of urban sprawl can be useful in minimising future sprawl. This result can be a tool for future urban planning and management in the Batticaloa municipality.

We must understand how their historical relationship to the land connects Kanaka Protectors to their kuleana, their sphere of responsibility and continual maintenance of its health and bounty. Relationality and a worldview based on a continuum of connections between the universe at large, the land, non-humans and humans is the main framework that allows us to understand not only the actions, but the vocabulary and the mindset in which Hawaiian Protection movements articulate their spiritual and political positions as well as their visions of the future.

TI  - Wildfires Vegetation Recovery through Satellite Remote Sensing and Functional Data Analysis
T2  - MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, wildfires have caused havoc across the world, which are especially aggravated in certain regions due to climate change. Remote sensing has become a powerful tool for monitoring fires, as well as for measuring their effects on vegetation over the following years. We aim to explain the dynamics of wildfires' effects on a vegetation index (previously estimated by causal inference through synthetic controls) from pre-wildfire available information (mainly proceeding from satellites). For this purpose, we use regression models from Functional Data Analysis, where wildfire effects are considered functional responses, depending on elapsed time after each wildfire, while pre-wildfire information acts as scalar covariates. Our main findings show that vegetation recovery after wildfires is a slow process, affected by many pre-wildfire conditions, among which the richness and diversity of vegetation is one of the best predictors for the recovery.

AB  - Discussion of Islamization is not only associated with the spread of religious values but also related to the activity of trade and the opening of the new lands. In Java, all three of these themes have occurred simultaneously and then experienced rapid development since the 15th century. During the 15th and 17th centuries, many Islamic kingdoms rose and fell by turns with variuos ideology and their economic and political motives. As a result, Java experienced a complex of territorialization. By a spatial-historical approach, this article shows how territorialization affects the fashion of the emergence and collapse of the cities in Java. The spatial dynamics of urban growth reflected changes in political space production run by each ruling actor. The city played a significant role as a symbol and an identity of the political power of the dominant regime.

TI  - Remote Sensing Indices for Spatial Monitoring of Agricultural Drought in South Asian Countries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is an intricate atmospheric phenomenon with the greatest impacts on food security and agriculture in South Asia. Timely and appropriate forecasting of drought is vital in reducing its negative impacts. This study intended to explore the performance of the evaporative stress index (ESI), vegetation health index (VHI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and standardized anomaly index (SAI) based on satellite remote sensing data from 2002-2019 for agricultural drought assessment in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. The spatial maps were generated against each index, which indicated a severe agricultural drought during the year 2002, compared to the other years. The results showed that the southeast region of Pakistan, and the north, northwest, and southwest regions of India and Afghanistan were significantly affected by drought. However, Bangladesh faced substantial drought in the northeast and northwest regions during the drought year (2002). The longest drought period of seven months was observed in India followed by Pakistan and Afghanistan with six months, while, only three months were perceived in Bangladesh. The correlation between drought indices and climate variables such as soil moisture has remained a significant drought-initiating variable. Furthermore, this study confirmed that the evaporative stress index (ESI) is a good agricultural drought indicator, being quick and with greater sensitivity, and thus advantageous compared to the VHI, EVI, and SAI vegetation indices.

M3  - Article
AB  - Vertical profiles and stratospheric HNO3 and HCl columns are retrieved by ground-based high resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) remote sensing measurements at the Hefei site in China. The time series of stratospheric HNO3 and HCl columns from January 2017 to December 2019 showed similar annual variation trends, with an annually decreasing rate of (-9.45 +/- 1.20)% yr(-1) and (-7.04 +/- 0.81)% yr(-1) for stratospheric HNO3 and HCl, respectively. The seasonal amplitudes of stratospheric HNO3 and HCl are 2.67 x 10(15) molec cm(-2) and 4.76 x 10(14) molec cm(-2) respectively, both reaching their maximum in March and their minimum in September, due to the tropopause height variation. Further, HNO3 and HCl data were used to compare with Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) satellite data. MLS satellite data showed similar seasonal variations and annual rates with FTIR data, and the stratospheric HNO3 and HCl columns of the two datasets have correlation coefficients (r) of 0.87 and 0.88, respectively. The mean bias between satellite and FTIR data of stratospheric HNO3 and HCl columns are (-8.58 +/- 12.22)% and (4.58 +/- 13.09)%, respectively.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Variations of Total Nitrogen and Phosphorus in Poyang, Dongting and Taihu Lakes from Landsat-8 Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Poyang Lake, Dongting Lake, and Taihu Lake are the largest freshwater lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China. In recent years, the eutrophication level of lakes has increased with the development of the social economy and caused many environmental and social problems. The concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) are the key indicators of the degree of eutrophication, but the traditional ground monitoring methods are not capable of capturing such parameters in whole lakes with high spatial-temporal resolution. In this paper, empirical models are established and evaluated between the TN and TP and remote sensing spectral factors in the three lakes using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite data and in-situ data. The results show that the inversion accuracy is higher than 75%. The TN and TP concentrations in the three lakes are inversed based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform from 2014 to 2020 and their spatial-temporal variations are analyzed. The results show that the concentrations of TN and TP in Poyang Lake were decreased by 5.99% and 7.13% over 7 years, respectively, and the TN in Dongting Lake was decreased by 5.25% while the TP remained stable. The temporal changes in TN and TP concentrations displayed seasonal variations. A low concentration was observed in summer and high concentrations were in spring and winter. The average concentrations of TN and TP in Taihu Lake were higher than that of the other two lakes. The TP concentration was increased by 17.3% over 7 years, while the TN concentration remained almost stable. The variation in TN in Taihu Lake was the same as the growth cycle of algae, with higher value in spring and winter and lower value in summer, while the concentration of TP was lower in spring and winter and higher in summer. The spatial distribution of TN and TP concentrations in the three major lakes was significantly affected by human activities, and the concentrations of TN and TP were higher in areas near cities and agricultural activities.

TI  - EARLY (AVANT-GARDE) SYMPHONIES BY VALENTIN SILVESTROV AS A SOUND UNIVERSE
T2  - STUDIA UNIVERSITATIS BABES-BOLYAI MUSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the article under consideration are the ways of symphony genre transformation in the early works of Valentin Silvestrov (Ukraine). For the first time, the First, Second, Third, and Fourth symphonies by the genius composers of the 20th century are analyzed as a certain stylistic system. These compositions are endowed with the features of avant-garde poetics, and as a subject of musicological reflection, they are associated with a rethinking of the semantic paradigm of the genre. V. Silvestrov's early symphonies stand out from the classical practice of European symphonies. Scientific awareness of their phenomenal nature necessitated a methodological choice aimed at the most accurate identification of the philosophical concept of the new sound universum of V. Silvestrov's music. Deep correlation of the image of a human being as a factor of the symphony poetics (the influence of philosophical concepts of human ontology in the 20th century with the transformation of the genre canon) is considered. This refers to the nonmusical dimension of the genre semantics. The study of V. Silvestrov's early symphonies reveal a new philosophy of music through gradual movement - modulation: from the neobaroque First Symphony and "cosmic pastorals" Musica Mundana of the Second Symphony through the history anthropologisation in the Third Symphony "Eschatology" to the monodrama Musica Humana in the Fourth Symphony. The dichotomy of Musica Mundana - Musica Humana is not accidental: in V. Silvestrov's creative method, remains relevant, which is confirmed by the dramaturgy of his latest work - the Ninth symphony (2019).

TI  - Analysis of tectonic deformation on channel morphology through quantitative geomorphic indices and DEM derived drainage system
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY
M3  - Review
AB  - Drainage basin dynamics of any river is controlled by geomorphic attributes which include both surface and subsurface characteristics of a watershed. These characteristics comprise erosional and deformational processes affecting the hydrological and morphological conditions of the watershed. Similarly, the tectonic setup of the watershed influences the terrain topography and geomorphology as well. The paper deals with the evaluation of DEM-derived parameters related to morphometry and tectonic setup in the Asan watershed, Doon Valley, Uttarakhand. The assessment of active tectonics in the study area is based on the parameters related to the morphometry and morphotectonic characters of the watershed. These terrain attributes are determined using Cartosat-1 DEM (10 m) using GIS to investigate the structural setting. The parametric evaluation concerning morphometric analysis helps to understand their significance in watershed prioritization and management while the tectonic analysis helps to determine the structural setup and identifying the hazard-prone area, if persists, in the watershed. The study area falls downhill of tectonically active Lesser Himalaya and Siwaliks, make it an ideal location to determine the degree of relative tectonic activity in the area. The average of measured attributes is used to evaluate the combined classification of the Relative Active Tectonic Index (R-i). The outcome reveals that the watershed is tectonically active that experienced a differential rate of tectonism and have a consistence relationship between structural disturbances and basin geometry.

TI  - Utilizing TVDI and NDWI to Classify Severity of Agricultural Drought in Chuping, Malaysia
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought is crucial in understanding the relationship to crop production functions which can be monitored using satellite remote sensors. The aim of this research is to combine temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) classifications for identifying drought areas in Chuping, Malaysia which has regularly recorded high temperatures. TVDI and NDWI are assessed using three images of the dry spell period in March for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017. NDWI value representing water content in vegetation decreases numerically to -0.39, -0.37 and -0.36 for the year 2015, 2016 and 2017. Normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) values representing vegetation health status in the given area for images of years 2015 to 2017 decreases significantly (p <= 0.05) from 0.50 to 0.35 respectively. Overall, TVDI in the Chuping area showed agricultural drought with an average value of 0.46. However, Kilang Gula Chuping area in Chuping showed a significant increase in dryness for all of the three years assessed with an average value of 0.70. When both TVDI and NDWI were assessed, significant clustering of spots in Chuping, Perlis for all the 3 years was identified where geographical local regressions of 0.84, 0.70 and 0.70 for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 was determined. Furthermore, Moran's I values revealed that the research area had a high I value of 0.63, 0.30 and 0.23 with respective Z scores of 17.80, 8.63 and 6.77 for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017, indicating that the cluster relationship is significant in the 95-99 percent confidence interval. Using both indices alone was sufficient to understand the drier spots of Chuping over 3 years. The findings of this research will be of interest to local agriculture authorities, like plantation and meteorology departments to understand drier areas in the state to evaluate water deficits severity and cloud seeding points during drought.

TI  - Multisource Data Analysis for Gold Potentiality Mapping of Atalla Area and Its Environs, Central Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, airborne geophysical and remote sensing datasets were integrated for gold potentiality mapping (GPM) over the Atalla area in Central Eastern Desert, Egypt. Utilizing aeromagnetic data, detailed structural complexity maps were constructed using the center for exploration targeting (CET) procedure. Then, spectrometric gamma-ray data primarily located hydrothermally altered tracts with discriminating various rock units. The latter are precisely outlined by implementing various techniques (false-color composite (FCC), band ratio (BR), relative absorption band depth (RBD), directed principal component analysis (DPCA), and constrained energy minimization (CEM)) to ASTER, Sentinel 2 and ALOS PRISM datasets, with reference to the geological maps. The study exhibits that gold mineralization is structurally controlled by NW-SE direction. The findings of structural complexity and hydrothermal alteration (argillic, advanced argillic, phyllic, and propylitic) were used as weighted inputs for contouring gold potentiality. The resultant GPM accentuated five gold-promising zones; two are confirmed via locations of ancient gold mines, while the remaining three zones are strongly recommended for their gold potentiality.

TI  - The Potential of Landsat NDVI Sequences to Explain Wheat Yield Variation in Fields in Western Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term maps of within-field crop yield can help farmers understand how yield varies in time and space and optimise crop management. This study investigates the use of Landsat NDVI sequences for estimating wheat yields in fields inWestern Australia (WA). By fitting statistical crop growth curves, identifying the timing and intensity of phenological events, the best single integrated NDVI metric in any year was used to estimate yield. The hypotheses were that: (1) yield estimation could be improved by incorporating additional information about sowing date or break of season in statistical curve fitting for phenology detection; (2) the integrated NDVI metrics derived from phenology detection can estimate yield with greater accuracy than the observed NDVI values at one or two time points only. We tested the hypotheses using one field (similar to 235 ha) in the WA grain belt for training and another field (similar to 143 ha) for testing. Integrated NDVI metrics were obtained using: (1) traditional curve fitting (SPD); (2) curve fitting that incorporates sowing date information (+SD); and (3) curve fitting that incorporates rainfall-based break of season information (+BOS). Yield estimation accuracy using integrated NDVI metrics was further compared to the results using a scalable crop yield mapper (SCYM) model. We found that: (1) relationships between integrated NDVI metrics using the three curve fitting models and yield varied from year to year; (2) overall, +SD marginally improved yield estimation (r = 0.81, RMSE = 0.56 tonnes/ha compared to r = 0.80, RMSE = 0.61 tonnes/ha using SPD), but +BOS did not show obvious improvement (r = 0.80, RMSE = 0.60 tonnes/ha); (3) use of integrated NDVI metrics was more accurate than SCYM (r = 0.70, RMSE = 0.62 tonnes/ha) on average and had higher spatial and yearly consistency with actual yield than using SCYM model. We conclude that sequences of Landsat NDVI have the potential for estimation of wheat yield variation in fields in WA but they need to be combined with additional sources of data to distinguish different relationships between integrated NDVI metrics and yield in different years and locations.

TI  - Mapping individual silver fir trees using hyperspectral and LiDAR data in a Central European mixed forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping a specific tree species at individual tree level across landscapes using remote sensing is challenging, especially in forests where co-occurring tree species exhibit similar characteristics. In Central European mixed forests, silver fir and Norway spruce have been identified as a pair of coniferous tree species with similar spectral and structural characteristics, typically leading to a major misclassification error in mapping studies. Here, we aimed to accurately map individual silver fir trees in a spruce-dominated natural forest in the Bavarian Forest National Park using integrated airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR data. To accomplish this goal, we extracted a set of relevant spectral and structural features from the hyperspectral and LiDAR data and used them to build machine learning classification models. Specifically, we compared the performance of three one-class classification algorithms (i.e. one-class support vector machine, biased support vector machine, and maximum entropy) for mapping individual silver fir trees. Our results showed that the biased support vector machine classifier yielded the highest mapping accuracy, with the area under the curve for positive and unlabeled samples (puAUC) achieving 0.95 (kappa 0.90). We found that the intensity value of 95th percentile of normalized tree height and the percentage of first returns above 2 m high were the most influential structural features, capturing the main morphological difference between silver fir and Norway spruce at the top tree crown. We also found that the wavebands at 700.1 nm, 714.5 nm, and 1201.6 nm were the most robust spectral bands, which are strongly affected by chlorophyll and foliar water content. Our study suggests that discovering links between spectral and structural features captured by different remotely sensed data and species-specific traits can significantly improve the mapping accuracy of a focal species at the individual tree level.

TI  - Using Satellite Data to Optimize Wheat Yield and Quality under Climate Change
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatic conditions during the grain-filling period are a major factor affecting wheat grain yield and quality. Wheat in many semi-arid and arid areas faces high-temperature stress during this period. Remote sensing can be used to monitor both crops and environmental temperature. The objective of this study was to develop a tool to optimize field management (cultivar and sowing time). Analysis of 155 cultivar experiments (from 10 growth seasons) representing different environmental conditions revealed the required degree-days for each Israeli spring wheat cultivar to reach heading (from emergence). We developed a Google Earth Engine (GEE) app to analyze time series of gap-filled 1 km MODIS land surface temperature (LSTcont). By changing the cultivar and/or emergence date in the GEE app, the farmer can "expose" each wheat field to different climatic conditions during the grain-filling period, thereafter enabling him to choose the best cultivar to be sown in the field with the right timing. This approach is expected to reduce the number of fields that suffer from heat stress during the grain-filling period. The app can be also used to assess the effects of different global warming scenarios and to plan adaptation strategies in other regions too.

TI  - Coupling Denoising to Detection for SAR Imagery
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application The proposed object detection framework aims to improve detection performance for noisy SAR images, which is applicable for general object detection in SAR imagery: recognition of militarily important targets such as ships and aircrafts or monitoring for abnormal civilian events. Detecting objects in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has received much attention in recent years since SAR can operate in all-weather and day-and-night conditions. Due to the prosperity and development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), many previous methodologies have been proposed for SAR object detection. In spite of the advance, existing detection networks still have limitations in boosting detection performance because of inherently noisy characteristics in SAR imagery; hence, separate preprocessing step such as denoising (despeckling) is required before utilizing the SAR images for deep learning. However, inappropriate denoising techniques might cause detailed information loss and even proper denoising methods does not always guarantee performance improvement. In this paper, we therefore propose a novel object detection framework that combines unsupervised denoising network into traditional two-stage detection network and leverages a strategy for fusing region proposals extracted from both raw SAR image and synthetically denoised SAR image. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework on our own object detection datasets constructed with remote sensing images from TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed satellites. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework on our own object detection datasets constructed with remote sensing images from TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed satellites. The proposed framework shows better performances when we compared the model with using only noisy SAR images and only denoised SAR images after despeckling under multiple backbone networks.

AB  - We established an analytical method for accurately determining the concentrations of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in a blood volume of 5 g. Inter-laboratory cross-comparison is available for maintaining the quality of dioxins and PCBs analyses. We carried out the cross comparison of dioxin and PCBs analyses in the blood with domestic analysis organizations. Two cross-comparison studies each of dioxins and PCBs analyses were carried out from FY 2016 to 2019. As a result, the findings of our analysis accorded well with the analyses of the other organizations. It was found that our analytical method is sufficiently reliable.

TI  - Assessing morphological changes in a human-impacted alluvial system using hydro-sediment modeling and remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Construction of managed aquifer recharge structures (MARS) to store floodwater is a common strategy for storing depleted groundwater resources in arid and semi-arid regions, as part of integrated water resources management (IWRM). MARS divert surface water to groundwater, but this can affect downstream fluvial processes. The impact of MARS on fluvial processes was investigated in this study by combining remote sensing techniques with hydro-sediment modeling for the case of the Kaboutar-Ali-Chay aquifer, northwestern Iran. The impact of MARS on groundwater dynamics was assessed, sedimentation across the MARS was modeled using a 2D hydrodynamic model, and morphological changes were quantified in the human-impacted alluvial fan using Landsat time series data and statistical methods. Changes were detected by comparing data for the periods before (1985-1996) and after (1997-2018) MARS construction. The results showed that the rate of groundwater depletion decreased from 2.14 m/yr before to 0.86 m/yr after MARS construction. Hydro-sediment modeling revealed that MARS ponds slowed water outflow, resulting in a severe decrease in sediment load which lead to a change from sediment deposition to sediment erosion in the alluvial fan. Morphometric analyses revealed decreasing alluvial fan area and indicated significant differences (p < 0.01) between pre- and post-impact periods for different morphometric parameters analyzed. The rate of change in area of the Kaboutar-Ali-Chay alluvial fan changed from -0.228 to -0.115 km(2)/year between pre- and post-impact periods.

TI  - DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) Level 1 Product Evaluation Using RadCalNet Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer (DESIS) is the first hyperspectral imaging spectrometer installed in the Multi-User System for Earth Sensing (MUSES) on the International Space Station (ISS) for acquiring routine science grade images from orbit. It was launched on 29 June 2018 and integrated into MUSES. DESIS measures energy in the spectral range of 400 to 1000 nm with high spatial and spectral resolution: 30 m and 2.55 nm, respectively. DESIS data should be sufficiently quantitative and accurate to use it for different applications and research. This work performs a radiometric evaluation of DESIS Level 1 product (Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance) by comparing it with coincident Radiometric Calibration Network (RadCalNet) measurements at Railroad Valley Playa (RVUS), Gobabeb (GONA), and La Crau (LCFR). RVUS, GONA, and LCFR offer 4, 15, and 5 coincident datasets between DESIS and RadCalNet measurements, respectively. The results show an agreement between DESIS and RadCalNet TOA reflectance within similar to 5% for most spectral regions. However, there is an additional similar to 5% disagreement across the wavelengths affected by water vapor absorption and atmospheric scattering. Among the three RadCalNet sites, RVUS and GONA show a similar measurement disagreement with DESIS of similar to 5%, while LCFR differs by similar to 10%. Agreement between DESIS and RadCalNet measurements is variable across all three sites, likely due to surface type differences. DESIS and RadCalNet agreement show a precision of similar to 2.5%, 4%, and 7% at RVUS, GONA, and LCFR, respectively. RVUS and GONA, which have a similar surface type, sand, have a similar level of radiometric accuracy and precision, whereas LCFR, which consists of sparse vegetation, has lower accuracy and precision. The observed precision of DESIS Level 1 products from all the sites, especially LCFR, can be improved with a better Bidirectional Reflection Distribution Function (BRDF) characterization of the RadCalNet sites.

M3  - Article
AB  - G. V. Ivanov's works are evaluated in different ways, but no matter what place analysts give him in the poetic hierarchy, two characteristics remain unchangeable. He is one of the most significant Russian poets. His poetic language is often focused on reconsidering the experience of his predecessors, which produces a large number of intertextual connections, which represent a constant of poetic language, one of the codes that allow people to see its true depth and pragmatic overtones. The essay introduces a large body of analytical works on G. V. Ivanov focusing on his similarities and differences with various writers, which often reveal controversies with their worldview and interpretations of creativity. For all the variety of works of this type, so far no one has paid attention to the interaction of G. V. Ivanov and L. N. Tolstoy. The second part of the essay proves that the poem "Kak vy kogda-to razborchivy byli..." (How picky once you were...) contains at least six direct textual and structural links with the story by L. N. Tolstoy "After the Ball" and his model of world outlook. These connections capture the complex nature of ambivalent assessment of Tolstoy's position, associated with common stereotyping behavior of the nobility. As the semantic analysis reveals, the lyrical hero of G. V. Ivanov is not only in conceptual relationship with the character of L. N. Tolstoy, but he declares similar stereotypes, characterized by axiological similarity and a single archaic coordinate system.

TI  - Synergistic Use of Multispectral Data and Crop Growth Modelling for Spatial and Temporal Evapotranspiration Estimations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this research is to explore the analysis of methods allowing a synergetic use of information exchange between Earth Observation (EO) data and growth models in order to provide high spatial and temporal resolution actual evapotranspiration predictions. An assimilation method based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter algorithm allows for combining Sentinel-2 data with a new version of Simple Algorithm For Yield (SAFY_swb) that considers the effect of the water balance on yield and estimates the daily trend of evapotranspiration (ET). Our study is relevant in the context of demonstrating the effectiveness and necessity of satellite missions such as Land Surface Temperature Monitoring (LSTM), to provide high spatial and temporal resolution data for agriculture. The proposed method addresses the problem both from a spatial point of view, providing maps of the areas of interest of the main biophysical quantities of vegetation (LAI, biomass, yield and actual Evapotranspiration), and from a temporal point of view, providing a simulation on a daily basis of the aforementioned variables. The assimilation efficiency was initially evaluated with a synthetic, large and heterogeneous dataset, reaching values of 70% even for high measurement errors of the assimilated variable. Subsequently, the method was tested in a case study in central Italy, allowing estimates of the daily Actual Evapotranspiration with a relative RMSE of 18%. The novelty of this research is in proposing a solution that partially solves the main problems related to the synergistic use of EO data with crop growth models, such as the difficult calibration of initial parameters, the lack of frequent high-resolution data or the high computational cost of data assimilation methods. It opens the way to future developments, such as the use of simultaneous assimilation of multiple variables, to deeper investigations using more specific datasets and exploiting the advanced tools.

TI  - Area burned adjustments to historical wildland fires in Canada
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Prior to delineation of fire perimeters from airborne and satellite imagery, fire management agencies in Canada employed conventional methods to map area burned based on sketch mapping, digitization from a global positioning system unit, and point buffering from geographic coordinates. These techniques usually provide a less precise representation of a wildland fire's size and shape than those derived from image data. The aim of this study is to assess the discrepancy in fire size from these techniques that contribute to uncertainty in area burned. We paired independently generated fire perimeters derived from Landsat satellite imagery with conventional perimeters (n = 2792; mean area difference per fire = 40.1%), and developed a set of prediction models to estimate a Landsat area burned from conventional perimeters by considering the mapping source, method, agency, and time period. A two-fold cross validation predicting the logarithm of area burned from the models, indicated an R (2) = 0.95 (MAE = 0.10 ha; RMSE = 0.19 ha). From this, we created an adjusted area burned time series from 1950 to 2018 using the model-predicted estimates from conventional perimeters (75% of agency-reported area) in combination with unchanged estimates from agency perimeters derived from airborne and satellite imagery (13% of fires). The predicted estimates reduced the size of individual fires over 2000 ha on average in some years, contributing to an annual average reduction of approximately 11% of the area burned reported in the national agency fire database. By retrospectively applying a robust statistical adjustment to the fire size data, the historical overestimation in annual area burned-up to 1.4 Mha in a single year-could be substantially minimized.

TI  - Investigating regional variation of respiratory infections in a general practice syndromic surveillance system
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Established surveillance systems can follow trends in community disease and illness over many years. However, within England there are known regional differences in healthcare utilisation, which can affect interpretation of trends. Here, we explore regional differences for a range of respiratory conditions using general practitioner (GP) consultation data.Methods Daily data for respiratory conditions were extracted from a national GP surveillance system. Average daily GP consultation rates per 100 000 registered patient population were calculated by each region of England and for each study year (2013-17). Consultation rates and incidence rate ratios were also calculated for each condition by deprivation quintile and by rural, urban, and conurbation groups.Results Upper and lower respiratory tract infections and asthma were higher in the North and the Midlands than in London and the South, were highest in the most deprived groups and tended to be higher in more urban areas. Influenza-like illness was highest in the least deprived and rural areas.Conclusions There are consistent differences in GP consultation rates across the English regions. This work has improved our understanding and interpretation of GP surveillance data at regional level and will guide more accurate public health messages.

TI  - High Prevalence of Methicillin-Resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> among Healthcare Facilities and Its Related Factors in Myanmar (2018-2019)
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global health problem. Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a common bacterium associated with a variety of community and hospital infections. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounts for most SA related morbidity and mortality. In this study, we determined the prevalence and factors associated with SA and MRSA in Myanmar. Methods: We collected the data retrospectively by reviewing an electronic register containing the results of bacterial culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing of biological specimens received from healthcare facilities during 2018-2019. Results: Of the 37,798 biological specimens with bacterial culture growth, 22% (8244) were Gram-positive. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, 42% (2801) were SA, of which 48% (1331) were judged as MRSA by phenotypic methods. The prevalence of MRSA was higher in the older age groups, in female patients, in urine specimens and specimens received from the intensive care unit and dermatology departments. One site (Site F) had the highest MRSA prevalence of the seven AMR sentinel sites. Most SA isolates were sensitive to vancomycin (90%) by phenotypic methods. Conclusions: The high prevalence of MRSA indicates a major public health threat. There is an urgent need to strengthen the AMR surveillance and hospital infection control program in Myanmar.

TI  - Patterns, Trends and Drivers of Water Transparency in Sri Lanka Using Landsat 8 Observations and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Addressing inland water transparency and driver effects to ensure the sustainability and provision of good quality water in Sri Lanka has been a timely prerequisite, especially under the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 agenda. Natural and anthropogenic changes lead to significant variations in water quality in the country. Therefore, an urgent need has emerged to understand the variability, spatiotemporal patterns, changing trends and impact of drivers on transparency, which are unclear to date. This study used all available Landsat 8 images from 2013 to 2020 and a quasi-analytical approach to assess the spatiotemporal Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) variability of 550 reservoirs and its relationship with natural (precipitation, wind and temperature) and anthropogenic (human activity and population density) drivers. Z(SD) varied from 9.68 cm to 199.47 with an average of 64.71 cm and 93% of reservoirs had transparency below 100 cm. Overall, slightly increasing trends were shown in the annual mean Z(SD). Notable intra-annual variations were also indicating the highest and lowest Z(SD) during the north-east monsoon and south-west monsoon, respectively. The highest Z(SD) was found in wet zone reservoirs, while dry zone showed the least. All of the drivers were significantly affecting the water transparency in the entire island. The combined impact of natural factors on Z(SD) changes was more significant (77.70%) than anthropogenic variables, whereas, specifically, human activity accounted for the highest variability across all climatic zones. The findings of this study provide the first comprehensive estimation of the Z(SD) of entire reservoirs and driver contribution and also provides essential information for future sustainable water management and conservation strategies.

TI  - Study on the domain selective inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by food-derived tyrosine-containing dipeptides
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD BIOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, the selective inhibition of several tyrosine-containing dipeptides on N and C domain of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) was studied, and the interaction mode of ACE and inhibitors was simulated by molecular docking. MTT assay was used to detect the effect of dipeptide on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The results showed that the food-derived dipeptides AY (Ala-Tyr), LY (Leu-Tyr), and IY (Ile-Tyr) containing tyrosine at the C-terminal were favorable structures for selective inhibition of ACE C-domain. These dipeptides showed competitive and mixed inhibition patterns, while the dipeptides EY (Glu-Tyr), RY (Arg-Tyr), FY (Phe-Tyr), and SY (Ser-Tyr) showed noncompetitive inhibition. Food-derived dipeptides containing tyrosine have no cytotoxicity on HUVEC cells, which provides a basis for the application of food-derived tyrosine dipeptides as antihypertensive peptides. This study provides a theoretical basis for exploring the selective inhibition mechanism of ACE inhibitory peptides containing tyrosine residue.Practical applicationsAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a two-domain dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, which is a key enzyme to regulate blood pressure. ACE has two active sites, C- and N-domain, which have high catalytic activity. Although the amino acid sequences of the two active sites have 60% similarity, there are some differences in structure and function. The action mechanism of ACE domain should be clarified, and the structure-activity relationship between inhibitors and ACE domain has not been systematically studied. The aim of this study was to identify the selective inhibitory effect of food-derived tyrosine dipeptides on the domain of ACE. This provides a new idea for finding new antihypertensive drugs with less side effects.

TI  - Efficacy of sentinel lymph node biopsy with radioisotope alone and the prediction of sentinel node status using PET-CT in breast cancer.
T2  - Korean journal of clinical oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Purpose: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) using both a radioactive isotope (RI) and blue dye is considered highly effective; however, there were limitations with the use of both agents in some hospitals, and blue dye has been shown to have some adverse effects. Additionally, preoperative prediction of sentinel lymph node (SLN) status using the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) can help avoid unnecessary axillary dissection or SLNB. Thus, we evaluated the efficacy and oncologic safety of SLNB using an RI alone in terms of long-term outcomes and determined the association between SLN metastasis and SUVmax of the primary tumor.Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at Konyang University Hospital between March 2011 and May 2018. Overall, 142 patients with breast cancer who underwent SLNB using an RI alone were enrolled. Data on identification and false-negative rates were collected. The SUVmax of primary tumors on PET-CT were analyzed for their association with SLN metastasis.Results: The identification and false-negative rates were 98.6% and 0%, respectively. There was no axillary local recurrence in patients with negative SLN findings. The correlation between the SUVmax of the primary tumor and SLN status was significant (r=0.249, P=0.005); the cutoff value for negative SLN metastasis was <2.15.Conclusion: The single agent method using an RI is not inferior to other methods and serves as a feasible option for SLNB. And the number of excised SLNs could be minimized when the SUVmax of primary tumor is extremely low.

TI  - An evaluation of Landsat, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 and MODIS data for crop type mapping
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Generating crop type maps using satellite remote sensing requires robust data acquisition at both high spatial and temporal resolutions to resolve rapid phenological transition at the field scale. The increasing availability of freely-available, moderate-resolution satellite data such as the Landsat and Sentinel series of satellites offers an unprecedent opportunity for large-area crop type mapping. In this study, we evaluated the utility of Landsat (7&8), Sentinel-2 (A&B), Sentinel-1 (A&B) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for mapping corn and soybean in the United States. We designed a series of classification experiments using these satellite data over a nationally distributed sample as input and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer (CDL) as reference for training and accuracy assessment. A set of tests were performed with data from each satellite senor as input to derive the potential accuracy achievable by the satellite/ sensor. In comparison, another set of tests were conducted with all data from all sensors as input to derive the combined accuracy as well as to evaluate the utility of each sensor, spectral band and acquisition date. Results showed that data from one satellite/sensor, either Landsat, Sentinel-2 or Sentinel-1, could achieve 94.8-96.8% accuracy, whereas the coarse-resolution MODIS produced about 92% accuracy, for both corn and soybean. Combing data from all sensors marginally improved the accuracy to 97.0% for both crops. Based on the criterion of deviation reduction in decision tree models, Landsat was identified as the most useful satellite/sensor for soybean classification, especially the two short-wave infrared bands, whereas Sentinel-2 was recognized as the most valuable satellite/sensor for corn classification, especially the red edge, near infrared and short-wave infrared bands. Optical data were always chosen over Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data by the pixel-based supervised classification algorithm except in some persistently cloudy regions, although using SAR data alone can also achieve very high accuracy. The virtual constellation of Landsat and Sentinel-2 increased data revisit frequency to 4-7 days in the U.S. during June to September 2017. However, cloud and shadow reduced clear-view observations by half. Satellite data acquisitions in July were most critical for mapping corn whereas data in July and August were most important for mapping soybean. Our analysis suggested that, without the practical limitation of training data, current freely-available, moderate-resolution satellite data including Landsat, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 and MODIS, can achieve a potential accuracy of over 95% for national-scale crop type mapping over large industrial agricultural regions such as the United States. Expanding the spatial coverage and maintaining consistent acquisitions of Sentinel-1 data is a high priority to enable operational crop mapping and monitoring over large areas.

TI  - Assessment of Polymer Atmospheric Correction Algorithm for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Imagery over Coastal Waters
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne imaging spectroscopy, also called hyperspectral remote sensing, has shown huge potential to improve current water colour retrievals and, thereby, the monitoring of inland and coastal water ecosystems. However, the quality of water colour retrievals strongly depends on successful removal of the atmospheric/surface contributions to the radiance measured by satellite sensors. Atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms are specially designed to handle these effects, but are challenged by the hundreds of narrow spectral bands obtained by hyperspectral sensors. In this paper, we investigate the performance of Polymer AC for hyperspectral remote sensing over coastal waters. Polymer is, in nature, a hyperspectral algorithm that has been mostly applied to multispectral satellite data to date. Polymer was applied to data from the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO), validated against in situ multispectral (AERONET-OC) and hyperspectral radiometric measurements, and its performance was compared against that of the hyperspectral version of NASA's standard AC algorithm, L2gen. The match-up analysis demonstrated very good performance of Polymer in the green spectral region. The mean absolute percentage difference across all the visible bands varied between 16% (green spectral region) and 66% (red spectral region). Compared with L2gen, Polymer remote sensing reflectances presented lower uncertainties, greater data coverage, and higher spectral similarity to in situ measurements. These results demonstrate the potential of Polymer to perform AC on hyperspectral satellite data over coastal waters, thus supporting its application in current and future hyperspectral satellite missions.

TI  - Promotion of the Development of Sentinel Species in the Water Column: Example Using Body Size and Fecundity of the Egg-Bearing Calanoid Copepod <i>Eurytemora affinis</i>
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of sentinel species in aquatic ecosystems is mostly based on benthic organisms; however, organisms living in water column such as zooplankton have received less attention, except for some cladocerans. In this paper, a new ecological indicator based on simple measurements of the size and fecundity of egg-bearing calanoid copepods is developed. The well-studied estuarine copepod Eurytemora affinis is used to illustrate this new framework. A large database obtained from laboratory experiments developed under different conditions is used to define a reference regression line between clutch size (CS) and prosome length (PL). The same database allowed one to confirm that the coefficient of variation (CV) of CS is an adequate estimator of the accumulated stress at population level. The CV of PL shows very little variability in all experimental and field conditions. The values of CS and PL obtained from the Seine, Loire, Gironde, Scheldt and Elbe estuaries in Europe are compared to the reference regression line. A quality index (QI) is calculated as a percentage of difference between the observed and the predicted CS. The QI classified 19 samples collected in the Seine estuary between 2004 and 2010 into four classes according to the physiological condition of the copepod female. A single sampling from June 2004 (5.26%) showed a very good condition, whereas 57.9% of the sampling dates confirmed good conditions. On the other hand, four sampling dates were associated to very bad conditions and three sampling dates indicated bad conditions. Seven additional samples obtained from other European estuaries between 2006 and 2009 were also used. Females showing poor conditions were observed in the early spring of 2005 and 2008 as well as during the month of November. These years were characterized by very strong climatic anomalies with a very cold late winter in 2005 and a warm winter in 2008. Therefore, it seems that the QI perfectly reflected the strong stress caused by the sudden change in hydro-climatic conditions that have certainly affected the physiology of copepod females and probably the availability of food. The new indicator is very simple to calculate and can be generalised to several aquatic ecosystems (fresh water and brackish water) by targeting the dominating egg-bearing calanoid copepods. As in the case of E. affinis, the development of sentinel species based on copepods or cladocerans can enrich ecological and ecotoxicological studies given their capacity to integrate the variability of their habitats' quality at the individual and population levels.

AB  - Remote sensing and satellite imagery have become commonplace in efforts to monitor and model various biological and physical characteristics of the Earth. The land/water interface is a continually evolving landscape of high scientific and societal interest, making the mapping and monitoring thereof particularly important. This paper aims at describing a new automated method of shoreline position detection through the utilization of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images derived from European Space Agency satellites, specifically the operational SENTINEL Series. The resultant delineated shorelines are validated against those derived from video monitoring systems and in situ monitoring; a mean distance of 1 and a maximum of 3.5 pixels is found.

TI  - Comparison and Ground Truthing of Different Remote and Proximal Sensing Platforms to Characterize Variability in a Hedgerow-Trained Vineyard
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Appropriate characterization of intra-parcel variability is a key element for the effective application of precision farming techniques. Nowadays there are many platforms available to end users differing for pixel spatial resolution and the type of acquisition (remote or proximal). A challenging aspect pertaining to remote sensing image acquisition in the vineyard ecosystem is that, in a large majority of cases, vegetation is discontinuous and single rows alternate with strips of either bare or grassed soil. In this paper, four different satellite platforms (Sentinel-2, Spot-6, Pleiades, and WorldView-3) having different spatial resolution and MECS-VINE(R) proximity sensor were compared in terms of accuracy at describing spatial variability. Vineyard mapping was coupled with detailed ground truthing of growth, yield, and grape composition variables. The analysis was conducted based on vigor indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index or Canopy Index) and using the Moran Index (MI) to assess the degree of spatial auto-correlation for the different variables. The results obtained showed a large degree of intra-plot variability in the main agronomic parameters (pruning weight CV: 33.86%, yield: 32.09%). The univariate Moran index showed a log-linear function relating MI coefficients to the resolution levels. Comparison between vigor indices and agronomic data showed that the highest bivariate MI was reached by Pleiades followed by MECS-VINE(R) which also did not exhibit the negative effect of the border pixel owing to the proximal scanning acquisition. Despite WorldView-3 ' s high resolution (1.24 m pixel) allowing very detailed data imaging, the comparison with ground-truth data was not encouraging, probably due to the presence of pure ground pixels, while Sentinel-2 was affected by the oversized pixel at 10 m.

TI  - Merkel Cell Carcinoma from Molecular Pathology to Novel Therapies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an uncommon and highly aggressive skin cancer. It develops mostly within chronically sun-exposed areas of the skin. MCPyV is detected in 60-80% of MCC cases as integrated within the genome and is considered a major risk factor for MCC. Viral negative MCCs have a high mutation burden with a UV damage signature. Aberrations occur in RB1, TP53, and NOTCH genes as well as in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. MCC is highly immunogenic, but MCC cells are known to evade the host's immune response. Despite the characteristic immunohistological profile of MCC, the diagnosis is challenging, and it should be confirmed by an experienced pathologist. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is considered the most reliable staging tool to identify subclinical nodal disease. Subclinical node metastases are present in about 30-50% of patients with primary MCC. The basis of MCC treatment is surgical excision. MCC is highly radiosensitive. It becomes chemoresistant within a few months. MCC is prone to recurrence. The outcomes in patients with metastatic disease are poor, with a historical 5-year survival of 13.5%. The median progression-free survival is 3-5 months, and the median overall survival is ten months. Currently, immunotherapy has become a standard of care first-line therapy for advanced MCC.

TI  - SAMIRA-SAtellite Based Monitoring Initiative for Regional Air Quality
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite based monitoring initiative for regional air quality (SAMIRA) initiative was set up to demonstrate the exploitation of existing satellite data for monitoring regional and urban scale air quality. The project was carried out between May 2016 and December 2019 and focused on aerosol optical depth (AOD), particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). SAMIRA was built around several research tasks: 1. The spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager (SEVIRI) AOD optimal estimation algorithm was improved and geographically extended from Poland to Romania, the Czech Republic and Southern Norway. A near real-time retrieval was implemented and is currently operational. Correlation coefficients of 0.61 and 0.62 were found between SEVIRI AOD and ground-based sun-photometer for Romania and Poland, respectively. 2. A retrieval for ground-level concentrations of PM2.5 was implemented using the SEVIRI AOD in combination with WRF-Chem output. For representative sites a correlation of 0.56 and 0.49 between satellite-based PM2.5 and in situ PM2.5 was found for Poland and the Czech Republic, respectively. 3. An operational algorithm for data fusion was extended to make use of various satellite-based air quality products (NO2, SO2, AOD, PM2.5 and PM10). For the Czech Republic inclusion of satellite data improved mapping of NO2 in rural areas and on an annual basis in urban background areas. It slightly improved mapping of rural and urban background SO2. The use of satellites based AOD or PM2.5 improved mapping results for PM2.5 and PM10. 4. A geostatistical downscaling algorithm for satellite-based air quality products was developed to bridge the gap towards urban-scale applications. Initial testing using synthetic data was followed by applying the algorithm to OMI NO2 data with a direct comparison against high-resolution TROPOMI NO2 as a reference, thus allowing for a quantitative assessment of the algorithm performance and demonstrating significant accuracy improvements after downscaling. We can conclude that SAMIRA demonstrated the added value of using satellite data for regional- and urban-scale air quality monitoring.

TI  - Spatial Patterns in Actual Evapotranspiration Climatologies for Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial patterns in long-term average evapotranspiration (ET) represent a unique source of information for evaluating the spatial pattern performance of distributed hydrological models on a river basin to continental scale. This kind of model evaluation is getting increased attention, acknowledging the shortcomings of traditional aggregated or timeseries-based evaluations. A variety of satellite remote sensing (RS)-based ET estimates exist, covering a range of methods and resolutions. There is, therefore, a need to evaluate these estimates, not only in terms of temporal performance and similarity, but also in terms of long-term spatial patterns. The current study evaluates four RS-ET estimates at moderate resolution with respect to spatial patterns in comparison to two alternative continental-scale gridded ET estimates (water-balance ET and Budyko). To increase comparability, an empirical correction factor between clear sky and all-weather ET, based on eddy covariance data, is derived, which could be suitable for simple corrections of clear sky estimates. Three RS-ET estimates (MODIS16, TSEB and PT-JPL) and the Budyko method generally display similar spatial patterns both across the European domain (mean SPAEF = 0.41, range 0.25-0.61) and within river basins (mean SPAEF range 0.19-0.38), although the pattern similarity within river basins varies significantly across basins. In contrast, the WB-ET and PML_V2 produced very different spatial patterns. The similarity between different methods ranging over different combinations of water, energy, vegetation and land surface temperature constraints suggests that robust spatial patterns of ET can be achieved by combining several methods.

TI  - Envisioning a sustainable future for water
T2  - AQUA-WATER INFRASTRUCTURE ECOSYSTEMS AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The water sector has a major leadership role to play in addressing the global water crisis. How can it make the radical shifts in approach that are needed? This paper highlights the reality that the management of water, and the ways in which water flows are directed, reflects social relations of power, not just between human groups, but also between humankind and the non-human world. Drawing on in-depth ethnographic research with indigenous communities and other water users in river catchments around the world, it considers alternate cultural worldviews that encourage more sustainable beliefs and practices, and asks how larger societies might make imaginative use of these in contemporary and future engagements with water. In a thought experiment intended to reposition human-non-human relations, it proposes a concept of 're-imagined communities' advocating more collaborative forms of conviviality - living together - with other species. Opening the door to ideas about pan-species democracy, it calls for decision-making processes in which a wide range of expertise is brought together to exchange knowledge, with an explicit and practical remit to 'speak for' and promote the needs and interests of the non-human inhabitants of the ecosystems on which all living kinds depend.

TI  - Retrieving Corn Canopy Leaf Area Index Based on Sentinel-2 Image and PROSAIL Model Parameter Calibration
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is related to photosynthesis, transpiration and biomass accumulating processes of vegetation closely. It is one of the important parameters of corn growth monitoring, disaster stress monitoring and yield prediction, as well as an important parameter of the radiative transfer model and crop growth model. Sentinel-2satelliteis the second satellite of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) plan. It has high spatial and temporal resolution, and visible and near-infrared bands resolution is 10 m, so sentinel-2 satellite is an ideal data source for agricultural remote sensing applications. The PROSAIL radiative transfer model is an effective way to retrievecorn canopy LAI using remote sensing images. However, there are some problems for LAI retrieval currently, including uncertainty of model inputs, difficulty in parameter adjustment, ill-posed inversion and low speed etc. Model inputs calibration can be used to acquire the exact value of model inputs in the uncertainty range of the observed reflectivity. Rich and accurate parameter information is provided to reduce the errors in parameter retrieval. In this paper, a sentinel-2A satellite image was used as the data source, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was used to calibrate model inputs. The spectral reflectance uncertainty of 5% was added to obtain the posterior value probability distribution of each parameter, to optimize the parameter setting in the retrieval process and improve the accuracy of LAI retrieval. The results showed that: (1) The sensitive model inputs of the PROSAIL model were LAI, chlorophyll content of leaves and leaf structure coefficient within visible and near-infrared bands. Taking these three parameters as variables in the look-up table could effectively retrieve LAI, and the determination coefficient of retrieval accuracy reached 0. 7. (2) MCMC method could be used to calibrate the PROSAIL model input and acquire each model input distribution in the study area. The posterior parameter distribution was close to the actual situation, indicating the feasibility and effectiveness of using the MCMC method for parameter calibration. (3) Input calibration could effectively improve the LAI retrieving accuracy, especially in reducing retrieval deviation and outliers. After inputs calibration, the average error of LAI retrieval decreased from 20% to 8%, while the estimation accuracy increased from 76% to 90%. These results showed that the model inputs calibration of the PROSAIL model by MCMC could improve the LAI retrieval accuracy and reduce the retrieval deviation. It provided a reference for improving the retrieval accuracy of crop canopy parameters by the PROSAIL radiative transfer model.

TI  - Multidrug-Resistant Phenotypes of <i>Escherichia coli</i> Isolates in Wild Canarian Egyptian Vultures (<i>Neophron percnopterus majorensis</i>)
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Increasing antimicrobial resistance is a global problem for both human and animal health. Escherichia coli is frequently used as a "sentinel" for antimicrobial resistance and as an indicator of faecal contamination of the environment. This study is a characterisation of the antimicrobial resistance phenotypes of E. coli isolates obtained from cloacal samples of Canarian Egyptian vultures. A total of 65 chickens and 38 adult and immature birds were studied. Antimicrobial susceptibility to 16 antibiotics of 12 different categories was determined in 103 E. coli isolates. We found a 39.8% prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli. Almost all MDR phenotypes found included resistance to tetracycline, an antibiotic widely used in veterinary medicine. Resistance has also been found to chloramphenicol (13 MDR phenotypes), imipenem (5 MDR phenotypes) and others. Wild birds can act as reservoirs and disseminators of MDR E. coli, transferring them via faeces to the environment, feed or water. Our results highlight the need to minimise exposure of wild birds to antimicrobials from human activities to avoid the spread of antimicrobial resistance. The presence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli in cloacal samples from Canarian Egyptian vultures was investigated. Samples were obtained from chicks (n = 65) and from adults and immature birds (n = 38). Antimicrobial susceptibility to 16 antibiotics included in 12 different categories was determined for 103 E. coli isolates. MDR was defined as acquired non-susceptibility to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories. Forty-seven different resistance phenotypes were detected: 31 MDR (41 isolates) and 16 non-MDR (62 isolates). One isolate was resistant to all 12 antimicrobial categories and 2 phenotypes included resistance to 9 antimicrobial categories. Imipenem resistance was included in five MDR phenotypes, corresponding to five different isolates. Statistically significant differences in prevalence of MDR-phenotypes were found between chicks in nests and the rest of the animals, probably due to the shorter exposure time of chicks to antimicrobials. The main risk derived from MDR bacteria in scavengers is that it threatens the treatment of wild animals in rescue centres and could be transferred to other animals in the facilities. In addition to this, it could pose a health risk to veterinarians or other staff involved in wildlife protection programmes.

T2  - BULLETIN OF THE LEBEDEV PHYSICS INSTITUTE
M3  - Article
AB  - By the example of two events of 2016, changes in the interplanetary scintillation level during corotating solar wind disturbances causing geomagnetic storms are analyzed. It is shown that night scintillations are attenuated before dense disturbance part arrival at the Earth, which is followed by a significant increase during the magnetic storm and a day after it. For interplanetary scintillations in the morning sector, such changes are absent: the scintillation level remains approximately constant. A comparison with the WIND satellite data shows that changes in night scintillations and the average plasma concentration near the Earth's orbit occur qualitatively in a similar way.

TI  - Using Landsat 8 OLI data to differentiate Sargassum and <i>Ulva prolifera</i> blooms in the South Yellow Sea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel remote sensing algorithm was developed based on Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data to separately recognize concurrent Sargassum and Ulva prolifera in the South Yellow Sea. This algorithm has three main steps: 1) classification of macroalgae-containing pixels from normal seawater pixels by means of a mature floating algae index (FAI) approach; 2) first-round separate recognition of the Sargassum and Ulva prolifera targets using a newly developed "Sargassum and Ulva prolifera Index I (SUI-I)" method; and 3) further fine identification of the algae by applying another new index (SUI-II) to the above output. The validation of our developed algorithm generated high and satisfactory predictive accuracies. The present study concludes that the Landsat 8 OLI data have great potential for detecting and distinguishing the mixed growth of Sargassum and Ulva prolifera, which will help in closely monitoring macroalgae blooms in oceanic waters.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Radar Composite Reflectivity Factor Estimations from Fengyun-4A Geostationary Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground-based weather radar data plays an essential role in monitoring severe convective weather. The detection of such weather systems in time is critical for saving people's lives and property. However, the limited spatial coverage of radars over the ocean and mountainous regions greatly limits their effective application. In this study, we propose a novel framework of a deep learning-based model to retrieve the radar composite reflectivity factor (RCRF) maps from the Fengyun-4A new-generation geostationary satellite data. The suggested framework consists of three main processes, i.e., satellite and radar data preprocessing, the deep learning-based regression model for retrieving the RCRF maps, as well as the testing and validation of the model. In addition, three typical cases are also analyzed and studied, including a cluster of rapidly developing convective cells, a Northeast China cold vortex, and the Super Typhoon Haishen. Compared with the high-quality precipitation rate products from the integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement, it is found that the retrieved RCRF maps are in good agreement with the precipitation pattern. The statistical results show that retrieved RCRF maps have an R-square of 0.88-0.96, a mean absolute error of 0.3-0.6 dBZ, and a root-mean-square error of 1.2-2.4 dBZ.

TI  - Improved Lunar Irradiance Model Using Multiyear MODIS Lunar Observations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on board the Terra and Aqua spacecrafts were launched on December 18, 1999, and May 4, 2002, respectively. One of the features of the MODIS instruments is the ability to perform observations of the lunar surface from its space view (SV) port. This event is scheduled approximately once a month via a spacecraft roll maneuver, which enables the lunar phase to be confined to within 1 degrees for each instrument. The Moon is considered to be an extremely stable reference to monitor the long-term radiometric stability of the reflective solar bands (RSB). Each MODIS instrument can also view the Moon for about four months in a year without a roll maneuver. This is caused by the intrusion of the Moon in the SV. The lunar phase angles of these unscheduled lunar observations are distributed over a wide range varying from approximately 50 degrees to 80 degrees for Terra MODIS and from about -80 degrees to -50 degrees for Aqua MODIS, where the positive phase angle refers to a waning Moon, while the negative phase angle corresponds to a waxing Moon. Together, the scheduled and unscheduled lunar observations are used to monitor the long-term radiometric stability of the RSB. Of the several challenges involved in the modeling of the lunar optical properties, such as its absolute brightness, a number of optical and view geometry effects need to be considered. These effects are much easier to characterize for the scheduled observations due to confinement of the lunar phase angles compared to those for the unscheduled intrusions of the Moon in the SV. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to remove the view geometry effect in the calibration coefficients derived from the scheduled lunar observations and even more challenging for the unscheduled lunar intrusions. In this work, the lunar absolute irradiance is modeled using known attributes and from the lunar observations by the two MODIS instruments from the time period between the years 2005 and 2012. The model developed here attempts to mitigate for the deficiencies in the lunar irradiance measurements by the RObotic Lunar Observatory (ROLO) model, developed by the United States Geological Survey. Overall, the relative uncertainty of the ROLO model for MODIS calibration has been assessed to be about 4% for the shortest wavelength (a center wavelength of 412 nm) in the phase angle range mentioned above. With our new established lunar model, the calibration coefficients derived from the lunar observations, especially those from the unscheduled lunar observations, for the RSB of the two MODIS instruments are significantly improved for the entire mission. A good agreement is observed between the calibration coefficients derived from the scheduled and unscheduled lunar observations. Both the absolute uncertainty of the new lunar irradiance model and its relative uncertainty due to view geometry variation are much smaller than those of the current ROLO model which has been widely used for most remote sensors' lunar calibrations. Our newly developed lunar irradiance model can be applied to other remote sensors for their lunar calibrations as well. Finally, the significant improvement in the measurement of the lunar irradiance led to a polarization effect in the Moon response for MODIS to be identified. In this article, the impact of the polarization of the moonlight for the MODIS RSB is quantified.This is extremely vital as polarization effect for remote sensors such as MODIS and the follow-on suite of the Joint Polar Satellite System Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite has been found to significantly increase the calibration uncertainty, especially at short wavelengths.

T2  - Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The long-term series of geographic data and remote sensing data contain noise and perio-dic fluctuation. We used the improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) to decompose the data of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), precipitation, and temperature from 1982 to 2015 on per-pixels in the Loess Pla-teau to obtain residuals. Using the residual with less noise and periodic fluctuations, we examined the changes of NDVI and the relationship between NDVI and climatic factors. The results showed that the spatial change trend of NDVI was mainly increasing from 1982 to 2015 in the Loess Plateau. The significance of the change trend of residual NDVI (95.9%) was greater than the original NDVI (72.3%), with spatial variations. Temperature and precipitation could largely explain the changes in vegetation coverage. The proportions of areas with extremely significant positive and negative correlations between temperature and NDVI on the Loess Plateau were 83.7% and 13.9%, respectively, while that between precipitation and NDVI were 54.4% and 37.2%, respectively. There were obvious spatial variations in the responses of vegetation to climate change on the Loess Plateau. Different climatic factors had different effects on different types of vegetation. In general, temperature had stronger correlation with different vegetation than precipitation. Therefore, temperature was the main driving factor for the changes of vegetation cover in the Loess Plateau.

TI  - Climate Variability May Delay Post-Fire Recovery of Boreal Forest in Southern Siberia, Russia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Prolonged dry periods and increased temperatures that result from anthropogenic climate change have been shown to increase the frequency and severity of wildfires in the boreal region. There is growing evidence that such changes in fire regime can reduce forest resilience and drive shifts in post-fire plant successional trajectories. The response of post-fire vegetation communities to climate variability is under-studied, despite being a critical phase determining the ultimate successional conclusion. This study investigated the responses of post-fire recruited species to climate change and inter-annual variability at 16 study sites that experienced high-severity fire events, mostly in early 2000, within the Scots pine forest-steppe zone of southeastern Siberia, Russia. These sites were originally dominated by Scots pine, and by 2018, they were recruited by different successional species. Additionally, three mature Scots pine stands were included for comparison. A Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) approach was used to model the relationship between Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series, temperature and precipitation in the 15 years after a stand-replacing fire. Using the resulting BART models, together with six projected climate scenarios with increased temperature and enhanced inner-annual precipitation variability, we simulated NDVI at 5-year intervals for 15 years post-fire. Our results show that the BART models performed well, with in-sample Pseudo-R-2 varying from 0.49 to 0.95 for fire-disturbed sites. Increased temperature enhanced greenness across all sites and across all three time periods since fires, exhibiting a positive feedback in a warming environment. Repeatedly dry spring periods reduced NDVI at all the sites and wetter summer periods following such dry springs could not compensate for this, indicating that a prolonged dry spring has a strong impact consistently over the entire early developmental stages from the initial 5 years to 15 years post-fire. Further, young forests showed higher climate sensitivity compared to the mature forest, irrespective of species and projected climatic conditions. Our findings suggest that a dry spring not only increases fire risk, but also delays recovery of boreal forests in southern Siberia. It also highlights the importance of changing rainfall seasonality as well as total rainfall in a changing climate for post-fire recovery of forest.

TI  - New Gridded Product for the Total Columnar Atmospheric Water Vapor over Ocean Surface Constructed from Microwave Radiometer Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the optimal interpolation (OI) algorithm, a daily fusion product of high-resolution global ocean columnar atmospheric water vapor with a resolution of 0.25 degrees was generated in this study from multisource remote sensing observations. The product covers the period from 2003 to 2018, and the data represent a fusion of microwave radiometer observations, including those from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS), WindSat, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System sensor (AMSR-E), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), and HY-2A microwave radiometer (MR). The accuracy of this water vapor fusion product was validated using radiosonde water vapor observations. The comparative results show that the overall mean deviation (Bias) is smaller than 0.6 mm; the root mean square error (RMSE) and standard deviation (SD) are better than 3 mm, and the mean absolute deviation (MAD) and correlation coefficient (R) are better than 2 mm and 0.98, respectively.

TI  - Midwest US Croplands Determine Model Divergence in North American Carbon Fluxes
T2  - AGU ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Large uncertainties in North American terrestrial carbon fluxes hinder regional climate projections. Terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), the essential tools for understanding continental-scale carbon cycle, diverge on whether temperate forests or croplands dominate carbon uptake in North America. Evidence from novel photosynthetic proxies, such as those based on chlorophyll fluorescence, has cast doubt on the "weak cropland, strong forest" carbon uptake patterns simulated by most TBMs. However, no systematic evaluation of TBMs has yet been attempted to pin down space-time patterns that are most consistent with regional CO2 observational constraints. Here, we leverage atmospheric CO2 observations and satellite-observed photosynthetic proxies to understand emergent space-time patterns in North American carbon fluxes from a large suite of TBMs and data-driven models. To do so, we evaluate how well the atmospheric signals resulting from carbon flux estimates reproduce the space-time variability in atmospheric CO2, as is observed by a network of continuous-monitoring towers over North America. Models with gross or net carbon fluxes that are consistent with the observed CO2 variability share a salient feature of growing-season carbon uptake in Midwest US croplands. Conversely, the remaining models place most growing-season uptake in boreal or temperate forests. Differences in model explanatory power depend mainly on the simulated annual cycles of cropland uptake-especially, the timing of peak uptake-rather than the distribution of annual mean fluxes across biomes. Our results suggest that improved model representation of cropland phenology is crucial to robust, policy-relevant estimation of North American carbon exchange.

TI  - Bioecology of coral reef in Panjang Island of Central Java Indonesia.
T2  - Ilmu Kelautan
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reefs currently are suffered from natural factors along with increasing anthropogenic activity. Panjang Island, a small reef island located in Jepara Regency, may also be experiencing such conditions. Therefore, this work was aimed to observe the condition of the coral cover of Panjang Island. Line intercept transect was applied to survey the coral cover and mortality index from fourteen stations. Insitu data consisted of the bottom substrate composition of the reefs and the physical parameters of the sea. The secondary data, i.e. coral reef area maps from 2001 to 2019 were taken from Landsat Image 7 and 8, data of wind were obtained from www.ogimet.com, while tidal data were collected from BMKG. The bathymetry was determined from the Geospatial Information Agency data, salinity global analysis forecast Phy 001.024 (CMEMS). Sea surface temperature (SST), and chlorophyll-a distribution were analyzed using ENVI software. The result showed that Panjang Island has a poor to the moderate condition of hard coral. Two out of six categories of abiotic and dead coral were found to be high. The mortality index of coral was in the high category (average 0.52). During research periods the sea waters were characterized by high sea surface temperature (29.34-30.94[degree]C), chlorophyll-a was also tended to be high (0-2.65 mg.m-3), and an average of salinity was high 32 [per mill]. The weak currents came to all sides of the island, therefore the coral reef was not exposed to extreme currents. The waves came from the east, then the energy decreases after being blocked by coral reefs on the eastern side of the island, so that coral reefs in the northeast and south sides were safer to be exposed. The results suggest that hydrodynamic ecology directly or indirectly affected the percentage of coral cover and mortality index at the reefs of Panjang Island.

TI  - A study of the relationship between fire hazard and burn severity in Grand Teton National Park, USA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire hazard maps are a useful tool which help land managers with wildfire mitigation planning. These maps are used for predicting the likelihood of fire ignition, fire behavior and effects, and can be generated using different techniques. However, the relationship between fire hazard and the resulting burn severity has not been fully explored. This paper presents a new method for assessing fire hazard and examines the relationship between fire hazard and burn severity. The 2016 Berry Fire in Grand Teton National Park is used as a case study for this examination. Fire hazard was calculated using a multicriteria evaluation based on fuel type, canopy cover, moisture conditions, topography, and infrastructure. Additionally, several previously proposed fire hazard indices were generated for comparison. All fire hazard indices were compared to the burn severities for the Berry Fire to determine if a relationship existed between fire hazard and burn severity. The proposed model exhibited a moderate relationship with two of the tested burn severity categories (unburned and moderate to high) and a weak relationship with the other categories (low, moderate, high). The other fire hazard indices exhibited very weak relationships with burn severity and in some instances the relationship was the inverse of what was expected.

TI  - Detecting peat extraction related activity with multi-temporal Sentinel-1 InSAR coherence time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of when, where and in which quantity peat is harvested is currently based on manual declarations. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a powerful tool for change detection and monitoring. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether Sentinel-1 6-day interferometric SAR (InSAR) temporal coherence could allow peat extraction monitoring from satellite. We demonstrate that temporal median coherence enables to detect harvest related surface altering works and therefore also spatially explicitly determine active and inactive extraction areas. A polygon-based multi-orbit time series approach is sufficient for the task. Hereby, vertical-vertical polarisation (VV) is more sensitive to the changes compared to vertical-horizontal (VH). During the main harvest season the peat extraction area has median VV coherence lower than 0.2 while the abandoned area and open bog which serve as reference for undisturbed extraction area have close to 0.6. Also, the potential for coherence based milled peat extraction intensity estimation is demonstrated and an indication is given how partially extracted areas could be distinguished from fully harvested and not harvest areas, by the use of coherence standard deviation. Regarding the influence of rainfall, only heavy rain on one of the acquisitions of the image pair whereas the other is from dry conditions seems to cause decorrelation comparable to surface altering works. Moreover, deploying images from multiple consecutive orbits or introducing backscatter intensity sigma(0) or reference polygons of undisturbed area helps to reduce risk for rain induced false positives. Developing an operational algorithm for peat extraction identification could be undertaken in future studies.

TI  - Super-Resolution Restoration of Spaceborne Ultra-High-Resolution Images Using the UCL OpTiGAN System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce a robust and light-weight multi-image super-resolution restoration (SRR) method and processing system, called OpTiGAN, using a combination of a multi-image maximum a posteriori approach and a deep learning approach. We show the advantages of using a combined two-stage SRR processing scheme for significantly reducing inference artefacts and improving effective resolution in comparison to other SRR techniques. We demonstrate the optimality of OpTiGAN for SRR of ultra-high-resolution satellite images and video frames from 31 cm/pixel WorldView-3, 75 cm/pixel Deimos-2 and 70 cm/pixel SkySat. Detailed qualitative and quantitative assessments are provided for the SRR results on a CEOS-WGCV-IVOS geo-calibration and validation site at Baotou, China, which features artificial permanent optical targets. Our measurements have shown a 3.69 times enhancement of effective resolution from 31 cm/pixel WorldView-3 imagery to 9 cm/pixel SRR.

TI  - Ultra-High-Resolution 1 m/pixel CaSSIS DTM Using Super-Resolution Restoration and Shape-from-Shading: Demonstration over Oxia Planum on Mars
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce a novel ultra-high-resolution Digital Terrain Model (DTM) processing system using a combination of photogrammetric 3D reconstruction, image co-registration, image super-resolution restoration, shape-from-shading DTM refinement, and 3D co-alignment methods. Technical details of the method are described, and results are demonstrated using a 4 m/pixel Trace Gas Orbiter Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System (CaSSIS) panchromatic image and an overlapping 6 m/pixel Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Context Camera (CTX) stereo pair to produce a 1 m/pixel CaSSIS Super-Resolution Restoration (SRR) DTM for different areas over Oxia Planum on Mars-the future ESA ExoMars 2022 Rosalind Franklin rover's landing site. Quantitative assessments are made using profile measurements and the counting of resolvable craters, in comparison with the publicly available 1 m/pixel High-Resolution Imaging Experiment (HiRISE) DTM. These assessments demonstrate that the final resultant 1 m/pixel CaSSIS DTM from the proposed processing system has achieved comparable and sometimes more detailed 3D reconstruction compared to the overlapping HiRISE DTM.

TI  - Quantitative Analysis of Forest Fires in Southeastern Australia Using SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Prescribed burning is a common strategy for minimizing forest fire risk. Fire is introduced under specific environmental conditions, with explicit duration, intensity, and rate of spread. Such conditions deviate from those encountered during the fire season. Prescribed burns mostly affect surface fuels and understory vegetation, an outcome markedly different when compared to wildfires. Data on prescribed burning are crucial for evaluating whether land management targets have been reached. This research developed a methodology to quantify the effects of prescribed burns using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery in the forests of southeastern Australia. C-band SAR datasets were specifically used to statistically explore changes in radar backscatter coefficients with the intensity of prescribed burns. Two modeling approaches based on pre- and post-fire ratios were applied for evaluating prescribed burn impacts. The effects of prescribed burns were documented with an overall accuracy of 82.3% using cross-polarized backscatter (VH) SAR data under dry conditions. The VV polarization indicated some potential to detect burned areas under wet conditions. The findings in this study indicate that the C-band SAR backscatter coefficient has the potential to evaluate the effectiveness of prescribed burns due to its sensitivity to changes in vegetation structure.

TI  - Characterization of the 2014 Indus River Flood Using Hydraulic Simulations and Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rivers play an essential role to humans and ecosystems, but they also burst their banks during floods, often causing extensive damage to crop, property, and loss of lives. This paper characterizes the 2014 flood of the Indus River in Pakistan using the US Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Centre River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model, integrated into a geographic information system (GIS) and satellite images from Landsat-8. The model is used to estimate the spatial extent of the flood and assess the damage that it caused by examining changes to the different land-use/land-cover (LULC) types of the river basin. Extreme flows for different return periods were estimated using a flood frequency analysis using a log-Pearson III distribution, which the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test identified as the best distribution to characterize the flow regime of the Indus River at Taunsa Barrage. The output of the flood frequency analysis was then incorporated into the HEC-RAS model to determine the spatial extent of the 2014 flood, with the accuracy of this modelling approach assessed using images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The results show that a supervised classification of the Landsat images was able to identify the LULC types of the study region with a high degree of accuracy, and that the most affected LULC was crop/agricultural land, of which 50% was affected by the 2014 flood. Finally, the hydraulic simulation of extent of the 2014 flood was found to visually compare very well with the MODIS image, and the surface area of floods of different return periods was calculated. This paper provides further evidence of the benefit of using a hydrological model and satellite images for flood mapping and for flood damage assessment to inform the development of risk mitigation strategies.

TI  - Advancing Floating Macroplastic Detection from Space Using Experimental Hyperspectral Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne and spaceborne remote sensing (RS) collecting hyperspectral imagery provides unprecedented opportunities for the detection and monitoring of floating riverine and marine plastic debris. However, a major challenge in the application of RS techniques is the lack of a fundamental understanding of spectral signatures of water-borne plastic debris. Recent work has emphasised the case for open-access hyperspectral reflectance reference libraries of commonly used polymer items. In this paper, we present and analyse a high-resolution hyperspectral image database of a unique mix of 40 virgin macroplastic items and vegetation. Our double camera setup covered the visible to shortwave infrared (VIS-SWIR) range from 400 to 1700 nm in a darkroom experiment with controlled illumination. The cameras scanned the samples floating in water and captured high-resolution images in 336 spectral bands. Using the resulting reflectance spectra of 1.89 million pixels in linear discriminant analyses (LDA), we determined the importance of each spectral band for discriminating between water and mixed floating debris, and vegetation and plastics. The absorption peaks of plastics (1215 nm, 1410 nm) and vegetation (710 nm, 1450 nm) are associated with high LDA weights. We then compared Sentinel-2 and Worldview-3 satellite bands with these outcomes and identified 12 satellite bands to overlap with important wavelengths for discrimination between the classes. Lastly, the Normalised Vegetation Difference Index (NDVI) and Floating Debris Index (FDI) were calculated to determine why they work, and how they could potentially be improved. These findings could be used to enhance existing efforts in monitoring macroplastic pollution, as well as form a baseline for the design of future multispectral RS systems.

TI  - Pixel- vs. Object-Based Landsat 8 Data Classification in Google Earth Engine Using Random Forest: The Case Study of Maiella National Park
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the general objective of producing a 2018-2020 Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) map of the Maiella National Park (central Italy), useful for a future long-term LULC change analysis, this research aimed to develop a Landsat 8 (L8) data composition and classification process using Google Earth Engine (GEE). In this process, we compared two pixel-based (PB) and two object-based (OB) approaches, assessing the advantages of integrating the textural information in the PB approach. Moreover, we tested the possibility of using the L8 panchromatic band to improve the segmentation step and the object's textural analysis of the OB approach and produce a 15-m resolution LULC map. After selecting the best time window of the year to compose the base data cube, we applied a cloud-filtering and a topography-correction process on the 32 available L8 surface reflectance images. On this basis, we calculated five spectral indices, some of them on an interannual basis, to account for vegetation seasonality. We added an elevation, an aspect, a slope layer, and the 2018 CORINE Land Cover classification layer to improve the available information. We applied the Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) algorithm to calculate the image's textural information and, in the OB approaches, the Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) algorithm for the image segmentation step. We performed an initial RF optimization process finding the optimal number of decision trees through out-of-bag error analysis. We randomly distributed 1200 ground truth points and used 70% to train the RF classifier and 30% for the validation phase. This subdivision was randomly and recursively redefined to evaluate the performance of the tested approaches more robustly. The OB approaches performed better than the PB ones when using the 15 m L8 panchromatic band, while the addition of textural information did not improve the PB approach. Using the panchromatic band within an OB approach, we produced a detailed, 15-m resolution LULC map of the study area.

TI  - Drivers of Organic Carbon Stocks in Different LULC History and along Soil Depth for a 30 Years Image Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are a remarkable property for soil and environmental monitoring. The understanding of their dynamics in crop soils must go forward. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of temporal environmental controlling factors obtained by satellite images over the SOC stocks along soil depth, using machine learning algorithms. The work was carried out in Sao Paulo state (Brazil) in an area of 2577 km(2). We obtained a dataset of boreholes with soil analyses from topsoil to subsoil (0-100 cm). Additionally, remote sensing covariates (30 years of land use history, vegetation indexes), soil properties (i.e., clay, sand, mineralogy), soil types (classification), geology, climate and relief information were used. All covariates were confronted with SOC stocks contents, to identify their impact. Afterwards, the abilities of the predictive models were tested by splitting soil samples into two random groups (70 for training and 30% for model testing). We observed that the mean values of SOC stocks decreased by increasing the depth in all land use and land cover (LULC) historical classes. The results indicated that the random forest with recursive features elimination (RFE) was an accurate technique for predicting SOC stocks and finding controlling factors. We also found that the soil properties (especially clay and CEC), terrain attributes, geology, bioclimatic parameters and land use history were the most critical factors in controlling the SOC stocks in all LULC history and soil depths. We concluded that random forest coupled with RFE could be a functional approach to detect, map and monitor SOC stocks using environmental and remote sensing data.

TI  - Fast Unsupervised Multi-Scale Characterization of Urban Landscapes Based on Earth Observation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most remote sensing studies of urban areas focus on a single scale, using supervised methodologies and very few analyses focus on the "neighborhood" scale. The lack of multi-scale analysis, together with the scarcity of training and validation datasets in many countries lead us to propose a single fast unsupervised method for the characterization of urban areas. With the FOTOTEX algorithm, this paper introduces a texture-based method to characterize urban areas at three nested scales: macro-scale (urban footprint), meso-scale ("neighbourhoods") and micro-scale (objects). FOTOTEX combines a Fast Fourier Transform and a Principal Component Analysis to convert texture into frequency signal. Several parameters were tested over Sentinel-2 and Pleiades imagery on Bouake and Brasilia. Results showed that a single Sentinel-2 image better assesses the urban footprint than the global products. Pleiades images allowed discriminating neighbourhoods and urban objects using texture, which is correlated with metrics such as building density, built-up and vegetation proportions. The best configurations for each scale of analysis were determined and recommendations provided to users. The open FOTOTEX algorithm demonstrated a strong potential to characterize the three nested scales of urban areas, especially when training and validation data are scarce, and computing resources limited.

TI  - Using the Landsat Burned Area Products to Derive Fire History Relevant for Fire Management and Conservation in the State of Florida, Southeastern USA
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of comprehensive spatially explicit fire occurrence data remains one of the most critical needs for fire managers globally, and especially for conservation across the southeastern United States. Not only are many endangered species and ecosystems in that region reliant on frequent fire, but fire risk analysis, prescribed fire planning, and fire behavior modeling are sensitive to fire history due to the long growing season and high vegetation productivity. Spatial data that map burned areas over time provide critical information for evaluating management successes. However, existing fire data have undocumented shortcomings that limit their use when detailing the effectiveness of fire management at state and regional scales. Here, we assessed information in existing fire datasets for Florida and the Landsat Burned Area products based on input from the fire management community. We considered the potential of different datasets to track the spatial extents of fires and derive fire history metrics (e.g., time since last burn, fire frequency, and seasonality). We found that burned areas generated by applying a 90% threshold to the Landsat burn probability product matched patterns recorded and observed by fire managers at three pilot areas. We then created fire history metrics for the entire state from the modified Landsat Burned Area product. Finally, to show their potential application for conservation management, we compared fire history metrics across ownerships for natural pinelands, where prescribed fire is frequently applied. Implications of this effort include increased awareness around conservation and fire management planning efforts and an extension of derivative products regionally or globally.

TI  - Eclectic Approaches to Analyze Recreational Cruise Sustainability
T2  - JOURNAL OF PARK AND RECREATION ADMINISTRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This research note highlights eclectic approaches to analyze recreational cruise sustainability. Whilst recreational cruising have become increasingly popular, studies to date are largely fragmented, often adopting an economically centric perspective based on a particular cruise market or specific destinations. This research note advances cross-disciplinary perspectives to analyze recreational cruise sustainability via novel data-collection methods such as geographical information systems (GIS), remote sensing data, along with underwater and surface audio recording of cruise-related and marine biology (dolphins, humpback whales) activities. These methods may prove extremely effective to inform contemporary and future theory and management practices related to sustainable real-time impacts on visitor mobility to manage parks and recreational zones.

TI  - Socializing justice: The interface of just world beliefs and legal socialization
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the pillars of legal socialization theory is how non-legal contexts shape the legitimacy of and compliance with laws. Yet there is little longitudinal evidence establishing the interface mechanism between these spheres. The purpose of this research was to demonstrate how youths' beliefs in a just world (BJW) can help explain the transmission between the justice of non-legal authorities (parents and schools) and law legitimacy and rule violating behavior (RVB). We utilized two waves of longitudinal data from adolescents at ages 13 and 14 (N = 680) in the Sao Paulo Legal Socialization Study. Structural equation modeling revealed a good fit to the tested model that parental procedural justice and school justice predict both personal and general BJW, and these predict law legitimacy evaluations 1 year later. General and personal BJW also had an indirect effect on RVB over the following year via law legitimacy. The results suggest that non-legal authorities may influence law legitimacy not through a direct projection (which was not significant), but through an indirect process of worldview construction. Legal socialization and just world belief research can converge to help explain the interface between non-legal and legal spheres of authority.

M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous uplift and evolution of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region (TPR) represents one of the most important Cenozoic geological events on Earth. The deformation mechanism of the lithosphere in the TPR is still under debate. Relevant viewpoints can be informed by investigations of the lithospheric density structure in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and surrounding regions (TP-SRs). Considering investigating the fine-scale lithospheric density structure of the large-scale areas, the GOCE satellite data covering entire TP-SRs are used in this study. GOCE gravity gradient data are first subjected to several corrections. Then, based on gravity gradient curvature (SI) calculation complemented with the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm, the distribution of SI and the lithospheric density structure at depths of 0-80 km in TP-SRs are obtained. The effects of temperature differences and material composition on the lithospheric density distribution are further distinguished. The results show that in the crust, the density anomalies in the TPR are blocked by the surrounding hard blocks. In the upper mantle, the distribution of the density anomalies in the TPR is predominantly affected by the northward subduction of the Indian Plate and the high heat flux environment. The Longmen Shan Thrust Belt is found to have penetrated the lower crust but has not reached the depth of the upper mantle. The density anomalies in the basins on the northern side of the TPR exhibit features indicative of independent stable blocks.

TI  - Tactile evaluation of down jacket fabric by the comprehensive handle evaluation system for fabrics and yarns
T2  - TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Down jacket fabric is greatly important in determining the quality of a down jacket. In order to enrich the research on fabric handle, subjective and objective evaluations were made for down jacket fabrics that were less studied. The comprehensive handle evaluation system for fabrics and yarns (CHES-FY) can be used to evaluate the tactile handle of the fabric by accurately and efficiently measuring the basic mechanical properties of the fabric. Therefore, the CHES-FY was used to link the objective evaluation with the subjective handle, so as to effectively estimate the total handle value of the down jacket fabric. Fifty-two kinds of down jacket fabrics were objectively tested through measuring 17 extracted parameters, and principal component analysis was adopted to establish the five main handle characteristics of fullness, softness, stiffness, smoothness, looseness and tightness to characterize basic style of the down jacket fabrics. The results showed that the subjective and objective results were in good agreement. These characteristics can be used as indicators to characterize fabric performance, and the principal component expression to characterize fabric handle can better predict the handle characteristics of down jacket fabrics. This also proves that the CHES-FY can quickly and accurately obtain the fabric handle value, and can also evaluate the fabric quality level.

TI  - Human Settlements Interactions and Deforestation in Gambari Forest Reserve located in Oluyole Local Government Area (LGA) of Oyo State, Nigeria
T2  - Journal of Applied Sciences & Environmental Management
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was designed to examine changes in land cover types and the interaction of human settlements with the forest and impact of such interaction on the reserve. Community leaders and randomly selected community dwellers in each of the selected settlements were sampled for group discussion to obtain information on population and services of the forest that attract them to the reserve. Landsat images of 1984 and 2019 were used to extract land cover types using maximum likelihood classifier in Idrisi environment. The level of attractiveness and Interactions of the communities with the reserve were determined employing gravitational model. Results show that there was an increase in the size and number of settlements within the study area and decrease in in forest cover by 34% and 6.02% respectively. It was also revealed from the study that about 39% of the total area was taken over by development (building, roads and other classes) within the forest reserve, while 3% of the developed area gave way to forest cover. The degraded parts of the reserve in recent time was about 16% of the total reserve area and about 78% remained forest cover. From the results it is obvious that the level of interaction and imparts of such interaction depends on the community's population size rather than distance. It is therefore imperative to regulate the activities of adjoining communities and those within the Gambari forest reserve by appropriate authorities.

TI  - Assessment of organic matter temporal dynamics in the klyazma basin using remote sensing and qgis trends.earth
T2  - NEXO REVISTA CIENTIFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article addresses the dynamics of biological processes in various landscapes within a holistic natural geosystem-a catchment area. The Klyazma river (the fourth order tributary to the Volga) was selected as the object of study. The natural complex of the Klyazma river basin is a combination of different landscapes, each marked by a diverse composition of geomorphological and soil-vegetation structures. The study is based on remote sensing data and the Trends.Earth Land Degradation Monitoring Project (Land Cover Dataset, European Space Agency 2015, 300 m spatial resolution) implemented using the open-source Quantum GIS 2.18. Four landscape provinces and eight site were identified in the studied catchment area according to the geomorphological structure and the soil and vegetation cover. The ecosystem parameters Gross Primary Productivity, Net Primary Productivity, and Ecosystem Respiration were measured in the identified sites. In different landscapes the biological processes, characterizing the organic matter dynamics in the form of plant production and organic matter accumulation, differ in both rate and intensity, and variously respond to the changes in climate parameters and land use. The river basin, as a holistic ecosystem, showed sufficient stability of the dynamic processes. This suggests that holistic natural ecosystems, such as catchment areas, have internal compensatory mechanisms that maintain the development stability over long period of time, while irrational land use remains the main damaging factor.

T2  - FUTURE INTERNET
M3  - Article
AB  - In the field of journalism, the collection and processing of information from different heterogeneous sources are difficult and time-consuming processes. In the context of the theory of journalism 3.0, where multimedia data can be extracted from different sources on the web, the possibility of creating a tool for the exploitation of Earth observation (EO) data, especially images by professionals belonging to the field of journalism, is explored. With the production of massive volumes of EO image data, the problem of their exploitation and dissemination to the public, specifically, by professionals in the media industry, arises. In particular, the exploitation of satellite image data from existing tools is difficult for professionals who are not familiar with image processing. In this scope, this article presents a new innovative platform that automates some of the journalistic practices. This platform includes several mechanisms allowing users to early detect and receive information about breaking news in real-time, retrieve EO Sentinel-2 images upon request for a certain event, and automatically generate a personalized article according to the writing style of the author. Through this platform, the journalists or editors can also make any modifications to the generated article before publishing. This platform is an added-value tool not only for journalists and the media industry but also for freelancers and article writers who use information extracted from EO data in their articles.

TI  - The Influence of Seasonality on the Multi-Spectral Image Segmentation for Identification of Abandoned Land
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Areas of agricultural land in Lithuania have decreased from 2005 to 2021 by up to 2.4%. Agricultural lands that are no longer used for their main purpose are very likely to become abandoned and the emergence of such lands can cause a variety of social, economic, and environmental problems. Therefore, it is very important to constantly monitor changes of abandoned agricultural lands. The purpose of the research is to analyse the influence of seasonality on image segmentation for the identification of abandoned land areas. Multi-spectral Sentinel-2 images from different periods (April, July, and September) and three supervised image segmentation methods (Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM), Maximum_Likelihood (ML), and Minimum distance (MD)) were used with the same parameters in this research. Studies had found that the most appropriate time to segment abandoned lands was in September, according to the SAM and ML algorithms. During this period, the intensity of the green colour was the highest and the colour brightness of abandoned lands differed from the colour intensity of other lands.

TI  - Statistical and dynamical based thunderstorm prediction over southeast India
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Thunderstorms, associated with lightning and heavy rain, are a weather hazard causing human deaths, urban floods and damage to crops. Current work attempted to study the thunderstorms over Andhra Pradesh, coastal state in southeast India, using multiple satellite datasets, gridded rainfall, Doppler Radar Images and Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (ARW) model simulations during the pre-monsoon seasons of 2017 and 2018. Thermodynamic stability indices computed using INSAT-3D/3DR satellite data were used to identify precursors and lead time of prediction. India Meteorological Department (IMD) daily gridded rainfall data were used to identify the thunderstorm occurrence days, and Doppler Radar Images and INSAT imagery were conjointly used to fix the location. Eight severe thunderstorm cases were analyzed to assess the precursors and the predictability. Further, ARW model predictions for two thunderstorm cases were performed and stability indices computed using model output were compared with satellite-based indices for evaluation. Statistical metrics had shown good agreement of ARW model-based stability indices with satellite-based stability indices. Model had simulated rainfall and cloud properties associated with thunderstorm activity. The results illustrated the predictability of the location and intensity of thunderstorms with 3-4 hrs lead time, which would find usefulness in the real-time prediction of thunderstorms.

TI  - Estimation of forest leaf area index using satellite multispectral and synthetic aperture radar data in Iran
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Different satellite datasets, including multispectral Sentinel 2 and synthetic aperture radar Sentinel 1 and ALOS2, were tested to estimate the Leaf Area Index (LAI) in the Zagros forests, Ilam province, in Iran. Field data were collected in 61 sample plots by hemispherical photographs, to train and validate the LAI estimation models. Different satellite data combinations were used as input in regression models built with the following algorithms: Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forests, and Partial Least Square Regression. The results indicate that Leaf Area Index can be best estimated using integrated ALOS2 and Sentinel 2 data; these inputs generated the model with higher accuracy (R-2 = 0.84). The combination of a single band and a vegetation index from Sentinel 2 also led to successful results (R-2 = 0.81). Lower accuracy was obtained when using only ALOS 2 (R-2 = 0.72), but this dataset is helpful where cloud coverage affects optical data. Sentinel 1 data was not useful for LAI prediction. The optimal model was based on the traditional Multiple Linear Regression algorithm, using a preliminary input selection step to exclude multicollinearity effects. To avoid this step, the use of Partial Least Square Regression may be an alternative, as this algorithm was able to produce estimates similar to those obtained with the best model.

TI  - Shedding New Light on Mountainous Forest Growth: A Cross-Scale Evaluation of the Effects of Topographic Illumination Correction on 25 Years of Forest Cover Change across Nepal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate remote sensing of mountainous forest cover change is important for myriad social and ecological reasons, but is challenged by topographic and illumination conditions that can affect detection of forests. Several topographic illumination correction (TIC) approaches have been developed to mitigate these effects, but existing research has focused mostly on whether TIC improves forest cover classification accuracy and has usually found only marginal gains. However, the beneficial effects of TIC may go well beyond accuracy since TIC promises to improve detection of low illuminated forest cover and thereby normalize measurements of the amount, geographic distribution, and rate of forest cover change regardless of illumination. To assess the effects of TIC on the extent and geographic distribution of forest cover change, in addition to classification accuracy, we mapped forest cover across mountainous Nepal using a 25-year (1992-2016) gap-filled Landsat time series in two ways-with and without TIC (i.e., nonTIC)-and classified annual forest cover using a Random Forest classifier. We found that TIC modestly increased classifier accuracy and produced more conservative estimates of net forest cover change across Nepal (-5.2% from 1992-2016) TIC. TIC also resulted in a more even distribution of forest cover gain across Nepal with 3-5% more net gain and 4-6% more regenerated forest in the least illuminated regions. These results show that TIC helped to normalize forest cover change across varying illumination conditions with particular benefits for detecting mountainous forest cover gain. We encourage the use of TIC for satellite remote sensing detection of long-term mountainous forest cover change.

TI  - The Post-Secular Society Desert or Oasis for Social Entrepreneurship in Religious Communities and Organizations?
T2  - LOUVAIN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Is post-secular society a desert or an oasis for social entrepreneurship in religious communities and organizations in their current 'standby state'? This article answers this question by first exploring the nature of semi-autonomous fields. It then turns to an analysis of the worldview transition that has occurred in Belgian society, the worldview landscape that has resulted, and its implications for social entrepreneurship by religious communities. In a next step the article delves into the nature of the post-secular society, looking to both Habermas and a social geographical approach in order to better understand the possibilities for religious communities and organizations. Finally, the article applies the notion of social entrepreneurship directly to the Church. Social entrepreneurship is defined as the capacity to deal skillfully with uncertainties, to experiment on a small scale, to collaborate in a co-creative way, to gather scarce resources, to permit failure, and to dare to draw critical lessons from what one undertakes. In the case of the church this becomes ecclesiopreneurship.

TI  - Spatiotemporal geostatistical analysis of precipitation combining ground and satellite observations
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation data are useful for the management of water resources as well as flood and drought events. However, precipitation monitoring is sparse and often unreliable in regions with complicated geomorphology. Subsequently, the spatial variability of the precipitation distribution is frequently represented incorrectly. Satellite precipitation data provide an attractive supplement to ground observations. However, satellite data involve errors due to the complexity of the retrieval algorithms and/or the presence of obstacles that affect the infrared observation capability. This work presents a methodology that combines satellite and ground observations leading to improved spatiotemporal mapping and analysis of precipitation. The applied methodology is based on space-time regression kriging. The case study refers to the island of Crete, Greece, for the time period of 2010-2018. Precipitation data from 53 stations are used in combination with satellite images for the reference period. This work introduces an improved spatiotemporal approach for precipitation mapping.

TI  - Continental-Scale Land Cover Mapping at 10 m Resolution Over Europe (ELC10)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover maps are important tools for quantifying the human footprint on the environment and facilitate reporting and accounting to international agreements addressing the Sustainable Development Goals. Widely used European land cover maps such as CORINE (Coordination of Information on the Environment) are produced at medium spatial resolutions (100 m) and rely on diverse data with complex workflows requiring significant institutional capacity. We present a 10 m resolution land cover map (ELC10) of Europe based on a satellite-driven machine learning workflow that is annually updatable. A random forest classification model was trained on 70K ground-truth points from the LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey) dataset. Within the Google Earth Engine cloud computing environment, the ELC10 map can be generated from approx. 700 TB of Sentinel imagery within approx. 4 days from a single research user account. The map achieved an overall accuracy of 90% across eight land cover classes and could account for statistical unit land cover proportions within 3.9% (R-2 = 0.83) of the actual value. These accuracies are higher than that of CORINE (100 m) and other 10 m land cover maps including S2GLC and FROM-GLC10. Spectro-temporal metrics that capture the phenology of land cover classes were most important in producing high mapping accuracies. We found that the atmospheric correction of Sentinel-2 and the speckle filtering of Sentinel-1 imagery had a minimal effect on enhancing the classification accuracy (<1%). However, combining optical and radar imagery increased accuracy by 3% compared to Sentinel-2 alone and by 10% compared to Sentinel-1 alone. The addition of auxiliary data (terrain, climate and night-time lights) increased accuracy by an additional 2%. By using the centroid pixels from the LUCAS Copernicus module polygons we increased accuracy by <1%, revealing that random forests are robust against contaminated training data. Furthermore, the model requires very little training data to achieve moderate accuracies-the difference between 5K and 50K LUCAS points is only 3% (86% vs. 89%). This implies that significantly less resources are necessary for making in situ survey data (such as LUCAS) suitable for satellite-based land cover classification. At 10 m resolution, the ELC10 map can distinguish detailed landscape features like hedgerows and gardens, and therefore holds potential for aerial statistics at the city borough level and monitoring property-level environmental interventions (e.g., tree planting). Due to the reliance on purely satellite-based input data, the ELC10 map can be continuously updated independent of any country-specific geographic datasets.

M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the work is to develop algorithms for the semantic segmentation of forest fire areas on satellite images. Despite the active development of computer vision algorithms, today there are a number of problems in this area that have not been fully solved and do not provide the required accuracy of work. Therefore, today there is a need for the development of algorithms and software that provide high quality image segmentation.The analysis of existing algorithms for image segmentation was carried out and it was revealed that the most suitable algorithms for solving this problem are deep learning neural networks. The machine learning libraries Keras, TensorFlow and PyTorch were reviewed. The library performance was tested on a set of 60,000 images. In the process of research, the PyTorch library showed the best results, so it was decided to use it to develop algorithms. Convolutional neural network consisting of 20 layers has been developed.The neural network was trained using a generated set of 50 images of Earth remote sensing with a resolution of 8000x8000. The set of images was selected from the Landsat 8 satellite database. The main selection criteria concerned the size of the scene, as well as the number of images taken by the satellite during the day.The generated set of images contains data of the following classes: forest fire (red); burnt-out area (black); smoke from a fire (white); reservoirs (blue); forest (green).For a set of images, augmentation was performed, that is, modification of the data for training. Using this method improves the generalizing ability of the neural network, adds new training examples that the neural network has not yet seen and does not provide an opportunity to retrain. As augmentation, the following modifications were performed: image rotation by an arbitrary degree; compression along the axes; stretching along the axes; mirroring along the axes; Gaussian Blur; change in brightness and contrast. The training included 50 epochs, each of which contains 2000 iterations.When choosing an algorithm for learning a neural network, the following algorithms were considered: Adam - adaptive moment estimation; Adagrad - adaptive gradient; RMSProp - gradient descent with momentum. During the research, the best results were obtained using the Adam algorithm.A comparison of the results of the proposed neural network with some analogues is presented. A comparative study of the accuracy of the segmentation algorithms was carried out on a set of reference and test images subjected to noise distortions. To compare the segmentation results, the boundaries of the segmented objects were used, which is a set of points that do not depend on the shading of the segments. To measure the segmentation results, two metrics were used: mean and Hausdorff distance. The study of the quality of work of a number of algorithms showed that they behave unstably when the image is noisy and blurred. Thus, we can conclude that it is advisable to clean the image from noise and increase its clarity before the segmentation procedure.The accuracy of the developed neural network is 94.22%. For the classes of objects, the accuracy was the following: fire - 93.6%; burnt-out area - 95.7; smoke - 87.6; reservoirs - 96.9; forest - 97.3. This result is the best in comparison with the presented analogs. However, the developed system is somewhat inferior to some analogues in terms of such indicators as fire, burnt out area, smoke. However, in such classes as forests, reservoirs, it wins.

AB  - Digital agriculture services can greatly assist growers to monitor their fields and optimize their use throughout the growing season. Thus, knowing the exact location of fields and their boundaries is a prerequisite. Unlike property boundaries, which are recorded in local council or title records, field boundaries are not historically recorded. As a result, digital services currently ask their users to manually draw their field, which is time-consuming and creates disincentives. Here, we present a generalized method, hereafter referred to as DECODE (DEtect, COnsolidate, and DElinetate), that automatically extracts accurate field boundary data from satellite imagery using deep learning based on spatial, spectral, and temporal cues. We introduce a new convolutional neural network (FracTAL ResUNet) as well as two uncertainty metrics to characterize the confidence of the field detection and field delineation processes. We finally propose a new methodology to compare and summarize field-based accuracy metrics. To demonstrate the performance and scalability of our method, we extracted fields across the Australian grains zone with a pixel-based accuracy of 0.87 and a field-based accuracy of up to 0.88 depending on the metric. We also trained a model on data from South Africa instead of Australia and found it transferred well to unseen Australian landscapes. We conclude that the accuracy, scalability and transferability of DECODE shows that large-scale field boundary extraction based on deep learning has reached operational maturity. This opens the door to new agricultural services that provide routine, near-real time field-based analytics.

AB  - The airborne NOAA Wide Swath Radar Altimeter (WSRA) is a 16-GHz digital beamforming radar altimeter that produces a topographic map of the waves as the aircraft advances. The wave topography is transformed by a two-dimensional FFT into directional wave spectra. The WSRA operates unattended on the aircraft and provides continuous real-time reporting of several data products: 1) significant wave height; 2) directional ocean wave spectra; 3) the wave height, wavelength, and direction of propagation of the primary and secondary wave fields; 4) rainfall rate; and 5) sea surface mean square slope (mss). During hurricane flights the data products are transmitted in real-time from the NOAA WP-3D aircraft through a satellite data link to a ground station and on to the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for use by the forecasters for intensity projections and incorporation in hurricane wave models. TheWSRAis the only instrument that can quickly provide high-density measurements of the complex wave topography over a large area surrounding the eye of the storm.

TI  - Evaluation of the tropical humid forest through fractional cover analysis and GIS techniques at Yuracyacu river watershed, peruvian's Amazon
T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluated the tropical humid forest at Yuracyacu watershed during the period 1989-2010. For this, 6 Landsat satellite images were used from the Thematic Mapper sensor for the years 1989, 1995, 2001, 2006, 2008, 2010, which the respective processing was carried out using CLASlite by analyzing the fractional cover. During the period 1989-1995 a loss of 18.2 km(2) of the forest cover was obtained, for the period 1995-2001 the forest cover was recovered in a ratio of 1.2 km(2)/year; for the periods 2001-2006, 2006-2008, and 2008-2010 it was pbserved the progressive decline of the tropical rain forest, these losses being 8.9 km(2), 3.4 km(2) and 7.5 km(2) respectively. In the 21 years, 32 km(2) of Amazon rainforest have been lost from the sub-basin with a deforestation rate -1.2% per year, the highest rate of deforestation was found in the period 1989-1995, which is -2.27%. The model for determining future tropical forest scenarios in the watershed estimated a resulting area of 89.1 km(2) by 2030, demonstrating the progressive decrease of tropical humid forest. Finally, in the validation of the results, a global reliability of 85% and a Kappa index of 0.65 were obtained indicating the goodness and precision of the classification. The results of this study will guide actions for the conservation and management of the tropical rainforest of the watershed.

TI  - Remotely-sensed evapotranspiration for informed urban forest management
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - With higher evapotranspiration (ET) rates compared to other urban land covers, urban forests can play an important role in stormwater flood reduction. Effective incorporation of urban forests into stormwater planning and green infrastructure design requires methods that can quantify ET across mixed-land use landscapes but with sufficient spatial resolution for parcel-specific rates. We used Landsat-derived ET from 2000 to 2018 to estimate 30-m annual ET rates across the City of Virginia Beach, USA, a large urban landscape with increasing flood concerns. Our objectives were to compare ET rates across land covers and then identify land attributes and models to explain spatial ET variation. Upland and wetland forests had higher ET compared to urban areas, where wetland forest had annual ET rates 3?4 times that of urban and contributed ca. 40% of total landscape ET despite covering only 20% of the area. These quantified ET rates highlight the disproportional role that urban forests may play in stormwater runoff reduction, and can inform scenarios of land use change to prioritize forest conservation efforts. Relationships between ET rates and aggregated, higher resolution land attribute data indicated key drivers, where ET increased with canopy cover and decreased with impervious cover and water table depth. A regression model combining these drivers explained approximately 70% of ET variation, providing means to downscale ET estimates to further guide stormwater planning at finer spatial scales. Our findings emphasize the importance of urban forests as green infrastructure elements and point to potential approaches to better incorporate them in stormwater planning decisions.

TI  - Analysis of Groundwater Depletion/Inflation and Freeze-Thaw Cycles in the Northern Urumqi Region with the SBAS Technique and an Adjusted Network of Interferograms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work investigated the large-scale ground deformations threatening the Northern Urumqi district, China, which are connected to groundwater exploitation and the seasonal freeze-thaw cycles that characterize this frozen region. Ground deformations can be well captured by satellite data using a multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (Mt-InSAR) approach. The accuracy of the achievable ground deformation products (e.g., mean displacement time series and related ground displacement time series) critically depends on the number and quality of the selected interferograms. This paper presents a straightforward interferogram selection algorithm that can be applied to identify an optimal network of small baseline (SB) interferograms. The selected SB interferograms are then used to produce ground deformation products using the well-known small baseline subset (SBAS) Mt-InSAR algorithm. The developed interferogram selection algorithm (ISA) permits the selection of the group of SB data pairs that minimize the relative error of the mean ground deformation velocity. Experiments were carried out using a group of 102 Sentinel-1B SAR data collected from 12 April 2017 to 29 October 2020. This research study shows that the investigated farmland region is characterized by a maximum ground deformation rate of about 120 mm/year. Periodic groundwater overexploitation, coupled with irrigation and freeze-thaw phases, is also responsible for seasonal (one-year) ground displacement signals, with oscillation amplitudes up to 120 mm in the zones of maximum displacement.

TI  - Temporal-spatial variations of vegetation phenology and the influence of topography on phenology in Shanxi Province
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - To clarify the vegetation phenology characteristics in Shanxi Province, we reconstructed the MODIS NDVI time series from 2000 to 2015 by adopting the Double Logistic fitting method, extracted vegetation phenology using the dynamic threshold method, and then analyzed temporal -spatial variations of phenology and the effects of topography on phenological changes. The results showed that phenology in Shanxi Province changed significantly from 2000 to 2015. The start of the growing season ( SOS) was advanced by about 0.7 d per year (R2=0.665, P<0.01). The end of the growing season (EOS) was delayed by about 1.5 days per year (R2=0.601, P< 0.001). The length of the growing season ( LOS) was extended by about 2.2 days per year (R2= 0.772, P<0.001). The phenological change rate varied with different vegetation types. Grasslands showed the highest rate of SOS changes, followed by crops and then forestland. Forestland had the highest change rate of EOS, followed by crops and grassland. Forestland had the highest change rate of LOS, followed by grassland and then crops. There were substantial spatial variations in vegetation phenology. From low latitude to high latitude and from west to east, the SOS was delayed, EOS was advanced, and LOS was shortened. Vegetation phenology was significantly different across altitudes, slope aspects, and slope degrees. Vegetation phenology changed significantly with altitude below 1200 m. At higher altitude, SOS was significantly delayed, EOS significantly was advanced, and LOS was significantly shortened. Compared with shade slope, SOS at sunny slope was advanced by about 1 d, the EOS was delayed by about 0.8 d, and the LOS was extended by about 1.8 d. In areas with slope less than 16 degrees, SOS was advanced, EOS was delayed, and LOS was extended with the increases of slope. Our results indicate that vegetation phenology varies greatly over a long time span and topography is a crucial factor influencing the spatial pattern of phenology.

M3  - Randomized Controlled Trial
AB  - Objective:To explore the value of indocyanine green（ICG） combined with methylene blue in the identification of sentinel lymph nodes（SLNs） in patients diagnosed with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma（PTMC）. Methods:Ninety patients were enrolled and were randomized into group A and group B with 45 patients in each group. ICG combined with methylene blue were injected into the thyroid in group A, and only methylene blue were injected into thyroid in group B. Blue-stained or fluorescent nodes observed using near-infrared fluorescence imaging systems were defined as SLNs. After SLNs were removed, central lymph nodes（CLNs） dissection was completed in both groups. The pathological data and postoperative outcomes were compared between two groups. Results:There were significantly more SLNs（2.93/2.17） and CLNs（4.51/3.89） were dissected in group A than in group B（P<0.05）. There were no significant differences in sensitivity, accuracy and the false-negative rate according the SLNs in two groups（P>0.05）, but group A has higher sensitivity and accuracy rates, and lower false-negative rate. There were no significant differences in the amount of blood loss, the amount of lymphatic drainage, and incidence of hoarseness and lymphatic leakage in two groups（P>0.05）. In group A, the operating time was longer, and the rate of hypoparathyroidism was lower（P<0.05）. Conclusion:Sentinel lymph nodes biopsy using ICG combined with methylene blue is feasible and safe for SLNs identification in PTMC patients. It is also clinically significant for the parathyroid gland protection.

TI  - Change in drought conditions and its impacts on vegetation growth over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding climate change as well as its impacts on vegetation growth over the Tibetan Plateau has important implication for ecosystems. This study investigated changes in drought conditions and their impacts on vegetation growth over the Tibetan Plateau. The results reveal that the precipitation in growing season (May-September) shows a significant increase over most parts of the central and eastern Tibetan Plateau during 1961-2019. Consequently, drought conditions have generally relieved except in the south and northeast where precipitation has decreased. Combining analyses of gridded-dataset-derived drought indices with vegetation indices during 1982-2015, vegetation improvement in most regions of the Plateau is mainly due to lessened drought conditions. Noticeably, vegetation degradation is also found in part of southern Tibetan Plateau mainly resulting from drought enhancement. This study is expected to provide scientific basis for understanding of change in drought condition and its impacts on vegetation over different regions of TP under global warming background.

TI  - Dynamic results of electron flux in radiation belt from 2011 to 2015 based on FY-3B satellite observation
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - FY-3B satellite is a polar orbiting meteorological satellite with an orbit altitude of 800 km and an inclination of 98 degrees. The onboard High-energy Electron Detector (HEED) can carry out long-term continuous monitoring of electron radiation with wide energy spectrum and high time resolution. Based on the observation data of HEED during 2011-2015, the detailed spatial dynamic distributions of 0.15 similar to 5.7 MeV electrons are obtained. The results show that the lower the energy, the higher the frequency of electron increasing, and the wider the spatial distribution. Electrons with energy of 0.15 similar to 0.35 MeV remain in the outer radiation zone and slot region for a long time. The electrons above 1 MeV always located in the outer belt and even weakened to the background flux level in most of 2014. Frequent enhanced disturbance in 2015 led to the overall increase in the electron flux level. The spatial distribution range of electron larger than 1 MeV can even spread to the slot. The influence of different disturbance parameters on regional distribution of electronflux during the two periods from May to July 2014 and May to July 2015 is analyzed. At the outer boundary of the outer radiation belt, the electron flux is significantly affected by the periodic modulation of the solar wind velocity. Solar wind speed and geomagnetic activity can affect the inner edge and peak position of the out belt. The stronger the magnetic storm, the deeper the injection depth and the lower the L value. Under the influence of the strong magnetic storm in March and June 2015, even more than 1 MeV electron increased significantly at position as low as L similar to 2.8. On the condition of extremely low background, substorm over 300 nT can result in an increase more than an order of magnitude in the electron flux of 0.15 similar to 0.35 MeV. These results have important reference for accurately understanding the basic characteristics of electrons in different periods, discovering the basic physical processes of dynamic energy electrons, and constructing more accurate electron model.

TI  - Assessment of landslide susceptibility and risk factors in China
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides represent some of the most important geological disasters and not only pose a threat to human beings but also have a serious destructive impact on the environment and property. Delimiting the potential distribution of landslide risk zones is of great significance for reducing casualties and economic losses and promoting sustainable development. Research has been performed on landslide hazard risk assessment for decades; however, the risk factors for landslide disasters in China are still not well understood. Based on the assembled georeferenced landslide occurrence records and a set of spatial covariates, the risk factors for landslide disasters are estimated, and a landslide susceptibility map is generated using the maximum entropy model. The results suggest that distance to roads, rainfall, and land use are the main risk factors affecting landslide occurrence, with relative contribution rate values of 32.9%, 29.8%, and 14.3%, respectively. The estimate map reveals that the potential landslide risk for zones in eastern and southern parts of China is higher than that in zones in western and northern China and that the predicted highest risk provinces are Yunnan, Sichuan and Hunan. Our findings provide an important basis for decision-making regarding disaster prevention and mitigation.

TI  - Comprehensive drought monitoring in Yunnan Province, China using multisource remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of drought monitoring techniques is important for understanding and mitigating droughts and for rational agricultural management. This study used data from multiple sources, including MOD13A3, TRMM 3B43, and SRTMDEM, for Yunnan Province, China from 2009 to 2018 to calculate the tropical rainfall condition index (TRCI), vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition index (TCI), and elevation factors. Principal component analysis (PCA) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) were used to construct comprehensive drought monitoring models for Yunnan Province. The reliability of the models was verified, following which the drought situation in Yunnan Province for the past ten years was analysed. The results showed that: (1) The comprehensive drought index (CDI) had a high correlation with the standardized precipitation index, standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, temperature vegetation dryness index, and CLDAS (China Meteorological Administration land data assimilation system), indicating that the CDI was a strong indicator of drought through meteorological, remote sensing and soil moisture monitoring. (2) The droughts from 2009 to 2018 showed generally consistent spatiotemporal changes. Droughts occurred in most parts of the province, with an average drought frequency of 29% and four drought-prone centres. (3) Monthly drought coverage during 2009 to 2014 exceeded that over 2015 to 2018. January had the largest average drought coverage over the study period (61.92%). Droughts at most stations during the remaining months except for October exhibited a weakening trend (slope > 0). The CDI provides a novel approach for drought monitoring in areas with complex terrain such as Yunnan Province.

TI  - Exploration of Semantic Geo-Object Recognition Based on the Scale Parameter Optimization Method for Remote Sensing Images
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Image segmentation is of significance because it can provide objects that are the minimum analysis units for geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA). Most segmentation methods usually set parameters to identify geo-objects, and different parameter settings lead to different segmentation results; thus, parameter optimization is critical to obtain satisfactory segmentation results. Currently, many parameter optimization methods have been developed and successfully applied to the identification of single geo-objects. However, few studies have focused on the recognition of the union of different types of geo-objects (semantic geo-objects), such as a park. The recognition of semantic geo-objects is likely more crucial than that of single geo-objects because the former type of recognition is more correlated with the human perception. This paper proposes an approach to recognize semantic geo-objects. The key concept is that a single geo-object is the smallest component unit of a semantic geo-object, and semantic geo-objects are recognized by iteratively merging single geo-objects. Thus, the optimal scale of the semantic geo-objects is determined by iteratively recognizing the optimal scales of single geo-objects and using them as the initiation point of the reset scale parameter optimization interval. In this paper, we adopt the multiresolution segmentation (MRS) method to segment Gaofen-1 images and tested three scale parameter optimization methods to validate the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach can determine the scale parameters, which can produce semantic geo-objects.

T2  - Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a fundamental flux in land surface hydrothermal process. Because of the differences in basic concepts, assumptions, application scales, different models have induced varying uncertainties to the estimation and simulation of evapotranspiration. With the Three-River-Source National Park as an example, we used the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method to integrate the ET estimations from five models of PT-JPL, ARTS-GIMMS3, ARTS-MODIS, MODIS global evapotranspiration product (MOD16), and SSEBop, and tried to improve the estimating accuracy of evapotranspiration. The results showed that the five models could well capture the seasonal variations in evapotranspiration at Haibei Flux Station, with an explanation range of 64%-86% variability in the observed ET, and a root means square deviation (RMSD) ranged from 0.47 mm·(8 d)-1 to 0.76 mm·(8 d)-1. BMA-based ET greatly improved its explanation to 89% and decreased the RMSD to 0.43 mm·(8 d)-1. The Three-River-Source National Park experienced an overall insignificant increasing trend in its inter-annual ET from 2003 to 2015. At the regional scale, the effects of temperature and precipitation on evapotranspiration were not significant, but were significant in the Yangtze River Source Park. Temperature and precipitation had positive impacts on evapotranspiration. The evapotranspiration showed different trends due to the geographi-cal differences between parks. This study provided a method reference for other multi-source data integration analysis. The integrated evapotranspiration data could effectively reduce the uncertainty of the original models and provide a more accurate data basis for the study of regional water heat change, which is of great significance to better understand water cycle under climate changes.
AB  - 蒸散发(ET)是陆表水热过程的一个基础通量,不同模型基于的概念、假设、应用尺度等诸多差异给ET的准确模拟带来了多种不确定性。本研究以三江源国家公园为例,应用贝叶斯模型平均(BMA)方法,通过通量塔观测值对模型进行训练,并综合PT-JPL、ARTS-GIMMS3g、ARTS-MODIS、MOD16和SSEBo 5个模型结果,以提高ET的估测精度。结果表明: 5个模型结果可以捕捉海北高寒草地通量塔观测ET的季节变化,可解释观测ET季节变异的64%～86%,均方根误差(RMSD)的范围为0.47～0.76 mm·(8 d)-1;基于BMA得到的ET的解释能力提高至89%,RMSD降低至0.43 mm·(8 d)-1。20032015年,三江源国家公园地表ET总体呈不显著增加的趋势,在全区尺度上,温度和降水对蒸散的影响不显著;但在长江源园区,降水和气温对其影响达到显著水平。气温和降水对蒸散发有积极的影响,但不同园区之间的地理差异导致蒸散发也出现不同的变化趋势。本研究为其他多源数据的集成分析提供了方法参考,所集成的蒸散数据可以有效降低原各自模型的不确定性,为区域水热变化研究提供了更为精确的数据基础。这对于更好地认识气候变化背景下的水循环过程具有重要意义。.

TI  - The Identification and Geological Significance of Fault Buried in the Gasikule Salt Lake in China based on the Multi-source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ACTA GEOLOGICA SINICA-ENGLISH EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The salinity of the salt lake is an important factor to evaluate whether it contains some mineral resources or not, the fault buried in the salt lake could control the abundance of the salinity. Therefore, it is of great geological importance to identify the fault buried in the salt lake. Taking the Gasikule Salt Lake in China for example, the paper established a new method to identify the fault buried in the salt lake based on the multi-source remote sensing data including Landsat TM, SPOT-5 and ASTER data. It includes the acquisition and selection of the multi-source remote sensing data, data preprocessing, lake waterfront extraction, spectrum extraction of brine with different salinity, salinity index construction, salinity separation, analysis of the abnormal salinity and identification of the fault buried in salt lake, temperature inversion of brine and the fault verification. As a result, the study identified an important fault buried in the east of the Gasikule Salt Lake that controls the highest salinity abnormal. Because the level of the salinity is positively correlated to the mineral abundance, the result provides the important reference to identify the water body rich in mineral resources in the salt lake.

TI  - A Simple Method for Surface Radiation Estimating Using <i>FY-4A</i> Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) is a geostationary meteorological satellite with four advanced payloads, which can be used to quantitatively detect Earth's atmospheric system with multispectral and high spatial and temporal resolution. However, the applicable model limits the application of the FY-4A satellite data. In this paper, the empirical statistical model developed for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor is extended for FY-4A Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI), and it is applied to observed data to evaluate the applicability of the model for AGRI measurements. To improve the accuracy of radiation estimation, the artificially intelligent particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used for model optimizing. Results show that the estimated radiation has diurnal variation that is in accord with the characteristics of radiation variation. The estimated net surface shortwave radiation (Sn) and observed values show good correlation. However, large deviations from observations are found in the estimated values when the empirical model based on MODIS is directly used to process AGRI data. Thus, the empirical statistical model based on MODIS can be applied to AGRI data, but the empirical parameters need to be revised. Optimization of the empirical statistical model by the PSO algorithm can effectively improve the accuracy of the radiation estimate. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of Sn estimated by optimized models is reduced to 15%. The MAPE of the net surface longwave radiation (Ln) estimated by optimized models is reduced to 31%, and the MAPE of the net radiation (Rn) estimated by optimized models is reduced to 27%. However, for the uncertainty caused by error accumulation effect, the influence of PSO optimization on Rn is not as obvious as that of Ln. However, the analysis of error distribution shows that PSO optimization does improve the estimation results of Rn. Based on AGRI data, the surface radiation can be estimated simply, and the regional or larger-scale surface radiation retrieval can quickly be realized by this method, which has large application potential and popularization value.

TI  - SAR-Assisted Optical Remote Sensing Image Cloud Removal Method Based on Deep Learning
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The existing deep learning based SAR-assisted cloud removal methods do not take full into account the texture and spectral information of the optical images, which results in blurring and spectral loss. In this paper, we constructed a data set for SAR-assisted cloud removal based on the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite images in Yuhang District of Hangzhou. In addition, we established a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) based model by fully considering the details, texture, and color information of optical remote sensing images, achieving information recovery and reconstruction in the case of optical images covered by thin clouds, fog, and thick clouds. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods in SAR-assisted cloud removal.

TI  - Added-value of GEO-hyperspectral Infrared Radiances for Local Severe Storm Forecasts Using the Hybrid OSSE Method
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - High spectral resolution (or hyperspectral) infrared (IR) sounders onboard low earth orbiting satellites provide high vertical resolution atmospheric information for numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. In contrast, imagers on geostationary (GEO) satellites provide high temporal and spatial resolution which are important for monitoring the moisture associated with severe weather systems, such as rapidly developing local severe storms (LSS). A hyperspectral IR sounder onboard a geostationary satellite would provide four-dimensional atmospheric temperature, moisture, and wind profiles that have both high vertical resolution and high temporal/spatial resolutions. In this work, the added-value from a GEO-hyperspectral IR sounder is studied and discussed using a hybrid Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) method. A hybrid OSSE is distinctively different from the traditional OSSE in that, (a) only future sensors are simulated from the nature run and (b) the forecasts can be evaluated using real observations. This avoids simulating the complicated observation characteristics of the current systems (but not the new proposed system) and allows the impact to be assessed against real observations. The Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) full spectral resolution (FSR) is assumed to be onboard a GEO for the impact studies, and the GEO CrIS radiances are simulated from the ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) with the hyperspectral IR all-sky radiative transfer model (HIRTM). The simulated GEO CrIS radiances are validated and the hybrid OSSE system is verified before the impact assessment. Two LSS cases from 2018 and 2019 are selected to evaluate the value-added impacts from the GEO CrIS-FSR data. The impact studies show improved atmospheric temperature, moisture, and precipitation forecasts, along with some improvements in the wind forecasts. An added-value, consisting of an overall 5% Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) reduction, was found when a GEO CrIS-FSR is used in replacement of LEO ones indicating the potential for applications of data from a GEO hyperspectral IR sounder to improve local severe storm forecasts.

TI  - Sub-Daily Natural CO<sub>2</sub> Flux Simulation Based on Satellite Data: Diurnal and Seasonal Pattern Comparisons to Anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions in the Greater Tokyo Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last decade, advances in the remote sensing of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations by the Greenhouse Gases Observing SATellite-1 (GOSAT-1), GOSAT-2, and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) have produced finer-resolution atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) datasets. These data are applicable for a top-down approach towards the verification of anthropogenic CO2 emissions from megacities and updating of the inventory. However, great uncertainties regarding natural CO2 flux estimates remain when back-casting CO2 emissions from concentration data, making accurate disaggregation of urban CO2 sources difficult. For this study, we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land products, meso-scale meteorological data, SoilGrids250 m soil profile data, and sub-daily soil moisture datasets to calculate hourly photosynthetic CO2 uptake and biogenic CO2 emissions with 500 m resolution for the Kanto Plain, Japan, at the center of which is the Tokyo metropolis. Our hourly integrated modeling results obtained for the period 2010-2018 suggest that, collectively, the vegetated land within the Greater Tokyo Area served as a daytime carbon sink year-round, where the hourly integrated net atmospheric CO2 removal was up to 14.15 +/- 4.24% of hourly integrated anthropogenic emissions in winter and up to 55.42 +/- 10.39% in summer. At night, plants and soil in the Greater Tokyo Area were natural carbon sources, with hourly integrated biogenic CO2 emissions equivalent to 2.27 +/- 0.11%-4.97 +/- 1.17% of the anthropogenic emissions in winter and 13.71 +/- 2.44%-23.62 +/- 3.13% in summer. Between January and July, the hourly integrated biogenic CO2 emissions of the Greater Tokyo Area increased sixfold, whereas the amplitude of the midday hourly integrated photosynthetic CO2 uptake was enhanced by nearly five times and could offset up to 79.04 +/- 12.31% of the hourly integrated anthropogenic CO2 emissions in summer. The gridded hourly photosynthetic CO2 uptake and biogenic respiration estimates not only provide reference data for the estimation of total natural CO2 removal in our study area, but also supply prior input values for the disaggregation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions and biogenic CO2 fluxes when applying top-down approaches to update the megacity's CO2 emissions inventory. The latter contribution allows unprecedented amounts of GOSAT and ground measurement data regarding CO2 concentration to be analyzed in inverse modeling of anthropogenic CO2 emissions from Tokyo and the Kanto Plain.

TI  - Observations of SST-Induced Wind Perturbations in the Leeuwin Current
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) perturbations modify low-level winds through the influence of air-sea heat flux across the marine atmospheric boundary layer, mostly observable in the major western boundary current systems. In this study, we investigate the effects of SST on surface winds in a poleward-flowing eastern boundary current system, the Leeuwin Current (LC), using the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) SST and wind data from Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP) during 2009-2018. There exist robust linear relationships between perturbation SST and perturbation wind speed and their derivatives in the LC. The regression slopes between SST perturbations and wind perturbations appear to be higher in austral summer when the alongshore northward winds are strongly opposing the LC, however, the relationships in winter are statistically more robust when the LC and associated cross-shore SST fronts are the strongest. Consistent with previous studies in the western boundary currents, crosswind perturbation wind speed gradient is the largest for the winds 80 degrees (-100 degrees) to the right (left) of the SST gradient in the LC region. The perturbation wind stress curl induced by the SST signature of the LC causes positive wind stress curl anomalies on the offshore edge of the LC, driving anomalous downwelling and would reduce surface chlorophyll a concentrations along the LC SST front as observed in satellite data, which may have implications in regional biogeochemistry.Plain Language Summary The Leeuwin current (LC) is an eastern boundary current of the southern Indian Ocean that flows poleward off the west coast of Australia. This study focuses on the effects of sea surface temperature (SST) associated with the LC on the surface wind field in the region. Observational data are used to analyze the relationships between SST and wind field. The robust relationships between perturbation SST and perturbation wind and their derivatives have seasonal variations. The feedback of the perturbed wind field to the LC is also discussed, that is, the perturbation wind stress curl induces the anomalous downwelling and reduces surface chlorophyll concentration at the offshore edge of the current.

TI  - Pansharpening of WorldView-2 Data via Graph Regularized Sparse Coding and Adaptive Coupled Dictionary
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectral mismatch between a multispectral (MS) image and its corresponding panchromatic (PAN) image affects the pansharpening quality, especially for WorldView-2 data. To handle this problem, a pansharpening method based on graph regularized sparse coding (GRSC) and adaptive coupled dictionary is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the pansharpening process is divided into three tasks according to the degree of correlation among the MS and PAN channels and the relative spectral response of WorldView-2 sensor. Then, for each task, the image patch set from the MS channels is clustered into several subsets, and the sparse representation of each subset is estimated through the GRSC algorithm. Besides, an adaptive coupled dictionary pair for each task is constructed to effectively represent the subsets. Finally, the high-resolution image subsets for each task are obtained by multiplying the estimated sparse coefficient matrix by the corresponding dictionary. A variety of experiments are conducted on the WorldView-2 data, and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance than the existing pansharpening algorithms in both subjective analysis and objective evaluation.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Characteristics of Atmospheric Pollution and Cause Analysis of Haze Events in Sichuan Basin, China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed the spatio-temporal variability of air quality data for six standard air pollutants (Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5), Particulate Matter 10 (PM10), SO2, NO2, CO, and O-3) in the Sichuan Basin (SCB), China from 2015 to 2018 in relation to the formation of haze using conventional meteorological data (temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity), satellite data (fire point data, vertical profiles of aerosol subtypes, and aerosol optical depth), planetary boundary layer height, and backward trajectories. The results indicated that the spatio-temporal evolution of the air quality index (AQI) had notable seasonality for the pollution severity in descending order: winter, spring, summer, and autumn. Autumn and winter severe haze events occurred in November and January, respectively, and were caused by higher local pollution emissions under stagnant air conditions. Spring severe haze events occurred in May and were caused by dust from Northwest China and local regions. Severe summer haze events occurred in July and were caused by local burning. Therefore, the analyses showed that local burning, stagnant meteorological conditions, air mass transport and anthropogenic pollution emissions played a key role in haze in the SCB. This study provides scientific insights for fully analyzing heavy air pollution in SCB, China, and also provides a scientific basis for pollution research in regions of complex terrain as basins and mountains.

TI  - Annually Urban Fractional Vegetation Cover Dynamic Mapping in Hefei, China (1999-2018)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation measures are crucial for assessing changes in the ecological environment. Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) provides information on the growth status, distribution characteristics, and structural changes of vegetation. An in-depth understanding of the dynamic changes in urban FVC contributes to the sustainable development of ecological civilization in the urbanization process. However, dynamic change detection of urban FVC using multi-temporal remote sensing images is a complex process and challenge. This paper proposed an improved FVC estimation model by fusing the optimized dynamic range vegetation index (ODRVI) model. The ODRVI model improved sensitivity to the water content, roughness degree, and soil type by minimizing the influence of bare soil in areas of sparse vegetation cover. The ODRVI model enhanced the stability of FVC estimation in the near-infrared (NIR) band in areas of dense and sparse vegetation cover through introducing the vegetation canopy vertical porosity (VCVP) model. The verification results confirmed that the proposed model had better performance than typical vegetation index (VI) models for multi-temporal Landsat images. The coefficient of determination (R-2) between the ODRVI model and the FVC was 0.9572, which was 7.4% higher than the average R-2 of other typical VI models. Moreover, the annual urban FVC dynamics were mapped using the proposed improved FVC estimation model in Hefei, China (1999-2018). The total area of all grades FVC decreased by 33.08% during the past 20 years in Hefei, China. The areas of the extremely low, low, and medium grades FVC exhibited apparent inter-annual fluctuations. The maximum standard deviation of the area change of the medium grade FVC was 13.35%. For other grades of FVC, the order of standard deviation of the change ratio was extremely low FVC > low FVC > medium-high FVC > high FVC. The dynamic mapping of FVC revealed the influence intensity and direction of the urban sprawl on vegetation coverage, which contributes to the strategic development of sustainable urban management plans.

TI  - Interferometric Phase Reconstruction Based on Probability Generative Model: Toward Efficient Analysis of High-Dimensional SAR Stacks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to minimize the influence of decorrelation noise on multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) applications, a series of phase reconstruction methods have been proposed in recent years. Unfortunately, current phase reconstruction methods generally exhibit a low computational efficiency due to their high non-linearity, in particular in the case that the dimension of a SAR stack is high. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to efficiently resolve phase reconstruction problems. This approach is inspired by the theory of probabilistic principle component analysis. A complex valued probability generative model is constructed to portray a phase reconstruction process. Moreover, in order to resolve such a model, a targeted algorithm based on the idea of expectation maximization is designed and implemented. For validation purposes, the proposed approach is compared to the traditional eigenvalue decomposition-based method by using simulated data and 101 real Sentinel-1A SAR images. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can accelerate the phase reconstruction process drastically, in particular when a high-dimensional SAR stack is required to be processed.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evolution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in urban agglomerations of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - As the main form of new urbanization in China, urban agglomerations are an important platform to support national economic growth, promote coordinated regional development, and participate in international competition and cooperation. However, they have become core areas for air pollution. This study used PM2.5 data from NASA atmospheric remote sensing image inversion from 2000 to 2015 and spatial analysis including a spatial Durbin model to reveal the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics and main factors controlling PM2.5 in China's urban agglomerations. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) From 2000 to 2015, the PM2.5 concentrations of China's urban agglomerations showed a growing trend with some volatility. In 2007, there was an inflection point. The number of low-concentration cities decreased, while the number of high-concentration cities increased. (2) The concentrations of PM2.5 in urban agglomerations were high in the west and low in the east, with the "Hu Line" as the boundary. The spatial differences were significant and increasing. The concentration of PM2.5 grew faster in urban agglomerations in the eastern and northeastern regions. (3) The urban agglomeration of PM2.5 had significant spatial concentrations. The hot spots were concentrated to the east of the Hu Line, and the number of hot-spot cities continued to rise. The cold spots were concentrated to the west of the Hu Line, and the number of cold-spot cities continued to decline. (4) There was a significant spatial spillover effect of PM2.5 pollution among cities within urban agglomerations. The main factors controlling PM2.5 pollution in different urban agglomerations had significant differences. Industrialization and energy consumption had a significant positive impact on PM2.5 pollution. Foreign direct investment had a significant negative impact on PM2.5 pollution in the southeast coastal and border urban agglomerations. Population density had a significant positive impact on PM2.5 pollution in a particular region, but this had the opposite effect in neighboring areas. Urbanization rate had a negative impact on PM2.5 pollution in national-level urban agglomerations, but this had the opposite effect in regional and local urban agglomerations. A high degree of industrial structure had a significant negative impact on PM2.5 pollution in a region, but this had an opposite effect in neighboring regions. Technical support level had a significant impact on PM2.5 pollution, but there were lag effects and rebound effects.

TI  - Environmental and anthropogenic drivers of surface urban heat island intensity: A case-study in the Yangtze River Delta, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays urban climate is a global problem and many studies focused on understanding the relation between urban climate the built-up space using radiometric observations of the land surface temperature to estimate and monitor the surface urban heat island intensity (SUHIs). In this study MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data were used. The Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA), eastern China, was selected as an example to study SUHI and multiple influencing factors in 16 big cities. Anthropogenic factors are considered the most important ones in determining SUHI, while natural factors remain influential. By using stratified random sampling (SRS), 78,085 random points were selected within the 16 cities. Nine influencing factors were selected in this study: distance from building (BD), distance from the main roads (RD), distance from water (WD), digital elevation model product (DEM), gross domestic product (GDP), normalized difference vegetation index product (NDVI), nighttime lighting intensity (NTI), population (POP) and impervious surface area data (%ISA). The SUHI intensity was extracted at each random point as well as the values of the influencing factors, NDVI, DEM, ISA, POP, NTI and GDP. For BD, WD and RD, random points were selected from the water, building and main roads using the near tool in ArcGIS to measure these distances. Boosted regression tree (BRT) model was applied to capture the contributions of the above factors to SUHI. We also applied a different procedure to evaluate the relative influence of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC). The relative influence refers to the contribution of each factor to determine SUHI. The influencing factors were ranked on the basis of the relative influence on SUHI. The results showed that (1) higher SUHI intensity was recorded in Shanghai, Jiaxing and Nanjing cities respectively, while Hangzhou recorded the lowest SUHI. (2) Anthropogenic drivers have slightly higher relative influence on SUHI than natural drivers, i.e. 51.29% and 48.71% respectively. The influence of all drivers on SUHI from high to low is NTI (27.62%), ISA (24.38%), NDVI (12.11%), GDP (7.95%), DEM (7.29%), POP (6.37%), BD (5.33%), WD (4.93%), RD (4.02%). (3) The variation in the socioeconomic level lead to different spatial patterns of different influence factors, further indicating that the overall mean SUHI intensity is affected by the development of the city.

TI  - Flash Flood Susceptibility Assessment and Zonation Using an Integrating Analytic Hierarchy Process and Frequency Ratio Model for the Chitral District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Pakistan is a flood-prone country and almost every year, it is hit by floods of varying magnitudes. This study was conducted to generate a flash flood map using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and frequency ratio (FR) models in the ArcGIS 10.6 environment. Eight flash-flood-causing physical parameters were considered for this study. Five parameters were based on the digital elevation model (DEM), Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS), and Sentinel-2 satellite, including distance from the river and drainage density slope, elevation, and land cover, respectively. Two other parameters were geology and soil, consisting of different rock and soil formations, respectively, where both layers were classified based on their resistance against water percolation. One parameter was rainfall. Rainfall observation data obtained from five meteorological stations exist close to the Chitral District, Pakistan. According to its significant importance in the occurrence of a flash flood, each criterion was allotted an estimated weight with the help of AHP and FR. In the end, all the parameters were integrated using weighted overlay analysis in which the influence value of the drainage density was given the highest value. This gave the output in terms of five flood risk zones: very high risk, high risk, moderate risk, low risk, and very low risk. According to the results, 1168 km(2), that is, 8% of the total area, showed a very high risk of flood occurrence. Reshun, Mastuj, Booni, Colony, and some other villages were identified as high-risk zones of the study area, which have been drastically damaged many times by flash floods. This study is pioneering in its field and provides policy guidelines for risk managers, emergency and disaster response services, urban and infrastructure planners, hydrologists, and climate scientists.

TI  - Sentinel Research Sites in Global Change Research: Whiteface Mountain, New York
T2  - NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Research at sentinel research sites focuses on long-term ecological monitoring related to global environmental changes. Despite the value of sentinel research sites during the Anthropocene, the factors that drive their development, success, and sustainability are not clear. Here we study the history of Whiteface Mountain, NY-a sentinel research site in global environmental change research. We review the origins of Whiteface Mountain as a research site, its contributions to forest ecosystem science, and the factors that contributed to the location's development, success, and sustainability. We identified 6 key characteristics that contributed to the success of Whiteface Mountain as a sentinel research site: (a) accumulation of high-quality long-term data, (b) features representative of a broad area, (c) availability of appropriate infrastructure and staffing, (d) sustained governmental and community support, (e) active communication and outreach programs, and ( f) dedicated leadership. These characteristics provide a roadmap for the successful development and sustainable operation of sentinel research sites in global environmental change research.

TI  - Emergent vegetation in Netley-Libau Marsh: Temporal changes (1990-2013) in cover in relation to Lake Winnipeg level and Red River flow
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A time-series (1990-2013) of classified vegetation cover maps was produced for Netley-Libau Marsh, a 26,000 ha coastal wetland on Lake Winnipeg, to assess its current status and verify earlier trends of emergent vegetation loss. Open water area in the marsh was measured from late-summer Landsat images for 20 years; three classes of vegetation types (emergents, wet meadows, upland) could also be identified for 12 images covering the same period. Temporal changes in area and distribution of marsh vegetation were related to adjoining Lake Winnipeg water-level and Red River discharge, as well as marsh connectivity and bathymetry. From 1990 to 2002, an increase in open-water areas and decrease in emergent vegetation coincided with rising levels and flows. The year 2003 marked major wetland regeneration and a decrease of open-water area under extremely low water-levels and flows. From 2005 to 2013, openwater area remained consistent, under high but variable levels and flows. A strong negative correlation was found between area of emergent vegetation and mean Red River discharge in the previous JuneJuly. Superimposition of the limit of new emergent vegetation observed in 2003 with depth contours surveyed in 2010 revealed the dynamic nature of marsh bathymetry. Periods of extremely low water as short as one year (2003) induced a marked expansion in emergent vegetation cover that persisted over the next ten years despite higher water-levels. Rather than being gradual, changes in the spatial extent of NetleyLibau Marsh vegetation appeared to proceed by fits and starts, wherein periods of relative stasis were disrupted by major changes in abundance.

TI  - Monitoring Landsat Based Burned Area as an Indicator of Sustainable Development Goals
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The "United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development" adopted in 2015 covers 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Fire is a common form of disaster and has a wide range of impacts on climate, biogeochemical cycle and human health, highly related to the SDGs. Satellite remote sensing technology provides an effective way for the dynamic monitoring of global burned area (BA). However, the existing global BA products are mainly at low and medium spatial resolution, which is difficult for detecting small fires, and also has large errors in calculating area of burned land. Based on Landsat 8 surface reflectance data and Google Earth Engine platform, a novel multi-year (from the starting year of SDGs [2015] to the nearest year [2019]) 30 m resolution global BA products were generated. Based on these products, spatial distribution, influencing factors and change characteristics of BA were analyzed. The results show that from 2015 to 2019 the total area of BA in the world was 365.27, 368.56, 374.56, 345.55, and 363.09 x 10(6) ha. From 2015 to 2019, the total area of global BA was relatively stable, however there were significant differences among various continents and regions. During the study period, BA in the Amazon and Australia changed dramatically. The huge Amazon fire in 2019 caused a reduction of 4.67 x 10(6) ha of vegetated area in the Amazon basin, an increase in BA of 119.25% compared with 2018. In 2019, BA on the eastern and southeastern coasts of Australia increased abnormally. The possible reasons for these changes were comprehensively discussed and analyzed.

TI  - Quantifying the indirect effects of urbanization on urban vegetation carbon uptake in the megacity of Shanghai, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization causes the expansion of urban land and changes to urban environments, both of which have significant impacts on the carbon uptake of urban vegetation. Although previous studies have proposed that the impact of the changes in the environmental conditions of vegetation carbon uptake by urban expansion are generally indirect, the processes of this impact are still unclear. In this study, we quantified the indirect effects of urbanization on urban vegetation carbon uptake for unchanged vegetation areas. We extracted unchanged vegetation areas based on multisource remote sensing data from the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. The influence of urbanization on vegetation carbon uptake and urban environmental factors in 2004, 2010, and 2016 along with the urban-rural gradient was calculated. In addition, we investigated the relative contribution of urban environmental factors to vegetation carbon uptake to study the relationship between them using a boosted regression tree method. The results showed that urbanization promoted vegetation carbon uptake, which varied with different years in Shanghai. Besides, the promoting effect of urbanization on the carbon uptake of vegetation was mainly due to the increase in temperature and the fragmentation of vegetation landscape patterns in Shanghai. The changes of soil moisture and radiation had little effect on the vegetation carbon uptake. Among the influencing factors, the relative contribution of the vegetation landscape pattern to vegetation carbon uptake was about 85%. Considering the crucial role of landscape patterns in the carbon uptake of vegetation, urban managers should consider reducing the negative influence of urbanization on vegetation through landscape design, which will further promote the sustainable development of urban ecology.

TI  - Designing a deep intercultural curriculum in higher education: co-constructing knowledge with Indigenous women
T2  - ALTERNATIVE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of intercultural curriculum in contexts with Indigenous populations has usually been approached from the perspective of the hegemonic culture, which has strengthened its assimilatory and acculturative character, subalternating Indigenous knowledge. Following a community-based participatory action research, this study aims to contribute from the participants' voices, to establish the basis of an intercultural curriculum considering the dialogue of Indigenous and academic knowledge systems. The study involved 99 Indigenous and non-Indigenous representatives from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Argentina, involving 33 Indigenous communities. The results point to six fundamental challenges considering the inclusion in the curriculum of Indigenous spiritualities, the concept of good living, healing, gender perspectives from their worldview and strengthening leadership, as well as considering an in-depth perspective of interculturality, complementarity, and reciprocity as methodological principles. The process developed provides a model for the collective construction of knowledge based on participation and communities' voices.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Backscatter Analysis and Radiative Transfer Modeling of Dense Winter Wheat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates a temporally dense VV-polarized Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter time series (revisit time of 1.5 days) for wheat fields near Munich (Germany). A dense time series consisting of images from different orbits (varying acquisition) is analyzed, and Radiative Transfer (RT)-based model combinations are adapted and evaluated with the use of radar backscatter. The model shortcomings are related to scattering mechanism changes throughout the growth period with the use of polarimetric decomposition. Furthermore, changes in the RT modeled backscatter results with spatial aggregation from the pixel to field scales are quantified and related to the sensitivity of the RT models, and their soil moisture output are quantified and related to changes in backscatter. Therefore, various (sub)sets of the dense Sentinel-1 time series are analyzed to relate and quantify the impact of the abovementioned points on the modeling results. The results indicate that the incidence angle is the main driver for backscatter differences between consecutive acquisitions with various recording scenarios. The influence of changing azimuth angles was found to be negligible. Further analyses of polarimetric entropy and scattering alpha angle using a dual polarimetric eigen-based decomposition show that scattering mechanisms change over time. The patterns analyzed in the entropy-alpha space indicate that scattering mechanism changes are mainly driven by the incidence angle and not by the azimuth angle. Besides the analysis of differences within the Sentinel-1 data, we analyze the capability of RT model approaches to capture the observed Sentinel-1 backscatter changes due to various acquisition geometries. For this, the surface models "Oh92" or "IEM_B" (Baghdadi's version of the Integral Equation Method) are coupled with the canopy model "SSRT" (Single Scattering Radiative Transfer). To resolve the shortcomings of the RT model setup in handling varying incidence angles and therefore the backscatter changes observed between consecutive time steps of a dense winter wheat time series, an empirical calibration parameter (coef) influencing the transmissivity (T) is introduced. The results show that shortcomings of simplified RT model architectures caused by handling time series consisting of images with varied incidence angles can be at least partially compensated by including a calibration coefficient to parameterize the modeled transmissivity for the varying incidence angle scenarios individually.

TI  - Vegetation Phenology in Permafrost Regions of Northeastern China Based on MODIS and Solar-induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is an indicator of vegetation response to natural environmental changes and is of great significance for the study of global climate change and its impact on terrestrial ecosystems. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), are widely used to monitor phenology by calculating land surface reflectance. However, the applicability of the vegetation index based on 'greenness' to monitor photosynthetic activity is hindered by poor observation conditions (e.g., ground shadows, snow, and clouds). Recently, satellite measurements of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from OCO-2 sensors have shown great potential for studying vegetation phenology. Here, we tested the feasibility of SIF in extracting phenological metrics in permafrost regions of the northeastern China, exploring the characteristics of SIF in the study of vegetation phenology and the differences between NDVI and EVI. The results show that NDVI has obvious SOS advance and EOS lag, and EVI is closer to SIF. The growing season length based on SIF is often the shortest, while it can represent the true phenology of vegetation because it is closely related to photosynthesis. SIF is more sensitive than the traditional remote sensing indices in monitoring seasonal changes in vegetation phenology and can compensate for the shortcomings of traditional vegetation indices. We also used the time series data of MODIS NDVI and EVI to extract phenological metrics in different permafrost regions. The results show that the length of growing season of vegetation in predominantly continuous permafrost (zone I) is longer than in permafrost with isolated taliks (zone II). Our results have certain significance for understanding the response of ecosystems in cold regions to global climate change.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Distribution of Ground Deformation Due to 2018 Lombok Earthquake Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lombok Island in Indonesia was hit by four major earthquakes (6.4 Mw to 7 Mw) and by at least 818 earthquakes between 29 July and 31 August 2018. The aims of this study are to measure ground deformation due to the 2018 Lombok earthquake series and to map its spatio-temporal distribution. The application of DinSAR was performed to produce an interferogram and deformation map. Time series Sentinel-1 satellite imageries were used as master and slave for each of these four major earthquakes. The spatio-temporal distribution of the ground deformation was analyzed using a zonal statistics algorithm in GIS. It focused on the overlapping area between the raster layer of the deformation map and the polygon layer of six observation sites (Mataram City, Pamenang, Tampes, Sukadana, Sembalun, and Belanting). The results showed that the deformation includes uplift and subsidence. The first 6.4 Mw foreshock hitting on 29 July 2018 produces a minimum uplift effect on the island. The 7.0 Mw mainshock on 5 August 2018 causes extreme uplift at the northern shore. The 6.2 Mw Aftershock on 9 August 2018 generates subsidence throughout the study area. The final earthquake of 6.9 Mw on 19 August 2018 initiates massive uplift in the study area and extreme uplift at the northeastern shore. The highest uplift reaches 0.713 m at the northern shore, while the deepest subsidence is measured -0.338 m at the northwestern shore. Dominant deformation on the northern area of Lombok Island indicates movement of Back Arc Trust in the north of the island. The output of this study would be valuable to local authorities to evaluate existing earthquake's impacts and to design mitigation strategies to face earthquake-induced ground displacement.

TI  - Urogenital schistosomiasis infection prevalence targets to determine elimination as a public health problem based on microhematuria prevalence in school-age children
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Recent research suggests that schistosomiasis targets for morbidity control and elimination as a public health problem could benefit from a reanalysis. These analyses would define evidence-based targets that control programs could use to confidently assert that they had controlled or eliminated schistosomiasis as a public health problem. We estimated how low Schistosoma haematobium infection levels diagnosed by urine filtration in school-age children should be decreased so that microhematuria prevalence was at, or below, a "background" level of morbidity.Methodology Data obtained from school-age children in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Tanzania, and Zambia who participated in schistosomiasis monitoring and evaluation cohorts were reanalyzed before and after initiation of preventive chemotherapy. Bayesian models estimated the infection level prevalence probabilities associated with microhematuria thresholds <= 10%, 13%, or 15%.Principal findings An infection prevalence of 5% could be a sensible target for urogenital schistosomiasis morbidity control in children as microhematuria prevalence was highly likely to be below 10% in all surveys. Targets of 8% and 11% infection prevalence were highly likely to result in microhematuria levels less than 13% and 15%, respectively. By contrast, measuring heavy-intensity infections only achieves these thresholds at impractically low prevalence levels.Conclusions/Significance A target of 5%, 8%, or 11% urogenital schistosomiasis infection prevalence in school-age children could be used to determine whether a geographic area has controlled or eliminated schistosomiasis as a public health problem depending on the local background threshold of microhematuria.Author summary For urogenital schistosomiasis, targets for morbidity control and elimination as a public health problem are based on the percentage of school-age children with a heavy intensity infection in a set of sentinel schools. These targets are not tied to specific morbidity indicators and should be reevaluated due to the recognition that all infections have an impact on people's health. Multiple studies have shown a strong association between urogenital schistosomiasis infection and microhematuria. In these analyses, data from children aged 6-15 years in monitoring and evaluation cohorts from five African countries were used to determine whether infection and heavy intensity infection targets could be developed, based on a prevalence of microhematuria in a school without schistosomiasis infections before and after initiation of a deworming program. Results indicate that targets of 5%, 8%, or 11% urogenital schistosomiasis infection prevalence in school-age children can be used to reliably conclude that a school is below a microhematuria prevalence of 10%, 13%, or 15%, respectively. These targets could be used by control program managers as guide to determine whether morbidity has been controlled or eliminated as a public health problem.

TI  - An Integrative Conceptualization of Floodplain Storage
T2  - REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Floodplains perform diverse functions, including attenuation of fluxes of water, solutes, and particulate material. Critical details of floodplain storage including magnitude, duration, and spatial distribution are strongly influenced by floodplain biogeochemical processes and biotic communities. Floodplain storage of diverse materials can be conceptualized in the form of a budget that quantifies inputs, outputs, and storage within the floodplain control volume. The floodplain control volume is here defined as bounded on the inner edges by the banks of the active channel(s), on the outer edges by the limit of periodic flooding and the deposition of fluvially transported sediment, on the underside by the extent of hyporheic exchange flows and the floodplain aquifer, and on the upper side by the upper elevation of living vegetation. Fluxes within the floodplain control volume can also change the location, characteristics, and residence time of material in storage. Fluxes, residence time, and quantities of material stored in floodplains can be measured directly; inferred from diverse types of remotely sensed data; or quantitatively estimated using numerical models. Human activities can modify floodplain storage by: hydrologically and/or geomorphically disconnecting channels and floodplains; altering fluxes of water and sediment to the river corridor; and obliterating floodplains through alluvial mining or urbanization. Floodplain restoration can focus on enlarging the functional floodplain, reconnecting the channel and floodplain, restoring natural regimes of water, sediment, and/or large wood, or enhancing the spatial heterogeneity of the channel and floodplain. Each form of floodplain restoration can increase floodplain storage and resilience to disturbances.

TI  - Assessing Water Balance Closure Using Multiple Data Assimilation- and Remote Sensing-Based Datasets for Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining reliable water balance estimates remains a major challenge in Canada for large regions with scarce in situ measurements. Various remote sensing products can be used to complement observation-based datasets and provide an estimate of the water balance at river basin or regional scales. This study provides an assessment of the water balance using combinations of various remote sensing- and data assimilation-based products and quantifies the nonclosure errors for river basins across Canada, ranging from 90 900 to 1 679 100 km(2), for the period from 2002 to 2015. A water balance equation combines the following to estimate the monthly water balance closure: multiple sources of data for each water budget component, including two precipitation products-the global product WATCH Forcing Data ERA-Interim (WFDEI), and the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA); two evapotranspiration products-MODIS, and Global Land surface Evaporation: The Amsterdam Methodology (GLEAM); one source of water storage data-GRACE from three different centers; and observed discharge data from hydrometric stations (HYDAT). The nonclosure error is attributed to the different data products using a constrained Kalman filter. Results show that the combination of CaPA, GLEAM, and the JPL mascon GRACE product tended to outperform other combinations across Canadian river basins. Overall, the error attributions of precipitation, evapotranspiration, water storage change, and runoff were 36.7%, 33.2%, 17.8%, and 12.2%, which corresponded to 8.1, 7.9, 4.2, and 1.4 mm month(-1), respectively. In particular, the nonclosure error from precipitation dominated in Western Canada, whereas that from evapotranspiration contributed most in the Mackenzie River basin.

TI  - Analysis of Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy and Research on Retrieval Conditions of <SUP>13</SUP>CO<sub>2</sub>
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we analyzed the characteristics of the mid-infrared spectra containing the (CO2)-C-13 strong absorption with a transmission model of scanning imaging absorption (SCIATRAN) and a high-resolution transmission molecular absorption database (HITRAN). We found that the (CO2)-C-13 absorption was more obvious in the mid-infrared band than in the near-infrared and thermal infrared bands; the mid -infrared band was extremely sensitive to changes in the CO2 concentration in the 5-15 km middle and upper troposphere. Atmospheric convection and exchange make the change in the CO2 concentration in the middle and upper layers closely related to the near-surface. The analysis of the spectral characteristics indicates that the main factors affecting CO2 retrieval are water vapor, temperature, and nitrous oxide. Furthermore, we retrieved the (CO2)-C-13 concentration with satellite remote sensing data and provided the necessary conditions for retrieval. Specifically, the profiles of water vapor, temperature, and nitrous oxide should respectively have the precision of 50 x 10(-6), above 0.03 K, and above 5 x 10(-9); the signal-to-noise ratio of the instruments needs to be higher than 600. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for (CO2)-C-13 detection with satellite remote sensing and put forward requirements for indicators for future hyperspectral detector manufacturing. As such, we can better control the CO2 source, sink, and transmission laws and grasp the global carbon cycle budget.

TI  - Intercalibration of MERIS, MODIS, and OLCI Satellite Imagers for Construction of Past, Present, and Future Cyanobacterial Biomass Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite imagery has been used to monitor and assess Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), specifically, cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Erie (the USA and Canada) for over twelve years. In recent years, imagery has been applied to the other Great Lakes as well as other U.S. lakes. The key algorithm used in this monitoring system is the cyanobacterial index (CI), a measure of the chlorophyll found in cyanobacterial blooms. The CI is a "spectral shape" (or curvature) algorithm, which is a form of the second derivative around the 681 nm (MERIS/OLCI) or 678 nm (MODIS) band, which is robust and implicitly includes an atmospheric correction, allowing reliable use for many more scenes than analytical algorithms. Monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms with the CI began with the European Space Agency's (ESA) Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) sensor (2002-2012). With the loss of data from MERIS in the spring of 2012, the monitoring system shifted to using NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). MODIS has bands that allow computation of a CI product, which was intercalibrated with MERIS at the time to establish a conversion of MODIS CI to MERIS CI. In 2016, ESA launched the Ocean and Land Color Imager (OLCI), the replacement for MERIS, on the Sentinel-3 spacecraft. MODIS can serve two purposes. It can provide a critical data set for the blooms of 2012-2015, and it offers a bridge from MERIS to OLCI. We propose a basin-wide integrated technique for intercalibrating the CI algorithm from MODIS to both MERIS and OLCI. This method allowed us to intercalibrate OLCI CI to MERIS CI, which would then allow the production of a 20-year and ongoing record of cyanobacterial bloom activity. This approach also allows updates as sensor calibrations change or new sensors are launched, and it could be readily applied to spectral shape algorithms.

TI  - Suitable-habitat dynamics for wintering geese in China's largest freshwater lake
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - To maintain species population stability and ensure the ecological safety of internationally important wetlands, it is essential to be able to simulate suitable habitat for dominant species. Here, we describe a suitable-habitat model for wintering geese in the Poyang lake region of China, based on the Maximum Entropy modeling. The spatiotemporal patterns of suitable habitats produced by the model are analyzed by using species occurrence data from satellite tracking and environmental variables derived from remote sensing data. The results show that the normalized difference vegetation index predictor-representing productivity and food availability-made a considerable contribution to model prediction power, while the contribution from terrain data is relatively low. Nearly one third of the area of the entire floodplain can provide suitable habitats for geese during wintering periods (25.50% for Bean goose Anser fabalis and 29.57% for Greater white fronted goose Anser albifrons). More than forty percent of the suitable habitats are located in the seasonally inundated sub-lakes, indicating that such sub-lakes play an indispensable role in maintaining goose habitats. In the sub-lakes, the area of suitable habitats for geese, per unit area, is 1.67-1.80 times than in the non-sub-lake areas of the floodplain. Therefore, the regulation of the sub-lakes during the dry season has important implications for the management of goose habitats.(c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V. CC_BY_NC_ND_4.0

TI  - Discharge Estimation Using Integrated Satellite Data and Hybrid Model in the Midstream Yangtze River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensing data have advantages in filling spatiotemporal gaps of in situ observation networks, showing potential application for monitoring floods in data-sparse regions. By using the water level retrievals of Jason-2/3 altimetry satellites, this study estimates discharge at a 10-day timescale for the virtual station (VS) 012 and 077 across the midstream Yangtze River Basin during 2009-2016 based on the developed Manning formula. Moreover, we calibrate a hybrid model combined with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data, by coupling the GR6J hydrological model with a machine learning model to simulate discharge. To physically capture the flood processes, the random forest (RF) model is employed to downscale the 10-day discharge into a daily scale. The results show that: (1) discharge estimates from the developed Manning formula show good accuracy for the VS012 and VS077 based on the improved Multi-subwaveform Multi-weight Threshold Retracker; (2) the combination of the GR6J and the LSTM models substantially improves the performance of the discharge estimates solely from either the GR6J or LSTM models; (3) RF-downscaled daily discharge demonstrates a general consistency with in situ data, where NSE/KGE between them are as high as 0.69/0.83. Our approach, based on multi-source remotely sensing data and machine learning techniques, may benefit flood monitoring in poorly gauged areas.

TI  - Effect of human settlements on urban thermal environment and factor analysis based on multi-source data: A case study of Changsha city
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In view of the lack of comprehensive evaluation and analysis from the combination of natural and human multi-dimensional factors, the urban surface temperature patterns of Changsha in 2000, 2009 and 2016 are retrieved based on multi-source spatial data (Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellite image data, POI spatial big data, digital elevation model, etc.), and 12 natural and human factors closely related to urban thermal environment are quickly obtained. The standard deviation ellipse and spatial principal component analysis (PCA) methods are used to analyze the effect of urban human residential thermal environment and its influencing factors. The results showed that the heat island area increased by 547 km(2) and the maximum surface temperature difference reached 10.1 degrees C during the period 2000-2016. The spatial distribution of urban heat island was mainly concentrated in urban built-up areas, such as industrial and commercial agglomerations and densely populated urban centers. The spatial distribution pattern of heat island is gradually decreasing from the urban center to the suburbs. There were multiple high-temperature centers, such as Wuyi square business circle, Xingsha economic and technological development zone in Changsha County, Wangcheng industrial zone, Yuelu industrial agglomeration, and Tianxin industrial zone. From 2000 to 2016, the main axis of spatial development of heat island remained in the northeast-southwest direction. The center of gravity of heat island shifted 2.7 km to the southwest with the deflection angle of 54.9 degrees in 2000-2009. The center of gravity of heat island shifted to the northeast by 4.8 km with the deflection angle of 60.9 degrees in 2009-2016. On the whole, the change of spatial pattern of thermal environment in Changsha was related to the change of urban construction intensity. Through the PCA method, it was concluded that landscape pattern, urban construction intensity and topographic landforms were the main factors affecting the spatial pattern of urban thermal environment of Changsha. The promotion effect of human factors on the formation of heat island effect was obviously greater than that of natural factors. The temperature would rise by 0.293 degrees C under the synthetic effect of human and natural factors. Due to the complexity of factors influencing the urban thermal environment of human settlements, the utilization of multi-source data could help to reveal the spatial pattern and evolution law of urban thermal environment, deepen the understanding of the causes of urban heat island effect, and clarify the correlation between human and natural factors, so as to provide scientific supports for the improvement of the quality of urban human settlements.

TI  - Modify the Accuracy of MODIS PWV in China: A Performance Comparison Using Random Forest, Generalized Regression Neural Network and Back-Propagation Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapor plays an important role in climate change and water cycling, but there are few water vapor products with both high spatial resolution and high accuracy that effectively monitor the change of water vapor. The high precision Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Precipitable Water Vapor (PWV) is often used to calibrate the high spatial resolution Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) PWV to produce new PWV product with high accuracy and high spatial resolution. In addition, the machine learning method has a good performance in modifying the accuracy of MODIS PWV. However, the accuracy improvement of different machine learning methods and different modeling timescale is different. In this article, we use three machine learning methods, namely, the Random Forest (RF), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN) to calibrate MODIS PWV in 2019, at annual and monthly timescales. We also use the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) method for comparison. The root mean squares (RMSs) at the annual timescale with the three machine learning methods are 4.1 mm (BPNN), 3.3 mm (RF), and 3.9 mm (GRNN), and the average RMSs become 2.9 mm (BPNN), 2.8 mm (RF), and 2.5 mm (GRNN) at the monthly timescale. Those results are all better than the MLR method (5.0 mm at the annual timescale and 4.6 mm at the monthly timescale). When there is an obvious variation pattern in the training sample, the RF method can capture the pattern to achieve the best results since the RF achieves the best performance at the annual timescale. Dividing such samples into several sub-samples each having higher internal consistency could further improve the performance of machine learning methods, especially for the GRNN, since GRNN achieves the best performance at the monthly timescale, and the performance of those three machine learning methods at the monthly timescale is better than that of annual timescale. The spatial and temporal variation patterns of the RMS values are significantly weakened after the modeling by machine learning methods for both three methods.

TI  - A Random Forest-Based Data Fusion Method for Obtaining All-Weather Land Surface Temperature with High Spatial Resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter for mirroring the water-heat exchange and balance on the Earth's surface. Passive microwave (PMW) LST can make up for the lack of thermal infrared (TIR) LST caused by cloud contamination, but its resolution is relatively low. In this study, we developed a TIR and PWM LST fusion method on based the random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm to obtain the all-weather LST with high spatial resolution. Since LST is closely related to land cover (LC) types, terrain, vegetation conditions, moisture condition, and solar radiation, these variables were selected as candidate auxiliary variables to establish the best model to obtain the fusion results of mainland China during 2010. In general, the fusion LST had higher spatial integrity than the MODIS LST and higher accuracy than downscaled AMSR-E LST. Additionally, the magnitude of LST data in the fusion results was consistent with the general spatiotemporal variations of LST. Compared with in situ observations, the RMSE of clear-sky fused LST and cloudy-sky fused LST were 2.12-4.50 K and 3.45-4.89 K, respectively. Combining the RF method and the DINEOF method, a complete all-weather LST with a spatial resolution of 0.01 degrees can be obtained.

TI  - Improvements in high-temporal resolution active fire detection and FRP retrieval over the Americas using GOES-16 ABI with the geostationary Fire Thermal Anomaly (FTA) algorithm
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geostationary imaging sensors offer unique high temporal resolution capabilities with which to characterise the fast-changing dynamics of landscape fires. The new R-Series of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-R) are the most advanced geostationary weather satellites currently operating, and each carry the new Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) which greatly improves on the spatial, temporal and radiometric characteristics of the previous GOES Imager. Here we develop and evaluate the first landscape fire radiative power (FRP) observation system for the first of the GOES-R series (GOES-16), comparing its outputs to those generated near simultaneously from the forerunner GOES-13 Imager and from the far higher spatial resolution, but far less frequently imaging, Moderate Spatial Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Across the Americas, when examining near-simultaneous data from August to September 2017, the geostationary Fire Thermal Anomaly (FTA) algorithm originally developed for use with Meteosat's Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) enables GOES-16 ABI to detect substantially more (6%) active fire (AF) pixels than GOES-13 Imager, due mainly to the former sensors` smaller pixel area. ABI detects even greater numbers of AF pixels due to its higher temporal resolution, but here we are only comparing results from near-simultaneous imagery. The majority of fires having an FRP substantially less than similar to 30 MW remain undetected even by ABI, and since these are the most common fire type ABI still shows a high error of omission (68%) compared to MODIS centre of swath data (+/- 30 degrees scan angle). ABI AF pixel errors of commission are far lower than errors of omission however at similar to 12% when using MODIS as a benchmark. This appears far more favorable than results found when using the Fire Detection and Characterization (FDC) algorithm, an adaptation of the Wildfire Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm (WF_ABBA) algorithm long-applied to GOES, which when applied to ABI data was recently assessed to have an 88% commission error. When ABI and MODIS both successfully detect a fire at the same time there is strong agreement and low bias in terms of their retrieved FRP. Overall therefore we find that the FTA approach to generating AF data from GOES-16 ABI sensor appears well performing across the Americas, and is compatible with the data from this system joining that from Meteosat, Meteosat over India Ocean and Himawari-8 to become part of the global geostationary active fire observation system now reaching maturity. The AF detection and FRP data provided from GOES-16 operating as GOES-East, and also now GOES-17 operating from the GOES-West position, are now available in near real-time for use worldwide.

TI  - Comparison of Surface Subsidence Measured by Airborne and Satellite InSAR Over Permafrost Areas Near Yellowknife Canada
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In addition to spaceborne Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), airborne data such as those obtained by the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) have also been utilized to measure surface subsidence in permafrost areas in recent years. Motivated by the integration of multiplatform InSAR data, we generated two UAVSAR interferograms and one Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)-2 L-band interferogram over a permafrost area near Yellowknife, Canada, then compared the surface subsidence in the thaw seasons of 2017. The correlation coefficient and the root mean square error (RMSE) of subsidence difference are calculated to compare the airborne and spaceborne InSAR measurements. The results demonstrate that the two UAVSAR measurements are self-consistent, with the correlation coefficient between independent airborne measurements similar to 0.7. While the RMSE of the difference between surface subsidence measured by UAVSAR and ALOS2 is similar to 2.0 cm, and the correlation coefficients are less than 0.41, that is, a noticeable deviation exists between the UAVSAR and ALOS2 results possibly due to different spatial resolution and the calibration processing of airborne and spaceborne InSAR data. In addition, both UAVSAR and ALOS2 interferograms show larger surface subsidence within taiga needleleaf forest regions than in regions of other biome types (including needleleaf forest, shrubland, and grassland). The results demonstrate that a scheme for the elimination of systematic differences needs to be developed before merging multisource InSAR results. This intercomparison will provide valuable insights for narrowing the gap between radar-based measurements and planning the integration of airborne and satellite InSAR measurements in permafrost environments.

TI  - Improving Geographically Weighted Regression Considering Directional Nonstationary for Ground-Level PM<sub>2.5</sub> Estimation
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in atmospheric pollution dominated by particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) has become one of the most serious environmental hazards worldwide. The geographically weighted regression (GWR) model is a vital method to estimate the spatial distribution of the ground-level PM2.5 concentration. Wind information reflects the directional dependence of the spatial distribution, which can be abstracted as a combination of spatial and directional non-stationarity components. In this paper, a GWR model considering directional non-stationarity (GDWR) is proposed. To assess the efficacy of our method, monthly PM2.5 concentration estimation was carried out as a case study from March 2015 to February 2016 in the Yangtze River Delta region. The results indicate that the GDWR model attained the best fitting effect (0.79) and the smallest error fluctuation, the ordinary least squares (OLS) (0.589) fitting effect was the worst, and the GWR (0.72) and directionally weighted regression (DWR) (0.74) fitting effects were moderate. A non-stationarity hypothesis test was performed to confirm directional non-stationarity. The distribution of the PM2.5 concentration in the Yangtze River Delta is also discussed here.

TI  - A Fast Non-Local Means Filtering Method for Interferometric Phase Based on Wavelet Packet Transform
T2  - RADIO SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Phase unwrapping is very important to acquire surface deformation using InSAR, unwrapping the interferometric phase directly is not appropriate because the phase is affected by various noises. Therefore, it is essential to apply a suitable filter to the interferometric phase before phase unwrapping. Although there are many filtering methods for noise, these methods cannot be used directly due to the particularity of interferometric phase noise and therefore it is important to do the corresponding domain transformation. Here, a fast non-local means filtering method based on wavelet packet transform is proposed. Originally, wavelet packet transform is performed on the real part and the imaginary part respectively, which avoids the influence of phase jumps on the subsequent filtering. Furthermore, the fast non-local means filtering can be applied to smooth the acquired wavelet packet coefficients. Eventually, inverse transform of the wavelet packet is used to reconstruct the phase after filtering. Compared with other filtering algorithms in simulated and actual Sentinel-1 data, the superiority of this algorithm is proved.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations and topographic differentiation of fractional vegetation cover in typical counties of Loess Plateau
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the spatiotemporal variations of vegetation on the Loess Plateau and its topographical differentiation effects is of great importance to understanding of the sustainable development modes of "Grain for Green" and the regional ecological evolution. Based on the Landsat image of the growing season from 1997 to 2018, combined with digital elevation model (DEM) data, we analyzed the spatiotemporal variations and topographic differentiation of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) before and after the implementation of the "Grain for Green" in Jixian County, Shanxi Province located in the Loess Plateau. The results showed that: (1) Ecological environment and overall FVC of Jixian County had been significantly improved from 1997 to 2018. With the implementation of the "Grain for Green", the average annual FVC was increased from 47.87% in 1997 to 58.24% in 2018. However, FVC showed a downward trend in the county town and its surrounding areas. (2) The area with low and medium-low levels of FVC showed a decreasing trend, but the area with medium, medium-high, and high level FVC showed an increasing trend. The area with low level FVC (< 20%) and medium-low level FVC (20%-40%) was mainly transferred out, while the area with medium level FVC (40%-60%) and medium-high level FVC (60%-80%) was mainly transferred in. FVC grade structure tended to be stable. (3) There were significant differences in vegetation restoration under different altitude, slope, and aspect conditions. The area of FVC located in the altitudes of 1000-1200 m, slopes of 15 degrees-25 degrees, and semi-sunny slopes was significantly increased. Our results can provide a scientific basis for evaluating the effects of regional ecological restoration and optimizing the measures of regional vegetation restoration.

AB  - The photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been steadily improved by developing novel non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) in recent years. Herein, to further improve the performance of P3HT-based OSCs, a solid additive (SA4) and a typical solvent additive [1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)] were employed to process P3HT:ZY-4Cl-based OSCs, respectively. In comparison with the DIO-processed device, the SA4-processed one exhibited a more ordered molecular packing and more favorable phase separation, leading to enhanced charge transport and reduced carrier recombination. As a result, the SA4-processed device delivered a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.24 %, which was much higher than that of the DIO-processed counterpart (6.26 %). This work reported a PCE over 10 % in P3HT-based OSCs for the first time, indicating the promising development of P3HT-based OSCs by morphological modulation.

TI  - A Fused Variable by Night Light Images and MODIS Products for Improving Urban Built-Up Area Extraction
T2  - TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The boundary of urban built-up areas is the baseline data of a city. Rapid and accurate monitoring of urban built-up areas is the prerequisite for the boundary control and the layout of urban spaces. In recent years, the night light satellite sensors have been employed in urban built-up area extraction. However, the existing extraction methods have not fully considered the properties that directly reflect the urban built-up areas, like the land surface temperature. This research first converted multi-source data into a uniform projection, geographic coordinate system and resampling size. Then, a fused variable that integrated the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) night light images, the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface temperature product and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) product was designed to extract the built-up areas. The fusion results showed that the values of the proposed index presented a sharper gradient within a smaller spatial range, compared with the only night light images. The extraction results were tested in both the area sizes and the spatial locations. The proposed index performed better in both accuracies (average error rate 1.10%) and visual perspective. We further discussed the regularity of the optimal thresholds in the final boundary determination. The optimal thresholds of the proposed index were more stable in different cases on the premise of higher accuracies.

TI  - SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIATION OF VEGETATION COVERAGE AND ITS RESPONSE TO CLIMATIC FACTORS FROM 2001 TO 2015: A CASE STUDY IN ANHUI, CHINA
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - As a robust indicator of terrestrial vegetation productivity, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is strongly driven by precipitation and temperature among climatic factors. Based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 13A1 remote sensing data, meteorological data during 2001-2015 and land use data in 2005 from Anhui Province, temporal and spatial characteristics of vegetation cover and its response to climate factors in Anhui Province were analyzed by ArcGIS correlation technology, trend analysis method and correlation analysis method. Between 2001 and 2015, the vegetation NDVI in Anhui Province showed a downward trend and the degradation rate was faster than the growth rate with a wider range. The significant decrease areas of vegetation NDVI were mainly distributed in coastal areas, Huaibei plain areas, southern Anhui mountainous areas and Dabie mountainous areas. From 2001 to 2015, the annual change of vegetation NDVI in Anhui Province was bimodal with the highest peak in August and the second highest peak in April. In Anhui Province, NDVI was positively correlated with precipitation and temperature (R=0.065; R=0.356), the sensitivity of temperature on vegetation growth is greater than that of precipitation. The correlation degree between NDVI and climate factors in different land types was different in Anhui Province during different growing seasons, however there was no significant difference. In general, temperature was a key climatic factor influencing vegetation growth in the study area.

TI  - Estimating Particulate Matter Emission from Dust Sources Using ZY-3 Data and GIS Technology-A Case Study in Zhengzhou City, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of the social economy in China, numerous Chinese cities are facing high levels of particulate matter (PM) pollution problems. In this study, high-resolution ZY-3 images and GIS techniques were used to establish the emission inventory of total suspended particle (TSP), particulate matter 10 (PM10) and particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) from fugitive dust sources in May 2016, and a spatial grid of 3 km x 3 km resolution was established to demonstrate the spatial distribution of PM emission. Results showed that the total emissions of TSP, PM10 and PM2.5 in Zhengzhou city were 237.5 kt center dot a(-1), 103.7 kt center dot a(-1) and 22.4 kt center dot a(-1), respectively. Construction dust source was the main fugitive dust emission source in Zhengzhou city-the TSP, PM10 and PM2.5 emission of which account for 76.42%, 89.68% and 88.39%, respectively, of the total emission, followed by road dust source and soil dust source. PM emission was higher in Zhongyuan, Huiji, Jinshui and Zhengdong New District, while Zhongmou, Xingyang, Dengfeng and other remote areas had low PM emissions. Compared to other Chinese cities or regions, the PM emission from the construction dust source was at a high level in Zhengzhou city, while the PM emissions from the soil dust source and road dust source were at moderate levels.

TI  - Comprehensive Investigation of Capabilities of the Left-Looking InSAR Observations in Coseismic Surface Deformation Mapping and Faulting Model Estimation Using Multi-Pass Measurements: An Example of the 2016 Kumamoto, Japan Earthquake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We here present an example of the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake with its coseismic surface deformation mapped by the ALOS-2 satellite both in the right- and left-looking observation modes. It provides the opportunity to reveal the coseismic surface deformation and to explore the performance of the unusual left-looking data in faulting model inversion. Firstly, three tracks (ascending and descending right-looking and descending left-looking) of ALOS PALSAR-2 images are used to extract the surface deformation fields. It suggests that the displacements measured by the descending left-looking InSAR coincide well with the ascending right-looking track observations. Then, the location and strike angle of the fault are determined from the SAR pixel offset-tracking technique. A complicated four-segment fault geometry is inferred for explaining the coseismic faulting of the Kumamoto earthquake due to the interpretation of derived deformation fields. Quantitative comparisons between models constrained by the right-looking only data and by joint right- and left-looking data suggest that left-looking InSAR could provide comparable constraints for geodetic modelling to right-looking InSAR. Furthermore, the slip model suggests that the series of events are dominated by the dextral strike-slip with some normal fault motions. The fault rupture initiates on the Hinagu fault segment and propagates from southwest to northeast along the Hinagu fault, then transforms to Futagawa fault with a slip maximum of 4.96 m, and finally ends up at similar to 7 km NW of the Aso caldera, with a rupture length of similar to 55 km. The talent of left-looking InSAR in surface deformation detection and coseismic faulting inversion indicates that left-looking InSAR can be effectively utilized in the investigation of the geologic hazards in the future, same as right-looking InSAR.

TI  - Mapping Panax Notoginseng Plantations by Using an Integrated Pixel- and Object-Based (IPOB) Approach and ZY-3 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plantations of Panax notoginseng (PN), traditional herbal medicine for the prevention and treatment of vascular diseases, are expanding rapidly in China, especially in the Yunnan province of China, due to its increasing demands and prices and causing dramatic environmental concerns. However, existing information on its planting area and spatial distribution are limited. Here, we mapped the PN planting area by using a new integrated pixel- and object-based (IPOB) approach, the Random Forest (RF) classifier, and the high-resolution ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) imagery. We improved the procedures of classification in three aspects: (1) a new spectral index-Normalized Difference PN Index (NDPI)-was proposed, (2) the efficiency and scale of segmentation were optimized by using the Bi-level Scale-sets Model (BSM), and (3) feature variables were selected through an iteration analysis from 99 feature variables (spectral, textural, geometric, and geographic). Compared with the pixel- and the object-based methods, the IPOB has the highest F1 score of 0.98 and also has high robustness in terms of user and producer accuracies (97% and 99%, respectively), following by the object-based method (F1 = 0.94) and the pixel-based method (F1 = 0.93). The high accuracy was expected since the target class has very distinctive spectral and textural characteristics. Although all three approaches showed reasonably high accuracies due to the application of the NDPI and optimized procedures, the result showed the outperformance of the proposed IPOB approach. The framework established in this study expects to apply for regional or national PN surveys extensively. The information on the area and spatial distribution of PN can guide the government on policy making for the planting and exporting of traditional Chinese medicine resources.

TI  - Mapping Outburst Floods Using a Collaborative Learning Method Based on Temporally Dense Optical and SAR Data: A Case Study with the Baige Landslide Dam on the Jinsha River, Tibet
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Outburst floods resulting from giant landslide dams can cause devastating damage to hundreds or thousands of kilometres of a river. Accurate and timely delineation of flood inundated areas is essential for disaster assessment and mitigation. There have been significant advances in flood mapping using remote sensing images in recent years, but little attention has been devoted to outburst flood mapping. The short-duration nature of these events and observation constraints from cloud cover have significantly challenged outburst flood mapping. This study used the outburst flood of the Baige landslide dam on the Jinsha River on 3 November 2018 as an example to propose a new flood mapping method that combines optical images from Sentinel-2, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from Sentinel-1 and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). First, in the cloud-free region, a comparison of four spectral indexes calculated from time series of Sentinel-2 images indicated that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with the threshold of 0.15 provided the best separation flooded area. Subsequently, in the cloud-covered region, an analysis of dual-polarization RGB false color composites images and backscattering coefficient differences of Sentinel-1 SAR data were found an apparent response to ground roughness's changes caused by the flood. We carried out the flood range prediction model based on the random forest algorithm. Training samples consisted of 13 feature vectors obtained from the Hue-Saturation-Value color space, backscattering coefficient differences/ratio, DEM data, and a label set from the flood range prepared from Sentinel-2 images. Finally, a field investigation and confusion matrix tested the prediction accuracy of the end-of-flood map. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were 92.3%, 0.89 respectively. The full extent of the outburst floods was successfully obtained within five days of its occurrence. The multi-source data merging framework and the massive sample preparation method with SAR images proposed in this paper, provide a practical demonstration for similar machine learning applications using remote sensing.

TI  - Land subsidence assessment under excessive groundwater pumping using ESA Sentinel-1 satellite data: a case study of Konya Basin, Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence analysis using satellite imagery is a consequential subject. Earth scientists have begun utilizing satellite imagery as an alternative to in-situ measurements and conceptual models. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, moreover, utilize the reformer approach more than traditional satellite imagery with the use of high-resolution radar images. As a natural hazard, land subsidence is mostly attributed to excessive groundwater extraction, which is also the main reason for choosing the Konya Plain in Turkey as the study area for the present work. Since the Konya region is an agricultural and industrial land, groundwater extraction has been a challenging circumstance for the last few years. Change in groundwater level is also correlated with land subsidence rates through hydrogeological conceptualization. In this study, SAR images of the Sentinel 1 satellite are utilized for land subsidence rate calculation with the European Space Agency's SNAP software. Differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) technique was used, which makes possible to detect deformation on the ground surface of the same portion of the Earth's surface using SAR images. The different acquisitions with DInSAR method allow to create differential interferograms that provide information ground motion with accuracy in cm. Three periods were utilized as 2016-2017, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 the mean land subsidence rates were calculated for each period as 2.2, 1.4 and 1.7 cm/year, respectively. In the sum of the 3-year period, the maximum subsidence value went up to 16 cm.

TI  - Comprehensive Evaluation of the GF-4 Satellite Image Quality from 2015 to 2020
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - GaoFen-4(GF-4) is the highest spatial resolution Earth observation satellite operating in geosynchronous orbit. Its fixed Earth observation location, rapid responsiveness, and wide observation range make it popular in disaster and emergency monitoring. To evaluate the GF-4 image quality in detail on a long-term basis, this study analyzes the image quality after the commissioning phase by focusing on ground sample distance (GSD) and geometric and radiometric quality. The theoretical calculation, geometric and radiometric measurements, and on-site experiments results show that (1) the GSD of the GF-4 image is similar to 50 m at the nadir point and increases gradually with the distance away from the nadir point, (2) most external geometric errors are within the design requirements of 4 km despite some exceeding the limit, and the internal geometric errors are tested within 1 pixel, and (3) image sharpness is generally stable but varies with the atmosphere condition and imaging time, and the radiometric response gradually degrades at the rate of less than 5.5% per year.

TI  - Subsidence monitoring by integration of time series analysis from different SAR images and impact assessment of stress and aquitard thickness on subsidence in Tehran, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, agricultural plains have been subject to significant subsidence in different parts of the world including Iran. Tehran plain is one of these parts exposed to land subsidence. In this paper, as the most effective method to monitor the subsidence, synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) makes use of two radar images to measure the ground surface deformation between two acquisitions. For this purpose, two different radar datasets including 16 ENVISAT ASAR images spanning from 2003 to 2008 and 12 Sentinel-1A images spanning from 2016 to 2017 were applied in InSAR small baseline subset (SBAS) time series analysis. Two distinct subsidence time series achieved from the two datasets were integrated using an appropriate model which was fitted to all data obtained from two time series results from 2003 to 2017 and verified running leveling measurements. The average value of the root mean square errors (RMSEs) calculated between the model and the achieved time series at all pixels is 0.02 m which is an illustration of the accuracy of the proposed model to join the two deformation time series results. Furthermore, the integration results were additionally used to discover the storage properties of the aquifer system by stress-strain relationship and the effect of aquitard thickness on subsidence of Tehran plain by subsidence-aquitard thickness (fine-grained interbed) relationship, respectively. The stress-strain relationship shows a low correlation between subsidence and groundwater exploitation where a direct relationship between subsidence and aquitard thickness is clearly obvious.

TI  - Spatial Resolution Enhancement for Large-Scale Land Cover Mapping via Weakly Supervised Deep Learning
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral satellite imagery is the primary data source for monitoring land cover change and characterizing land cover globally. However, the consistency of land cover monitoring is limited by the spatial and temporal resolutions of the acquired satellite images. The public availability of daily highresolution images is still scarce. This paper aims to fill this gap by proposing a novel spatiotemporal fusion method to enhance daily low spatial resolution land cover mapping using a weakly supervised deep convolutional neural network. We merge Sentinel images and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived thematic land cover maps under the application background of massive remote sensing data and the large spatial resolution gaps between MODIS data and Sentinel images. The neural network training was conducted on the public data set SEN12MS, while the validation and testing used ground truth data from the 2020 IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society data fusion contest. The proposed data fusion method shows that the synthesized land cover map has significantly higher spatial resolution than the corresponding MODIS-derived land cover map. The ensemble approach can be implemented for generating highresolution time series of satellite images by fusing fine images from Sentinel-1 and -2 and daily coarse images from MODIS.

TI  - Study of Atmospheric Turbidity in a Northern Tropical Region Using Models and Measurements of Global Solar Radiation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiative transfer in the Earth's atmosphere under clear-sky conditions strongly depends on turbidity due to aerosols and hydrometeors. It is therefore important to know its temporal radiative properties for a given site when the objective is to optimize the solar energy that is collected there. Turbidity can be studied via measurements and models of the global solar radiation reaching the ground in cloudless conditions. These models generally depend on two parameters, namely the Angstrom turbidity coefficient and the Linke factor. This article aims to do a comparative study of five models of global solar radiation, all dependent on the Linke factor, based on real data. The measurements are provided by the Tamanrasset Meteorological Center (Algeria), which has a long series of global solar radiation data recorded between 2005 and 2011. Additional data from AERONET and MODIS onboard the TERRA satellite were also used to perform the comparison between the two estimated parameters and those obtained from AERONET. The study shows that the ESRA models are the most reliable among the five models for estimating the Linke factor with a correlation coefficient R of the data fits of 0.9995, a RMSE of 13.44 W/m(2), a MBE of -0.64 W/m(2) and a MAPE of 6.44%. The maximum and minimum statistical values were reached, respectively, in June and during the autumn months. The best correlation is also observed in the case of ESRA models between the Linke parameter and the joint optical thickness of aerosols and the total column-integrated water vapor. The Angstrom turbidity coefficient beta, calculated from the Linke factor and MODIS data, has values less than 0.02 at 9% of the cases, and 76% present values ranging between 0.02 and 0.15 and 13% higher than 0.15. These beta values are validated by AERONET measurements since a very good correlation (R approximate to 0.87) is observed between the two datasets. The temporal variations of beta also show a maximum in June. Satellite observations confirm more aerosols during the summer season, which are mostly related to the African monsoon.

TI  - Feasibility of sentinel lymph node mapping in renal cell carcinoma using intraoperative radiotracer injection
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The applicability of sentinel lymph node biopsy for early detection of metastasis in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is still in the validation phase and under investigation, which might be due to the unpredictability of the lymphatic pattern in RCC. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of sentinel node biopsy in patients with renal masses.Methods: In this prospective study, twenty-one candidates for open radical nephrectomy with T1-T3 renal tumors, were included consecutively. Sentinel nodes were sought using a hand-held gamma probe following the injection of radiotracer. The validity of sentinel node biopsy procedure as our index test was compared with lymphadenectomy as the standard method for staging and detecting the regional lymph nodes metastasis.Results: At least one sentinel lymph node was detected in thirteen of the patients using a hand-held gamma probe, and the detection rate was 61%. There was no patient with positive pathological involvement of the regional lymph nodes despite the negative involvement of the sentinel lymph node; so, the false-negative rate was 0%.Conclusion: Although sentinel lymph node biopsy was feasible in patients with RCC, sentinel node detection failure was high in our study. More prospective studies with a larger sample size are needed for standardization of the radiotracer injecting aspects and mapping method to increase the detection rate and to evaluate the false negative rate more accurately.

TI  - Robust CFAR Detector Based on Censored Harmonic Averaging in Heterogeneous Clutter
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
M3  - Letter
AB  - In this article, a robust constant false alarm rate detector (CFARD) is proposed for dense outlier situations such as the presence of high-density interfering targets within the reference window. Harmonic mean mitigates the impact of large outliers better than the arithmetic mean. We propose a CFARD called censored harmonic averaging (CHA)-CFARD, by using the modified harmonic averaging instead of the common arithmetic averaging in order to estimate the local clutter level. In practice, the number of cells which contain outliers is not known precisely. This poses a major challenge for censoring and truncating methods which aim to eliminate outliers from the reference window. The proposed detector reduces the undesirable effects of strong outliers without this restriction. Simulation results show that the CHA-CFARD outperforms the well-known CFARDs in the presence of interfering targets. Moreover, at the clutter edges, the proposed method shows an acceptable performance. Experimental results with TerraSAR-X images demonstrate that the proposed method is also effective and efficient for ship detection applications in nonhomogeneous sea clutter environments.

TI  - The use of satellite products to assess spatial uncertainty and reduce life-time costs of offshore wind farms
T2  - CLEANER ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Managers of offshore wind farms make strategic decisions based on information about site wind speeds and significant wave heights (SWH) available from numerical weather predictions (NWP) or local in-situ measurements. However, the coarse resolution with which such information are available, both in space and time, introduces a high degree of uncertainty into the decision process which in turn may result in higher costs during different stages of offshore wind farm life. The current work investigates how space-borne data describing wind speeds and SWH might be used to quantify spatial uncertainties and support decisions during the design and operation of offshore wind sites. Results have revealed that due to high spatial variance of wind speed, the estimated wind power can differ from that provided by an offshore met mast up to 11%. The methodology proposed for SWH has shown how data collected from distinct satellites can be efficiently interpolated (maximum absolute error observed around 1m) to generate high-resolute spatial information of sea water surface, regardless of satellite trajectory distributions. The work has provided insights on how the propagation of measurement uncertainty through the wind farm area can affect both management costs and wind energy production over the plant life-cycle.

TI  - 8-Day and Daily Maximum and Minimum Air Temperature Estimation via Machine Learning Method on a Climate Zone to Global Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature (Ta) is a required input in a wide range of applications, e.g., agriculture. Land Surface Temperature (LST) products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are widely used to estimate Ta. Previous studies of these products in Ta estimation, however, were generally applied in small areas and with a small number of meteorological stations. This study designed both temporal and spatial experiments to estimate 8-day and daily maximum and minimum Ta (Tmax and Tmin) on three spatial scales: climate zone, continental and global scales from 2009 to 2018, using the Random Forest (RF) method based on MODIS LST products and other auxiliary data. Factors contributing to the relation between LST and Ta were determined based on physical models and equations. Temporal and spatial experiments were defined by the rules of dividing the training and validation datasets for the RF method, in which the stations selected in the training dataset were all included or not in the validation dataset. The RF model was first trained and validated on each spatial scale, respectively. On a global scale, model accuracy with a determination coefficient (R-2) > 0.96 and root mean square error (RMSE) < 1.96 degrees C and R-2 > 0.95 and RMSE < 2.55 degrees C was achieved for 8-day and daily Ta estimations, respectively, in both temporal and spatial experiments. Then the model was trained and cross-validated on each spatial scale. The results showed that the data size and station distribution of the study area were the main factors influencing the model performance at different spatial scales. Finally, the spatial patterns of the model performance and variable importance were analyzed. Both daytime and nighttime LST had a significant contribution in the 8-day Tmax estimation on all the three spatial scales; while their contribution in daily Tmax estimation varied over different continents or climate zones. This study was expected to improve our understanding of Ta estimation in terms of accuracy variations and influencing variables on different spatial and temporal scales. The future work mainly includes identifying underlying mechanisms of estimation errors and the uncertainty sources of Ta estimation from a local to a global scale.

TI  - Monitoring, Modeling and Management of Water Quality
T2  - WATER
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - In this special issue, we are able to present a selection of high-level contributions showing the manifold aspects of the monitoring, modeling, and management of water quality. Monitoring aspects range from cyanobacteria in water using spectrophotometry via wide-area water quality monitoring and exploiting unmanned surface vehicles, to using sentinel-2 satellites for the near-realtime evaluation of catastrophic floods. Modeling ranges from small scale approaches by deriving a Bayesian network for assessing the retention efficacy of riparian buffer zones, to national scales with a modification of the MONERIS (Modeling Nutrient Emissions in River Systems) nutrient emission model for a lowland country. Management is specifically addressed by lessons learned from the long-term management of a large (re)constructed wetland and the support of river basin management planning in the Danube River Basin.

TI  - A Spatiotemporal Change Detection Method for Monitoring Pine Wilt Disease in a Complex Landscape Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using high-resolution remote sensing data to identify infected trees is an important method for controlling pine wilt disease (PWD). Currently, single-date image classification methods are widely used for PWD detection in pure stands of pine. However, they often yield false detections caused by deciduous trees, brown herbaceous, and sparsely vegetated regions in complex landscapes, resulting in low user accuracies. Due to the limitations on the bands of the high-resolution imagery, it is difficult to distinguish wilted pine trees from such easily confused objects when only using the optical spectral characteristics. This paper proposes a spatiotemporal change detection method to reduce false detections in tree-scale PWD monitoring under a complex landscape. The framework consisted of three parts, which represent the capture of spectral, temporal, and spatial features: (1) the Normalized Green-Red Difference Index (NGRDI) was calculated as a descriptor of canopy greenness; (2) two NGRDI images with similar dates in adjacent years were contrasted to obtain a bitemporal change index that represents the temporal behaviors of typical cover types; and (3) a spatial enhancement was performed on the change index using a convolution kernel matching the spatial patterns of PWD. Finally, a set of criteria based on the above features were established to extract the wilted pine trees. The results showed that the proposed method effectively distinguishes wilted pine trees from other easily confused objects. Compared with single-date image classification, the proposed method significantly improved user's accuracy (81.2% vs. 67.7%) while maintaining the same level of producer's accuracy (84.7% vs. 82.6%).

TI  - Mapping CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes of cypress swamp and marshes in the Greater Everglades using eddy covariance measurements and Landsat data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands play a critical role in the global carbon (C) budget by sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2) and storing significant amounts of C, but climate change is altering C dynamics in these ecosystems. Therefore, predicting and mapping net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 in wetlands has emerged as a focus of research to better understand where, how, and when biogeochemical cycles will be modified by human and natural disturbances like climate change. To address this, we developed an object-based machine learning ensemble approach to upscale eddy covariance (EC) CO2 flux measurements across two major wetland ecosystems (cypress swamp and freshwater marshes) in the Greater Everglades of south Florida. We linked 30-m Landsat, water depth, and air temperature data with EC flux measurements using the temporally composite concept for model development, and mapped fluxes within Big Cypress National Preserve (BCNP) and Everglades National Park (ENP) to characterize two distinct seasonal flux patterns. Using an ensemble analysis of three machine learning model outputs (Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest), our models of NEE at BCNP had a high predictive power with a R-2 greater than 0.8, while NEE was predicted at ENP with a R-2 greater than 0.5. We also generated an uncertainty map to quantify the prediction diversity caused by application of multiple models in upscaling. This uncertainty map identifies regions that are either easy or challenging to predict from model based analyses. We conclude that integration of Landsat, water depth, and air temperature data is valuable for quantifying CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and Everglades ecosystems, and the developed paradigm is promising for upscaling EC flux measurements in wetlands to study and mitigate disturbances to wetland ecosystem services such as hurricanes, fires, water management and/or climate change.

TI  - A Study on the Retrieval of Temperature and Humidity Profiles Based on FY-3D/HIRAS Infrared Hyperspectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite infrared hyperspectral instruments can obtain a wealth of atmospheric spectrum information. In order to obtain high-precision atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles, we used the traditional One-Dimensional Variational (1D-Var) retrieval algorithm, combined with the information capacity-weight function coverage method to select the spectrum channel. In addition, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm was introduced to correct the satellite observation data error and compare it with the conventional error correction method. Finally, to perform the temperature and humidity profile retrieval calculation, we used the FY-3D satellite HIRAS (Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder) infrared hyperspectral data and combined the RTTOV (Radiative Transfer for TOVS) radiative transfer model to build an atmospheric temperature and humidity profile retrieval system. We used data on the European region from July to August 2020 to carry out the training and testing of the retrieval system, respectively, and used the balloon-retrieved sounding data of temperature and humidity published by the University of Wyoming as standard truth values to evaluate the retrieval accuracy. Our preliminary research results show that, compared with the retrieval results of conventional deviation correction, the introduction of ANN algorithm error correction can improve the retrieval accuracy of the retrieval system effectively and the RMSE (Root-Mean-Square Error) of the temperature and humidity has a maximum accuracy of improvement of about 0.5 K (The K represents the thermodynamic temperature unit) and 5%, respectively. The temperature and humidity results obtained by the retrieval system were compared with Global Forecast System (GFS) forecast data. The retrieved temperature RMSE was less than 1.5 K on average, which was better than that for the GFS; the humidity RMSE was less than 15% as a whole, and better than the forecast profile between 100 hpa (1 hpa is 100 pa, the pa represents the air pressure unit) and 600 hpa. Compared with AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) products, the result of the retrieval system also had a higher accuracy. The main improvement of the temperature was at 200 hpa and 800 hpa, with maximum accuracy improvements of 2 K and 1.5 K, respectively. The RMSE of the humidity retrieved by the system was also better than the AIRS humidity products at most pressure levels, and the error of maximum difference could reach 15%. After combining the two algorithms, the FY-3D/HIRAS infrared hyperspectral retrieval system could obtain higher-precision temperature and humidity profiles, and relevant results could provide a reference for improving the accuracy of business products.

TI  - Using unmanned aerial vehicles to quantify spatial patterns of dominant vegetation along an elevation gradient in the typical Gobi region in Xinjiang, Northwest China
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Elevation gradient is a key environmental factor influencing the distribution of plants in the Gobi region. It can indirectly regulate the distribution of plants based on terrain and varying soil moisture, nutrient distribution, and particle composition. Undertaking ground vegetation surveys to observe vegetation distribution over large scales in the Gobi region is challenging due to the harsh environment and manpower constraints. In addition, due to the sparse vegetation distribution in the region, the precision of vegetation parameters extracted from satellite remote sensing images is low. Using the spatial-point pattern analysis method based on the Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) near-ground remote sensing data, this study analysed the spatial patterns of dominant plant species in the typical Gobi area of south of the Tianshan Mountains, Xinjiang in northwestern China along an altitudinal gradient in an alluvial fan. The results showed that dominant plants in the study area were distributed in a patchy pattern at the top of the diluvial fan and in a banded pattern in the middle and bottom. The richness of dominant species decreased with a decrease in altitude, and they were aggregated at small scales and randomly or uniformly distributed at large scales. In addition, degree of aggregation and uniformity in dominant species increased with a decrease in altitude. Interspecific relationships at the top of alluvial fan were weak with almost no correlation, and the correlations of dominant species were highly positive at small scales and highly negative at large scales, with a decrease in altitude. Both correlation analysis and grey correlation analysis indicated that the altitude and the soil moisture were the main factors influencing the spatial distribution of vegetation significantly, while the habitat heterogeneity was the main factor influencing the interspecific relationships. According to the results, UAVs can provide high-resolution data suitable for analysing sparsely distributed vegetation in the Gobi region. The results of the present study enhance our understanding of the factors influencing the distribution of plants in Gobi plant communities and provide a theoretical basis for the better conservation of the vegetation resources in the fragile ecological ecosystem.(c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Eco-environmental quality assessment and cause analysis of Qilian Mountain National Park based on GEE
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - The eco-environment is highly related to human life. Remote sensing technique can objectively and quantitatively evaluate the spatial and temporal variations of eco-environment quality and thus provide a scientific basis for regional eco-environment management. Based on the Google Earth Engine ( GEE) platform, we adopted Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing images as the basic data source to calculate the remote sensing ecological index ( RSEI) that reflects the eco-environment quality. Using RSEI, we evaluated the eco-environmental quality of Qilian Mountain National Park during 1989-2019 and analyzed the reasons. The results showed that RSEI performed well in assessing the eco-environment qua-lity of Qilian Mountain National Park. Greenness and wetness were the two indices with positive effects on the eco-environment quality, while dryness and heat indices had adverse effects. The analysis of spatial and temporal variations in Qilian Mountain National Park showed that the eco-environment quality presented a trend of "slow decline - rapid decline - increase" during 1989-2019. Changes in eco-environment quality were stable from 1989 to 1999, mainly mildly deteriorated from 1999 to 2009, and mainly mildly improved from 2009 to 2019. The analysis of the causes of eco-environment quality showed that the effects of all the four indices were significant. The strength of natural factors in influencing eco-environment quality were in order of greenness > dryness > wetness > heat in 1989; heat > greenness > wetness > dryness in 1999; dryness > heat > wetness > greenness in 2009; and greenness > wetness > dryness > heat in 2019. Animal husbandry was an important factor affecting the eco-environment quality of Qilian Mountains National Park. Our results suggested that the GEE -based platform could be used as a computing platform to evaluate the eco-environment quality of Qilian Mountain National Park. This platform extends the application of RSEI in the evaluation of eco-environment quality at large scale and long time series. The eco-environmental quality of Qilian Mountain National Park has developed in the right direction in recent years, although comprehensive management work needs further improvement.

TI  - Biological crust in sand and dust storm source areas of Asia and its impact on dust emission
T2  - ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Even though the biological crusts are critical to dust emissions, no sand and dust forecast model have considered the impacts of the biological crust in dust emission scheme. This situation mainly comes from two scientific difficulties: there is no large scale regional biological crust data available that can be used in the forecast model; there is no quantification of how biological crusts impact on sand emission. In this way, we studied the distribution of biological soil crust in sand and dust storm source areas of Central and East Asia using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite surface reflectance data collected in 2000-2019 to determine its potential impact on dust emission according to two empirical schemes. We further evaluated the relationships between soil crust coverage, roughness length, and dust emission to study SDS source areas. We found that biological crust is widely distributed in SDS source areas of Central and East Asia, with coverage rates of 19.8% in Central Asian deserts, 23.1% in the Gobi Desert, and 17.3%-32.8% in Chinese deserts (p > 0.05). Cyanobacteria and lichen coverage has increased in Chinese deserts, reflecting the recent impacts of the Project of Returning Farmland to Grassland and Farmland to Forests. However, biological soil crust coverage has not increased in Central Asian deserts or the Gobi Desert, and that in Central Asian deserts continues to decrease, demonstrating the complexity of the combined effects of human activities and climate change on its distribution. Biological soil crust increased the roughness length of Central and East Asian SDS source areas by 0.14-0.62 mm. The suppression of dust emission due to biological soil crust did not change among years during the study period. The horizontal and vertical dust flux inhibition coefficient (DFIC) were 2.0-11.0 and 1.7-2.9 (p > 0.05), respectively, clearly showing a suppressive effect. Improvement of the ecological environment in some deserts can lead to the ability of these crusts to inhibit dust erosion errors that must be considered in the dust emission scheme for areas where crust coverage has improved.

TI  - Typhoon Hato's precipitation characteristics based on PERSIANN
T2  - TROPICAL CYCLONE RESEARCH AND REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy precipitation induced by typhoons is the main driver of catastrophic flooding, and studying precipitation patterns is important for flood forecasting and early warning. Studying the space-time characteristics of heavy precipitation induced by typhoons requires a large range of observation data that cannot be obtained by ground-based rain gauge networks. Satellite-based estimation provides large domains of precipitation with high space-time resolution, facilitating the analysis of heavy precipitation patterns induced by typhoons. In this study, Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) satellite data were used to study the temporal and spatial features of precipitation induced by Typhoon Hato, which was the strongest typhoon of 2017 to make landfall in China. The results show that rainfall on the land lasted for six days from the typhoon making landfall to disappearing, reaching the maximum when the typhoon made landfall. Hato produced extremely high accumulated rainfall in South China, almost 300mm in Guangdong Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and 260mm in Hainan Province. The rainfall process was separated into three stages and rainfall was the focus in the second stage (5 h before making landfall to 35 h after making landfall).

TI  - Evaluation of Data Quality of FY-3D Satellite Sensor MERSI II over Marine Waters
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to promote the application of MERSI II data in the ocean, this paper uses the visible infrared optical imaging remote sensing instrument (VIIRS), which is one of the mainstream sensors for water color remote sensing, as a reference, from the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and other aspects to conducte a preliminary assessment of the MERSI II data quality. The results show that the SNR values of MERSI II are higher than 300 in the visible band, and the maximum can reach 900, which meet the water bodies monitoring requirements. The SNR values of MERSI II are slightly lower than that of VIIRS in the visible band and the near-infrared band, and are not much different from VIIRS in the short-wave infrared band. In addition, the radiance calibrated MERSI II reflectance data at the top-of-atmosphere is in good agreement with the VIIRS data, the determination coefficients (R-2) are higher than 0.5, and the blue band R-2 can reach more than 0.9. The mean absolute percentage error (E-MAPE) is less than 30%. The R-2 in the 670-865 nm band of the Western Pacific is about 0.5, and the E-MAPE is 5%-15%. The R-2 can reach 0.8 in the 670-865 nm band of China's coastal waters, and the E-MAPE is 7 A-24%. After a simple linear fitting, the MERSI II reflectance data at the top-of-atmosphere is closer to the VIIRS data. The E-MAPE in the visible band drops to 8%, and the blue band drops to 3%. The above results show that the quality of MERSI II data is comparable to VIIRS and can be used for ocean remote sensing applications.

TI  - Improving Parcel-Level Mapping of Smallholder Crops from VHSR Imagery: An Ensemble Machine-Learning-Based Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Explicit spatial information about crop types on smallholder farms is important for the development of local precision agriculture. However, due to highly fragmented and heterogeneous cropland landscapes, fine-scale mapping of smallholder crops, based on low- and medium-resolution satellite images and relying on a single machine learning (ML) classifier, generally fails to achieve satisfactory performance. This paper develops an ensemble ML-based framework to improve the accuracy of parcel-level smallholder crop mapping from very high spatial resolution (VHSR) images. A typical smallholder agricultural area in central China covered by WorldView-2 images is selected to demonstrate our approach. This approach involves the task of distinguishing eight crop-level agricultural land use types. To this end, six widely used individual ML classifiers are evaluated. We further improved their performance by independently implementing bagging and stacking ensemble learning (EL) techniques. The results show that the bagging models improved the performance of unstable classifiers, but these improvements are limited. In contrast, the stacking models perform better, and the Stacking #2 model (overall accuracy = 83.91%, kappa = 0.812), which integrates the three best-performing individual classifiers, performs the best of all of the built models and improves the classwise accuracy of almost all of the land use types. Since classification performance can be significantly improved without adding costly data collection, stacking-ensemble mapping approaches are valuable for the spatial management of complex agricultural areas. We also demonstrate that using geometric and textural features extracted from VHSR images can improve the accuracy of parcel-level smallholder crop mapping. The proposed framework shows the great potential of combining EL technology with VHSR imagery for accurate mapping of smallholder crops, which could facilitate the development of parcel-level crop identification systems in countries dominated by smallholder agriculture.

TI  - Remote sensing of lake ice phenology in Alaska
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The timing of lake ice breakup and freezeup are important indicators of climate change in Arctic and boreal regions because they respond rapidly and directly to variations in climate conditions. Despite its importance, lake ice phenology remains poorly documented in most lakes of Alaska. To fill this data gap, we constructed a remote sensing-derived lake ice phenology database covering all lakes in Alaska larger than 1 km(2) (n = 4241) over the period 2000-2019. This dataset, which includes lake ice on/off dates and lake ice duration, was based on an automatic method using daily moderate resolution imaging spectroradiomenter (MODIS) imagery to measure lake ice fraction. This method extracts lake ice pixels from MODIS images using a dynamic threshold that was calibrated against Landsat Fmask. Different filters that account for clouds, polar night, and other sources of error were applied to increase the accuracy of lake ice phenology estimation. Trend analysis shows earlier breakup (-5.5 d decade(-1)) for 440 lakes and later breakup (7.5 d decade(-1)) for four lakes (p < 0.05). A total of 289 lakes had significant trends toward later freezeup (2.9 d decade(-1)) and 11 lakes towards earlier freezeup (-3.3 d decade(-1)). Most lakes with significant trends are north of the Brooks Range. This dataset can contribute to increased understanding of interactions between lake processes and climate change, and it supports the study of biogeochemical, limnological and ecological regimes in Alaska and pan-Arctic regions.

TI  - Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Protist Infections in Hospital Inpatients in Southwestern China
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cryptosporidium spp., Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia duodenalis, and Blastocystis sp. infections have been frequently reported as etiological agents for gastroenteritis, but also as common gut inhabitants in apparently healthy individuals. Between July 2016 and March 2017, stool samples (n = 507) were collected from randomly selected individuals (male/female ratio: 1.1, age range: 38-63 years) from two sentinel hospitals in Tengchong City Yunnan Province, China. Molecular (PCR and Sanger sequencing) methods were used to detect and genotype the investigated protist species. Carriage/infection rates were: Blastocystis sp. 9.5% (95% CI: 7.1-12.4%), G. duodenalis 2.2% (95% CI: 1.1-3.8%); and E. histolytica 2.0% (95% CI: 0.9-3.6%). Cryptosporidium spp. was not detected at all. Overall, 12.4% (95% CI: 9.7-15.6) of the participants harbored at least one enteric protist species. The most common coinfection was E. histolytica and Blastocystis sp. (1.0%; 95% CI: 0.3-2.2). Sequence analyses revealed that 90.9% (10/11) of the genotyped G. duodenalis isolates corresponded to the sub-assemblage AI. The remaining sequence (9.1%, 1/11) was identified as sub-assemblage BIV. Five different Blastocystis subtypes, including ST3 (43.7%, 21/48), ST1 (27.1%, 13/48), ST7 (18.8%, 9/48), ST4 (8.3%, 4/48), and ST2 (2.1%, 1/48) were identified. Statistical analyses confirmed that (i) the co-occurrence of protist infections was purely random, (ii) no associations were observed among the four protist species found, and (iii) neither their presence, individually or jointly, nor the patient's age was predictors for developing clinical symptoms associated with these infections. Overall, these protist mono- or coinfections are asymptomatic and do not follow any pattern.

TI  - FSRSS-Net: High-Resolution Mapping of Buildings from Middle-Resolution Satellite Images Using a Super-Resolution Semantic Segmentation Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite mapping of buildings and built-up areas used to be delineated from high spatial resolution (e.g., meters or sub-meters) and middle spatial resolution (e.g., tens of meters or hundreds of meters) satellite images, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, it is important to explore a deep-learning approach to delineate high-resolution semantic maps of buildings from middle-resolution satellite images. The approach is termed as super-resolution semantic segmentation in this paper. Specifically, we design a neural network with integrated low-level image features of super-resolution and high-level semantic features of super-resolution, which is trained with Sentinel-2A images (i.e., 10 m) and higher-resolution semantic maps (i.e., 2.5 m). The network, based on super-resolution semantic segmentation features is called FSRSS-Net. In China, the 35 cities are partitioned into three groups, i.e., 19 cities for model training, four cities for quantitative testing and the other 12 cities for qualitative generalization ability analysis of the learned networks. A large-scale sample dataset is created and utilized to train and validate the performance of the FSRSS-Net, which includes 8597 training samples and 766 quantitative accuracy evaluation samples. Quantitative evaluation results show that: (1) based on the 10 m Sentinel-2A image, the FSRSS-Net can achieve super-resolution semantic segmentation and produce 2.5 m building recognition results, and there is little difference between the accuracy of 2.5 m results by FSRSS-Net and 10 m results by U-Net. More importantly, the 2.5 m building recognition results by FSRSS-Net have higher accuracy than the 2.5 m results by U-Net 10 m building recognition results interpolation up-sampling; (2) from the spatial visualization of the results, the building recognition results of 2.5 m are more precise than those of 10 m, and the outline of the building is better depicted. Qualitative analysis shows that: (1) the learned FSRSS-Net can be also well generalized to other cities that are far from training regions; (2) the FSRSS-Net can still achieve comparable results to the U-Net 2 m building recognition results, even when the U-Net is directly trained using both 2-meter resolution GF2 satellite images and corresponding semantic labels.

TI  - HOG-ShipCLSNet: A Novel Deep Learning Network With HOG Feature Fusion for SAR Ship Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship classification in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a fundamental and significant step in ocean surveillance. Recently, with the rise of deep learning (DL), modern abstract features from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have hugely improved SAR ship classification accuracy. However, most existing CNN-based SAR ship classifiers overly rely on abstract features, but uncritically abandon traditional mature hand-crafted features, which may incur some challenges for further improving accuracy. Hence, this article proposes a novel DL network with histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) feature fusion (HOG-ShipCLSNet) for preferable SAR ship classification. In HOG-ShipCLSNet, four mechanisms are proposed to ensure superior classification accuracy, that is, 1) a multiscale classification mechanism (MS-CLS-Mechanism); 2) a global self-attention mechanism (GS-ATT-Mechanism); 3) a fully connected balance mechanism (FC-BAL-Mechanism); and 4) an HOG feature fusion mechanism (HOG-FF-Mechanism). We perform sufficient ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of these four mechanisms. Finally, our experimental results on two open SAR ship datasets (OpenSARShip and FUSAR-Ship) jointly reveal that HOG-ShipCLSNet dramatically outperforms both modern CNN-based methods and traditional hand-crafted feature methods.

TI  - Injection of Traditional Hand-Crafted Features into Modern CNN-Based Models for SAR Ship Classification: What, Why, Where, and How
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rise of artificial intelligence, many advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship classifiers based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved better accuracies than traditional hand-crafted feature ones. However, most existing CNN-based models uncritically abandon traditional hand-crafted features, and rely excessively on abstract ones of deep networks. This may be controversial, potentially creating challenges to improve classification performance further. Therefore, in view of this situation, this paper explores preliminarily the possibility of injection of traditional hand-crafted features into modern CNN-based models to further improve SAR ship classification accuracy. Specifically, we will-(1) illustrate what this injection technique is, (2) explain why it is needed, (3) discuss where it should be applied, and (4) describe how it is implemented. Experimental results on the two open three-category OpenSARShip-1.0 and seven-category FUSAR-Ship datasets indicate that it is effective to perform injection of traditional hand-crafted features into CNN-based models to improve classification accuracy. Notably, the maximum accuracy improvement reaches 6.75%. Hence, we hold the view that it is not advisable to abandon uncritically traditional hand-crafted features, because they can also play an important role in CNN-based models.

TI  - A study on historical location and evolution of Lop Nor in China with maps and DEM
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Lop Sea, located at the east end of the Tarim Basin, Northwest China, dried up permanently, which is the terminal lake of the Tarim River. Lop Sea was considered as the lake basin of Lop Nor since Quaternary. However, the possibility that Lop Nor was away from the Lop Sea in historical time is crucial to be discussed to interpret the proxy records in sediment profiles. To obtain a general view of the evolution of Lop Nor and Lop Sea in a historical period, several approaches were adopted in this paper. First, the Qianlong Thirteen-Row Atlas, an ancient imperial atlas of the Qing Dynasty, which was completed around 1760, indicated that the Tarim River formed a relatively large lake at its modern upstream region. Second, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with a 10-m spatial resolution and a relative precision of 0.42 m was derived from TanDEM-X/TerraSAR-X satellite image pairs using the interferometry method, which was verified using ICESat-GLAS laser footprints and a local DEM acquired by a drone. Finally, based on the spatial analysis of historical documents, expedition reports, sediment profiles and archaeological evidence, it can be deduced that the lacustrine deposition was discontinued in the Lop Sea. Six episodes in the evolutionary history of the drainage system in eastern Tarim Basin were summarized. The proved depositional condition variations could be used for future interpretation of proxy records in sediment. The high-accurate DEM provided a reference for the location of further fieldwork in the Lop Sea. The method proposed in this paper may be efficient for the research of inland lakes or rivers in global arid regions.

TI  - Estimating Urban Evapotranspiration at 10m Resolution Using Vegetation Information from Sentinel-2: A Case Study for the Beijing Sponge City
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating accurately evapotranspiration (ET) in urban ecosystems is difficult due to the complex surface conditions and a lack of fine measurement of vegetation dynamics. To overcome such difficulties using recent developments of remote sensing technology, we estimate leaf area index (LAI) from Sentinel-2-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using the NDVI-LAI nonlinear relationship. By applying Sentinel-2-based LAI and land cover classification (LCC) to a carbon-water coupling model (PML-V2.1) with surface meteorological forcing data as input, we, for the first time, estimate monthly ET at 10m x 10m resolution for the Beijing Sponge City. Results show that for the whole sponge city during June 2018, the LAI, ET and gross primary productivity (GPP) are 0.83 m(2) m 2, 1.6 mm d (-1) and 2.8 gC m (-2) d (-1), respectively. For different LCCs, lakes and rivers have the highest ET (>= 8 mm d 1), followed by mixed forests and croplands (ET is 4-6 mm d (-1) and LAI is 2-3 m(2) m (-2)) with dominant contribution (>80%) from plant transpiration, while grasslands (2-4 mm d (-1)) have 50-70% from transpiration due to smaller LAI (1 similar to 2 m(2) m (-2)). The impervious surfaces occupying similar to 60% of the sponge city area, have the smallest ET (<2.0 mm d 1) in which interception evaporation by impervious surface contributes 20-30%, and transpiration from greenbelts (0.5-1.0 m(2) m (-2) of LAI) contributes 40-50%. These findings can provide a valuable scientific basis for policymaking and urban water use planning. This study proposes a Sentinel2-based technology for estimating ET as a feasible framework to evaluate city-level hydrological dynamics in urban ecosystems.

TI  - High Temporal Resolution Land Use Regression Models with POI Characteristics of the PM<sub>2.5</sub> Distribution in Beijing, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - PM2.5 is one of the primary components of air pollutants, and it has wide impacts on human health. Land use regression models have the typical disadvantage of low temporal resolution. In this study, various point of interests (POIs) variables are added to the usual predictive variables of the general land use regression (LUR) model to improve the temporal resolution. Hourly PM2.5 concentration data from 35 monitoring stations in Beijing, China, were used. Twelve LUR models were developed for working days and non-working days of the heating season and non-heating season, respectively. The results showed that these models achieved good fitness in winter and summer, and the highest R-2 of the winter and summer models were 0.951 and 0.628, respectively. Meteorological factors, POIs, and roads factors were the most critical predictive variables in the models. This study also showed that POIs had time characteristics, and different types of POIs showed different explanations ranging from 5.5% to 41.2% of the models on working days or non-working days, respectively. Therefore, this study confirmed that POIs can greatly improve the temporal resolution of LUR models, which is significant for high precision exposure studies.

TI  - Fengyun-3D/MERSI-II Cloud Thermodynamic Phase Determination Using a Machine-Learning Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global cloud thermodynamic phase (CP) is normally derived from polar-orbiting satellite imaging data with high spatial resolution. However, constraining conditions and empirical thresholds used in the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) CP algorithm are closely associated with spectral properties of the MODIS infrared (IR) spectral bands, with obvious deviations and incompatibility induced when the algorithm is applied to data from other similar space-based sensors. To reduce the algorithm dependence on spectral properties and empirical thresholds for CP retrieval, a machine learning (ML)-based methodology was developed for retrieving CP data from China's new-generation polar-orbiting satellite, FY-3D/MERSI-II (Fengyun-3D/Moderate Resolution Spectral Imager-II). Five machine learning algorithms were used, namely, k-nearest-neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Stacking and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT). The RF algorithm gave the best performance. One year of EOS (Earth Observation System) MODIS CP products (July 2018 to June 2019) were used as reference labels to train the relationship between MODIS CP (MYD06 IR) and six IR bands of MERSI-II. CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization), MODIS, and FY-3D/MERSI-II CP products were used together for cross-validation. Results indicate strong spatial consistency between ML-based MERSI-II and MODIS CP products. The hit rate (HR) of random forest (RF) CP product could reach 0.85 compared with MYD06 IR CP products. In addition, when compared with the operational FY-3D/MERSI CP product, the RF-based CP product had higher HRs. Using the CALIOP cloud product as an independent reference, the liquid-phase accuracy of the RF CP product was higher than that of operational FY-3D/MERSI-II and MYD06 IR CP products. This study aimed to establish a robust algorithm for deriving FY-3D/MERSI-II CP climate data record (CDR) for research and applications.

TI  - Cultivated Land Use Zoning Based on Soil Function Evaluation from the Perspective of Black Soil Protection
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Given that cultivated land serves as a strategic resource to ensure national food security, blind emphasis on improvement of food production capacity can lead to soil overutilization and impair other soil functions. Therefore, we took Heilongjiang province as an example to conduct a multi-functional evaluation of soil at the provincial scale. A combination of soil, climate, topography, land use, and remote sensing data were used to evaluate the functions of primary productivity, provision and cycling of nutrients, provision of functional and intrinsic biodiversity, water purification and regulation, and carbon sequestration and regulation of cultivated land in 2018. We designed a soil function discriminant matrix, constructed the supply-demand ratio, and evaluated the current status of supply and demand of soil functions. Soil functions demonstrated a distribution pattern of high grade in the northeast and low grade in the southwest, mostly in second-level areas. The actual supply of primary productivity functions in 71.32% of the region cannot meet the current needs of the population. The dominant function of soil in 34.89% of the area is water purification and regulation, and most of the cultivated land belongs to the functional balance region. The results presented herein provide a theoretical basis for optimization of land patterns and improvement of cultivated land use management on a large scale, and is of great significance to the sustainable use of black soil resources and improvement of comprehensive benefits.

TI  - Retrieval and Spatio-Temporal Variations Analysis of Yangtze River Water Clarity from 2017 to 2020 Based on Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yangtze River is the third longest river in the world. Monitoring and protecting its water quality are important for economic and social development. Water clarity (Secchi disk depth, SDD) is an important reference index for evaluating water quality. In this study, Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) remote sensing images were utilized together with the Forel-Ule index (FUI) and hue angle alpha to construct an SDD retrieval model, which was applied to the Yangtze River from 2017 to 2020, which was used to describe color in the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) color space to construct an SDD retrieval model that was applied to the Yangtze River for the period 2017-2020. Further, the spatial distribution, seasonal variation, inter-annual variation, and driving factors of the observed SDD variations were analyzed. The spatial distribution pattern of the Yangtze River was high in the west and low in the east. The main driving factors affecting the Yangtze River SDD was sediment runoff, water level, and precipitation. The upstream and downstream Yangtze River SDD were negatively correlated with the change in water level and sediment runoff, whereas the midstream Yangtze River SDD was positively correlated with the change in water level and sediment runoff. The upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and overall SDD showed a weak downward trend, and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River remained almost unchanged.

TI  - Prediction of axillary response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in clinical node positive breast cancer
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: For clinical lymph node positive (cN+) breast cancer, the false negative rate of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is high. Prediction of axillary response after NAC may provide a better way of patient selection. Our study was designed to evaluate factors associated with axillary pathologic complete response (ypN0) after NAC, and to assess the accuracy of the published Olga Kantor predictive model.Methods: A total of 406 patients with cN+ breast cancer were enrolled in this study. All patients had received full courses of NAC before undergoing axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Univariate analyses and multivariate analysis were performed to explore independent predictors of ypN0. Then the Olga Kantor model were validated by the data of patients enrolled. The Olga Kantor model is not ideal because the pathological breast tumor response was not available before surgery, the clinical breast tumor response was assessed in our study as a modification. The accuracy of the validation and modification of Olga Kantor model were assessed by the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC).Results: Age (P=0.004), molecular subtype (P= 0.000), tumor grade (P=0.006), clinical tumor response (P=0.000) and Ki-67 (P=0.009) were correlated with ypN0. Age, molecular subtype and the clinical tumor response were independent predictors of ypN0 (P<0.05). In validation and modification model, the AUC values were 0.795 and 0.789, respectively, there were no significant differences between the two models (P=0.536). For model score <= 3, 4-7 and >= 8 in the modification model, the ypN0 rate were 3.9% (2/51), 22.5% (59/262) and 67.7% (63/93), respectively.Conclusions: The Olga Kantor predictive model had high accuracy predicting ypN0 after NAC. Our modification model achieved the same predictive efficiency but is more feasible for clinical practice. Patients with higher scores were more likely to achieve ypN0, so SLNB might be a better way than ALND. However, more patient data and multicenter cohort trials are needed to verify the study.

TI  - Winter wheat yield estimation based on assimilated Sentinel-2 images with the CERES-Wheat model
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Assimilating Sentinel-2 images with the CERES-Wheat model can improve the precision of winter wheat yield estimates at a regional scale. To verify this method, we applied the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to assimilate the leaf area index (LAI) derived from Sentinel-2 data and simulated by the CERES-Wheat model. From this, we obtained the assimilated daily LAI during the growth stage of winter wheat across three counties located in the southeast of the Loess Plateau in China: Xiangfen, Xinjiang, and Wenxi. We assigned LAI weights at different growth stages by comparing the improved analytic hierarchy method, the entropy method, and the normalized combination weighting method, and constructed a yield estimation model with the measurements to accurately estimate the yield of winter wheat. We found that the changes of assimilated LAI during the growth stage of winter wheat strongly agreed with the simulated LAI. With the correction of the derived LAI from the Sentinel-2 images, the LAI from the green-up stage to the heading-filling stage was enhanced, while the LAI decrease from the milking stage was slowed down, which was more in line with the actual changes of LAI for winter wheat. We also compared the simulated and derived LAI and found the assimilated LAI had reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) by 0.43 and 0.29 m(2) m(-2), respectively, based on the measured LAI. The assimilation improved the estimation accuracy of the LAI time series. The highest determination coefficient (R-2) was 0.8627 and the lowest RMSE was 472.92 kg ha(-1) in the regression of the yields estimated by the normalized weighted assimilated LAI method and measurements. The relative error of the estimated yield of winter wheat in the study counties was less than 1%, suggesting that Sentinel-2 data with high spatial-temporal resolution can be assimilated with the CERES-Wheat model to obtain more accurate regional yield estimates.

TI  - Spatio-temporal differentiation of ecological carrying capacity of the protected area : A case study of Jinshitan in Dalian.
T2  - Acta Ecologica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the ecological carrying capacity of nature reserves is of great significance to understand its spatiotemporal differentiation and sustainable development. Jinshitan Geoheritage Reserve is a combination area of national park and scenic spot. It is a place where contradictions and conflicts exist between ecological protection and regional development. It is also a typical representative area of multi-status nature reserves. Based on the remote sensing data and the land use data of 1998, 2003, 2007, 2012, 2015, and 2018, this paper selects Jinshitan, a nature reserve with multiple functions of protection and development, as the research area. An evaluation system of ecological carrying capacity is constructed from three aspects : elastic ecological support, resource and environment capacity, and socio-economic coordination. We evaluate the spatial and temporal difference of the ecological carrying capacity of Jinshitan by using the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. The results show that : ( 1) in the three criteria layers, the elastic ecological support force and the capacity of resources and environment show a sharp downward trend, while the social and economic coordination force shows a trend of decreasing first, then increasing, and developing steadily. (2) The ecological carrying capacity of Jinshitan has changed from high to low. From 0.7572 to 0.2940 from 1998 to 2018, the carrying capacity level has decreased in recent 30 years. (3) The ecological carrying capacity of sea and land is totally different, the land is high, and the coast is low. The coastal area is gradually weakened from the north land to the south coast, showing extremely unbalanced spatial differentiation of sea and land. Through the analysis of ecological carrying capacity of Jinshitan from 1998 to 2018, it can reflect the changes in the ecological carrying capacity of the region, provide reference for the ecological carrying capacity assessment and sustainable development of other nature reserves.

TI  - Re-exploration of fault dipping direction in Iran Sang sefid 2017 <i>M</i><sub>W</sub>6.1 earthquake using imaging geodesy
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The first step of earthquake risk analysis is to determine the blind fault parameters. There are many disputes about the parameter determination of each blind fault. In this paper, we took 2017 M(W)6.1 Sang sefid earthquake as an example. First, we defined two possible fault models based on the elastic half space model. On this basis, the 2D (East-West and Up-Down) co-seismic deformation is inverted by Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 ascending and descending InSAR data. Results of two fault models reveal the characteristics of the rupture mode as well as the thrust features in the subduction zone. For more details of the fault and fully explaining the dipping angle of the fault, we used constrained least squares and bayesian inversion methods respectively obtained the optimal fault parameters and derived the anisotropy of two fault models. The inverted slip distribution showed that the northeast dipping fault owned smaller residual and its slip distribution was more reasonable. By further analyzing the 59 relocated aftershocks, we found that the slip distribution and depth extension of the aftershocks are more consistent with the northeast dipping model. Besides, the strike of the northeast dip fault is basically parallel to the known active fault in the northeast of Iran. Therefore, it can be regarded as a further evidence of the Sang sefid earthquake's seismological fault as a WNW-ESE fault. The fault parameters we obtained in this paper are strike 314.67 degrees, dip 41.5 degrees, and the average rake 128.8 degrees. The fault features northeast dip thrust with right-lateral strike slip. The inverted slip mainly distributed at 6-22 km along the strike direction. The maximum slip of 1.09 m located at a depth of 7 km. This earthquake did not rupture the surface, and the moment tensor was 1.427x10(18)N.m, equivalent to the M(W)6.07 earthquake.

TI  - Radiometric Cross-Calibration of Large-View-Angle Satellite Sensors Using Global Searching to Reduce BRDF Influence
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite sensors with large view angles can provide wide-swath imaging for earth observations, which pose new challenges for cross-calibration due to bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). To address these challenges, we adopted global searching (GS) algorithms to "search" calibration coefficients with BRDF considered. The GS-based methods were implemented to calibrate two Chinese large-view-angle sensors: the Gaofen-1 first wide-field-of-view (WFV1) camera and Gaofen- 4 panchromatic multispectral sensor (PMS) with Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager (OLI) as references. Validations were conducted by evaluating the top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance and surface reflectance using synchronous OLI data. The mean relative biases (MRBs) of the GS-derived TOA radiance for the WFV1 were smaller than 5.5% compared with the OLI-simulated TOA radiance, while those of using official coefficients were up to 13%. The performances of the GS method and traditional method using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF products for BRDF correction are comparable. The GS-based scheme has the potential to correct BRDF during cross-calibration and thus free cross-calibration of large-view-angle sensors from BRDF models and products.

TI  - A Spatio-Temporal Local Association Query Algorithm for Multi-Source Remote Sensing Big Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is extremely important to extract valuable information and achieve efficient integration of remote sensing data. The multi-source and heterogeneous nature of remote sensing data leads to the increasing complexity of these relationships, and means that the processing mode based on data ontology cannot meet requirements any more. On the other hand, the multi-dimensional features of remote sensing data bring more difficulties in data query and analysis, especially for datasets with a lot of noise. Therefore, data quality has become the bottleneck of data value discovery, and a single batch query is not enough to support the optimal combination of global data resources. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal local association query algorithm for remote sensing data (STLAQ). Firstly, we design a spatio-temporal data model and a bottom-up spatio-temporal correlation network. Then, we use the method of partition-based clustering and the method of spectral clustering to measure the correlation between spatio-temporal correlation networks. Finally, we construct a spatio-temporal index to provide joint query capabilities. We carry out local association query efficiency experiments to verify the feasibility of STLAQ on multi-scale datasets. The results show that the STLAQ weakens the barriers between remote sensing data, and improves their application value effectively.

TI  - Extraction of Irrigation Signals by Using SMAP Soil Moisture Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To allow extraction of irrigation signals from satellite-derived data on soil moisture, this study describes the development of an irrigation signal extraction method that takes into account multiple environmental factors in irrigation. Firstly, the fuzzy membership functions of irrigation relating to multiple environmental factors are constructed. Then, a model is built based on the fuzzy membership functions by using operation rules of fuzzy sets, which is used to infer the relevant degree of irrigation to nonirrigation. Finally, the irrigation signals in satellite-based soil moisture data are recognized according to the relevant degree. Taking Henan Province in the North China Plain as the study area, the proposed method is used to extract irrigation signals from the SMAP Level 3 Passive Soil Moisture Product. Extracted irrigation signals from two SMAP grids are validated using daily in situ soil moisture and precipitation data, with the results showing correct identification of most of the irrigation signals. By grading the membership degree of the extracted irrigation signals, irrigation frequency maps for the 2016-2017 winter crop growth season and the 2017 summer crop growth season are obtained for Henan Province. Compared to the irrigation frequency maps with data on the annual precipitation and the annual potential evapotranspiration, the irrigation frequency maps show a spatial pattern opposite that of the annual precipitation and a spatial pattern similar to that of the annual potential evapotranspiration. It is common sense that areas with low precipitation and high evapotranspiration need more irrigation frequency and irrigation water. Thus, the spatial patterns of irrigation frequency maps are reasonable in a sense. However, it should be noted that the observed irrigation data used in the qualitative assessments are rendered less convincing by the SMAP product's coarse resolution. Quantitative validation of extracted irrigation signals remains a significant challenge, and small-scale irrigation cannot be captured by coarse-resolution satellite-based soil moisture products. Thus, a high-resolution soil moisture product should be used to extract irrigation signals in future.

TI  - Tracking Historical Wetland Changes in the China Side of the Amur River Basin Based on Landsat Imagery and Training Samples Migration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the recent decades, development of agricultural and human settlements have severely affected wetlands on the China-side of the Amur River Basin (CARB). A long-term holistic view of spatio-temporal variations of the wetlands on the CARB is essential for supporting sustainable conservation of wetlands in this region. In this study, a training sample migration method along with Random Forest classifier were adopted to map wetland and other land covers from two key seasons image collections. The proposed classification method was applied to Landsat images, and a 30-m resolution dataset was obtained, which reflected the dynamic changes of historical wetland distribution on the CARB region from 1990 to 2010. As the accuracy assessments showed, land cover maps of the CARB had high accuracies. The classification results indicated that the wetland area decreased from 89,432 km(2) to 75,061 km(2) between 1990 and 2010, with a net loss of 16%, which was mainly converted to paddy field and dry farmland, and the changes were most obvious in Sanjiang Plain and Songnen Plain. This suggests that agricultural activities are the main cause of wetland loss. The results can provide reliable information for the research on wetland management and sustainable development of the society and economy in the CARB.

TI  - Urban Flood Analysis in Ungauged Drainage Basin Using Short-Term and High-Resolution Remotely Sensed Rainfall Records
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing flooding in urban areas is a great challenge due to the lack of long-term rainfall records. This study hereby seeks to propose a modeling framework for urban flood analysis in ungauged drainage basins. A platform called "RainyDay" combined with a nine-year record of hourly, 0.1 degrees remotely sensed rainfall data are used to generate extreme rainfall events. These events are used as inputs to a hydrological model. The comprehensive characteristics of urban flooding are reflected through the projection pursuit method. We simulate runoff for different return periods for a typical urban drainage basin. The combination of RainyDay and short-record remotely sensed rainfall can reproduce recent observed rainfall frequencies, which are relatively close to the design rainfall calculated by the intensity-duration-frequency formula. More specifically, the design rainfall is closer at high (higher than 20-yr) return period or long duration (longer than 6 h). Contrasting with the flood-simulated results under different return periods, RainyDay-based estimates may underestimate the flood characteristics under low return period or short duration scenarios, but they can reflect the characteristics with increasing duration or return period. The proposed modeling framework provides an alternative way to estimate the ensemble spread of rainfall and flood estimates rather than a single estimate value.

TI  - Assessment of the Urban Impact on Surface and Screen-Level Temperature in the ALADIN-Climate Driven SURFEX Land Surface Model for Budapest
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface models with detailed urban parameterization schemes provide adequate tools to estimate the impact of climate change in cities, because they rely on the results of the regional climate model, while operating on km scale at low cost. In this paper, the SURFEX land surface model driven by the evaluation and control runs of ALADIN-Climate regional climate model is validated over Budapest from the aspect of urban impact on temperature. First, surface temperature of SURFEX with forcings from ERA-Interim driven ALADIN-Climate was compared against the MODIS land surface temperature for a 3-year period. Second, the impact of the ARPEGE global climate model driven ALADIN-Climate was assessed on the 2 m temperature of SURFEX and was validated against measurements of a suburban station for 30 years. The spatial extent of surface urban heat island (SUHI) is exaggerated in SURFEX from spring to autumn, because the urbanized gridcells are generally warmer than their rural vicinity, while the observed SUHI extent is more variable. The model reasonably simulates the seasonal means and diurnal cycle of the 2 m temperature in the suburban gridpoint, except summer when strong positive bias occurs. However, comparing the two experiments from the aspect of nocturnal UHI, only minor differences arose. The thorough validation underpins the applicability of SURFEX driven by ALADIN-Climate for future urban climate projections.

TI  - Assessing the impacts of land use on riparian vegetation dynamics in Osun State, Nigeria
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - The existence of riparian vegetation is greatly threatened by change in land uses in Nigeria and information on historical management of land use which influences riparian vegetation dynamics is critical to the conservation of plants species diversity. This information is poorly understood especially in Nigeria and by extension in Africa. This study therefore assessed the areas covered by riparian forests in Osun State, Nigeria in order to identify the main drivers of its decline using optical remote sensing data. It also assessed the availability and distribution of the riparian forests over three decades (1986-2016) using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM). Results showed that the riparian forests covered 546.18km(2) (6.40%) with about 308riparian forests distributed across the state in 1986 but had declined to 176 by 2016. Three decades later, areas covered by riparian forests decreased to171.69km(2) (2.01%), representing a decline of about 69% and was predicted a rapid transition to disturbed lands. Human activities such as logging, farming, grazing and construction have greatly influenced the riparian vegetation cover with obvious decline in extent, distribution and quality. Observation from our case study showed that the disappearance of these forests is taken place at a rate that is faster than the predicted level of the Nigerian riparian forest loss by 2040. Notably deforestation, agriculture and urbanization are the main drivers of this decline, of the African gallery forests.

TI  - Zooplankton community associated with mesophotic coral reefs in the Colombian Caribbean Sea
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The morphological, phenological and ecological characteristics of shallow coral reefs have been widely studied, but only recently have mesophotic corals begun to be studied. Very little is known about these ecosystems and their associated communities, such as the zooplankton community, which constitutes a food source for reefs and for the organisms that inhabit them. In the present study, changes in zooplankton composition were characterised during two hydroclimatic periods in a mesophotic environment of the submarine mountain Bajo Frijol, in Corales de Profundidad National Natural Park, Colombia. Zooplankton was collected using a portable pumping device, which contained three collectors of differing mesh sizes; this allowed the capture of zooplankton ranging in size from 45 to 300 mu m. Temperature, conductivity, oxygen and pH were obtained and complemented with MODIS AQUA satellite information. In this ecosystem, the zooplankton organisms with the greatest richness and abundance were small-sized copepods, radiolarians and tintinnids. The oceanography of the area results in greater zooplankton abundance, richness, and diversity in June when the coastal current allows greater chlorophyll-a concentrations in the area and smaller organisms are favoured by greater retention within the corals of the mesophotic system. The biodiversity reported for Bajo Frijol is the first detailed approach to the community of mesophotic coral reefs in the Colombian Caribbean Sea, contributing to new records to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To report background intussusception epidemiology in children under-two years in Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu state, India, prior to rotavirus vaccine (RVV) introduction. Methods Prospective sentinel surveillance was done at four hospitals in Coimbatore during April 2016 to September 2017. The children aged >1 mo and < 24 mo with diagnosed intussusception were recruited and data on clinical, treatment, diet, immunization, and sociodemography were collected. Results Sixty-eight children with intussusception were recruited. Among them 76.5% were infants with male predominance (57.4%) and 48.5% were 4-8 mo old. Vomiting (83.8%), pain in abdomen (including excessive crying) (72.1%), and bloody stools (45.6%) were the main symptoms. Reduction was tried in 92.6% cases with success in 83.8%. Surgery was needed by 16.2% children. No child died. Any RVV dose was received by 24.1% children and 2 children received RVV in 8-21 d and none within 1-7 d window. The incidence of intussusception requiring hospitalization was estimated to be 36.4 and 11.7 cases/100,000 children/y for the first and second years, respectively. Conclusion Intussusception occurred in infants even without RVV exposure. Continued surveillance is needed to document the changes in intussusception epidemiology after RVV introduction.

TI  - Prostate cancer risk variants of the HOXB genetic locus
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The G84E germline mutation of HOXB13 predisposes to prostate cancer and is clinically tested for familial cancer care. We investigated the HOXB locus to define a potentially broader contribution to prostate cancer heritability. We sought HOXB locus germline variants altering prostate cancer risk in three European-ancestry case-control study populations (combined 7812 cases and 5047 controls): the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics Study; the Nashville Familial Prostate Cancer Study; and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Multiple rare genetic variants had concordant and strong risk effects in these study populations and exceeded genome-wide significance. Independent risk signals were best detected by sentinel variants rs559612720 within SKAP1 (OR=8.1, P=2E-9) and rs138213197 (G84E) within HOXB13 (OR=5.6, P=2E-11), separated by 567 kb. Half of carriers inherited both risk alleles, while others inherited either alone. Under mutual adjustment, the variants separately carried 3.6- and 3.1-fold risk, respectively, while joint inheritance carried 11.3-fold risk. These risks were further accentuated among men meeting criteria for hereditary prostate cancer, and further still for those with early-onset or aggressive disease. Among hereditary prostate cancer cases diagnosed under age 60 and with aggressive disease, joint inheritance carried a risk of OR=27.7 relative to controls, P=2E-8. The HOXB sentinel variant pair more fully captured genetic risk for prostate cancer within the study populations than either variant alone.

TI  - Syndromic surveillance using monthly aggregate health systems information data: methods with application to COVID-19 in Liberia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 circulation is imperative to inform local public health response. However, it has been hindered by limited access to SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests and testing infrastructure. In regions with limited testing capacity, routinely collected health data might be leveraged to identify geographical locales experiencing higher than expected rates of COVID-19-associated symptoms for more specific testing activities.Methods: We developed syndromic surveillance tools to analyse aggregated health facility data on COVID-19-related indicators in seven low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including Liberia. We used time series models to estimate the expected monthly counts and 95% prediction intervals based on 4 years of previous data. Here, we detail and provide resources for our data preparation procedures, modelling approach and data visualisation tools with application to Liberia.Results: To demonstrate the utility of these methods, we present syndromic surveillance results for acute respiratory infections (ARI) at health facilities in Liberia during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic (January through August 2020). For each month, we estimated the deviation between the expected and observed number of ARI cases for 325 health facilities and 15 counties to identify potential areas of SARS-CoV-2 circulation.Conclusions: Syndromic surveillance can be used to monitor health facility catchment areas for spikes in specific symptoms which may indicate SARS-CoV-2 circulation. The developed methods coupled with the existing infrastructure for routine health data systems can be leveraged to monitor a variety of indicators and other infectious diseases with epidemic potential.

TI  - Method comparison of indirect assessments of understory leaf area index (LAI<sub>u</sub>): A case study across the extended network of ICOS forest ecosystem sites in Europe
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a key ecological indicator for describing the structure of canopies and for modelling energy exchange between atmosphere and biosphere. While LAI of the forest overstory can be accurately assessed over large spatial scales via remote sensing, LAI of the forest understory (LAI(u)) is still largely ignored in ecological studies and ecosystem modelling due to the fact that it is often too complex to be destructively sampled or approximated by other site parameters. Additionally, so far only few attempts have been made to retrieve understory LAI via remote sensing, because dense canopies with high LAI are often hindering retrieval algorithms to produce meaningful estimates for understory LAI. Consequently, the forest understory still constitutes a poorly investigated research realm impeding ecological studies to properly account for its contribution to the energy absorption capacity of forest stands. This study aims to compare three conceptually different indirect retrieval methodologies for LAI(u) over a diverse panel of forest understory types distributed across Europe. For this we carried out near-to-surface measurements of understory reflectance spectra as well as digital surface photography over the extended network of Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) forest ecosystem sites. LAI(u) was assessed by exploiting the empirical relationship between vegetation cover and light absorption (Beer Lambert-Bouguer law) as well as by utilizing proposed relationships with two prominent vegetation indices: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and simple ratio (SR). Retrievals from the three methods were significantly correlated with each other (r = 0.63-0.99, RMSE = 0.53-0.72), but exhibited also significant bias depending on the LAI scale. The NDVI based retrieval approach most likely overestimates LAI at productive sites when LAI(u) > 2, while the simple ratio algorithm overestimates LAI(u) at sites with sparse understory vegetation and presence of litter or bare soil. The purely empirical method based on the Beer-Lambert law of light absorption seems to offer a good compromise, since it provides reasonable LAI(u) values at both low and higher LAI ranges. Surprisingly, LAI(u) variation among sites seems to be largely decoupled from differences in climate and light permeability of the overstory, but significantly increased with vegetation diversity (expressed as species richness) and hence proposes new applications of LAI(u) in ecological modelling.

TI  - An improved modeling of precipitation phase and snow in the Lancang River Basin in Southwest China
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation phase (e.g., rainfall and snowfall) and snow (e.g., snowpack and snowmelt runoff) in high-mountain regions may largely affect runoff generation, which is critical to water supply, hydropower generation, agricultural irrigation, and ecosystems downstream. Accurately modeling precipitation phase and snow is therefore fundamental to developing a better understanding of hydrological processes for high-mountain regions and their lower reaches. The Lancang River (LR, or the Upper Mekong River) in China, among the most important transboundary rivers originating from the Tibetan Plateau, features active dam construction and complex water resources allocation of various stakeholders in Southeast Asian countries under climate change. This study aims to improve precipitation phase and snow modeling for the LR basin with a hydrological model and multisource remotely sensed data. Results show that joint use of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature product with high spatial resolution (1 kmx1 km) and an air temperature product can more precisely distinguish precipitation phase than air and wet-bulb temperature products in the LR basin. Snowfall and snowmelt were found to be controlled primarily by rainfall and snowfall temperature thresholds in snow modeling. The rainfall and snowfall temperature thresholds derived from the hydrological model through calibration with remotely sensed snowpack at basin scales were considerably lower than those derived from in situ observations. Rainfall and snowfall temperature thresholds derived from in situ observations could lead to the overestimation of snowmelt runoff due mostly to the lack of representation of point-based measurements at basin scales. This study serves as a basis for better modeling and predicting snow for the LR basin and potentially other similar basins globally.

TI  - Soil organic carbon prediction using phenological parameters and remote sensing variables generated from Sentinel-2 images
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important to predict the spatial distribution of SOC accurately for migrating carbon emission and sustainable soil management. Environmental variables influence the accuracy of SOC prediction with digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches. In addition to the commonly-used natural predictors, remote sensing variables have been recently used in DSM. However, it is still challenging which variables are effective to predict SOC in farmland. Although phenological parameters have been recently used to indicate human activities that affect SOC in farmland, there are few studies that employ the phenological parameters in SOC prediction. Therefore, this study investigates the feasibility of SOC prediction with the phenological parameters and numerous remote sensing variables extracted from Sentinel-2 at high temporal and spatial resolutions. From 34 Sentinel-2 time series images from 2018 to 2019, 17 phenological parameters were extracted for Xuanzhou, Anhui Province using a dynamic threshold method. Furthermore, fifteen remote sensing predictors comprised of vegetation indices, bright-related indices, and moisture indices were generated from the Sentinel-2 images. The phenological parameters and remote sensing variables were combined with natural variables to predict SOC contents at the surface soil layer using random forest. The results showed that the auxiliary parameters, i.e., the phenological parameters and remote sensing predictors, enhanced the predictability of SOC with an increase in R-2 by 171% and a decrease in RMSE by 14%. This study also identified relatively more important auxiliary parameters for the SOC prediction: the largest data value for the fitted function during the season (a6), rate of increase at the beginning of the season (a8), large seasonal integral (a10), SATVI, and Band8. Therefore, this study verified that the phenological parameters and remote sensing predictors extracted from the Sentinel-2 EVI time series are effective for DSM in farmland.

TI  - Value of the Sentinel Node Procedure in Pediatric Extremity Rhabdomyosarcoma: A Systematic Review and Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Our aim is to show whether the sentinel node procedure (SNP) is recommendable for pediatric patients with extremity rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Lymph node metastases are an important prognostic factor in pediatric patients with extremity RMS. Accurate nodal staging is necessary to treat the patient accordingly. An alternative to the current recommended lymph node sampling is the sentinel node procedure (SNP). Methods A systematic review was performed summarizing all published cases of SNP in addition to 13 cases from our hospital and 8 cases from two other hospitals that have not been published before. Results For all patients (n = 55), at least one SLN was identified, but the SNP technique used was not uniform. The SNP changed the nodal classification of eight patients (17.0%) and had a false-negative rate of 10.5%. Conclusions The SNP is recommendable for pediatric patients with extremity RMS. It can change lymph node status and can be used to sample patients in a more targeted way than nodal sampling alone. Therefore, we recommend use of the SNP in addition to clinical and radiological nodal assessment for pediatric patients with extremity RMS.

TI  - Variations in surface roughness of heterogeneous surfaces in the Nagqu area of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal and spatial variations of the surface aerodynamic roughness lengths (Z(0m)) in the Nagqu area of the northern Tibetan Plateau were analysed in 2008, 2010 and 2012 using MODIS satellite data and in situ atmospheric turbulence observations. Surface aerodynamic roughness lengths were calculated from turbulent observations by a single-height ultrasonic anemometer and retrieved by the Massman model. The results showed that Z(0m) has an apparent characteristic of seasonal variation. From February to August, Z(0m) increased with snow ablation and vegetation growth, and the maximum value reached 4-5 cm at the BJ site. From September to February, Z(0m) gradually decreased and reached its minimum values of about 1-2 cm. Snowfall in abnormal years was the main reason for the significantly lower Z(0m) compared with that in normal conditions. The underlying surface can be divided into four categories according to the different values of Z(0m): snow and ice, sparse grassland, lush grassland and town. Among them, lush grassland and sparse grassland accounted for 62.49% and 33.74 %, and they have an annual variation of Z(0m) between 1-4 and 2-6 cm, respectively. The two methods were positively correlated, and the retrieved values were lower than the measured results due to the heterogeneity of the underlying surface. These results are substituted into the Noah-MP (multi-parameterisation) model to replace the original parameter design numerical simulation experiment. After replacing the model surface roughness, the sensible heat flux and latent heat flux were simulated with a better diurnal dynamics.

TI  - Is Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Reliable After Recent Oncoplastic Breast Reduction?
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
M3  - Article
AB  - An oncoplastic breast reduction may disrupt normal lymphatic drainage and make subsequent identification of the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) unreliable. There are little data on the success rate of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after recent oncoplastic breast reduction, and there is no agreement on whether SLNB should be done at the time of the partial mastectomy and reduction for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The primary goals of this study were to evaluate the identification rate of SLNB after recent oncoplastic or functional breast reduction and to examine recurrence rates in this setting. Results reveal SLNB is feasible in this setting. At least one SLN was found in all patients, and there were no recurrences with an average follow-up of 34 months.

TI  - Pursuing fullness of life through harmony with nature: Towards an African response to environmental destruction and climate change in Southern Africa
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Like the rest of the developed world, African nations are now subject to consumerist tendencies of the global economic architecture and activities, which excessively exploit natural resources for profits and are at the centre of what this article describes as 'disharmony between nature and humanity'. The exploitative nature of consumerist tendencies requires healing and restoration as it leads towards unpredictable and destructive weather patterns in which the relationships between human activity and the environment have created patterns and feedback mechanisms that govern the presence, distribution and abundance of species assemblages. Disharmony is employed to describe the exploitative nature of consumerist tendencies that lead to unpredictable weather patterns. The consequences include climate change and natural disasters such as floods, drought and environmental pollution, which have been severely experienced in Southern Africa recently. This article provides a qualitative literature review on recent religious and ecumenical responses to climate change crisis and draws on the notions of `cultural landscapes' and `ecotheology' to highlight an exploitative relationship, which is characterised by disharmony in the relationship between humanity and nature. This illustration demonstrates how the concept of unity between `self and the entire Kosmos' in African worldview presents a potentially constructive African theology of ecology. Amongst other recommendations, the article proposed that in order for humanity to restore harmony and attain fullness of life - oikodome - with nature the notions of healing, reconciliation, liberation and restoration should be extended to human relations or interactions with nature and all of God's creation.Contribution: This article represents a contextual and systematic reflection on climate challenges facing the African context within a paradigm in which the intersection of philosophy, religious studies, social sciences, humanities and natural sciences generates an interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary contested discourse.

TI  - Image Pan-Sharpening and Sub-pixel Classification Enabled Building Detection in Strategically Challenged Forest Neighborhood Environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of strategically important geospatial objects in remote sensing images is one of the important tasks for interpreting satellite images. Identification and mapping of objects such as tank, airplane, roads, buildings, etc. from remotely sensed images has gained much research and exploration in both defense and civilian applications. Detection and identification of buildings become more challenging when analyzed in forest neighborhood environment. The presence of dense trees in the surroundings increases the complexity and the rates of both false positives and false negatives. In the current study, an integration of image pan-sharpening (Gram-Schmidt) and sub-pixel image classification (Linear Mixture Model) algorithm is used for identification and mapping of building objects in two high resolution remote sensing satellite imagery (IKONOS and Worldview-2). Building objects having large, medium and small geometric size are selected from both the satellite imagery in strategically challenged forest neighborhood. The capability of pan-sharpening and sub-pixel classification techniques are jointly used for detection of building objects. The accuracy of target detection has been evaluated qualitatively (visual interpretation) and quantitatively (statistical analysis). Results on selected datasets show that the proposed combination of pan-sharpening and sub-pixel classification offers higher correctness in identification of building than other contemporary techniques. Although, significant improvement is noticed in results obtained for both the satellite imagery. Irrespective of having lower spatial resolution, after pan-sharpening, IKONOS datasets are found to be slightly more accurate in building identification in comparison to Worldview-2 datasets.

TI  - Relating pre-fire canopy species, fire season, and proximity to surface waters to burn severity of boreal wildfires in Alberta, Canada
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased global temperature, drought, and extreme weather have increased the frequency and intensity of wildfires in Canadian Boreal forests. We examined how burn severity was related to canopy species composition and proximity to water in six large boreal forest stands across northern Alberta (two in the Bistcho Lake region, three in Wood Buffalo National Park, and one in the Richardson backcountry) and a smaller stand close to the town of Slave Lake (204-5217 km(2)). We used Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellite images that included two phenological stages (spring, summer, or fall), followed by Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification to map the distribution of pre-fire canopy species. To quantify the burn severity of each fire, we used the Landsat images to calculate the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR); we then combined dNBR for all affected areas to develop the Standardised Burn Impact Score (SBIS), that quantifies the average impact of each fire based on the size of the burned area and mean burn severity per pixel. In general, pre-fire dominance of coniferous species (jack pine and spruce) led to higher SBIS values while pre-fire dominance of broad-leaved species (aspen, birch, and poplar) led to lower values. Mean burn severity and SBIS values increased when fire events occurred at a distance of 1 km or greater from surface waters (e.g. lakes, rivers, and streams). We further analyzed the influence of fire season on burn duration and the proportion of canopy species being burned in each season. We found that fires that were ignited in spring lasted longer and burned more deciduous stands compared to fires that were ignited in summer. By integrating burn impact over very large temporal and spatial scales, we have confirmed the general influence of pre-fire canopy species on burn severity, and the ameliorating effect of surface waters on fire behavior at the landscape level.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoir sedimentation is a momentous problem and has severe consequences on water management, flood control and production of energy. As the river flows into the reservoir, the sediments that travel along with it get deposited and thereby reduces the capacity of the reservoir. From this, it is obvious that study of sediment deposition has to be done periodically as it may affect the safety of dams and, without proper management, negatively impact the environment. This study has attempted to find out the amount of sediment deposition in Idukki reservoir, over the years. As the conventional method such as hydrographic survey is non-economical and time-consuming, the satellite remote sensing method is recommended for this analysis. LANDSAT 8 OLI/TIRS satellite images for the period 2017-2019 were used to assess the water spread area using Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), determine the sediment deposition and evaluate the revised capacity of the reservoir. After intensive analysis, a decline of 11.6% was observed between the cumulative capacities of the original base year (1974) and the latest (2019). The loss in live storage capacity between the years 1974 and 2019 was 0.10 km(3) which is equivalent to 100 hm(3). The study also evaluates the impact of the Kerala Floods 2018 in the Reservoir and also assess the need for desilting.

TI  - Innovations for the future of breast surgery
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Future innovations in science and technology with an impact on multimodal breast cancer management from a surgical perspective are discussed in this narrative review. The work was undertaken in response to the Commission on the Future of Surgery project initiated by the Royal College of Surgeons of England.Methods: Expert opinion was sought around themes of surgical de-escalation, reduction in treatment morbidities, and improving the accuracy of breast-conserving surgery in terms of margin status. There was emphasis on how the primacy of surgical excision in an era of oncoplastic and reconstructive surgery is increasingly being challenged, with more effective systemic therapies that target residual disease burden, and permit response-adapted approaches to both breast and axillary surgery.Results: Technologies for intraoperative margin assessment can potentially half re-excision rates after breast-conserving surgery, and sentinel lymph node biopsy will become a therapeutic procedure for many patients with node-positive disease treated either with surgery or chemotherapy as the primary modality. Genomic profiling of tumours can aid in the selection of patients for neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies as well as prevention strategies. Molecular subtypes are predictive of response to induction therapies and reductive approaches to surgery in the breast or axilla.Conclusion: Treatments are increasingly being tailored and based on improved understanding of tumour biology and relevant biomarkers to determine absolute benefit and permit delivery of cost-effective healthcare. Patient involvement is crucial for breast cancer studies to ensure relevance and outcome measures that are objective, meaningful, and patient-centred.

AB  - In April 2013, Rio Tinto Kennecott Copper's (RTKC) Bingham Canyon Mine experienced what is arguably the world's largest ever in-pit slope failure. The failure initiated on the east wall of the mine, along major, continuous, low-strength bedding faults, which were the upper and lower contact of the Manefay hornfels bed. The failure comprised approximately 145 million tonnes of rock and waste dump material. East wall slope deformations were detected some months prior to the catastrophic slope collapse by RTKC's ground-based slope monitoring systems. Use of existing terrestrial radar and prism monitoring systems provided excellent data to manage the response to the slope collapse. The failure resulted in no injuries/loss of life, although the failure runout distance was longer than expected, resulting in the loss of mining equipment and significant production interruption. Post-failure investigations identified an RTKC-sponsored, university research project, which detected a zone of sporadic ground deformation at the crest of the Manefay failure using satellite-based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) monitoring. When the outcomes of this research study were received in 2010, RTKC responded by conducting detailed field inspections, installing prisms in the area of concern and monitoring the area closely in the years before the event. Interferometric methods for calculating ground displacement from satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have improved significantly since the time leading up to the Manefay failure. These updated methods have been used in this study of the available historic SAR data with results indicating that significant ground movements were occurring over a number of years prior to failure. Detailed knowledge of these movements could potentially have led to a different interpretation of failure mechanisms and magnitude and, in hindsight, different slope management and mine development plans in the years preceding slope failure. From a business and mine operations perspective, the ability to identify subtle signs of slope failure before a catastrophic slope collapse is essential for appropriate management of such events. The use of InSAR monitoring, as discussed in this paper, provides an increased capability for further improved slope management at RTKC, and at other mining operations.

TI  - AI-ForestWatch: semantic segmentation based end-to-end framework for forest estimation and change detection using multi-spectral remote sensing imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest change detection is crucial for sustainable forest management. The changes in the forest area due to deforestation (such as wild fires or logging due to development activities) or afforestation alter the total forest area. Additionally, it impacts the available stock for commercial purposes, climate change due to carbon emissions, and biodiversity of the forest habitat estimations, which are essential for disaster management and policy making. In recent years, foresters have relied on hand-crafted features or bi-temporal change detection methods to detect change in the remote sensing imagery to estimate the forest area. Due to manual processing steps, these methods are fragile and prone to errors and can generate inaccurate (i.e., under or over) segmentation results. In contrast to traditional methods, we present AI-ForestWatch, an end to end framework for forest estimation and change analysis. The proposed approach uses deep convolution neural network-based semantic segmentation to process multi-spectral spaceborne images to quantitatively monitor the forest cover change patterns by automatically extracting features from the dataset. Our analysis is completely data driven and has been performed using extended (with vegetation indices) Landsat-8 multi-spectral imagery from 2014 to 2020. As a case study, we estimated the forest area in 15 districts of Pakistan and generated forest change maps from 2014 to 2020, where major afforestation activity is carried out during this period. Our critical analysis shows an improvement of forest cover in 14 out of 15 districts. The AI-ForestWatch framework along with the associated dataset will be made public upon publication so that it can be adapted by other countries or regions. (C) The Authors.

TI  - A satellite-based mobile warning system to reduce interactions with an endangered species
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth-observing satellites are a major research tool for spatially explicit ecosystem nowcasting and forecasting. However, there are practical challenges when integrating satellite data into usable real-time products for stakeholders. The need of forecast immediacy and accuracy means that forecast systems must account for missing data and data latency while delivering a timely, accurate, and actionable product to stakeholders. This is especially true for species that have legal protection. Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus (Atlantic sturgeon) were listed under the United States Endangered Species Act in 2012, which triggered immediate management action to foster population recovery and increase conservation measures. Building upon an existing research occurrence model, we developed an Atlantic sturgeon forecast system in the Delaware Bay, USA. To overcome missing satellite data due to clouds and produce a 3-d forecast of ocean conditions, we implemented data interpolating empirical orthogonal functions (DINEOF) on daily observed satellite data. We applied the Atlantic sturgeon research model to the DINEOF output and found that it correctly predicted Atlantic sturgeon telemetry occurrences over 90% of the time within a 3-d forecast. A similar framework has been utilized to forecast harmful algal blooms, but to our knowledge, this is the first time a species distribution model has been applied to DINEOF gap-filled data to produce a forecast product for fishes. To implement this product into an applied management setting, we worked with state and federal organizations to develop real-time and forecasted risk maps in the Delaware River Estuary for both state-level managers and commercial fishers. An automated system creates and distributes these risk maps to subscribers' mobile devices, highlighting areas that should be avoided to reduce interactions. Additionally, an interactive web interface allows users to plot historic, current, future, and climatological risk maps as well as the underlying model output of Atlantic sturgeon occurrence. The mobile system and web tool provide both stakeholders and managers real-time access to estimated occurrences of Atlantic sturgeon, enabling conservation planning and informing fisher behavior to reduce interactions with this endangered species while minimizing impacts to fisheries and other projects.

TI  - Characterization of a landslide-triggered debris flow at a rainforest-covered mountain region in Brazil
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Debris flows represent great hazard to humans due to their high destructive power. Understanding their hydrogeomorphic dynamics is fundamental in hazard assessment studies, especially in subtropical and tropical regions where debris flows have scarcely been studied when compared to other mass-wasting processes. Thus, this study aims at systematically analyzing the meteorological and geomorphological factors that characterize a landslide-triggered debris flow at the Pedra Branca catchment (Serra do Mar, Brazil), to quantify the debris flow's magnitude, peak discharge and velocity. A magnitude comparison with empirical equations (Italian Alps, Taiwan, Serra do Mar) is also conducted. The meteorological analysis is based on satellite data and rain gauge measurements, while the geomorphological characterization is based on terrestrial and aerial investigations, with high spatial resolution. The results indicate that it was a large-sized stony debris flow, with a total magnitude of 120,195 m(3), a peak discharge of 2146.7 m(3) s(-1) and a peak velocity of 26.5 m s(-1). The debris flow was triggered by a 188-mm rainfall in 3 h (maximum intensity of 128 mm h(-1)), with an estimated return period of 15 to 20 years, which, combined with the intense accumulation of on-channel debris (ca. 37,000 m(3)), indicates that new high-magnitude debris flows in the catchment and the region are likely to occur within the next two decades. The knowledge of the potential frequency and magnitude (F-M) can support the creation of F-M relationships for Serra do Mar, a prerequisite for reliable hazard management and monitoring programs.

TI  - Modeling and Analysis of Ecological Urban Landscape Pattern Evolution Based on Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - COMPLEXITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering that the development of urbanization cannot be separated from the application of landscape pattern evolution, in order to improve the development level of ecocity, a modeling analysis of ecological urban landscape pattern evolution based on multisource remote sensing data is proposed. Taking ecotype city as the research object, the remote sensing images of ecological urban landscape pattern are screened by using multisource remote sensing data and nonremote sensing data as the basic data. CA-Markov model is constructed and the evolution of ecological urban landscape pattern is analyzed. The experimental results show that, from 2005 to 2020, the development level of urbanization process is higher and higher and the area of building land patches is increasing, which reduces the fragmentation of building land patches. However, the landscape of cultivated land and green space is less and less, and the distribution of the patches also causes uneven phenomenon, which leads to the gradual decline of ecological urban landscape diversity. In the ecological urban landscape pattern, the degree of fragmentation and diversity of urban landscape is reduced due to the high connection and coverage of the construction land.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIAC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Our case demonstrates a novel use of the Sentinel (TM) cerebral protection device (SCPD) for prevention of stroke during removal of a thrombus-adherent atrial septal occluder.Case Presentation A 45-year-old male with multiple strokes and ostium secundum atrial septal defect closed ten years prior using an Amplatzer Septal Occluder presented with recurrent neurologic symptoms. Over the ensuing year, serial transesophageal echocardiography revealed persistent and worsening device-adherent thrombus despite trial of different anticoagulants. The device appeared to be mal-deployed, prompting the decision for surgical explant. Given concern for embolization during explant, an SCPD was placed. Excision, pericardial patch repair, and Atriclip appendage closure (AAC) were performed. The device demonstrated incomplete endothelialization and microthrombi. SCPD filtration revealed embolic debris.Conclusions We demonstrate the first successful use of an SCPD during surgical excision of a mal-deployed occluder. With its ease of use and safety, SCPD may have utility in surgeries with high cardio-embolic risk.

TI  - Agronomic approach to understanding climate change and food security
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate impacts agricultural productivity and the distribution of crops grown around the world. Because the United States is a leader in food exports, climate change impacts in the United States have the potential to disproportionately affect the global food supply. Given the change in temperature, precipitation, and carbon dioxide occurring now and expected into the future, the potential for agroecosystems to produce sufficient quantities of food to meet world demand is in question. To address this question, the concept of yield gaps, as the difference between potential yield (PY) and farm or actual yield (FY), provides a framework for the evaluation of progress in production. Across all crops, there have been increases in both PY (breeding, technological advances) and FY (implementation of improved genetic resources and management practices); however, climate change threatens to diminish those advances due to temperature stresses and more uncertain precipitation patterns. Climate change will not only directly increase the yield gap in the future but also further indirectly widen the yield gap by the degradation of the soil resource due to interactions of climate and management. Modern agricultural systems must adapt to become more resilient to climate change, and the tools to this adaptation involve genetics, environmental monitoring, and evolving management practices. However, progress can only begin once agricultural systems are managed from a more holistic view of providing both quantity and quality of a more diverse mixture of agricultural crops that will provide sustainability, equity, nutrition, and a secure food future.

TI  - The burden of active infection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the general population: Results from a statewide sentinel-based population survey in Karnataka, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To estimate the burden of active infection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in Karnataka, India, and to assess variation across geographical regions and risk groups. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 16,416 people covering three risk groups was conducted between 3-16 September 2020 using the state of Karnataka's infrastructure of 290 healthcare facilities across all 30 districts. Participants were further classified into risk subgroups and sampled using stratified sampling. All participants were subjected to simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using a commercial ELISA kit, SARS-CoV-2 antigen using a rapid antigen detection test (RAT) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for RNA detection. Maximum-likelihood estimation was used for joint estimation of the adjusted IgG, active and total prevalence (either IgG or active or both), while multinomial regression identified predictors. Results: The overall adjusted total prevalence of COVID-19 in Karnataka was 27.7% (95% CI 26.1-29.3), IgG 16.8% (15.5-18.1) and active infection fraction 12.6% (11.5-13.8). The case-to-infection ratio was 1:40 and the infection fatality rate was 0.05%. Influenza-like symptoms or contact with a COVID-19-positive patient were good predictors of active infection. RAT kits had higher sensitivity (68%) in symptomatic people compared with 47% in asymptomatic people. Conclusion: This sentinel-based population survey was the first comprehensive survey in India to provide accurate estimates of the COVID-19 burden. The findings provide a reasonable approximation of the population immunity threshold levels. Using existing surveillance platforms coupled with a syndromic approach and sampling framework enabled this model to be replicable.

TI  - Dynamical downscaling of global reanalysis data for high-resolution spatial modeling of snow accumulation/melting at the central/southern Sierra Nevada watersheds
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Data scarcity is one of the major constraints for hydrological modeling at a mountainous region with complex terrains. In this study, WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting model) model was configured to produce highresolution atmospheric data for spatial modeling of snow at seven watersheds in central/southern Sierra Nevada. The configured WRF model downscaled a global reanalysis dataset into hourly time intervals and 3-km spatial grid resolution. Performance of the configured WRF model was validated by comparing basin averages of daily precipitation and daily mean temperature between the WRF simulation and data from Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM). The WRF model demonstrated satisfactory performance in simulating peaks and variations of daily precipitation and daily mean temperature. The atmospheric data which were obtained by the dynamical downscaling of Climate Forecast System Reanalysis dataset (CFSR) were then used for calibration and validation of the snow model for the seven watersheds. The dynamical downscaling and the subsequent simulation of snow were performed through the application of The Watershed Environmental Hydrology Hydro-Climate Model (WEHY-HCM) into the central/southern Sierra Nevada. The daily scale validation of the calibrated snow model showed that the simulated snow water equivalent (SWE) was mostly in agreement with observed SWE, however, tended to somewhat underestimate SWE. The snow model simulation with the precipitation input from PRISM indicated that the results using the dynamical downscaling had comparable performance with the results using PRISM precipitation, while some observation points showed improvements of the simulated SWE by using PRISM precipitation. Spatial comparison of the snow cover between the snow model simulations and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations showed that the snow model was capable of detecting the snow cover at high elevation bands while the snow cover detection at low elevation bands, which correspond to the boundary between snow cover and no snow cover area, was less accurate.

AB  - Purpose of the study. - The population of people in police custody is a sentinel niche that is poorly represented in the "usual panels" of public health studies. The aim is to make an overview of their diversion of drugs.Patients and methods. - A retrospective study based on cases of misuse in a sample of people in custody examined between 2015 and 2016 at the forensic medicine unit of the hospital Hotel- Dieu Paris.Results. - Of the 5149 medical examinations, 302 were for substance use disorder or drug misuse. In 2016, the number of notifications for misuse of clonazepam increased (n=85); the user population appears to be getting younger (average age = 23.5 years) and to be supplied mainly by deal (63%). Regarding opioid substitution treatments, the indicators of abuse and diversion are confirmed, while morphine sulfate stands out with a strong deal (>75%), IV injection (62%) and polydrug use, including methadone, cocaine (62%).Conclusion. - From our results, national surveys in general population and studies carried out in the context of deprivation of liberty, people in police custody constitute a real barometer of the parallel market for street drugs. Clinical impacts can be major; a better monitoring is needed. For caregivers, it is also a matter of better identification of misuse, substance use disorder for a future orientation of the patient.

AB  - The landscape-level estimation of nitrogen will constitute a significant input in global change models. High resolution broadband satellite technology is a promising solution to the limitation of spatial coverage. This study sought to identify an optimal spatial resolution for estimating foliar nitrogen in dry miombo woodlands. The contrast texture measure, calculated at increasing window size on Sentinel-2 imagery, was related to field measured nitrogen via random forest regression models. Our results show that the optimum size for estimating nitrogen is 50m. This result is significant in understanding the scale at which dynamics in foliar nitrogen concentration can be remotely measured.

TI  - Decadal-scale spatiotemporal changes in land use/land cover of El Potosi Basin at semi-arid northeast Mexico and evolution of peat fire between 1980-2020 CE
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We estimated decadal-scale changes to the land use/land cover in one of the many drought-prone agricultural basins (El Potosi Basin) of northeast Mexico by using the temporal satellite images of Landsat Multi spectral scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) for 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 CE. Increase in land without shrub and permanent uncultivated (fallow) land, and reduction in coverages of the agricultural land and forest over the last four decades reflected the intensities of water scarcity caused from global warming as well as the agriculture related anthropogenic activities. Enhanced aridity led to 136-fold surge (ca. 2.5-340 km(2)) in abandonment of cultivated areas covering almost half of the basin. Absence of cropland in 2010 CE reflected the severe drought of early 21st Century but augmentation in usages of groundwater reestablished the agriculture a decade later in ca.15.7 km(2). Over the last four decades, the subsurface fire from combustion of peat covered ca.17.4 km(2) mostly at expenses of lands with and without shrub and agriculture land. Our temporal and spatial land use/land cover assessments might be helpful for private and government agencies to evaluate the short-term impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities in order to mitigate their effects in this water scarce region.

TI  - The complexity of measuring cropland use intensity: An empirical study
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: Cropland intensification promises additional food supply without further expanding croplands into natural ecosystems. Cropland use intensity measures the degree of intensification by various indicators, both from input and output perspectives; all of these indicators are however not always coherent-which may cause confusion and send contradicting signals to policymakers. Few empirical studies have been conducted to relate and compare various intensity indicators.OBJECTIVE: In this study, we start with a hypothesis that cropland use intensity measured by different indicators may differ. We then test such a hypothesis based on empirical evidence in a typical multi-cropped region (i.e., Jinxian County) in Jiangxi Province-a major breadbasket in Southern China.METHODS: We focus on two widely used indicators, i.e., multi-cropping frequency (MCF) and crop growth duration (GD a ), measured by a hybrid time-series remote sensing dataset which fuses MODIS and Gaofen-1 images for the year 2015. We map these two indicators independently at a 16 m spatial resolution. For each pixel, MCF takes value from 1 to 3 corresponding to single-, double- and triple- cropping; while GD a is quantified by the accumulative crop growth days within the study year. We relate the values of two indicators, summarize the descriptive statistics of GD a grouped by MCF categories, and compare MCF and GD a values by using a box-whisker chart, a bivariate map, and a set of statistical tests.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We find that a significant overlap of GD a exists between single cropping and double cropping both visually and statistically. In other words, the different cropland intensity levels measured by MCF appear to be the same if measured by GD a . The box-whisker chart shows that the GD a of single cropping in the upper quarter is substantially longer than the GD a of double cropping in the lower quarter. The nonparametric tests show that the overlapped GD a between single cropping and double cropping exists substantially, which may cause confusion. Moreover, the bivariate map shows that single cropping with shorter growth duration (i.e., consistent low intensity) and double cropping with longer growth duration (i.e., consistent high intensity) account for 44% and 28%, respectively, while the rest manifested as inconsistent which accounts for another 28% of the total cropland area.SIGNIFICANCE: These results confirm our hypothesis-the inconsistency among intensification indicators. Different measurements may convey contradicting messages for policymakers in pursuing the sustainable intensification goals, which suggests more efforts are required to understand the multidimensionality of the process of cropland intensification for distinct policy measurements.

TI  - Surface Turbulence Reveals Riverbed Drag Coefficient
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flow in rivers and the coastal ocean is controlled by the frictional force exerted on the water by riverbed or seabed roughness. The frictional force is typically characterized by a drag coefficient C-d, which is estimated from bulk measurements and often assumed constant. Here, we demonstrate a relationship between bed roughness and water surface turbulence that can be used to make remote estimates of C-d. We observe that regions with larger bed roughness result in greater turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), which is transported upward by river boils to the water surface. We present a relationship between surface TKE and C-d, and validate this relationship by comparing remotely sensed estimates of C-d to those from in situ measurements. Thus, our results provide an approach for estimating bottom roughness and C-d based entirely on remotely sensed data, including their spatial variability, which can improve modeling of river discharge and morphodynamics in data-poor regions.

TI  - Bioinformatics-based Identification of Key Pathways and Hub Genes of Traumatic Brain Injury in a Rat Model
T2  - CURRENT MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common injury caused by external forces that lead to damaged brain function or pathological changes in the brain tissue. To explore the molecular mechanism and the hub genes of TBI, we downloaded gene expression profiles of the TBI model of rat and the sham control for the subsequent gene set enrichment analysis, pathway analysis and protein-protein interactions analysis. The results of Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis indicated that multiple biological pathways, including immune response, inflammatory response and cellular response to interleukin-1, as well as signaling pathways, such as tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway and nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway were implicated in the TBI. In conclusion, this study provides insights into the molecular mechanism of TBI by screening the differentially expressed genes and hub genes that can be used as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

TI  - Using high-density UAV-Lidar for deriving tree height of <i>Araucaria Angustifolia</i> in an Urban Atlantic Rain Forest
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forest remnants contribute to climate change mitigation by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in urban areas. Hence, understanding the dynamics and the potential of urban forests as carbon pools is crucial to propose effective policies addressing the ecosystem services' maintenance. Remote sensing technologies such as Light detection and ranging (Lidar) are alternatives to acquire information on urban forests accurately. In this paper, we evaluate a UAV-Lidar system's potential to derive individual tree heights of Araucaria angustifolia trees in an Urban Atlantic Forest. Additionally, the influence of point density when deriving tree heights was assessed (2500, 1000, 500, 250, 100, 50, 25, 10 and 5 returns.m(-2)). The UAV-Lidar data was collected with the GatorEye Unmanned Flying Laboratory 'Generation 2'. The UAV-Lidar-derived and field-based tree heights were compared by statistical analysis. Higher densities of points allowed a better description of tree profiles. Lower densities presented gaps in the Crown Height Model (CHM). The highest agreement between UAV-Lidar-derived and fieldbased tree heights (r = 0.73) was noticed when using 100 returns.m(-2). The lowest rRMSE was observed for 50 returns.m(-2) (8.35 %). There are no explicit differences in derived tree heights using 25 to 2500 returns.m(-2). UAV-Lidar data presented satisfactory performance when deriving individual tree heights of Araucaria angustifolia trees.

TI  - Hydrological modeling of Ar Rub Al Khali, Arabian Peninsula: a modified remote sensing approach based on the weight of hydrological evidence
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological modelling of Ar Rub Al Kahli over a very regional scale using the weight of evidence based on pixel calculation and several pieces of evidences is timely consuming. This study aims to modify an approach, which calls a weight of hydrological evidence (WoHE) approach. The approach is based on calculating the logarithmic ratio of the total areas of distribution good (event) and distribution bad (non-event) of features such as faults, palaeochannels and zones of flow accumulation. The approach starts by mapping fault zones, palaeochannels, drainage basins and flow accumulation zones from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) DEM. The proposed approach is an effective approach to improve the hydrological modeling and summarize large datasets over a very regional scale obtained using machine learning, which is used widely in the literature. The results exhibited that the basins of Dhofar has the highest values for the WoHE of 0.0432.

TI  - Water requirements for irrigated crops in semi-arid region in Jordan using sentinel satellite images
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural sector consumes most of the groundwater in Jordan, and Mujib basin is one of the most important available ground basins. Unsupervised classification has been applied on multitemporal satellite image for an arid region such as Mujib basin in order to identify the types of irrigated agricultural crops present in it, where it consisted of vegetables, field crops and fruit trees. Then find the reference evapotranspiration values and estimate crop coefficient values for each crop to calculate the water requirements of irrigated crops in order to find the quantities of water consumption in the basin which amounted to 29.7 million cubic meters. Where area of irrigated crops reached about 59 km2, which represents 1% of the total basin area and its concentrated in the northern and eastern regions, while rainfed agricultural activity was found in the western part of the basin. Vegetables are consumed high quantities of water, especially summer ones. Where this water is invaluable, and its importance will increase greatly soon as a result of high evaporation rates and scarcity of water resources in the region besides presence the political conflicts on these water resources. The classification of lands using multitemporal images from Sentinel satellite led to obtain more accurate results about the irrigated agricultural crops in terms of cultivation dates, duration, harvest time, monitoring the crop, determining its type and calculating its area.

TI  - Efficacy and efficiency of fracture liaison services to reduce the risk of recurrent osteoporotic fractures
T2  - AGING CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Acting to prevent the next fracture after a sentinel fracture is support by the evidence base and brings benefits for patients, clinicians and healthcare systems. However, more patients after a fragility fracture remain untreated and vulnerable to future potentially life-changing fractures. Fracture liaison services (FLS) are models of care that can close this care gap. Methods A narrative review of the key evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of FLS was performed Results There are few randomised control trials of FLSs and none with fracture as the primary outcome. Several observational studies have also demonstrated reductions in fracture, but most were limited by potential bias. Several studies have highlighted that not every FLS is automatically effective. Conclusion Further research should focus on implementing effective FLS using published standards and only then exploring impacts on patient outcomes such as refracture rates.

TI  - Surface Flow Velocities From Space: Particle Image Velocimetry of Satellite Video of a Large, Sediment-Laden River
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional, field-based streamflow monitoring in remote, inaccessible locations such as Alaska poses logistical challenges. Safety concerns, financial considerations, and a desire to expand water-observing networks make remote sensing an appealing alternative means of collecting hydrologic data. In an ongoing effort to develop non-contact methods for measuring river discharge, we evaluated the potential to estimate surface flow velocities from satellite video of a large, sediment-laden river in Alaska via particle image velocimetry (PIV). In this setting, naturally occurring sediment boil vortices produced distinct water surface features that could be tracked from frame to frame as they were advected by the flow, obviating the need to introduce artificial tracer particles. In this study, we refined an end-to-end workflow that involved stabilization and geo-referencing, image preprocessing, PIV analysis with an ensemble correlation algorithm, and post-processing of PIV output to filter outliers and scale and geo-reference velocity vectors. Applying these procedures to image sequences extracted from satellite video allowed us to produce high resolution surface velocity fields; field measurements of depth-averaged flow velocity were used to assess accuracy. Our results confirmed the importance of preprocessing images to enhance contrast and indicated that lower frame rates (e.g., 0.25 Hz) lead to more reliable velocity estimates because longer capture intervals allow more time for water surface features to translate several pixels between frames, given the relatively coarse spatial resolution of the satellite data. Although agreement between PIV-derived velocity estimates and field measurements was weak (R-2 = 0.39) on a point-by-point basis, correspondence improved when the PIV output was aggregated to the cross-sectional scale. For example, the correspondence between cross-sectional maximum velocities inferred via remote sensing and measured in the field was much stronger (R-2 = 0.76), suggesting that satellite video could play a role in measuring river discharge. Examining correlation matrices produced as an intermediate output of the PIV algorithm yielded insight on the interactions between image frame rate and sensor spatial resolution, which must be considered in tandem. Although further research and technological development are needed, measuring surface flow velocities from satellite video could become a viable tool for streamflow monitoring in certain fluvial environments.

TI  - The consolidated European synthesis of CH<sub>4</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O emissions for the European Union and United Kingdom: 1990-2017
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable quantification of the sources and sinks of greenhouse gases, together with trends and uncertainties, is essential to monitoring the progress in mitigating anthropogenic emissions under the Paris Agreement.This study provides a consolidated synthesis of CH4 and N2O emissions with consistently derived state-of-the-art bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) data sources for the European Union and UK (EU27 C UK). We integrate recent emission inventory data, ecosystem process-based model results and inverse modeling estimates over the period 1990-2017. BU and TD products are compared with European national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs) reported to the UN climate convention UNFCCC secretariat in 2019. For uncertainties, we used for NGHGIs the standard deviation obtained by varying parameters of inventory calculations, reported by the member states (MSs) following the recommendations of the IPCC Guidelines. For atmospheric inversion models (TD) or other inventory datasets (BU), we defined uncertainties from the spread between different model estimates or model-specific uncertainties when reported. In comparing NGHGIs with other approaches, a key source of bias is the activities included, e.g., anthropogenic versus anthropogenic plus natural fluxes. In inversions, the separation between anthropogenic and natural emissions is sensitive to the geospatial prior distribution of emissions. Over the 2011-2015 period, which is the common denominator of data availability between all sources, the anthropogenic BU approaches are directly comparable, reporting mean emissions of 20.8 TgCH(4) yr (-1) (EDGAR v5.0) and 19.0 TgCH(4) yr(-1) (GAINS), consistent with the NGHGI estimates of 18.9 +/- 1.7 TgCH(4) yr(-1). The estimates of TD total inversions give higher emission estimates, as they also include natural emissions. Over the same period regional TD inversions with higher-resolution atmospheric transport models give a mean emission of 28.8 TgCH(4) yr(-1). Coarser-resolution global TD inversions are consistent with regional TD inversions, for global inversions with GOSAT satellite data (23.3 TgCH(4) yr(-1)) and surface network (24.4 TgCH(4) yr (-1)). The magnitude of natural peatland emissions from the JSBACH-HIMMELI model, natural rivers and lakes emissions, and geological sources together account for the gap between NGHGIs and inversions and account for 5.2 TgCH(4) yr(-1). For N2O emissions, over the 2011-2015 period, both BU approaches (EDGAR v5.0 and GAINS) give a mean value of anthropogenic emissions of 0.8 and 0.9 TgN(2)Oyr(-1), respectively, agreeing with the NGHGI data (0.9 0.6 TgN(2)Oyr(-1)). Over the same period, the average of the three total TD global and regional inversions was 1.3 +/- 0.4 and 1.3 +/- 0.1 TgN(2)Oyr(-1), respectively. The TD and BU comparison method defined in this study can be operationalized for future yearly updates for the calculation of CH4 and N2O budgets both at the EU CUK scale and at the national scale.

TI  - Distribution and Clonality of drug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa
T2  - BMC MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Studies have shown that drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) in South Africa (SA) is clonal and is caused mostly by transmission. Identifying transmission chains is important in controlling DR-TB. This study reports on the sentinel molecular surveillance data of Rifampicin-Resistant (RR) TB in SA, aiming to describe the RR-TB strain population and the estimated transmission of RR-TB cases. Method RR-TB isolates collected between 2014 and 2018 from eight provinces were genotyped using combination of spoligotyping and 24-loci mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-units-variable-number tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) typing. Results Of the 3007 isolates genotyped, 301 clusters were identified. Cluster size ranged between 2 and 270 cases. Most of the clusters (247/301; 82.0%) were small in size (< 5 cases), 12.0% (37/301) were medium sized (5-10 cases), 3.3% (10/301) were large (11-25 cases) and 2.3% (7/301) were very large with 26-270 cases. The Beijing genotype was responsible for majority of RR-TB cases in Western and Eastern Cape, while the East-African-Indian-Somalian (EAI1_SOM) genotype accounted for a third of RR-TB cases in Mpumalanga. The overall proportion of RR-TB cases estimated to be due to transmission was 42%, with the highest transmission-rate in Western Cape (64%) and the lowest in Northern Cape (9%). Conclusion Large clusters contribute to the burden of RR-TB in specific geographic areas such as Western Cape, Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga, highlighting the need for community-wide interventions. Most of the clusters identified in the study were small, suggesting close contact transmission events, emphasizing the importance of contact investigations and infection control as the primary interventions in SA.

TI  - Mapping the Eucalyptus spp woodlots in communal areas of Southern Africa using Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Imager data for hydrological applications
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive alien plant species (IAPs) drive anthropogenic global environmental change by threatening native species communities and ecosystems. For instance, the Eucalyptus species are notoriously known for releasing toxic chemicals which impedes the growth of indigenous plants which usually results in severe erosion. It is, therefore, important and necessary to quantify and understand the spatial extent and distribution of these IAPs to identify critical hotspots for restoration. This study, therefore, tested the utility of Sentinel 2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) data in distinguishing Eucalyptus community-woodlots from other land cover types with an aid of the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm. The results show that eucalyptus species were successfully discriminated from other land cover types with an overall accuracy (OA) of 85.07%. Eucalyptus covered an area of 2378.08 ha, constituting 11.6% of the study area. Furthermore, about 23% of Eucalyptus wood plots were found at a closer range of 1 km from the rivers. Sentinel 2 MSI Band 3 (green), 7 (vegetation red edge) and 8A (narrow near-infrared (NIR)) proved to be effective in characterizing the spatial distribution and extent of Eucalyptus wood plots. The findings of this study serve as a footstool towards the establishment of a framework for monitoring these IAPs and understanding their impact on the diversity of indigenous tree species.

TI  - The Extraction and Analysis of Deformation Features of Hualien Earthquake Based on Sentinel-1A/B SAR Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Focusing on Hualien earthquake which happened on April 18th in 2019, this research took Sentinel-1A/B SAR images as data source, extracted deformation field through DInSAR and MAI technology, analyzed deformation features based on interferogram, geological structure, distribution of aftershocks and the vertical PGA monitoring results. Our results showed that the maximum displacement of land surface subsidence near the seismic focus areas in LOS direction reached up to 3.6 cm, and the maximum displacement near the seismic focus areas in azimuth direction reached up to - 3.5 cm, both less than 4.0 cm. That was to say, the displacement in both direction caused by this earthquake was not significant in study area. And the previous research results indirectly implied that the extraction results of deformation field were reasonable near the seismic focus area. Then, based on the previous research results on geological structure, regional tectonics, reverse-type earthquake rupture and PGA, through the analysis on surface deformation field, vertical PGA results and surface cover types in the study area, we could indicate that, due to the effect of terrain on refraction and reflection of seismic wave, the impact of terrain on vertical PGA exceeded that of the epicentral distance.

TI  - Built-up area mapping in China from GF-3 SAR imagery based on the framework of deep learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and reliable acquisition of built-up areas (BAs) information in large regions is of great significance for the assessment of the influence of human activities in local, regional and even global environments and promotes the sustainable development of cities. In this study, a deep learning based framework is presented to automatically extract BAs from Gaofen-3 (GF-3) data in China. In the framework, a U-Net structure based deep learning with convolutional neural network is implemented for semantic segmentation to extract BAs. To overcome the problem of network degradation when the neural network layers become deeper, residual blocks were introduced via identity shortcut connections to add to U-Net. About 30,000 samples containing different distribution types of BAs and corresponding labeled binary images, which are from 27 scenes of GF-3 SAR images covering different regions (for example plain, hilly and mountainous regions) in China, were obtained for model training. With the trained model, more than 1700 scenes of 10-m resolution GF-3 Fine Stripmap II (FSII) mode singlepolarized images covering the whole country of China were processed to obtain the BA map of China. On the one hand, quality evaluation based on the confusion matrix was performed to determine the accuracy of the results with the ground truth data, which were manually interpreted by experts. The experimental results show that among 34 provinces or regions, the overall accuracy ranges from 76.05% to 93.45%, and the F1-score ranges from 0.69 and 0.89. On the other hand, the results were also compared with other semantic segmentation methods, such as FCN, PSPNet and U-Net, and other global urban area products, such as the Global Urban Footprint (GUF), Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring of Global Land Cover (FROM-GLC) and Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL). The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Impact of heat storage on remote-sensing based quantification of anthropogenic heat in urban environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic heat (AH) significantly impacts urban climates. Although combining the surface energy balance (SEB) with remote sensing data (RS-SEB) is promising for AH quantification, it has been shown to yield paradoxical low AH values in urban centers. Some speculation on the causes for the underestimation has appeared in the literature; however, none has been verified or thoroughly evaluated, largely hindering the further improvement of spatial representation of AH estimated through the RS-SEB approach. Here by casting the difference in the SEB between the observed reference state and a hypothetical scenario without AH, we developed a thermal stability analysis framework to identify the primary causes. Using AH estimations from six representative US cities based on Local Climate Zone (LCZ), we find that the reduced efficiency of the pathway from AH to sensible heat flux near high-rise buildings results in greater heat storage, which is a primary contributor to the underestimation. This study highlights the importance of heat storage in AH quantification using remote sensing data and provides evidence for potentially correcting the bias in AH with improved heat storage modeling.

TI  - Mapping regional surface water volume variation in reservoirs in northeastern Brazil during 2009-2017 using high-resolution satellite images
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The multiple-year drought that started in 2011 and reached climax in 2015 was the most severe and prolonged one in the semiarid northeastern (NE) Brazil in recent decades. This study aimed to investigate the reservoir surface water volume (SWV) variation in NE Brazil from 2009 to 2017 in four representative regions covering a total area of approximately 10,000 km2 there and encompassing 2,140 reservoirs (areas range from 0.003 to 21 km2). High-resolution (10 m) digital elevation models (DEMs) were generated from the TanDEM-X data acquired during October-December 2015 to represent the reservoirs' bathymetric maps. The water extents in the reservoirs were delineated from high-resolution (6.5 m) RapidEye images acquired during 2009-2017. The combination of the aforementioned two variables yielded reservoir SWV with an accuracy of 0.64 x 106-1.06 x 106 m3, corresponding to 3.1%-5.6% of the maximum SWV in the reservoirs. The results showed that: 1) 81%-99% of the reservoirs in the four regions were from the groups with maximum water extent <50 ha and contributed 2%-59% of the regional reservoir SWV. In contrast, 0.6%-20% of the reservoirs were from the group of >50 ha and contributed 40%-98% to the regional SWV; 2) From 2009 to 2017, reservoir SWV in the four regions decreased at the rates of 2.3 x 106-17.8 x 106 m3/year; and 3) The SWV in the reservoirs responded differently to the regional terrestrial water budget, i.e. the differences between precipitation and evapotranspiration (P-ET). This study filled the data gap of bathymetric maps for the 2140 reservoirs, regardless of their sizes and macrophyte coverage. The SWV variations derived in those reservoirs over a period covering the recent drought can support better pre-paredness for drought in NE Brazil and better understanding of the regional hydrology in semi-arid regions.

TI  - Assessing albedo dynamics and its environmental controls of grasslands over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo, as an essential biophysical factor, plays an essential role in surface energy balance. Identifying environmental drivers of albedo in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) helps to understand the role of the "third pole" in responding to environmental change and regulating regional climate. Based on remotely sensed data of albedo, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), snow cover, and soil moisture, this study investigated the effects of land cover (i.e., vegetation, snow) and soil on albedo from the perspectives of spatial, temporal, and spectral (visible, near-infrared, and shortwave) changes of albedo. Generally, changes in shortwave (SW) albedo were primarily driven by changes in snow cover during the growing season (from May to September), predominantly in May and June. The NDVI had larger contributions to visible (VIS) albedo change and was identified as the foremost important driver for VIS albedo in July and August. The correlations between the nearinfrared (NIR) albedo and NDVI were positive in the mid- and late growing season in eastern TP. Soil moisture was negatively correlated with albedo throughout the growing season and was identified as the foremost important driver in August. The NIR albedo was more susceptible than the VIS albedo to changes in soil moisture. The correlations between NDVI and albedo varied across different categories of aridity caused by changing correlations between NIR albedo and NDVI along the aridity gradients, and consequently the VIS and NIR albedo counterbalance can further limit the contributions of vegetation greenness on SW albedo in sub-humid and humid region. Our findings are expected to improve understandings of energy budget simulations over TP region in land surface models.

TI  - Unsupervised Change Detection by Cross-Resolution Difference Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection (CD) aims to identify the differences between multitemporal images acquired over the same geographical area at different times. With the advantages of requiring no cumbersome labeled change information, unsupervised CD has attracted extensive attention of researchers. Multitemporal images tend to have different resolutions as they are usually captured at different times with different sensor properties. It is difficult to directly obtain one pixelwise change map for two images with different resolutions, so current methods usually resize multitemporal images to a unified size. However, resizing operations change the original information of pixels, which limits the final CD performance. This article aims to detect changes from multitemporal images in the originally different resolutions without resizing operations. To achieve this, a cross-resolution difference learning method is proposed. Specifically, two cross-resolution pixelwise difference maps are generated for the two different resolution images and fused to produce the final change map. First, the two input images are segmented into individual homogeneous regions separately due to different resolutions. Second, each pixelwise difference map is produced according to two measure distances, the mutual information distance and the deep feature distance, between image regions in which the pixel lies. Third, the final binary change map is generated by fusing and binarizing the two cross-resolution difference maps. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for detecting changes from different resolution images.

TI  - Observations of Lightning NO<sub>x</sub> Production From Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument Case Studies Over the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen oxides produced by lightning (LNOx) play an important role in determining mid- and upper-tropospheric concentrations of the hydroxyl radical (OH), methane (CH4), and ozone (O-3). The moles of NOx produced per flash was examined using nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns and cloud properties from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and flash counts from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) aboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16) and Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN) for 29 convective systems over the United States that occurred during 2018 and 2019. For each of the case studies, the LNOx production efficiency (PE) was estimated using TROPOMI pixels over deep convection. First, the NOx columns associated with the TROPOMI NO2 columns were estimated using a specially derived air mass factor (AMF). The tropospheric column due to recent lightning was then determined by subtracting from the median NOx column a background representative of the NOx column due to sources other than recent lightning. Then, the PE was calculated by multiplying the LNOx column by the storm area and dividing by the number of flashes contributing to the column. For a three-hour chemical lifetime, the mean PE was found to be 175 +/- 100 mol per flash for optical flashes from GLM and 120 +/- 65 mol per flash for radio-wave-detected flashes from ENTLN. The uncertainty associated with these values is mostly due to uncertainties in tropospheric background, AMF, and detection efficiency. GLM PE for individual systems was found to be positively correlated with optical energy.

TI  - Gross primary productivity of Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) estimated by different remote sensing-based models
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary production (GPP) is the total amount of fixed carbon and depends on vegetation health and water and energy availability. GPP has been monitored worldwide by flux towers and models that are coupled with remotely sensed data, such as by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, models have not been evaluated for tropical savanna, which presumably represent a challenge because of large spatial and seasonal variation in GPP. Thus, our goal was to evaluate the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), Temperature and Greenness Model (TG), Vegetation Index Model (VI), and the MOD17A2 product of MODIS in a tropical mixed woodland-grassland. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Photosynthetically Active Radiation Fraction (fPAR) derived from the MODIS sensor were used as model inputs and integrated with ground-based micrometeorological variables. GPP varied significantly between the wet and dry seasons and was positively correlated with seasonal variations in soil volumetric water content (VSWC) and precipitation, and negatively correlated with the vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Satellite vegetation indices (NDVI, LSWI, and to a lesser extent, the EVI) and derived quantities (fPAR and LUE) also exhibited similar correlations with VSWC and precipitation. Thus, there were strong positive correlations between the SVIs and GPP. All of the models were able to simulate the seasonal variations in GPP; however, VPM had the best performance with the highest correlation and smallest errors. TG, VI, and MOD17A2 models performed similarly, except for the VI model based only on the EVI. Given their ability to capture seasonal dynamics, remote-sensing based models, such as those tested here, will likely be an important tool for assessing how climate variability alters C cycling dynamics in these spatially and temporally heterogeneous landscapes.

TI  - Suggestion of a simpler and faster influenza-like illness surveillance system using 2014-2018 claims data in Korea
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza is an important public health concern. We propose a new real-time influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance system that utilizes a nationwide prospective drug utilization monitoring in Korea. We defined ILI-related claims as outpatient claims that contain both antipyretic and antitussive agents and calculated the weekly rate of ILI-related claims, which was compared to weekly ILI rates from clinical sentinel surveillance data during 2014-2018. We performed a cross-correlation analysis using Pearson's correlation, time-series analysis to explore actual correlations after removing any dubious correlations due to underlying non-stationarity in both data sets. We used the moving epidemic method (MEM) to estimate an absolute threshold to designate potential influenza epidemics for the weeks with incidence rates above the threshold. We observed a strong correlation between the two surveillance systems each season. The absolute thresholds for the 4-years were 84.64 and 86.19 cases per 1000claims for claims data and 12.27 and 16.82 per 1000 patients for sentinel data. The epidemic patterns were more similar in the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons than the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 seasons. ILI claims data can be loaded to a drug utilization review system in Korea to make an influenza surveillance system.

The worldview is applied to the Canadian context which includes 600+ Indigenous cultures and languages. A description of the key concepts of Oneness, a spiritual foundation and relationship are coupled with concepts about family, education, life cycles, gender, and language. Application of these concepts are described, including the application to current research. It is essential that professionals and academics working with Indigenous Peoples understand that Western/European worldviews do not apply. Indigenous scholars and leaders in Canada have used the concept of the Indigenous worldview to lead the reclamation of original Indigenous Nations and languages. The term provides an information base from which differentiation of Indigenous values and protocols and beliefs can be made from Western/European forms. In order to achieve reconciliation between Indigenous Peoples and Western nations, knowledge of the Indigenous worldview is essential.

TI  - MP-ResNet: Multipath Residual Network for the Semantic Segmentation of High-Resolution PolSAR Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - There are limited studies on the semantic segmentation of high-resolution polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images due to the scarcity of training data and the complexity of managing speckle noise. The Gaofen contest has provided open access a high-quality PolSAR semantic segmentation dataset. Taking this opportunity, we propose a multipath residual network (MP-ResNet) architecture for the semantic segmentation of high-resolution PolSAR images. Compared to conventional U-shape encoder-decoder convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, the MP-ResNet learns semantic context with its parallel multiscale branches, which greatly enlarges its valid receptive fields and improves the embedding of local discriminative features. In addition, MP-ResNet adopts a multilevel feature fusion design in its decoder to effectively exploit the features learned from its different branches. Comparisons with the baseline method of fully connected network (FCN with ResNet34) show that the MP-ResNet has achieved significant accuracy improvements. It also surpasses several state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall accuracy (OA), mF(1) and frequency weighted intersection over union (fwIoU), with only a limited increase of computational costs. This CNN architecture can be used as a baseline method for future studies on the semantic segmentation of PolSAR images.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the remote sensing image processing field, cloud and snow detection for high-resolution sensors and cloud and snow morphology in different latitudes of the world is challenging. A deep learning training model (Softmax) was developed to improve the accuracy of cloud and snow identification from Gaofen-1 and Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite-1 images. First, more than 1800 scenes remote sensing images in various regions over the world are collected. Next, the texture details and spectral information of the objects are extracted. Finally, the Softmax model is applied to process the features to obtain the final cloud and snow masks. The cloud and snow detection results are evaluated by performing statistical analysis. The overall accuracy for cloud detection reaches 92.64% (kappa coefficient = 0.83) and for snow detection reaches 93.94% (kappa coefficient = 0.8). The algorithm is not only accurate but also computationally efficient. It is of great importance for image processing in ground segment and corresponding applications.

TI  - Impact of Covid-19 lockdown on air quality in the Poland, Eastern Europe
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The first case of COVID-19 in Poland was registered on 4 March 2020. Governmental measures significantly restricted social and economic activities. This study investigates the impact on air quality resulting from the preventive measures taken by the government to manage Covid-19. The study was carried out with use of aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite and tropospheric column NO2 observed by Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Concentrations of atmospheric pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and SO2) retrieved from ground-based air quality stations, located in five large cities of the country, were also used for quantitative assessment of air quality change. Ground-based and satellite data demonstrated the reduction of pollutants in the period of lockdown as compared to the same periods in 2018 and 2019. In particular, AOD data shows reductions of aerosol concentrations in the air column in April and May of approximately by -23% and -18% as compared to 2018-2019. The greatest contraction was for PM2.5 in April and May with reductions of -11.1% to -26.4% and from -8.7 to -21.1% respectively. For PM10, the reductions were from -8.6% to -33.9% and from -8.5% to -31.5% as compared to the same months in 2019. The results showed that restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 significantly improved Poland's air quality.

TI  - Towards scalable estimation of plant functional diversity from Sentinel-2: In-situ validation in a heterogeneous (semi-)natural landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale high-resolution satellite observations of plant functional diversity patterns will greatly benefit our ability to study ecosystem functioning. Here, we demonstrate a potentially scalable approach that uses aggregate plant traits estimated from radiative transfer model (RTM) inversion of Sentinel-2 satellite images to calculate community patterns of plant functional diversity. Trait retrieval relied on simulations and Look-up Tables (LUTs) generated by a RTM rather than heavily depending on a priori field data and data-driven statistical learning. This independence from in-situ training data benefits its scalability as relevant field data remains scarce and difficult to acquire. We ran a total of three different inversion algorithms that are representative of commonly applied approaches and we used two different metrics to calculate functional diversity. In tandem with Sentinel-2 image-based estimation of plant traits, we measured Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf Chlorophyll content (CAB), and Leaf Mass per Area (LMA) in-situ in a (semi-)natural heterogeneous landscape (Montesinho region) located in northern Portugal. Sampling plots were scaled and georeferenced to match the satellite observed pixels and thereby allowed for a direct one-to-one posterior ground truth validation of individual traits and functional diversity. Across approaches, we observe a reasonable correspondence between the satellite-based retrievals and the insitu observations in terms of the relative distribution of individual trait means and plant functional diversity across locations despite the heterogeneity of the landscape and canopies. The functional diversity estimates, based on a combination of canopy and leaf traits, were robust against estimation biases in trait means. Particularly, the convex hull volume estimate of functional diversity showed strong concordance with in-situ observations across all three inversion methods (Spearman's rho: 0.67-0.80). The remotely sensed estimates of functional diversity also related to in-situ taxonomic diversity (Spearman's rho: 0.55-0.63). Our work highlights the potential and challenges of RTM-based functional diversity metrics to study spatial community-level ecological patterns using currently operational and publicly available Sentinel-2 imagery. While further validation and assessment across different ecosystems and larger datasets are needed, the study contributes towards a further maturation of scalable, spatially, and temporally explicit methods for functional diversity assessments from space.

TI  - Multisensor and Multimodel Monitoring and Investigation of a Wintertime Air Pollution Event Ahead of a Cold Front Over Eastern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the limitations in pollutant measurements (e.g., coverage, observation errors) and air quality model uncertainties (e.g., with parameterizations and emissions), a multisensor and multimodel approach offers additional benefits compared to a single-instrument and deterministic approach for monitoring, investigating, and predicting air pollution events. In this study, we use multisensors (including the spaceborne MODIS, OCO-2, AIRS, and OMPS instruments as well as surface instruments) and multimodels (including WRF-Chem and WRF-CO2) to investigate a severe air pollution event on December 9, 2016 over eastern China. During this episode, a strong cold front moved southward. At the leading edge of the front, WRF-CO2 simulates an enhanced XCO2 belt while WRF-Chem simulates a belt of high PM2.5 concentration. The XCO2 and PM2.5 belts are generally colocated, due to coemission of CO2 and pollutants (or their precursors). Satellite observations including MODIS AOD, OCO-2 XCO2, OMPS NO2, AIRS CO, and surface data confirm the simulated pollution and XCO2 belts. Later on, the front became distorted due to terrain blocking and mountain channel flows. Both observations and simulations show that the channel winds between Mountains Dabie and Huang transport the haze plume into Jiangxi province, enhancing pollution in the region. It is concluded that the multisensor (including space-based and ground-based instruments) and multimodel (e.g., WRF-CO2, WRF-Chem) approach can be used to collectively monitor and investigate air pollution events, given that emissions of the involved species have generally similar spatial distributions.

TI  - Simultaneous corn and soybean yield prediction from remote sensing data using deep transfer learning
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale crop yield estimation is, in part, made possible due to the availability of remote sensing data allowing for the continuous monitoring of crops throughout their growth cycle. Having this information allows stakeholders the ability to make real-time decisions to maximize yield potential. Although various models exist that predict yield from remote sensing data, there currently does not exist an approach that can estimate yield for multiple crops simultaneously, and thus leads to more accurate predictions. A model that predicts the yield of multiple crops and concurrently considers the interaction between multiple crop yields. We propose a new convolutional neural network model called YieldNet which utilizes a novel deep learning framework that uses transfer learning between corn and soybean yield predictions by sharing the weights of the backbone feature extractor. Additionally, to consider the multi-target response variable, we propose a new loss function. We conduct our experiment using data from 1132 counties for corn and 1076 counties for soybean across the United States. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed method accurately predicts corn and soybean yield from one to four months before the harvest with an MAE being 8.74% and 8.70% of the average yield, respectively, and is competitive to other state-of-the-art approaches.

TI  - Contribution of the world's main dust source regions to the global cycle of desert dust
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Even though desert dust is the most abundant aerosol by mass in Earth's atmosphere, the relative contributions of the world's major source regions to the global dust cycle remain poorly constrained. This problem hinders accounting for the potentially large impact of regional differences in dust properties on clouds, the Earth's energy balance, and terrestrial and marine biogeochemical cycles. Here, we constrain the contribution of each of the world's main dust source regions to the global dust cycle. We use an analytical framework that integrates an ensemble of global aerosol model simulations with observationally informed constraints on the dust size distribution, extinction efficiency, and regional dust aerosol optical depth (DAOD). We obtain a dataset that constrains the relative contribution of nine major source regions to size-resolved dust emission, atmospheric loading, DAOD, concentration, and deposition flux. We find that the 22-29 Tg (1 standard error range) global loading of dust with a geometric diameter up to 20 mu m is partitioned as follows: North African source regions contribute similar to 50% (11-15 Tg), Asian source regions contribute similar to 40% (8-13 Tg), and North American and Southern Hemisphere regions contribute similar to 10% (1.8-3.2 Tg). These results suggest that current models on average overestimate the contribution of North African sources to atmospheric dust loading at similar to 65 %, while underestimating the contribution of Asian dust at similar to 30 %. Our results further show that each source region's dust loading peaks in local spring and summer, which is partially driven by increased dust lifetime in those seasons. We also quantify the dust deposition flux to the Amazon rainforest to be similar to 10 Tg yr(-1), which is a factor of 2-3 less than inferred from satellite data by previous work that likely overestimated dust deposition by underestimating the dust mass extinction efficiency. The data obtained in this paper can be used to obtain improved constraints on dust impacts on clouds, climate, biogeochemical cycles, and other parts of the Earth system.

TI  - Drought sensitivity of pastures related to soil and landform in the eastern Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Livestock in the Amazon is mainly limited by the lack of forage biomass production in the dry season. The sensitivity of pasture to drought depends on pasture management and on certain natural factors that enable the grass cover to stay green for longer under low rainfall. The sustainability of livestock production systems depends on identifying these natural factors to make better use of their forage production potential without consuming additional water resources or resorting to deforestation. We built an index of pasture dependence on rainfall at the beginning of the dry season by calculating the slope of the linear regression between the MODIS enhanced vegetation index and monthly cumulative rainfall obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission. The index was calculated in Paragominas municipality. A 15-year time series (2000 to 2014) was used to assess the sensitivity of pasture to drought. A map of geomorphological units was overlaid on the index map to check whether the soil and the landform influence drought sensitivity at a large scale. Drought resistance was shown to be higher in lowland areas with loamy sand with a shallow groundwater table and on plateaus covered by fertile sedimentary clay. The escarpments with a ferruginous duricrust and mottled clay were shown to be the most sensitive to drought. These results underline the importance of natural factors in pasture productivity in tropical humid areas. (C) 2021 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Monitoring Turbidity in San Francisco Estuary and Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Using Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study utilizes satellite data to investigate water quality conditions in the San Francisco Estuary and its upstream delta, the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. To do this, this study derives turbidity from the European Space Agency satellite Sentinel-2 acquired from September 2015 to June 2019 and conducts a rigorous validation with in situ measurements of turbidity from optical sensors at continuous monitoring stations. This validation includes 965 matchup comparisons between satellite and in situ sensor data across 22 stations, yielding R-2 = 0.63 and 0.75 for Nephelometric Turbidity Unit and Formazin Nephelometric Unit (FNU) stations, respectively. This study then applies remote sensing to evaluate patterns in turbidity during the Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gates Action ("Gates action"), a pilot study designed to increase habitat access and quality for the endangered Delta Smelt. The basic strategy was to direct more freshwater into Suisun Marsh, creating more low salinity habitat that would then have higher (and more suitable) turbidity than upstream river channels. For all seven acquisitions considered from June 29 to September 27, 2018, turbidity conditions in Bays and Sloughs subregions were consistently higher (and more suitable) (26-47 FNU) than what was observed in the upstream River region (13-25 FNU). This overall pattern was observed when comparing images acquired during similar tidal stages and heights.

TI  - Evaluating the performance of eight drought indices for capturing soil moisture dynamics in various vegetation regions over China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is pervasive global hazard and seriously impacts ecology. Particularly, vegetation drought, which is chiefly driven by soil moisture (SM) deficiency, has a direct bearing on grain production and human livelihoods. Various drought indices associated with vegetation and SM conditions have been proposed tomonitor and detect vegetation drought. In this study, we evaluated the performance of eight drought indices, including Drought Severity Index (DSI), Evaporation Stress Index (ESI), Normalized Vegetation Supply Water Index (NVSWI), Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI), Temperature Vegetation Precipitation Dryness Index (TVPDI), Vegetation Health Index (VHI), Self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (SC-PDSI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), for capturing SM dynamic (derived from Copernicus Climate Change Service) across the six main vegetation coverage types of China. Our results showed DSI and ESI had the best overall performance. When exploring the reasons for the uncertainty of these indices (except SC-PDSI and SPEI) in the evaluation, we found that, in the non-arable regions, the time lag effect of drought indices on SM, the average state and rangeability of corresponding variables and the climatic conditions (precipitation and temperature) all impacted the performance of DSI, ESI, NVSWI, TVPDI and VHI. In the arable region, cropland types (paddy field and non-paddy field) and the uncertainty of SM data mainly caused the uncertainties of the above five indices. With regard to the TVDI, abnormalities of dry and wet edges fitting may be the primary factor affecting its performance. These results demonstrated that these drought indices with reliable and robust performance of capturing SM dynamics can be suggested to characterize the trend of SM. Certainly, this study can provide a reference for the improvement of existing drought indices and the establishment of new drought indices. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Vertical Structure of the Arctic Spring Transition in the Middle Atmosphere
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the middle atmosphere, spring transition is the time period where the zonal circulation reverses from winter westerly to summer easterly which has a strong impact on the vertical wave propagation influencing the ionospheric variability. The spring transition can be rapid in form of a final sudden stratospheric warming (SSW, mainly dynamically driven) or slow (mainly radiatively driven) but also intermediate stages can occur. In most studies spring transitions are classified either by their timing of occurrence or by their vertical structure. However, all these studies focus exclusively on the stratosphere and it is not clear if and how pre-winter conditions have an impact on when and how spring transitions take place. Here we classify the spring transitions regarding their vertical-temporal development beginning in January and spanning the whole middle atmosphere in the core region of the polar vortex. This leads to five classes where the timing of the SSW in the preceding winter and a downward propagating Northern Annular Mode plays a crucial role. First, we use Microwave Limb Sounder satellite data to describe the five classes for recent single years, and then we use Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 reanalysis data for a composite analysis. The results show distinctive differences between the five classes in the months before the spring transition especially in the mesosphere. We hypothesize that this will help to improve the prediction of the spring transition. Additionally, meteor radar winds are used to link spring transition effects in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere with the stratospheric final warming.

TI  - New Observation Operators for Cloud Liquid/Ice Water Path From ABI and Their Impact on Assimilation and Hurricane Forecasts
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The cloud liquid/ice water path (LWP/IWP) can provide valuable information about the cloud and precipitation. For the first time, the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system is applied to examine the impact of the high spatial and temporal resolution LWP and IWP products derived from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on the new generation geostationary environmental satellites (GOES-R series) in numerical weather prediction (NWP). To extend the GSI's capability to assimilate LWP and IWP products, a pair of new observation operators of LWP and IWP is developed to avoid the requirement for hydrometeor control variables. The new observation operators enable the direct use of hydrometeor background information from the NWP model and allow the vertical propagation of the water vapor increment according to the Jacobian distributions for the new LWP and IWP operators. The new LWP and IWP observation operators are evaluated by the single observation tests and the cycling assimilation and forecast experiments of Hurricane Irma (2017) and Hurricane Maria (2017). The results from single observation tests show that the assimilations of pseudo-LWP and pseudo-IWP can achieve positive water vapor increments, which also spread vertically according to the Jacobian distributions. The impact studies on two hurricanes demonstrate that the ABI LWP and IWP measurements can be successfully assimilated into the NWP model by the new observation operators, which enhances the water vapor analysis and further improves other atmospheric state variables in the forecast fields. The improved environmental fields lead to the overall forecast improvement for the two hurricanes, with the most notable track improvement.

TI  - Cause analysis of PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution during the COVID-19 lockdown in Nanning, China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - To analyse the cause of the atmospheric PM2.5 pollution that occurred during the COVID-19 lockdown in Nanning, Guangxi, China, a single particulate aerosol mass spectrometer, aethalometer, and particulate Lidar coupled with monitoring near-surface gaseous pollutants, meteorological conditions, remote fire spot sensing by satellite and backward trajectory models were utilized during 18-24 February 2020. Three haze stages were identified: the pre-pollution period (PPP), pollution accumulation period (PAP) and pollution dissipation period (PDP). The dominant source of PM2.5 in the PPP was biomass burning (BB) (40.4%), followed by secondary inorganic sources (28.1%) and motor vehicle exhaust (11.7%). The PAP was characterized by a large abundance of secondary inorganic sources, which contributed 56.1% of the total PM2.5 concentration, followed by BB (17.4%). The absorption angstrom ngstrom exponent (2.2) in the PPP was higher than that in the other two periods. Analysis of fire spots monitored by remote satellite sensing indicated that open BB in regions around Nanning City could be one of the main factors. A planetary boundary layer-relative humidity-secondary particle matter-particulate matter positive feedback mechanism was employed to elucidate the atmospheric processes in this study. This study highlights the importance of understanding the role of BB, secondary inorganic sources and meteorology in air pollution formation and calls for policies for emission control strategies.

TI  - "Awakening the sleeping giant": re-Indigenization principles for transforming biodiversity conservation in Canada and beyond
T2  - FACETS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitous declines in biodiversity threaten planetary boundaries, requiring transformative changes to conservation. Colonial systems have decimated species and ecosystems and dispossessed Indigenous Peoples of their rights, territories, and livelihoods. Despite these challenges, Indigenous governed lands retain a large proportion of biodiversity-rich landscapes. Indigenous Peoples have stewarded the land in ways that support people and nature in respectful relationship. Biodiversity conservation and resurgence of Indigenous autonomies are mutually compatible aims. To work towards these aims requires significant transformation in conservation and re-Indigenization. Key to both are systems that value people and nature in all their diversity and relationships. This paper introduces Indigenous principles for re-Indigenizing conservation: (i) embracing Indigenous world views of ecologies and M's-it No'kmaq, (ii) learning from Indigenous languages of the land, (iii) Natural laws and Netukulimk, (iv) correct relationships, (v) total reflection and truth, (vi) Etuaptmumk-"two-eyed seeing," and "strong like two people", and (vii) "story-telling/story-listening". Although the principles derive primarily from a Mi'kmaw worldview, many are common to diverse Indigenous ways of knowing. Achieving the massive effort required for biodiversity conservation in Canada will entail transformations in worldviews and ways of thinking and bold, proactive actions, not solely as means but as ongoing imperatives.

TI  - Feasibility of sentinel node navigated surgery in high-risk T1b esophageal adenocarcinoma patients using a hybrid tracer of technetium-99 m and indocyanine green
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Minimally invasive esophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy is standard of care for T1b esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) with a high risk of lymph node metastasis. Sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) is a well-known concept to tailor the extent of lymphadenectomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of SNNS with a hybrid tracer (technetium-99 m/indocyanine green/nanocolloid) for patients with high-risk T1b EAC. Methods In this prospective, multicenter pilot study, 5 patients with high-risk T1b EAC were included. The tracer was injected endoscopically around the endoscopic resection scar the day before surgery, followed by preoperative imaging (lymphoscintigraphy/SPECT-CT). During surgery, first the SNs were localized and resected based on preoperative imaging and intraoperative gammaprobe- and fluorescence-based detection, followed by esophagectomy. Primary endpoints were the percentage of patients with detectable SNs, concordance between preoperative and intraoperative SN detection, and the additive value of indocyanine green. Results SNs could be identified and resected in all patients (median 3 SNs per patient, range 2-7). There was a high concordance between preoperative and intraoperative SN detection. In 2 patients additional peritumoral SNs were identified with fluorescence-based detection. None of the resected lymph nodes showed signs of (micro)metastases and no nodal metastases were detected in the surgical resection specimen. Conclusions SNNS using technetium-99 m/indocyanine green/nanocolloid seems feasible and safe in patients with high-risk T1b EAC. Indocyanine green fluorescence seems to be of additive value for detection of peritumoral SNs. Whether this approach can optimize selection for esophagectomy needs to be studied in future research.

TI  - Comparing airborne and spaceborne photon-counting LiDAR canopy structural estimates across different boreal forest types
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of forested ecosystems relies on an accurate description of forest structure. The Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), launched in September 2018, carries the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) instrument capable of detecting individual photons reflected back from vegetation canopy. ICESat-2 data is delivering global estimates of forest structure; however, analysis of the performance of ICESat-2 on-orbit data across a range of forest conditions remains limited. This study derives structural estimates of (i) canopy height, (ii) canopy cover and (iii) canopy height variability from ICESat-2 data acquired in snow-free and low atmospheric scattering conditions over different boreal forest structural types in Ontario, Canada. ICESat-2 structural estimates were derived from the Global Geolocated Photon Data (ATL03) and Land and Vegetation Height (ATL08) data products and compared against single-photon detection airborne LiDAR (Leica SPL100). An extensive network of ground plots were used to stratify the study area into three distinct forest structural groups, each resulting from different stand development stages. ICESat-2 and SPL100 estimates of canopy height were compared at the ATL03 photon level, whereas estimates of height variability and canopy cover were compared for spatial analysis units (AU; mean size = 1287 m2). ICESat-2 photons returned from the top of the canopy underestimated canopy height relative to SPL100 by an average of 2.3 m overall and corresponded most strongly to the 90th percentile (P90) of coincident airborne SPL100 returns (root mean square difference (RMSD) = 2.9 m and correlation coefficient (r) = 0.84). The lowest average underestimation of SPL P90 was observed in homogeneous stands that were relatively simple, and singlelayered with a single dominant species (RMSD = 2.5 m, r = 0.84). We observed the least agreement of ICESat-2 and SPL forest structural metrics in over-mature stands with complex structure and greater variability in canopy heights (RMSD = 3.5 m, r = 0.64). For the AUs, the strength of the relationship between SPL100 and ICESat-2 canopy height percentiles increased with increasing height percentiles (e.g. P25 RMSD% = 77.8%; P95 RMSD% = 23.7%). ICESat-2 generally underestimated canopy height variability relative to the SPL100 data, with both data having similar absolute variability (standard deviation of canopy heights RMSD% = 26.8%, r = 0.75), but lower agreement in relative variability (coefficient of variation of canopy heights RMSD% = 33.9%, r = 0.45). Herein we propose the use of the vegetation fill index as a method to estimate canopy cover with ICESat-2. Comparison of SPL100 and ICESat-2 vegetation fill indices at the AU level resulted in strong agreement overall (RMSD% = 19.7%; r = 0.57). These observations and results contribute to the overall objective of building a comprehensive understanding of the performance of ICESat-2 for characterizing vegetation structure in boreal forest environments.

TI  - Ethnic and minority group differences in engagement with COVID-19 vaccination programmes - <i>at Pandemic Pace; when vaccine confidence in mass rollout meets local vaccine hesitancy</i>
T2  - ISRAEL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Israel, the UK, the USA, and some other wealthier countries lead in the implementation of COVID-19 vaccine mass vaccination programmes. Evidence from these countries indicates that their ethnic minorities could be as disproportionately disadvantaged in COVID-19 vaccines roll-out as they were affected by COVID-19-related serious illnesses. Their disadvantage is linked to their lower social status and fewer social goods compared with dominant population groups.Albeit limited by methodology, early studies attribute lower uptake of COVID-19 amongst ethnic minorities to the wider determinants of vaccine uptake, hesitancy or lack of vaccine confidence, including lower levels of trust and greater concerns about vaccine safety. Early sentinel studies are needed in all early adopter countries.One emerging theme among those of reproductive age in minority communities concerns a worry regarding COVID-19 vaccine's potential adverse effect on fertility. Respected professional groups reassure this is not a credible rationale. Drug and vaccine regulators use understandable, cautious and conditional language in emergency licencing of new gene-based vaccines. Technical assessments on whether there is any potential genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity should be more emphatic.From a public health perspective, sentinel studies should identify such community concerns and act early to produce convincing explanations and evidence. Local public health workforces need to be diverse, multiskilled, and able to engage well with minorities and vulnerable groups. The local Directors of Public Health in the UK are based in each local government area and have a remit and opportunity to stimulate speedy action to increase vaccine uptake.During the rapid Pandemic Pace of the vaccines roll-out, extra efforts to minimise uptake variations are likely to achieve improvements in the next year or two. We expect variations will not disappear however, given that underlying inequalities persist in less inclusive social systems.

TI  - Storm and fire disturbances in Europe: Distribution and trends
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Abiotic forest disturbances are an important driver of ecosystem dynamics. In Europe, storms and fires have been identified as the most important abiotic disturbances in the recent past. Yet, how strongly these agents drive local disturbance regimes compared to other agents (e.g., biotic, human) remains unresolved. Furthermore, whether storms and fires are responsible for the observed increase in forest disturbances in Europe is debated. Here, we provide quantitative evidence for the prevalence of storm and fire disturbances in Europe 1986-2016. For 27 million disturbance patches mapped from satellite data, we determined whether they were caused by storm or fire, using a random forest classifier and a large reference dataset of true disturbance occurrences. We subsequently analyzed patterns of disturbance prevalence (i.e., the share of an agent on the overall area disturbed) in space and time. Storm- and fire-related disturbances each accounted for approximately 7% of all disturbances recorded in Europe in the period 1986-2016. Storm-related disturbances were most prevalent in western and central Europe, where they locally accounted for >50% of all disturbances, but we also identified storm-related disturbances in south-eastern and eastern Europe. Fire-related disturbances were a major disturbance agent in southern and south-eastern Europe, but fires also occurred in eastern and northern Europe. The prevalence and absolute area of storm-related disturbances increased over time, whereas no trend was detected for fire-related disturbances. Overall, we estimate an average of 127,716 (97,680-162,725) ha of storm-related disturbances per year and an average of 141,436 (107,353-181,022) ha of fire-related disturbances per year. We conclude that abiotic disturbances caused by storm and fire are important drivers of forest dynamics in Europe, but that their influence varies substantially by region. Our analysis further suggests that increasing storm-related disturbances are an important driver of Europe's changing forest disturbance regimes.

TI  - The analysis of using satellite soil moisture observations for flood detection, evaluating over the Thailand's Great Flood of 2011
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - A flood monitoring and warning system provides critical information that can protect property and save lives. A basin-scale flood monitoring system requires an effective observation platform that offers extensive ground coverage of flood conditions, low latency, and high spatiotemporal resolution. While satellite imagery offers substantial spatial flood extent in detail due to its high spatial resolution, the coarse temporal resolution and cloud obstruction limit its near real-time application. Daily soil moisture data derived from satellite sensors at a scale of a few km can be used to monitor extreme wet surface conditions arising in flood occurrences. This study analyzes the flood detection capabilities of several sources of soil moisture information, including the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission (SMOS), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on EOS, the Advanced SCATterometer on MetOp, the Global Land Data Assimilation System, and the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model. In addition to soil moisture, the analysis includes measurements of surface reflectance from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), precipitation measurements from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, and terrestrial water storage estimates from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment as proxies for flood inundations. The analysis was conducted over the Chao Phraya River Basin in Thailand, where the Great Flood of 2011 led to one of the most significant economic losses in the country's history. Satellite-derived soil moisture exhibits a stronger correlation with the flood inundations than the precipitation, model-derived soil moisture, and terrestrial water storage data. SMOS soil moisture observation agrees best with the MODIS-derived flood extent/occurrence, both in terms of spatial distribution and timing, and providing approximated flood lead-time of one week or longer. A neural network constructed from SMOS and MODIS data is used to predict flood intensity/occurrence (given soil moisture input) with a predicted time window from eight days to thirty-two days. The short-term prediction (e.g., eight days) achieves the highest accuracy with an averaged recovery rate of approximately 60% (correlation coefficient). This study's results suggest a potential application of satellite soil moisture data in assisting flood monitoring and warning systems.

TI  - A Multiyear Assessment of Irrigation Cooling Capacity in Agricultural and Urban Settings of Central Arizona
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation water use associated with agricultural activities and urban green spaces provides substantial cooling effects and ameliorates heat in central Arizona. In this arid and semiarid area, evaluating the effect of irrigation on land surface temperature (LST) for different types of land use can improve decision making related to water resources management. In this work, we improved the simulation of urban and agricultural irrigation in the Variable Infiltration Capacity model through remotely sensed vegetation and irrigation parameters applied at high spatiotemporal resolution. We then conducted a multiyear (2004-2013) assessment of simulated LST with respect to ground observations and remotely sensed products finding overall good agreement. Overall, results show that irrigation of about 2 mm/day is required to reduce average daily LST by 1 degrees C across the region. Numerical experiments with the validated model also reveal that irrigation leads to LST reductions of higher magnitude and greater spatial variability in croplands than in urban areas. Furthermore, we found that the role of interannual variations in cropping practices is more critical than year-to-year differences in climatic conditions for the evaluation of irrigation cooling capacity. Thus, remotely sensed vegetation products can serve a valuable purpose in quantifying LST reductions and irrigation requirements to achieve a target of heat amelioration.

TI  - The evaluation of the potential of global data products for snow hydrological modelling in ungauged high-alpine catchments
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - For many ungauged mountain regions, global datasets of different meteorological and land surface parameters are the only data sources available. However, their applicability in modelling high-alpine regions has been insufficiently investigated so far. Therefore, we tested a suite of globally available datasets by applying the physically based Cold Regions Hydrological Model (CRHM) for a 10-year (September 2000-August 2010) period in the gauged high-alpine Research Catchment Zugspitze (RCZ), which is 12 km(2) and located in the European Alps. Besides meteorological data, snow depth is measured at two stations. We ran CRHM with a reference run with in situ-measured meteorological data and a 2.5m high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) for the parameterization of the surface characteristics. Regarding different meteorological setups, we used 10 different globally available datasets (including versions of ERA, GLDAS, CFSR, CHIRPS) and additionally one transferred dataset from a similar station in the vicinity. Regarding the different DEMs, we used ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) and SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) (both 30 m) as well as GTOPO30 (1 km). The following two main goals were investigated: (a) the reliability of simulations of snow depth, specific snow hydrological parameters and runoff with global meteorological products and (b) the influence of different global DEMs on snow hydrological simulations in such a topographically complex terrain. The range between all setups in mean decadal temperature is high at 3.5 degrees C and for the mean decadal precipitation sum at 1510 mm, which subsequently leads to large offsets in the snow hydrological results. Only three meteorological setups, the reference, the transferred in situ dataset and the CHIRPS dataset, substituting precipitation only, showed agreeable results when comparing modelled to measured snow depth. Nevertheless, those setups showed obvious differences in the catchment's runoff regime and in snow depth, snow cover, ablation period, the date, and quantity of maximum snow water equivalent in the entire catchment and in specific parts. All other globally available meteorological datasets performed worse. In contrast, all globally available DEM setups reproduced snow depth, the snow hydrological parameters and runoff quite well. Differences occurred mainly due to differences in radiation model input due to different spatial realizations. Even though SRTM and ALOS have the same spatial resolution, they showed considerable differences due to their different product origins. Despite the fact that the very coarse GTOPO30 DEM performed relatively well on the catchment mean, we advise against using this product in such heterogeneous high-alpine terrain since small-scale topographic characteristics cannot be captured. While global meteorological data are not suitable for sound snow hydrological modelling in the RCZ, the choice of the DEM with resolutions in the decametre level is less critical. Nevertheless, global meteorological data can be a valuable source to substitute single missing variables. For the future, however, we expect an increasing role of global data in modelling ungauged high-alpine basins due to further product improvements, spatial refinements and further steps regarding assimilation with remote sensing data.

TI  - Machine learning for hydrologic sciences: An introductory overview
T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrologic community has experienced a surge in interest in machine learning in recent years. This interest is primarily driven by rapidly growing hydrologic data repositories, as well as success of machine learning in various academic and commercial applications, now possible due to increasing accessibility to enabling hardware and software. This overview is intended for readers new to the field of machine learning. It provides a non-technical introduction, placed within a historical context, to commonly used machine learning algorithms and deep learning architectures. Applications in hydrologic sciences are summarized next, with a focus on recent studies. They include the detection of patterns and events such as land use change, approximation of hydrologic variables and processes such as rainfall-runoff modeling, and mining relationships among variables for identifying controlling factors. The use of machine learning is also discussed in the context of integrated with process-based modeling for parameterization, surrogate modeling, and bias correction. Finally, the article highlights challenges of extrapolating robustness, physical interpretability, and small sample size in hydrologic applications.

TI  - Impact of Thermohaline Conditions on Vertical Variability of Optical Properties in the Gulf of Finland (Baltic Sea): Implications for Water Quality Remote Sensing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertical variability of inherent optical properties (IOPs) affect the water quality retrievals from remote sensing data. Here, we studied the vertical variability of IOPs and simulated apparent optical properties (AOPs) in the Gulf of Finland (Baltic Sea) under three characteristic (non)stratification conditions. In the case of mixed water column, the vertical variability of optically significant constituents (OSC) and IOPs was relatively small. While in case of stratified water column the IOPs of surface layer were three times higher compared to the IOPs below the thermocline and the IOPs were strongly correlated with the physical parameters (temperature, salinity). Measurements of IOPs in stratified water column showed that the ratio of scattering (b(440)) to absorption (a(440)) changed under the thermocline (b(440)/a(440) < 1) i.e., absorption became the dominant component of attenuation under thermocline while the opposite is true for the upper layer. Simulated (from IOPs) spectral irradiance reflectance (R(lambda)) and spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d(lambda)) from deeper layers (below thermocline) have significantly smaller magnitude and smoother shape. This becomes relevant during upwelling events-a common process in the coastal Baltic Sea. We quantified the effect of upwelling on surface water properties using simulated AOPs. The simulated AOPs (from IOPs measurements) showed a decrease of the signal up to 68.8% and an increase of optical depth (Z(90)(lambda)) from 2.3 to 4.3 m in the green part of the spectrum in case upwelled water mass reaches the surface. In the coastal waters a vertical decrease of K-d(lambda) in the PAR region (400-700 nm) by 6.8% (surface to 20 m depth) was observed, while vertical decrease of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM) was 31.7 and 42.1%, respectively. The ratio R(490)/R(560) >= 0.77 indicates also the upwelled water mass. The study showed that upwelling is a process that, in addition to biological activity, horizontal transport of OSC, and temperature changes, alters the optical signal of surface water measured by a remote sensor. Knowledge about the vertical variability of IOPs and AOPs relation to upwelling can help the parametrisation of remote sensing algorithms for retrieving water quality estimates in the coastal regions.

TI  - Estimating the Influence of Oyster Reef Chains on Freshwater Detention at the Estuary Scale Using Landsat-8 Imagery
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oyster reef chains grow in response to local hydrodynamics and can redirect flows, particularly when reef chains grow perpendicular to freshwater flow paths. Singularly, oyster reef chains can act as porous dams that may facilitate nearshore accumulation of fresh or low-salinity water, in turn creating intermediate salinities that support oyster growth and estuarine conditions. However, oyster-driven freshwater detention has only been confirmed by limited, point-scale observational data, and simplified models. Oyster reef-driven freshwater detention in real ecosystems at the estuary scale remains largely unexplored. In this study, we analyzed the visible bands in 30-m resolution remote sensing (RS) images recorded by the Operational Land Imager aboard Landsat-8 to characterize the freshwater detention effect of oyster reef chains across a set of hydrologic conditions. Our results support prior findings indicating that 30-m resolution RS images recorded by the Operational Land Imager aboard Landsat-8 are useful for analyzing coastal dynamics after atmospheric correction, despite having been originally designed for terrestrial studies. Statistical models of water-leaving reflectance revealed that freshwater detention by oyster reefs was evident across the estuary, with the greatest effect occurring in the region closest to shore. Additionally, statistical modeling results and spatial patterns apparent in the satellite images suggested that reef-driven freshwater detention occurred under high riverine discharge conditions, but was less evident when flow was low. Beyond offering insight on the potential role of oyster reefs as mediators of estuarine hydrology, this study presents a transferable methodological framework for exploring estuarine biophysical feedbacks in blackwater river estuaries using satellite remote sensing.

TI  - Understanding the spatiotemporal pollution dynamics of highly fragile montane watersheds of Kashmir Himalaya, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Pollution of riverine ecosystems through the multidimensional impact of human footprints around the world poses a serious challenge. Research studies that communicate potential repercussions of landscape structure metrics on snowmelt riverine water quality particularly, in climatically fragile Himalayan watersheds are very scarce. Though, worldwide, grasping the influence of land-use practices on water quality (WQ) has received renewed attention yet, the relevance of spatial scale linked to landscape pattern is still elusive due to its heterogenic nature across diverse geomorphic regions. In this work, therefore, we tried to capture the insights on landscape-aquascape interface by juxtapositioning the impacts of landscape structure pattern on snowmelt stream WQ of the whole Jhelum River Basin (JRB) under three varying spatial scales viz., watershed scale, riparian corridor (1000 m wide) and reach buffer (500 m wide). The percentage of landscape pattern composition and configuration metrics in the JRB were computed in GIS utilizing Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS satellite image having 30 m resolution. To better explicate the influence of land-use metrics on riverine WQ with space and time, we used Redundancy analysis (RDA) and multilinear regression (MLR) modeling. MLR selected land-use structure metrics revealed the varied response of WQ parameters to multi-scale factors except for total faecal coliform bacteria (TC) which showed perpetual presence. The reach-scale explained slightly better (76%) variations in WQ than riparian (75%) and watershed (70%) scales. Likewise, across seasonal scale, autumn (75%), winter (83%), and summer (77%) captured the most WQ variation at catchment, riparian, and reach scales respectively. We observed impairing WQ linkages with agriculture, built-up and barren rocky areas across watersheds, besides, pastures in riparian buffer areas, and fragmentation of landscape patches at the reach scale. Due to little appearance of spatial scale differences, a multi scale perspective landscape planning is emphasized to ensure future sustainability of Kashmir Himalayan water resources.

TI  - Comprehensive bathymetry and intertidal topography of the Amazon estuary
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The characterization of estuarine hydrodynamics primarily depends on knowledge of the bathymetry and topography. Here, we present the first comprehensive, high-resolution dataset of the topography and bathymetry of the Amazon River estuary, the world's largest estuary. Our product is based on an innovative approach combining spaceborne remote sensing data, an extensive and processed river depth dataset, and auxiliary data. Our goal with this mapping is to promote the database usage in studies that require this information, such as hydrodynamic modeling or geomorphological assessments. Our twofold approach considered 500 000 sounding points digitized from 19 nautical charts for bathymetry estimation, in conjunction with a state-of-the-art topographic dataset based on remote sensing, encompassing intertidal flats, riverbanks, and adjacent floodplains. Finally, our estimate can be accessed in a unified 30 m resolution regular grid referenced to the Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM08), complemented both landward and seaward by land (Multi-Error-Removed Improved-Terrain digital elevation model, MERIT DEM) and ocean (General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans version 2020, GEBCO_2020) topographic data. Extensive validation against independent and spatially distributed data, from an airborne lidar survey, from ICESat-2 altimetric satellite data, and from various in situ surveys, shows a typical vertical accuracy of 7.2m (riverbed) and 1.2 m (non-vegetated intertidal floodplains). The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.17632/3g6b5ynrdb.2 (Fassoni-Andrade et al., 2021).

TI  - LandTrendr smoothed spectral profiles enhance woody encroachment monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary succession (SS) is one of the main consequences of the abandonment of agricultural and forestry practices in rural areas, causing-among other processes-woody encroachment on former pastures and croplands. In this study we model and monitor the spatial evolution of SS over semi-natural grassland communities in the mountain range of the Pyrenees in Spain, during the last 36 years (1984-2019). Independent variables for 'annual-based' and `period-based' modeling were drawn from a suite of Surface Reflectance Landsat images, LandTrendr (LT)-algorithm-adjusted images and LT outputs. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were trained and tested using all possible variable combinations of all the aforementioned datasets. The best modeling strategy involved yearly time series of LT-adjusted Tasseled Cap Brightness (TCB) and Wetness (TCW) axes as predictors, attaining a F1-score of 0.85, a Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.67 and an AUC 0.83. Woodlands encroached above 480,000 ha of grasslands and crops during the study period. A model using LT outputs for the whole period also denoted good performance (F1-score = 0.85, MCC = 0.75) and estimated a similar area of woodland expansion (similar to 509,000 ha), but this 'period' approach was unable to provide temporal information on the year or the encroachment dynamics. Our results suggest an overall proportion of 66% for the Pyrenees being affected by SS, with higher intensity in the west-central part, decreasing towards the eastern end.

TI  - Modeling of surface soil moisture using C-band SAR data over bare fields in the tropical semi-arid region of India
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial variability of surface soil moisture is a prime factor in modeling many environmental and meteorological processes. This study aims to model surface soil moisture in bare fields using Sentinel-1A SAR data at a regional scale. The site/plot selected for the study falls in the tropical semi-arid region of Malavalli, Karnataka, India. The study site is divided into 43 grids to collect soil moisture samples from bare field plots synchronized with Sentinel-1A pass. Sentinel-1A, dual-polarized (VV and VH) data with 5.405-GHz frequency and central incidence angle of 33 degrees are used. Six SAR imageries were procured from ESA, out of which five were used to model field soil moisture and one for validation. Processing of the SAR imageries is carried out using SNAP 7.0 software's standard tools, and the backscattered energy of each sample grid is extracted using R software. The relation between SAR backscatter energy with soil parameters like moisture, dielectric constant, and roughness was used to model soil moisture. Results revealed that Sentinel-1A has a high potential to record the soil moisture spatial variation at the plot scale. Volumetric soil moisture and backscattered energy showed a positive correlation with R-2 of 0.59 and 0.51 for VV and VH polarization. Dielectric constant also showed a positive correlation with backscattered energy having R-2 of 0.54 and 0.48 for VV and VH polarization. With this knowledge, surface soil moisture is modeled over bare fields and mapped. Soil moisture modeled is validated using field data, which has R-2 of 0.88 and RMSE of 1.93. The developed model and surface soil moisture map are helpful in regional hydrological studies and crop water requirement assessment.

TI  - Sensitivity of snowmelt runoff modelling to the level of cloud coverage for snow cover extent from daily MODIS product collection 6
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: The Balkhab River Basin in northern AfghanistanStudy Focus: Snowmelt is a primary water resource in mountainous regions of the world. Remotely sensed snow cover products are useful for obtaining spatial snow information but have unsolved cloud cover issues. Thus, this study demonstrates (1) a spatiotemporal combination approach for reducing cloud cover and improving the accuracy in snow cover extent (SCE) estimation from 2010 to 2018 using the MODIS daily snow cover product version 6 and (2) the sensitivity of snowmelt runoff modelling to SCE inputs with different levels of cloud cover from 2012 to 2014 using a snowmelt runoff model (SRM).New Hydrological Insights for the Region: The average cloud coverages of the original MODIS Aqua and Terra daily products for the study region and period were reduced from 37.66 % and 31.88 % to 25.9 % after the spatial combination and to 14.28 % and 8.94 %, respectively, after the temporal combination. The temporal combination with previous and following days yielded a substantial improvement in cloud removal. The sensitivity of the SRM results to the different levels of clouds clearly depicts the gradual improvement in the simulated snowmelt runoffs with a cloud cover reduction in the SCE input. Interestingly, the SRM performances with the direct SCE input from Aqua or Terra products are degraded in some cases compared to those without SCE input in the SRM. Thus, careful attention is needed when directly applying remotely sensed snow cover products as input variables in snow hydrological modelling. The simulated snowmelt runoffs are improved substantially in the melting season in March-May. The snowmelt runoff peaks in May are due to the temperature increase and are mainly responsible for extreme floods in the arid study region. This study contributes further to agricultural water resource management for crop cultivation during the dry season from June to September and to flood protection during the snowmelt runoff peaks in May with a potential hydraulic engineering solution.

TI  - Urban expansion and enhanced flood risk in Africa: The example of Lagos
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The world is increasingly characterised by uncertainty, complexity and rapid change while vulnerability to potential disasters is equally increasing. The situation is more dire in countries where governments are unable to manage land use and development in rapidly growing towns and cities. Lagos, a major city in Nigeria, is notorious for flooding, owing to its being lowland, and this is compounded by inadequate planning and uncoordinated physical development. A systematic study of urban expansion in Lagos was done using Landsat ETM, OLI and Google Earth imageries for 2000, 2013 and 2019 to analyse land use and land cover change, and pattern of encroachment of physical development into vegetation cover and flood plains in Lagos. The comparison of the three Land Use Land Cover Change (LU/LC) schemes, indicates that built-up areas accounted for about 50.0% of land use in Lagos in 2019. The increase is almost thrice the extent recorded in the year 2000. As the pace of growth quickens, new structures deplete vegetation and fuels lateral expansion into marginal land. Adherence to land use planning regulation, vertical expansion and flood-plain-buy-back were recommended as strategies to mitigate flood risk.

TI  - Preventive covered stent placement at the gastroduodenal artery stump in angiogram-negative sentinel hemorrhage after pancreaticoduodenectomy
T2  - ABDOMINAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To evaluate the clinical outcomes of preventive covered stent placement at the gastroduodenal artery stump in patients with angiogram-negative sentinel hemorrhage after pancreaticoduodenectomy.Methods Between July 2006 and September 2018, patients undergoing computed tomography angiography or diagnostic angiography for sentinel hemorrhage after pancreaticoduodenectomy were retrospectively reviewed. Patients having angiogram-negative angiography and undergoing preventive covered stent placement or conservative treatment were included. Clinical outcomes, technique success, and complications were evaluated.Results A total of 25 patients (mean age 62.5 years) were evaluated, including 15 patients underwent preventive covered stent placement at the gastroduodenal artery stump and 10 patients received conservative treatments. The clinical success rates were 50% (5/10) and 86.7% (13/15) for conservative treatments and covered stent groups, respectively (p = 0.07). In the conservative treatment group, delayed massive hemorrhage occurred in five patients, two of whom died of recurrent bleeding due to gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm within 16 days, and two had intraluminal hemorrhage within 5 days. In the covered stent group, one patient had inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm 1 day after the placement of the covered stent, and one had recurrent bleeding due to duodenal ulcer within 14 days. The 30-day mortality was 40% (4/10) and 0 in the conservative treatment and covered stent groups, respectively (p = 0.02). The difference in the overall survival was nonsignificant between the two groups (p = 0.23).Conclusions The preventive covered stent placement at the gastroduodenal artery stump is safe and reduces delayed massive hemorrhage and short-term mortality in patients with angiogram-negative sentinel hemorrhage after pancreaticoduodenectomy.

TI  - CD63 expression in metastatic melanoma and melanocytic nevi in lymph nodes
T2  - PATHOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymph node status remains one of the most important determinants for prognosis in patients with invasive malignant melanoma. Immunohistochemical stains are routinely employed in the histopathologic evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes removed for staging in patients with melanoma. Histologic analysis may reveal the presence of incidental benign melanocytic nevus cell inclusions (BMNCI), which are critical to distinguish from metastatic melanoma (MM). Our study assesses the utility of NK1 C3 (CD63) immunohistochemical staining in distinguishing between MM and BMNCI in sentinel lymph nodes. We found no difference in staining of MM and BMNCI, precluding its usefulness in differentiating between benign and malignant melanocytes. Thus CD63 lacks specificity when facing challenging cases requiring distinction between benign and malignant melanocytic cells; however, in combination with other immunohistochemical antibodies, CD63 may be useful in supporting melanocytic differentiation. Distinguishing MM and BMNCI continues to be a diagnostic challenge at times. Further research is needed to identify potentially useful markers to provide better diagnostic utility when evaluating lymph node biopsies in patients with melanoma.

TI  - FIRM: Framework for Image Registration Using Multistage Feature Detection and Mode-Guided Motion Smoothness Keypoint Optimization
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing image registration is a pivotal preprocessing step for earth observation data analytics. In this regard, georeferencing corrects the systematic geometric degradation in the image. However, it is difficult to achieve subpixel geometric accuracy across multitemporal scenes. This article focuses on hindmost part of geometric correction that uses reference layer and feature detection in hierarchical stages to improve the geometric fidelity of images at subpixel level. The methodology developed is based on patch affine-oriented fast and brief with mode-guided tiled scale invariant feature transform (MT-SIFT) techniques in a coordinate manner at a multistage processing architecture, which we refer to as FIRM. Motion smoothness constraint (MSC) keypoint correspondence optimization is used in FIRM to remove the outliers at gross stage and estimate segmented affine transformation parameters at finer stage. The automatic coregistration pipeline is evaluated in Indian Resourcesat multispectral camera images covering diverse landscapes. The capability of the designed framework is demonstrated to handle relatively large geometrical error. With more than a decade difference in acquisitions, multitemporal images are superimposed over each other and compared with state-of-the-art feature-based methods. The potential of the proposed approach FIRM is assessed on multisatellite imagery acquired from Resourcesat-2 and Landsat -8. It is observed that the root mean square error (RMSE) between coregistered images is 0.12 pixel at a spatial resolution of 5 m.

TI  - Usefulness and Prospects of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Patients With Breast Cancer Using the Medical Imaging Projection System
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe Medical Imaging Projection System (MIPS) projects indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence images directly on the surgical field using a projection mapping technique. We conducted an observational study of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy using the prototype MIPS; we found a high identification rate. However, the number of SLN-positive cases was small, and the sensitivity could not be evaluated. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical usefulness of the MIPS assisted ICG fluorescence method using commercially available equipment.MethodsThis was a retrospective observational study. Patients with primary breast cancer who underwent SLN biopsy using the MIPS at Kyoto University Hospital from April to December 2020 were included in the study. The primary endpoints were the identification rate of SLNs and detection of positive SLNs by the MIPS. The secondary endpoint was the number of SLNs excised using the MIPS per patient. We also conducted a questionnaire survey focused on the utility of the MIPS; it involved doctors with an experience in using the MIPS.ResultsSeventy-nine patients (84 procedures) were included in the study. In 60 (71%) procedures, both the radioisotope (RI) method and MIPS were used. At least one SLN could be detected by the MIPS in all the procedures, with an identification rate of 100% (95% confidence interval 95.6-100%). A total of 19 (7%) positive SLNs were removed, which were identifiable by the MIPS. Among 57 patients in whom the MIPS and RI methods were used, there was no positive SLN only identified by the RI method. The results of the questionnaire survey showed that the MIPS enabled the operator and assistant to share the ICG fluorescence image in the surgical field and to communicate with each other easily.ConclusionThe current study demonstrated that the identification rate of SLNs using the MIPS was high, and the MIPS can be used for detecting positive SLNs. It was suggested that the MIPS will be useful in learning SLN biopsy procedures.

TI  - Precision Breast-Conserving Surgery With Microwave Ablation Guidance: A Pilot Single-Center, Prospective Cohort Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionNegative margins in breast-conserving surgery (BCS) are essential for preventing recurrence. The aim of this study was to determine the use of preoperative microwave ablation (MWA) in the guidance of BCS for early-stage breast cancer and access whether MWA could influence the rates of positive resection margins.MethodsFrom 2016 to 2018, 22 women with T1/T2 invasive breast cancer were enrolled for MWA prospectively in the guidance of BCS. US-guided MWA was performed under local anesthesia, followed by BCS and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) one week after ablation. Women who underwent palpation-guided BCS directly were included as control, and propensity score matching analysis was applied.ResultsMWA was performed in 22 patients. Of the 21 MWA cases with effect information, the mean tumor size in US was 20.9 +/- 6.2 mm (6-37 mm). Compared with control group (BCS directly), a lower rate of positive/close margins was observed in MWA guidance group (P = 0.018), and MWA caused a higher rate of accurate surgery (the largest margin <= 3 cm and the smallest margin >= 1mm, P = 0.042). Of these 21 patients treated with MWA, 18 were candidates for SLNB. And sentinel lymph nodes were successfully identified in all cases, and no recurrence was found with a mean follow-up of 23 months.ConclusionFor patients with T1/T2 breast cancer, the application of preoperative MWA could guide BCS accurately without impairing SLNB. Clinical trials with long-term results are required to validate MWA in the guidance for breast cancer excision.

TI  - Improvement in air quality and its impact on land surface temperature in major urban areas across India during the first lockdown of the pandemic
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic and the enforced lockdown have reduced the use of surface and air transportation. This study investigates the impact of the lockdown restrictions in India on atmospheric composition, using Sentinel-5Ps retrievals of tropospheric NO2 concentration and ground-station measurements of NO2 and PM2.5 between March-May in 2019 and 2020. Detailed analysis of the changes to atmospheric composition are carried out over six major urban areas (i.e. Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad) by comparing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and land surface temperature (LST) measurements in the lockdown year 2020 and pre-lockdown (2015-2019). Satellite-based data showed that NO2 concentration reduced by 18% (Kolkata), 29% (Hyderabad), 32-34% (Chennai, Mumbai, and Bangalore), and 43% (Delhi). Surface-based concentrations of NO2, PM2.5, and AOD also substantially dropped by 32-74%, 10-42%, and 8-34%, respectively over these major cities during the lockdown period and co-located with the intensity of anthropogenic activity. Only a smaller fraction of the reduction of pollutants was associated with meteorological variability. A substantial negative anomaly was found for LST both in the day (-0.16 degrees C to -1 degrees C) and night (-0.63 degrees C to -2.1 degrees C) across select all cities, which was also consistent with air temperature measurements. The decreases in LST could be associated with a reduction in pollutants, greenhouse gases and water vapor content. Improvement in air quality with lower urban temperatures due to lockdown may be a temporary effect, but it provides a crucial connection among human activities, air pollution, aerosols, radiative flux, and temperature. The lockdown for a shorter-period showed a significant improvement in environmental quality and provides a strong evidence base for larger scale policy implementation to improve air quality.

TI  - A simplified modelling framework for real-time assessment of conservative pollutants in ungauged rivers during cloudy periods
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the optical remote sensing technique is effectively applied to monitor real-time water quality parameters at finer spatiotemporal scales that are mostly based on the surface reflectance of satellite images. However, during the rainy season due to cloudy or hazy satellite images, it is a great challenge to obtain the surface reflectances and to estimate the pollutant concentration. This study is specially focused on developing a novel approach to estimate the daily-scale pollutant concentrations in ungauged rivers during cloudy days. The developed approach integrates the simplified physically-based VPMM-AD(psi Dc) solute transport model with the remote sensing (RS)-based approach for assessing the non-reactive river pollutants in real-time. This integrated VPMM-AD(psi Dc)-RS approach is tested for simulating the in-situ heavy metal (Fe, Zn, Cu, Cr, Pb, and Cd) and total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations in the Brahmani River during the tropical monsoon (rainy) seasons of the typical years 2010-2013. The study results reveal that the proposed integrated approach performed reasonably well with acceptable accuracy for real-time estimation of pollutant concentrations in the considered ungauged river reach during the cloudy period.

TI  - Monitoring ecosystem restoration of multiple surface coal mine sites in China via LANDSAT images using the Google Earth Engine
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The restoration of surface mining (open-cast) sites is key to meeting global ecosystem restoration targets. With the improving of data availabilities and technologies, it has become possible to expand restoration monitoring from single to multiple mine sites on a large scale. Based on the MODIS global disturbance index (MGDI), this study proposes a mine landscape restoration index (MLRI), by coupling the LST and EVI to simultaneously monitor the restoration of multiple mine sites. Restoration areas were identified by MLRItime-series analysis and classified into significant consistent increase (SCI) andsignificant anti-consistent increase (SAI) areas. The restoration effects of 46 surface coal mine sites located in the ecologically fragile northwestern region of China from 2000 to 2019 were assessed based on 3,675 LANDSAT images from the Google Earth Engine. Results show that the MLRI was effective at identifying restoration areas and processes, and this effectiveness was validated by high-resolution images and field investigations of mine samples. The overall percentage of restored area for mines that started mining before 2000 was 55.01% ; for mines that starting mining after 2000, 33.68%. According to the differences of SCI and SAI area percentages, 46 mine sites were classified into three clusters, with 13, 11, and 22 mine sites, respectively. The mine sites with high restoration percentage are located mainly in Hailar and Shanbeimengnan regions. This study provides a new approach for monitoring the restoration effects of multiple mine sites and informs government managers about developing mine restoration programs and sustainable mining development plans.

T2  - Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - As the diagnosis rate of early gastric cancer is increasing annually, the current hot spot in the treatment of early gastric cancer is how to better preserve the anatomical structure and physiological function of the stomach and improve the quality of life of patients after surgery under the premise of tumor eradication. Therefore, function-preserving gastrectomy has been the trend of surgical treatment for early gastric cancer. It is not just a modified gastrectomy, but a better combination of improved surgical techniques and the concept of function-preserving treatment, rather than being limited to traditional surgical treatments. Currently, the routine function-preserving gastrectomy mainly includes pylorus-preserving gastrectomy, proximal gastrectomy and partial gastrectomy combined with endoscopy. In addition, with the deeper understanding of metastasis pattern of gastric cancer and the development and popularization of minimally invasive techniques, laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery is gradually gaining attention. The application of laparoscopic and endoscopic hybrid surgery combined with sentinel lymph node navigation is anticipated in the treatment of early gastric cancer.
AB  - 随着早期胃癌诊断率的逐年上升，如何在达到肿瘤根治前提下，更好地保留胃的解剖结构和生理功能，并改善患者术后生活质量，已成为目前早期胃癌治疗关注的热点。因此，胃保功能手术应是早期胃癌手术治疗的趋势。胃保功能手术并不是单纯胃的缩小手术，是将手术技术改良与保功能治疗理念更完美地结合，而不单纯局限于传统外科治疗手段。目前，常规开展的胃保功能手术主要包括保留幽门的胃节段切除、近端胃切除及与内镜联合的胃局部切除术。随着对胃癌转移规律的深入理解，以及微创治疗技术的发展普及，双镜下的前哨淋巴结导航及胃局部切除联合手术在早期胃癌治疗中的应用前景值得期待。.

TI  - On the Use of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar Data for Monitoring and Forecasting Natural Hazards
T2  - MATHEMATICAL GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in satellite technologies, statistical and mathematical models, and computational resources have paved the way for operational use of satellite data in monitoring and forecasting natural hazards. We present a review of the use of satellite data for Earth observation in the context of geohazards preventive monitoring and disaster evaluation and assessment. We describe the techniques exploited to extract ground displacement information from satellite radar sensor images and the applicability of such data to the study of natural hazards such as landslides, earthquakes, volcanic activity, and ground subsidence. In this context, statistical techniques, ranging from time series analysis to spatial statistics, as well as continuum or discrete physics-based models, adopting deterministic or stochastic approaches, are irreplaceable tools for modeling and simulating natural hazards scenarios from a mathematical perspective. In addition to this, the huge amount of data collected nowadays and the complexity of the models and methods needed for an effective analysis set new computational challenges. The synergy among statistical methods, mathematical models, and optimized software, enriched with the assimilation of satellite data, is essential for building predictive and timely monitoring models for risk analysis.

TI  - Spatial Distribution of Mast Cells Regulates Asymmetrical Angiogenesis at the Ocular Surface
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mast cells, historically known for their function as effector cells in the induction of allergic diseases, reside in all vascularized tissues of the body, particularly, in proximity to blood and lymphatic vessels. Despite being neighboring sentinel cells to blood vessels, whether the spatial distribution of mast cells regulates the degree of angiogenesis remains to be investigated. Herein, an asymmetrical distribution of mast cells was shown at the murine ocular surface, with the higher number of mast cells distributed along the nasal limbus of the cornea compared with the temporal side. Using a well-characterized murine model of suture-induced corneal neovascularization, insult to the nasal side was shown to result in more extensive angiogenesis compared with that to the temporal side. To directly assess the impact of the spatial distribution of mast cell on angiogenesis, neovascularization was induced in mast cell-deficient mice (cKit(w-sh)). Unlike the wild-type (C57BL/6) mice, cKit(w-sh) mice did not show disproportionate growth of corneal blood vessels following the temporal and nasal insult. Moreover, cromolyn-mediated pharmacologic blockade of mast cells at the ocular surface attenuated the asymmetrical nasal and temporal neovascularization, suggesting that spatial distribution of mast cells significantly contributes to angiogenic response at the ocular surface.

TI  - Towards a remote sensing data based evapotranspiration estimation in Northern Australia using a simple random forest approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work we have developed a random forest regressor to predict daily evapotranspiration in three eddycovariance sites in Northern Australia from in-situ meteorological data and fluxes, and satellite leaf area index and land surface temperature data. The variable analysis for the random forest regressor suggests that leaf area index is the most important one at this temporal scale. A development sample corresponding to the period 2010-2013 was used, while the year 2014 has been separated for testing. Using this approach, we have obtained satisfactory performances in the three sites, with RMSE errors around 1 mm/day (and relative RMSEs similar to 0.3) in comparison to the measured values. With the final aim of testing the predictive capability of a model that uses remote sensing data as input, regressors that predict evapotranspiration exclusively from leaf area index and land surface temperature, have been trained resulting in reasonable performances. The RMSEs over the test set are similar to 1.1 - 1.2 mm/day. In all cases, the errors are comparable to those obtained in previous works that use similar locations and different methods. When compared to the measured values, the random forest predictions of evapotranspiration are more accurate than the global MODIS ET 8-day 1 km product, which was used as benchmark for the performance evaluation of our models, in the three selected locations.

TI  - Successful Long-Distance Breeding Range Expansion of a Top Marine Predator
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Little is known about the effects of large-scale breeding range expansions on the ecology of top marine predators. We examined the effects of a recent range expansion on the breeding and foraging ecology of Laysan albatrosses (Phoebastria immutabilis). Laysan albatrosses expanded from historical breeding colonies in the Central Pacific Ocean to the Eastern Pacific Ocean around central Baja California, Mexico, leading to a 4,000-km shift from colonies located adjacent to the productive transition zone in the Central Pacific to colonies embedded within the eastern boundary current upwelling system of the Eastern Pacific California Current. We use electronic tagging and remote sensing data to examine the consequences of this range expansion on at-sea distribution, habitat use, foraging habitat characteristics, and foraging behavior at sea by comparing birds from historic and nascent colonies. We found the expansion resulted in distinct at-sea segregation and differential access to novel oceanographic habitats. Birds from the new Eastern Pacific colony on Guadalupe Island, Mexico have reduced ranges, foraging trip lengths and durations, and spend more time on the water compared to birds breeding in the Central Pacific on Tern Island, United States. Impacts of the range expansion to the post-breeding season were less pronounced where birds maintained some at-sea segregation but utilized similar habitat and environmental variables. These differences have likely benefited the Eastern Pacific colony which has significantly greater reproductive output and population growth rates. Laysan albatrosses have the plasticity to adapt to distinctly different oceanographic habitats and also provide insight on the potential consequences of range shifts to marine organisms.

TI  - GIMMS NDVI3g+(1982-2015) response to climate change and engineering activities along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Restricted by cold, drought and high altitude natural environments, vegetation ecological environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is fragile and difficult to repair when damaged. The purpose of this research is to reveal the characteristic of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in direct impact area and ecological background area response to the engineering activities and global climate changes along Qinghai-Tibet railway. A framework was constructed by integrating a Gaussian fitting model, a buffer analysis, a trend analysis, a correlation analysis and a regression analysis method. The advantages of this framework are (1) Exploration of the impact of human and natural factors on the local vegetation ecological environment in pre-, co-, and postconstruction of the railway; (2) Investigation of the time and extent of the impact of engineering activities on the plateau ecological environment; (3) Identify the contribution of climate change and engineering activities to changes of vegetation index. The framework was evaluated with GIMMS (Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) NDVI from 1982 to 2001-2018. Results demonstrated that (1) Annual NDVI of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway was highly responsive to climate change and engineering activities, and shown a downward trend, upward trend for under construction and in operation period respectively. (2) Engineering activities of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway had a significant impact on vegetation along the route. Annual NDVI growth rate of 'core area' and 'background buffer' are quite different in pre-construction, under construction and in operation time. (3) Climate change along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway was significantly be responded to global changes during the 34 years. The air temperature and precipitation growth rate of the Golmud South-mountain Pass to Lhasa (GSPL) route is substantial lower than that of the Xining to Golmud South-mountain Pass (XGSP) route. Research results recommend that information on vegetation ecological environment is exploited by government agencies to ensure responsible ecological safety, traffic safety and sustainable development along the Qinghai-Tibet railway.

TI  - Assessment of axillary node status by ultrasound after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer according to breast cancer subtype
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for patients with cN1 breast cancer is controversial. Improvements of negative predictive value (NPV) by axillary ultrasound (AUS), which corresponds to the accurate prediction rate of node-negative status after NAC, would lead to decreased FNR of SNB following NAC. In this study, we retrospectively investigated the accurate prediction rate of NPV by AUS after NAC in patients with cytologically node-positive breast cancer treated between January 2012 and December 2016. Of 279 eligible patients, the NPV was 49.2% in all patients, but varied significantly by tumor subtype (p<0.001) and tumor response determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (p=0.0003). Of the 23 patients with clinically node negative (ycN0) by AUS and clinical complete response in primary lesion by MRI, the NPV was 100% in patients with HR<plus/minus>/HER2+or HR-/HER2-breast cancer. In conclusion, regarding FNR reduction post-NAC, it will be of clinical value to take tumor subtype and primary tumor response using MRI into account to identify patients for SNB after NAC.

TI  - Improving population estimates of difficult-to-observe species: A dung decay model for forest elephants with remotely sensed imagery
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and ecologically relevant wildlife population estimates are critical for species management. One of the most common survey methods for forest mammals - line transects for animal sign with distance sampling - has assumptions regarding conversion factors that, if violated, can induce substantial bias in abundance estimates. Specifically, for sign (e.g. nests, dung) surveys, a single number representing total time for decay is used as a multiplier to convert estimated sign density into animal density. This multiplier is likely inaccurate if not derived from a study reflecting the spatiotemporal variation in decay times. Using dung decay observations from three protected areas in Gabon, and a previous study in Nouabale-Ndoki National Park (Congo), we developed Weibull survival models to adaptively predict forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) dung decay based on environmental variables from field collected and remotely sensed data. Seasonal decay models based on remotely sensed covariates explained 86% of the variation for the wet season and 79% for the dry season. These models included canopy cover, cloud cover, humidity, vegetation complexity and slope as factors influencing dung decay. With these models, we assessed sensitivity of elephant density estimates to spatiotemporal environmental heterogeneity, showing that our methods work best for large-scale studies >50 km(2). We simulated decay studies with and without these variables in four Gabonese national parks and reanalyzed two previous surveys of elephants in Minkebe National Park, Gabon. Disregarding spatial and temporal variation in decay rate biased population estimates up to 1.6 and 6.9 times. Our reassessment of surveys in Minkebe National Park showed an expected loss of 78% of forest elephants over ten years, but the elephant abundance was 222% higher than previously estimated. Our models incorporate field or remotely sensed variables to provide an ecological context essential for accurate population estimates while reducing need for expensive decay field studies.

TI  - Virtual cultural landscapes: Geospatial visualizations of past environments
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in spatial and remote sensing technology have led to new methods in archaeological site identification and reconstruction, allowing archaeologists to investigate landscapes and sites on multiple scales. These remotely conducted surveys create virtual cultural landscapes and seascapes that archaeologists and the public interact with and experience, often better than traditional maps. Our study examines landscape reconstruction and archaeological site classifications from a phenomenological and human behavioural ecology (HBE) perspective. HBE aims to reconstruct how humans interacted with these places as part of their active and passive decision making. Through temporal reconstructions, archaeologists and others can experience and interpret past landscapes and subtle changes in cultural land- and seascapes. Here, we evaluate the use of remotely sensed data (lidar, satellite imagery, sonar, radar, etc.) for developing virtual cultural landscapes while also incorporating Indigenous perspectives. Our study compares two vastly different landscapes and perspectives: a seascape in coastal Alaska, USA, and a neotropical jungle in Belize, Central America. By incorporating ethnographic accounts, oral histories, Indigenous traditional knowledge and community engagement, archaeologists can develop new tools to understand decisions made in the past, especially pertaining to settlement selection and resource procurement. These virtual reconstructions become cognitive images of a possible place that the observer experiences. Virtual cultural landscapes allow archaeologists to reproduce landscapes that may otherwise be invisible and present them to different publics. These processes elucidate how landscapes changed over time based on human behaviours while simultaneously allowing archaeologists to engage with Indigenous communities and the public in the protection of prehistoric and historic sites and sacred spaces through cultural heritage management.

TI  - Inferring management and predicting sub-field scale C dynamics in UK grasslands using biogeochemical modelling and satellite-derived leaf area data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands, natural and managed, cover a large part of the Earth's surface and play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle. Human management strongly affects grassland C budgets through grass cutting and removal, varied grazing intensities, and organic matter additions. Thus managed grassland C cycles are highly heterogeneous and challenging to quantify. In this study, we combine a process-based model of the grassland C cycle, validated against field data on C fluxes and pools, with satellite-derived data (Proba-V and Sentinel-2) on leaf area index (LAI) in order to quantify field-scale grassland productivity and C dynamics under climatic and management conditions typical of northwest Europe. Input data on the weekly vegetation canopy anomaly (estimated from Proba-V LAI) and meteorology are used to drive the grassland C model (DALEC-Grass) that is integrated into a Bayesian model-data fusion (MDF) framework. The novelty of the MDF algorithm is that it infers weekly livestock grazing and grass cutting events based on expected canopy growth estimated by the model, and constrained by LAI observations (estimated from Sentinel-2). The MDF approach also resolves observational, parametric, and input uncertainties on C cycling estimates. We analysed four years (2015-2018) of C dynamics at three variably-managed fields of the Rothamsted Research North Wyke Farm Platform (UK). Compared against independent field data, the MDF was able to (i) identify 87.5% of the harvest events that occurred, (ii) accurately predict the annual yields in 83% of the identified harvest years and (iii) reproduce the observed grazing intensity in each field (r = 0.8, overlap = 90%). We demonstrate that the fusion of process modelling with earth observations is an effective method for monitoring biomass removals and quantifying management impacts on field-scale C balance, without the need for frequent and laborious ground measurements. This approach can support the delivery of more robust national greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting that takes account of grassland vegetation management.

AB  - Objective. Investigate the overall survival of patients with FIGO stage I endometrioid endometrial carcinoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNBx).& nbsp; Methods. Patients diagnosed between 2012 and 2015 with pathological stage I endometrioid endometrial carcinoma who underwent minimally invasive hysterectomy and had at least one month of follow-up were identified in the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Patients who underwent SLNBx or systematic lymphadenectomy (LND) (defined as at least 20 lymph nodes removed) were selected. Overall survival (OS) was evaluated following generation of Kaplan-Meier curves and compared with the log-rank test. A Cox model was constructed to evaluate survival after controlling for confounders.& nbsp; Results. A total of 13,010 patients with endometrioid endometrial carcinoma who met the inclusion criteria were identified; 9861 (75.8%) and 3149 (24.2%) patients had systematic LND and SLNBx, respectively. Patients who had LND were more likely to receive radiation therapy (27.4% vs 19.3%, p < 0.001) and chemotherapy (13% vs 8.7%, p < 0.001) compared to those who had SLNBx. After controlling for patient age, race, insurance status, depth of myometrial invasion, tumor grade, tumor size, presence of lymph-vascular invasion and receipt of radiation therapy, the performance of SLNBx was not associated with worse survival (HR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.80, 1.21). For high-intermediate risk patients (based on GOG-99 criteria) after controlling for confounders, performance of SLNBx was not associated with worse survival (HR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.80, 1.44). For intermediate risk patients who did not receive external beam radiation therapy or chemotherapy after controlling for confounders, performance of SLNBx was not associated with worse survival (HR: 1.58, 95% CI: 0.94, 2.65).& nbsp; Conclusions. SLNBx had no negative impact on the survival of patients with FIGO stage I endometrioid endometrial carcinoma who undergo hysterectomy.& nbsp; (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Predicting defoliator abundance and defoliation measurements using Landsat-based condition scores
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing imagery can provide critical information on the magnitude and extent of damage caused by forest pests and pathogens. However, monitoring short-term changes in deciduous forest condition caused by defoliating insects is challenging and requires approaches that directly account for seasonal vegetation dynamics. We implemented a previously published harmonic modeling approach for forest condition monitoring in Google Earth Engine and systematically assessed the relative ability of condition change products generated using various model parameterizations for predicting pest abundances and defoliation during the 2016-2018 gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) outbreak in southern New England. Our comparisons revealed that most models made reasonable predictions of changes in canopy condition and egg and larval abundances of L. dispar, indicating a strong correlation between our harmonic-based estimates of condition change and defoliator activity. The greatest differences in predictive ability were in the spectral domain, with assessments based on Tasseled Cap Greenness, Simple Ratio, and the Enhanced Vegetation Index ranking among the top models, and the commonly used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index consistently exhibiting poorer performance. We also observed notable differences in the magnitude of scores for different baseline periods. Additionally, we found that Landsat-based condition scores better explained larval abundance than egg mass counts, which have historically been used as a proxy for later-season larval abundance, indicating that our remote sensing approach may be more accurate and cost-effective for generating consistent retrospective assessments of L. dispar population abundance in addition to estimates of canopy damage. These findings provide important linkages between spectral changes detected using a harmonic modeling approach and biophysical aspects of defoliator activity, with potential to extend monitoring and prediction to regional or even continental scales.

However, in subgroup analyses melanoma-specific survival among patients with nodal metastases seemed better.Aim To evaluate the association of performing a SLNB with overall survival in intermediate thickness melanoma patients in a Dutch population-based daily clinical setting.Methods Survival, excess mortality adjusted for age, gender, Breslow-thickness, ulceration, histological subtype, location, co-morbidity and socioeconomic status were calculated in a population of 1,989 patients diagnosed with malignant cutaneous melanoma (1.2-3.5 mm) on the trunk or limb between 2000-2016 in ten hospitals in the South East area, The Netherlands.Results A SLNB was performed in 51% of the patients (n = 1008). Ten-year overall survival after SLNB was 75% (95%CI, 71%-78%) compared to 61% (95%CI 57%-64%) following observation. After adjustment for risk factors, a lower risk on death (HR = 0.80, 95%CI 0.66-0.96) was found after SLNB compared to observation only.Conclusions SLNB in patients with intermediate-thickness melanoma on trunk or limb resulted in a 14% absolute and significant 10-year survival difference compared to those without SLNB.

TI  - Mercury concentration in the sentinel fish species Orthopristis ruber: Effects of environmental and biological factors and human risk assessment
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to assess corocoro grunt use as bioindicator of Hg contamination in coastal marine systems by testing environmental (seasons) and biological effects (sexual maturity, size and weight) on THg accumulation and assessing human health risk. Fish was captured in winter and summer seasons at Vermelha Beach, Rio de Janeiro, Southeast Brazil. Adult O. ruber showed significantly higher THg than juveniles, and THg concentrations were positively correlated to fish length and weight. Fish THg concentrations did not differ between seasons and were below the accepted limit for human consumption. Human exposure risk by fish consumption was 0.31 mu g MeHg kg-1 week-1 and the hazard quotient was 0.44 (0.11-1.84). Our results confirm the applied use of O. ruber as sentinel species for Hg contamination monitoring and highlight concern for its consumption, especially for local fishermen populations that highly consume this fish and may be more susceptible to Hg adverse effects.

TI  - Utilizing the electronic health records to create a syndromic staff surveillance system during the COVID-19 outbreak
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Since December 2019, COVID-19 has caused a worldwide pandemic and Singapore has seen esca-lating cases with community spread. Aggressive contact tracing and identification of suspects has helped to identify local community clusters, surveillance being the key to early intervention. Healthcare workers (HCWs) have contracted COVID-19 infection both at the workplace and community. We aimed to create a prototype staff surveillance system for the detection of acute respiratory infection (ARI) clusters amongst our HCWs and describe its effectiveness.Methods: A prototypical surveillance system was built on existing electronic health record infrastructure.Results: Over a 10-week period, we investigated 10 ARI clusters amongst 7 departments. One of the ARI clus-ters was later determined to be related to COVID-19 infection. We demonstrate the feasibility of syndromic surveillance to detect ARI clusters during the COVID-19 outbreak.Conclusion: The use of syndromic surveillance to detect ARI clusters amongst HCWs in the COVID-19 pan-demic may enable early case detection and prevent onward transmission. It could be an important tool in infection prevention within healthcare institutions.(c) 2020 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Himawari-8-derived diurnal variations in ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution across China using the fast space-time Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) has been used as an important atmospheric environmental parameter mainly because of its impact on human health. PM2.5 is affected by both natural and anthropogenic factors that usually have strong diurnal variations. Such information helps toward understanding the causes of air pollution, as well as our adaptation to it. Most existing PM2.5 products have been derived from polarorbiting satellites. This study exploits the use of the nextgeneration geostationary meteorological satellite Himawari-8/AHI (Advanced Himawari Imager) to document the diurnal variation in PM2.5. Given the huge volume of satellite data, based on the idea of gradient boosting, a highly efficient tree-based Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) method by involving the spatiotemporal characteristics of air pollution, namely the space-time LightGBM (STLG) model, is developed. An hourly PM2.5 dataset for China (i.e., ChinaHighPM(2.5)) at a 5 km spatial resolution is derived based on Himawari-8/AHI aerosol products with additional environmental variables. Hourly PM2.5 estimates (number of data samples = 1 415 188) are well correlated with ground measurements in China (cross-validation coefficient of determination, CV-R-2 = 0.85), with a root-meansquare error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of 13.62 and 8.49 mu g m(-3), respectively. Our model captures well the PM2.5 diurnal variations showing that pollution increases gradually in the morning, reaching a peak at about 10:00 LT (GMT+8), then decreases steadily until sunset. The proposed approach outperforms most traditional statistical regression and tree-based machine-learning models with a much lower computational burden in terms of speed and memory, making it most suitable for routine pollution monitoring.

TI  - Fallen dogmas: recent advances in locoregionally advanced melanoma
T2  - POLISH ARCHIVES OF INTERNAL MEDICINE-POLSKIE ARCHIWUM MEDYCYNY WEWNETRZNEJ
M3  - Review
AB  - The last decade has brought new achievements in the research on melanoma, which resulted in important changes in the clinical management of patients with stage III disease. Our review summarizes recent updates with particular focus on practical aspects. Results from surgical studies, the MSLT-II (Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial II) and the DeCOG-SLT (German Dermatologic Cooperative Oncology Group), showed that the dogmatic surgical approach that all sentinel lymph node melanoma metastases warrant completion lymph node dissection is no longer valid; omission of completion lymph node dissection in a large proportion of patients with sentinel lymph node-positive melanoma has no negative impact on survival rates. Moreover, oncological trials (COMBI-AD, EORTC 1325-MG / KEYNOTE-054, and CheckMate 238) showed that in patients with stage III melanoma, chances of recurrence-free survival can be improved by 10% to 20% by modern immunotherapy and / or molecular targeted therapy. These findings led to the fall of another dogma in oncology: there is no effective adjuvant therapy for stage III melanoma at acceptable toxicity. At the end of the day, in 2021, a modern multidisciplinary approach incorporating newest findings offers patients with stage III melanoma less surgical complications of better tailored surgery and longer survival as a result of efficient adjuvant therapy.

AB  - The dual polarimetric study including degree of polarization (m(L)) and energy span (lambda(1)+lambda(2)) for vegetation targets infer the accuracy of vegetation algorithms. The Sentinel - 1 A and ALOS - 2 satellite data were utilized for dual polarimetric radar vegetation index (DPRVI), polarimetric radar vegetation index (PRVI) and radar vegetation index (RVI) computation and simulation of backscattering coefficient (sigma(0) (dB)) at VV polarization. The DPRVI, PRVI and RVI were computed at VV + VH and HH + HV polarizations, respectively. The simulation of sigma(0) (dB) at HH + HV can be show better results than VV + VH polarization using derived radar vegetation descriptors (V). The DPRVI, PRVI and RVI showed higher R-2 and lower RMSE values at L - band than C - band. The DPRVI at L - band (HH + HV polarization) was indicated highest R-2 = 0.91 and lower RMSE = 0.31 (dB) among all proposed V in the algorithm.

TI  - Improving modeling of ecosystem gross primary productivity through re-optimizing temperature restrictions on photosynthesis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The terrestrial ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP) plays an important role in the global carbon cycle and ecosystem functions. However, the estimates of GPP still have large uncertainties due to insufficient understanding of the photosynthesis-temperature relationship and maximum light use efficiency (LUEmax). We used satellite-derived proxies of GPP to derive optimum, minimum, and maximum temperature for photosynthesis at the ecosystem scale, which was then used to construct a new temperature stress expression. This study improves the MODIS-based light use efficiency model through coupling the optimized LUEmax with the new proposed temperature stress expression. The new model (R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 17.8 gC m(-2) (16 d)(-1)) performed better than the MODIS GPP products (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 30.4 gCm(-2) (16 d)(-1)), especially for evergreen broad-leaf forests and croplands. Themean annual GPP over China is 5.7 +/- 0.27 PgC, and the GPP significantly increased by 0.046 +/- 0.006 PgC year(-1) during 2001-2018. This study provides a potential method for future projections of terrestrial ecosystem functioning. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) on the islands of Puerto Rico and Vieques, USA
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - We conducted an island-wide survey of the Caribbean islands Puerto Rico and Vieques, U.S.A. during late 2018 and early 2019 to document the current richness of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae). We used a combination of larval surveys and adult trapping using baited CDC light traps and BG-Sentinel traps across 41 of the 78 municipalities. We collected 9 genera, 12 subgenera, and 31 species, which when combined with past studies yields 44 species on the islands. We also note species occurrences across habitat types and elevations from around the islands. One new record, Aedes (Ochlerotatus) obturbator Dyar and Knab, is noted. However we found no evidence of the presence of Aedes albopictus (Skuse), an invasive found throughout the Caribbean, or Aedes (Fredwardsius) vittatus (Bigot), an exotic species recently reported in the Dominican Republic and Cuba. Habitat associations and information regarding the medical importance of species are also included. Given that the islands often experience outbreaks of several arboviruses, obtaining a complete picture of the species present is of high importance.

TI  - Improved semantic segmentation method using edge features for winter wheat spatial distribution extraction from Gaofen-2 images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the final feature map obtained using a convolutional neural network for remote sensing image segmentation, there are great differences between the feature values of the pixels near the edge of the block and those inside the block; ensuring consistency between these feature values is the key to improving the accuracy of segmentation results. The proposed model uses an edge feature branch and a semantic feature branch called the edge assistant feature network (EFNet). The EFNET model consists of one semantic branch, one edge branch, one shared decoder, and one classifier. The semantic branch extracts semantic features from remote sensing images, whereas the edge branch extracts edge features from remote sensing images and edge images. In addition, the two branches extract five-level features through five sets of feature extraction units. The shared decoder sets up five levels of shared decoding units, which are used to further integrate edge features and deep semantic features. This strategy can reduce the feature differences between the edge pixels and the inner pixels of the object, obtaining a per-pixel feature vector with high inter-class differentiation and intra-class consistency. Softmax is used as the classifier to generate the final segmentation result. We selected a representative winter wheat region in China (Feicheng City) as the study area and established a dataset for experiments. The comparison experiment included three original models and two models modified by adding edge features: SegNet, UNet, and ERFNet, and edge-UNet and edge-ERFNet, respectively. EFNet's recall (91.01%), intersection over union (81.39%), and F1-Score (91.68%) were superior to those of the other methods. The results clearly show that EFNET improves the accuracy of winter wheat extraction from remote sensing images. This is an important basis not only for crop monitoring, yield estimation, and disaster assessment but also for calculating land carrying capacity and analyzing the comprehensive production capacity of agricultural resources.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Dams must provide human development with economic viability, social equitability, and be environmentally sustainable However, environmental and social impacts are often negative and seldom considered in the design of these projects. We made a multitemporal analysis classifying 26 satellite images of several Mexican hydroelectric power stations between 1972 and 2016 to evaluate the effect of dams on the change in land use. Eleven socio-economic indicators were also compared before and after the construction of the dam to document effects on local communities. We use the Land Change Modeler to quantify the net changes in land use and land cover. We found a mean decrease in tropical forest (1,404.19 km(2)) and temperate forest (1,191.26 km(2)) and an increase in agriculture (2,241.26 km(2)) and urban use (92.9 km(2)). The results also show that although some indicators improved, the environmental deterioration around these projects shows that they are not sustainable.

TI  - Article Title Variations in Growing Season NDVI and Its Sensitivity to Climate Change Responses to Green Development in Mountainous Areas
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is sensitive to changes in surface vegetation cover. Research into how climate change impacts surface vegetation cover is essential to manage ecological systems and promote green development. The Western Henan Mountains, located in the transitional zone between the northern subtropical and warm temperate zones of China, is an ideal location to study the impacts of climate change on surface vegetation cover. Combining a digital elevation model (DEM) with temperature and precipitation data; and MODIS-NDVI imagery (2000 similar to 2017) for the Western Henan Mountains, this study explores variations in the growing season NDVI and its response to climate change. Results show that there are significant changes with fluctuations in NDVI values from 2000 to 2017. NDVI increased at a growth rate of 0.027 per decade (p < 0.05) overall, indicating vegetation conditions have gradually improved. Although the NDVI value showed an overall increasing trend, 19.12% of the areas showed a decreasing trend, interspersing and intersecting spatially, showing significant spatial differences. NDVI increased initially, but then decreased as a function of elevation, which was shown to be proportional to slope and independent of aspect. Variables including elevation and slope gradient are shown to provide high explanation of NDVI variability, whilst temperature is shown to have a more significant impact on NDVI than precipitation. However, vegetation responses to temperature and precipitation covaried with both slope and aspect. Positive NDVI trends were strongest at low elevations (i.e., <1,100 masl), which we attribute to vegetation restoration activities. Lower NDVI values characterized gentle slopes (<5 degrees), whilst higher values were, in contrast, associated with steeper slopes (5 similar to 10 degrees). This study highlights the complex mechanisms and their relations governing vegetation response to climate change and should form an instructive basis for both future modeling studies investigating the response of vegetation to future global warming.

T2  - JOINT COMMISSION JOURNAL ON QUALITY AND PATIENT SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Editor's Note: For over two decades, The Joint Commission has developed and disseminated Sentinel Event Alerts (SEAs). SEAs identify specific types of adverse events and high-risk conditions, describe their underlying causes, and recommend steps to reduce risk and prevent future occurrences. Health care organizations should consider the information in SEAs when designing or redesigning processes, including specific suggestions contained in the alerts to mitigate risks. Recently, The Joint Commission decided that co-publishing SEAs in the Journal would help expand dissemination efforts by reaching beyond health care organizations to the broader quality and safety community, including researchers and policymakers. In this issue, we are proud to publish Sentinel Event Alert 63: Optimizing Smart Infusion Pump Safety with DERS (dose error reduction software). The SEA describes actions health care organizations can take to reduce the risk of errors caused by the misuse of smart infusion pumps, especially errors that can be avoided by the optimal use of DERS. We will co-publish future SEAs that we think would be of interest to the Journal's audience. We hope you enjoy this new addition to the Journal.

TI  - A Multi-Feature Fusion Using Deep Transfer Learning for Earthquake Building Damage Detection
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the recent tremendous improvements in the spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions of remote sensing imaging systems, there has been a dramatic increase in their applications. Amongst different applications of very high-resolution remote sensing images, damage detection for rapid emergency response is one of the most challenging ones. Recently, deep learning frameworks have enhanced the performance of earthquake damage detection by automatic extraction of strong deep features. However, most of the existing studies in this area focus on using nadir satellite images or orthophotos which limits the available data sources. The objective of this study is to present a multi-modal integrated structure to combine orthophoto and off-nadir images for earthquake building damage detection. In this context, a multi-feature fusion method based on deep transfer learning is presented, which contains four different steps, namely pre-processing, deep feature extraction, deep feature fusion, and transfer learning. To validate the presented framework, two comparative experiments are conducted on the 2010 Haiti earthquake, using pre- and post-event off-nadir satellite images, which were collected by WorldView-2 (WV-2) satellite platform as well as a post-event airborne orthophoto. The results demonstrate considerable advantages in identifying damaged and non-damaged buildings with over 83% for the overall accuracy.

TI  - Making Landsat 5, 7 and 8 reflectance consistent using MODIS nadir-BRDF adjusted reflectance as reference
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat satellite data applications have been broadened by the improvement in data consistency, e.g., advances in calibration and atmospheric correction algorithms. However, there are still inter-sensor inconsistencies of surface reflectance caused by differences in sensor spectral response and residuals in calibration and atmospheric correction. Such inconsistencies tend to entangle with the land surface change, especially for the subtle changes such as vegetation responses to climate change. We propose a Bayesian approach to reduce inter-sensor inconsistencies by making Landsat 5, 7 and 8 reflectance consistent with MODIS nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR). The Bayesian MODIS-consistent Landsat reflectance should be similar to the MODIS NBAR when it is degraded to the MODIS resolution considering the point spread function (PSF). The MODIS NBAR PSF is modelled as a Gaussian function with empirically derived and band specific parameters. The relationships between the MODIS-consistent Landsat reflectance and the two available reflectance (i.e., the MODIS NBAR and observed Landsat reflectance) are built in the Bayesian framework. The Bayesian MODIS-consistent Landsat reflectance is then derived using the computationally efficient conjugate gradient descent method. The algorithm was applied to Landsat 5, 7 and 8 surface reflectance over five study areas in Brazil, China, France, Russia and USA, and compared with a linear regression-based reflectance adjustment method. Visual difference was evident in the MODIS NBAR and the observed Landsat reflectance and the relative root-mean-squared differences (rRMSD) ranged from 3.16% to 67.72% and R2 from 0.037 to 0.934. Both the Bayesian and linearly MODISconsistent Landsat reflectance are visually more consistent with the MODIS NBAR. The average rRMSD and R2 improvements of the Bayesian MODIS-consistent Landsat reflectance over the observed Landsat reflectance were 21.36% and 0.19, 3.38% and 0.11, 5.25% and 0.07, 3.14% and 0.11, 3.49% and 0.08, and 5.72% and 0.09 for the blue, green, red, near infrared, and two shortwave infrared bands, respectively. The linearly MODISconsistent Landsat reflectance had less rRMSD improvements: 18.26%, 1.46%, 3.02%, 1.86%, 1.97% and 3.36% for the six bands respectively, and had no R2 improvements. The linear regression derived using the whole image pixels has low performance in adjusting some extreme reflectance values that are not well represented in the image. In contrast, the Bayesian method derives the reflectance image that is consistent to MODIS at pixel level.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change has intensified extreme climate events such as torrential rain/snow, heat waves, and droughts. Among climate disaster events, extreme heat can bring long and intensified heat waves and seriously impact the human living environment and ecological habitat. However, extreme heat may have inconsistent impacts on various geographical environments, and such extreme heat might impact human health differently among various locations and climate zones. Therefore, this study applies Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to produce 2014-2018 land surface temperatures and further applies spatial analysis to categorize areas into absolute and relative heat areas in the Taipei metropolitan area in Taiwan. A comparative analysis is then conducted based on ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) to explore the spatial heterogeneity of changing heat environments in the study area. Although the OLS results show that mixed use has the greatest influence on heat, whereas green space and barren land have the highest negative effect on heat, the GWR analysis shows that the coefficients of every land use type demonstrate different spatial patterns. These spatial patterns can be applied as a reference for the mitigation plans to reduce the effects of heat.

TI  - Placental gene networks at the interface between maternal PM2.5 exposure early in gestation and reduced infant birthweight
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A growing body of evidence links maternal exposure to particulate matter <2.5 mu M in diameter (PM2.5) and deviations in fetal growth. Several studies suggest that the placenta plays a critical role in conveying the effects of maternal PM2.5 exposure to the developing fetus. These include observed associations between air pollutants and candidate placental features, such as mitochondrial DNA content, DNA methylation and telomere length. However, gaps remain in delineating the pathways linking the placenta to air pollution-related health effects, including a comprehensive profiling of placental processes impacted by maternal PM2.5 exposure. In this study, we examined alterations in a placental transcriptome-wide network in relation to maternal PM2.5 exposure prior to and during pregnancy and infant birthweight.Methods: We evaluated PM2.5 exposure and placental RNA-sequencing data among study participants enrolled in the Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS). Daily residential PM2.5 levels were estimated using a hybrid model incorporating land-use regression and satellite remote sensing data. Distributed lag models were implemented to assess the impact on infant birthweight due to PM2.5 weekly averages ranging from 12 weeks prior to gestation until birth. Correlations were assessed between PM2.5 levels averaged across the identified window of susceptibility and a placental transcriptome-wide gene coexpression network previously generated using the WGCNA R package.Results: We identified a sensitive window spanning 12 weeks prior to and 13 weeks into gestation during which maternal PM2.5 exposure is significantly associated with reduced infant birthweight. Two placental coexpression modules enriched for genes involved in amino acid transport and cellular respiration were correlated with infant birthweight as well as maternal PM2.5 exposure levels averaged across the identified growth restriction window. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that maternal PM2.5 exposure may alter placental programming of fetal growth, with potential implications for downstream health effects, including susceptibility to cardiometabolic health outcomes and viral infections.

TI  - Geographically and temporally weighted neural network for winter wheat yield prediction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate prediction of crop yield is essential for agricultural trading, market risk management and food security. Although various statistical models and machine learning models have been developed to enhance prediction accuracy, spatial and temporal non-stationarity, an intrinsic attribute of many geographical processes, is still rarely considered in crop yield modeling. From a statistical point of view, this study respectively provided evidence for the existence of spatial non-stationarity and temporal non-stationarity in winter wheat yield prediction based on geographically weighted regression (GWR) and temporally weighted regression (TWR). Then, a geographically and temporally weighted neural network (GTWNN) model was proposed by integrating artificial neural network (ANN) into geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) using publicly available data sources, including satellite imagery and climate data. For a more credible evaluation, the leave-one-year-out strategy was adopted to make out-of-sample prediction resulting in a total of 12 test years from 2008 to 2019. The experiment results showed that the proposed GTWNN outperformed ANN, GTWR and support vector regression (SVR) achieving the average coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.766, 0.759 and 0.720 at the three prediction times of end of July, end of June and end of May. Moreover, an extended Moran's I was adopted to assess the degree of spatiotemporal autocorrelation of the prediction errors. The error aggregation of GTWNN was lower than other models, indicating that GTWNN is applicable to addressing spatial non-stationarity in modeling the relationship between predictors and yield response. The methodology proposed in this paper can be extended to handle spatiotemporal non-stationarity in other crop yield predictions and even other environmental phenomena.

TI  - cuFSDAF: An Enhanced Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion Algorithm Parallelized Using Graphics Processing Units
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal data fusion is a cost-effective way to produce remote sensing images with high spatial and temporal resolutions using multisource images. Using spectral unmixing analysis and spatial interpolation, the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF) algorithm is suitable for heterogeneous landscapes and capable of capturing abrupt land-cover changes. However, the extensive computational complexity of FSDAF prevents its use in large-scale applications and mass production. Besides, the domain decomposition strategy of FSDAF causes accuracy loss at the edges of subdomains due to the insufficient consideration of edge effects. In this study, an enhanced FSDAF (cuFSDAF) is proposed to address these problems, and includes three main improvements. First, the TPS interpolator is replaced by an accelerated inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolator to reduce computational complexity. Second, the algorithm is parallelized based on the compute unified device architecture (CUDA), a widely used parallel computing framework for graphics processing units (GPUs). Third, an adaptive domain decomposition (ADD) method is proposed to improve the fusion accuracy at the edges of subdomains and to enable GPUs with varying computing capacities to deal with datasets of any size. Experiments showed while obtaining similar accuracies to FSDAF and an up-to-date deep-learning-based method, cuFSDAF reduced the computing time significantly and achieved speed-ups of 140.3-182.2 over the original FSDAF program. cuFSDAF is capable of efficiently producing fused images with both high spatial and temporal resolutions to support applications for large-scale and long-term land surface dynamics.

TI  - Application of IUCN Red List of Ecosystems to assess the ecological status of marine bar ecosystems of Burullus wetland: A Ramsar site
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems has been employed to assess the status of ecosystems and evaluate the risk of their collapse. The RLE assessment was conducted on the main ecosystems of the marine bar of Burullus wetland; sand plain and salt marshes ecosystems of the marine bar which separates the lake from the Mediterranean Sea. Four criteria were used for conducting the assessment; (A) reduction in distribution, (B) constricted distribution, (C) abiotic components degradation, and (D) disruption of biotic processes and interactions. The integration of remotely-sensed data allowed the application of RLE to study the changes in ecosystems distribution for Criteria A and B. Criterion A showed the same result for sand plain and salt marshes as Critically Endangered (CR). This indicates the distribution of the marine bar is extremely affected by the urban and human activities in the region. It is also expected to be affected by any slight changes in the sea-level and costal erosions in the future in terms of disruption in biotic processes and interactions. Criteria D was applied using floristic quality assessment for current floristic composition and the available historic data. The results show that sand plain and salt marshes are Near Threatened (NT). However, the application of Criteria C was Data Deficient DD due to lack of long term data about the abiotic variables responsible for environmental degradation. The identical results of RLE assessment of sand plain and salt marshes reflect that both ecosystems are equally affected by the ongoing activities in the region, particularly over the last few years. The results indicate that the marine bar ecosystems were disturbed by anthropogenic events such as urban development, grazing and farming. Also natural events such as climate change and its consequences are expected to have severe impacts on the marine bar in the future. Therefore, further studies should focus on the study of the main interactions and processes in the marine bar ecosystems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Multicenter Soft Supervised Classification Method for Modeling Spectral Diversity in Multispectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the spectral diversity of objects within the same classes and the spectral similarity between different classes, classical fuzzy classification methods perform poorly in multispectral remote sensing image classification. The basic reason is that they often use a single spectral curve to represent a land cover type while ignoring spectral diversity characteristics. To solve this issue, this article proposes a novel multicenter supervised fuzzy classification (MCSFC) method for modeling spectral diversity in multispectral remote sensing data. Images are first split into clusters with similar sizes or volumes, namely, granularities, by a hierarchical clustering process. Second, the granularities are labeled by training samples. As a result, the centers of the granularities corresponding to one type of sample can represent the spectral diversity within one class and, thus, are treated as the multiple centers of a land cover type. The membership degree of each unlabeled sample belonging to any land cover type is determined by the shortest distance to the centers of each type, and the spectral diversity is considered in this stage. A comparison reveals that the proposed method clearly improves the classification performance of various single-center fuzzy semisupervised clustering (FSSC) methods. Two case studies indicate that the granularity volume parameter notably affects the classification performance, and the overall accuracy (OA) decreases with increasing granularity volume.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Urban Green Space Detection Using Marine Predators Algorithm Optimized Machine Learning Approach
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information regarding the current status of urban green space is crucial for urban land-use planning and management. This study proposes a remote sensing and data-driven solution for urban green space detection at regional scale via employment of state-of-the-art metaheuristic and machine learning approaches. Remotely sensed data obtained from Sentinel 2 satellite in the study area of Da Nang city (Vietnam) are used to construct and verify an intelligent model that hybridizes Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) and support vector machines (SVM). SVM are employed to generalize a decision boundary that separates features characterizing statistical measurements of remote sensing data into two categories of "green space" and "nongreen space". The MPA metaheuristic is used to optimize the SVM training phase by identifying an appropriate set of the SVM's hyperparameters including the penalty coefficient and the kernel function parameter. Experimental results show that the proposed model which processes information provided by all of the Sentinel 2 satellite's spectral bands can deliver a better performance than those obtained from the model based on vegetation indices. With a good classification accuracy rate of roughly 93%, an F1 score = 0.93, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic = 0.98, the newly developed model is a promising tool to assist local authority to obtain up-to-date information on urban green space and develop plans of sustainable urban land use.

TI  - Impacts of phosphorus loading temporal pattern on benthic algae growth in Lake Ontario
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nuisance growth of the alga Cladophora has been a critical issue in the Laurentian Great Lakes for decades. Although loading of total phosphorus (TP) has been below target values since the 1990s, the nearshore of the lakes still experience Cladophora blooms. This study explores the effects of TP loading temporal pattern on Cladophora growth in Rochester Embayment in Lake Ontario, where Cladophora blooms are frequently observed. Long-term TP loadings from the Genesee River, which is the primary tributary to the embayment, are calculated with a hydrological model, and Cladophora indicators based on beach closures and satellite data are collected for 2008-2017 to analyze the TP loading temporal patterns and their relation with Cladophora abundance. Using time series clustering for both TP loading and Cladophora indicators, it is found that besides total annual TP loading, the timing of high TP loading also plays an important role for Cladophora growth. High TP loading in mid-March to mid-June, compared to that in January to mid-March, is found to produce higher Cladophora abundance in summer. This finding is supported and explained using an integrated hydrodynamic and ecological modeling framework that includes a state-of-the-art Cladophora module. This study suggests that future Cladophora control should consider not only the total annual TP loading mass, but also the temporal loading patterns.

TI  - Air Pollution and Cognitive Functions: Evidence from Straw Burning in ChinaJEL codes
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the impact of air pollution from straw burning on human cognitive health in China by linking household health surveys with PM2.5 emissions derived from remote sensing data on fire activity. The identification strategy leverages the spatial dispersion of air pollutants due to exogenous wind directions. The results indicate that PM2.5 emissions from upwind straw burning have a negative impact on cognitive functions of respondents aged 55 and above, but PM2.5 emissions from downwind fires do not. The impact is transitory and caused by contemporaneous PM2.5 emissions on the day of cognitive testing. Our findings demonstrate a link from air pollution to cognitive declines and suggest that through this link, climate change could result in additional health costs by increasing the risk of wildfires.

TI  - On the relation between landscape beauty and land cover: A case study in the UK at Sentinel-2 resolution with interpretable AI
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The environment where we live and recreate can have a significant effect on our well-being. More beautiful landscapes have considerable benefits to both health and quality of life. When we chose where to live or our next holiday destination, we do so according to some perception of the environment around us. In a way, we value nature and assign an ecosystem service to it. Landscape aesthetics, or scenicness, is one such service, which we consider in this paper as a collective perceived quality. We present a deep learning model called ScenicNet for the large-scale inventorisation of landscape scenicness from satellite imagery. We model scenicness with an interpretable deep learning model and learn a landscape beauty estimator based on crowdsourced scores derived from more than two hundred thousand landscape images in the United Kingdom. Our ScenicNet model learns the relationship between land cover types and scenicness by using land cover prediction as an interpretable intermediate task to scenicness regression. It predicts landscape scenicness and land cover from the Corine Land Cover product concurrently, without compromising the accuracy of either task. In addition, our proposed model is interpretable in the sense that it learns to express preferences for certain types of land covers in a manner that is easily understandable by an end-user. Our semantic bottleneck also allows us to further our understanding of crowd preferences for landscape aesthetics.

TI  - Anthropogenic disturbances caused declines in the wetland area and carbon pool in China during the last four decades
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are among the natural ecosystems with the highest soil carbon stocks on Earth. However, how anthropogenic disturbances have impacted the quantity and distribution of wetland carbon pool in China is not well understood. Here we used a comprehensive countrywide wetland inventory and Landsat 8 data to document the spatial patterns in China's wetland areas and carbon pools and to understand the underlying causes of their changes from the 1980s to 2010s. We found that the wetland area and carbon pool have decreased from 4.11 x 10(5) km(2) and 15.2 Pg C in the 1980s to 2.14 x 10(5) km(2) and 7.6 Pg C in the 2010s, respectively. Using the human influence index (HII) as a quantitative measure of anthropogenic disturbance intensity, we found a positive relationship between the HII values and wetland decreases in many regions and across China as a whole-which have increased 17% during the time period-indicating that anthropogenic disturbances have been a major factor causing wetland destruction in recent decades. This study provides new evidence for recent changes in China's wetland carbon pool and emphasizes the importance of mitigating anthropogenic disturbances for wetland conservation.

TI  - A Novel Algorithm Based on Compressive Sensing to Mitigate Phase Unwrapping Errors in Multitemporal DInSAR Approaches
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we present a new method based on the compressive sensing (CS) theory to correct phase unwrapping (PhU) errors in the multitemporal sequence of interferograms exploited by advanced differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) techniques to generate deformation time series. The developed algorithm estimates the PhU errors by using a modified L-1-norm estimator applied to the interferometric network built in the temporal/spatial baseline plane. Indeed, in order to search the minimum L-1-norm sparse solution, we apply the iterative reweighted least-squares method with an improved weight function that takes account of the baseline characteristics of the interferometric pairs. Moreover, we also introduce a quality function to identify those solutions that have no physical meaning. Although the proposed approach can be applied to different multitemporal DInSAR approaches, our analysis is tailored to the full-resolution small baseline subset (SBAS) processing chain that we properly modify to implement the proposed CS-based algorithm. To assess the performance of the developed technique, we carry out an extended experimental analysis based on simulated and real SAR data. In particular, we process two wide SAR datasets acquired by Sentinel-1 and COSMO-SkyMed constellations over central Italy between 2011 and 2019. The achieved experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach in retrieving PhU errors and generating displacement time series related to strongly nonlinear deformation phenomena. Indeed, the developed CS-based technique significantly increases the number of detected coherent points and improves the accuracy of the retrieved deformation time series.

TI  - Formation of dense shelf water associated with sea ice freezing in the Gulf of Anadyr estimated with oxygen isotopic ratios
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - We analyzed temperature and salinity data and oxygen isotope ratios (818O) in summer 2018 in order to quantify the formation of dense shelf water (DSW) associated with sea ice freezing in the Gulf of Anadyr in the northwestern Bering Sea. Salinity and 818O displayed a strong linear relationship in samples upstream (southwest) of the Gulf of Anadyr. However, in bottom water (>26.5 00) in the northern Gulf of Anadyr, where a large polynya is the site of high sea ice production in winter, salinity was clearly higher than in the upstream water, whereas 818O was in the same range. This deviation is consistent with the formation of sea ice through brine rejection and subsequent DSW formation, causing an increase of salinity without changing 818O. A mass balance calculation based on these results yielded an estimated production of sea ice equivalent to a thickness 0.7 m, a result that matched an independent estimate of 2018 annual ice production based on satellite data. Even though the winter of 2018 had a historically low sea ice extent in the Bering Sea, including the Gulf of Anadyr, our results indicate continued DSW formation in the Gulf of Anadyr.

TI  - Contemporary variability in dimethylsulfide flux in the Barents Sea and simulated change under 4xCO<sub>2</sub> climate conditions
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of climate change will likely be most pronounced in the Arctic, due to various climate feedbacks such as the sea-ice albedo effect and changes in the biogenic emission of marine aerosols. The Barents Sea is one of the most productive ecosystems in the Arctic Ocean, seems to be a hot spot of warming, and as such merits special attention.A biogeochemical model is used to simulate phytoplankton variability and dimethylsulfide (DMS) flux in year 2005. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) technique is used to calibrate the biogeochemical model parameters. The CMIP5 (Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5) model output is used to provide changes in relevant model forcings under 1xCO(2) (contemporary) and 4xCO(2) (which could be reached by 2100 under worst case greenhouse gas emissions scenarios). Satellite data and meteorological forcings are used to characterize contemporary biophysical conditions in a region of the Barents Sea (70 degrees N-80 degrees N, 30 degrees E-40 degrees E).Under contemporary climate, meteorological forcings are studied for year 2003-2013. Mean concentrations of chlorophyll-a (CHL) reach a peak in late May and increase from north to south. Sea ice cover (ICE) decreases from March to September and is almost zero after year 2005 in the southern region (70 degrees N-75 degrees N). In the northern region (75 degrees N-80 degrees N), seasonal ice melt is closely related to the timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom. In general, the vernal increase of CHL coincides with an increase of sea surface temperature (SST) and decrease in surface wind speed (WIND). Under 4xCO(2) climate conditions, spring ICE decreases around 60% and the mixed layer depth (MLD) increases around 112%. The simulated deepening of the mixed layer leads to less favorable light conditions for phytoplankton growth. DMS sea-to-air flux hence decreases annual around 12%-46% due to a delay in the vernal bloom of phytoplankton. However, sea ice melt with concomitant increase in open waters promotes a DMS flux increase of around 9%-20% from May to mid of July. The change in DMS flux is influenced more by deepening of the MLD, rather than the increase in open water due to reduced sea ice cover. Importantly, these results contrast with previous studies that simulated increases in DMS sea-air flux in the Arctic Ocean under warming.

TI  - COVID-19: Differences in sentinel injury and child abuse reporting during a pandemic
T2  - CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives: There is widespread concern that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the incidence of child maltreatment. However, reports in the scientific literature documenting rates of child maltreatment during this period are scarce. This study was designed to explore whether the incidence of child maltreatment among patients presenting to a pediatric emergency department has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients of all ages presenting to a pediatric Emergency Department trauma center, who also had a child abuse report filing or a sentinel injury diagnosis related to their index visit. All such patients who presented to this institution from March through July of 2017 through 2020 were included in the study.Results: Analysis demonstrated an increase in the incidence of child maltreatment in May and June of 2020 and that there was an overall shift in distribution of types of child maltreatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a significant increase in the proportion of emotional/ psychological abuse (2.52 % before the pandemic to 7.00 % during the pandemic, p < 0.0001) and non-medical neglect (31.5%-40.0%, p < 0.0001).Conclusions: We observed an increase in specific types of child maltreatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings highlight the need for increased attention to children at risk for child abuse and neglect.

TI  - Intensive monitoring for bees in North America: indispensable or improvident?
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Continued reports of bee declines have prompted repeated calls for a national monitoring programme in the United States. Here, we argue that such a large-scale surveillance monitoring programme would consume inordinate resources without providing the sought-after data in a meaningful time period.Surveillance monitoring cannot provide reliable and timely measures of absolute or relative population size, species richness or diversity, host plant and nest site preferences or typical foraging ranges. In addition, the multitude of specimens captured by the passive traps commonly used to surveil overwhelm our identification capacity and, in some cases, may even accelerate species decline.Conversely, surveillance monitoring should be pursued when data can be collected non-lethally for readily identifiable species or species groups (e.g., bumble bees) or when widely distributed sentinel plants can be observed (e.g., sunflowers). Lethal collections should continue at appropriate temporal intervals but only at a limited number of representative areas with accurate historic records.We advocate that emphasis be placed on a targeted, natural-history approach aimed at addressing specific hypotheses and exploring solutions to conservation management problems. We already know enough about the drivers of bee decline to formulate and test potential solutions. While additional information is of value in understanding bee diversity, distributions and evolution, we do not need it to begin to take action; we should be focusing on the best ways to help bee species endure rather than attempting to accumulate even more evidence that they are in trouble.

TI  - Estimating root zone soil moisture across diverse land cover types by integrating in-situ and remotely sensed data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many soil moisture networks monitor only one land cover type, typically grassland, and the availability of in-situ soil moisture data in other land cover types is severely limited. Satellite-based radiometers lack adequate resolution to match the spatial variability in land cover, which often occurs at the sub-kilometer scale. Thus, spatial and temporal dynamics of root zone soil moisture in regions with heterogeneous land cover types remain poorly understood. Our objective was to determine how effectively root-zone soil moisture for diverse land cover types can be estimated using a water balance model driven by normalized high-resolution, remotely sensed vegetation indices (VI) data and in-situ meteorological data. Root zone soil moisture dynamics under four different land cover types were estimated using normalized VI data as a proxy for the basal crop coefficient. Correlation co-efficients (r) between measured and modeled soil moisture ranged from 0.50-0.92, mean absolute error (MAE) ranged from 0.03-0.06 m(3) m(-3), and mean bias error (MBE) ranged from -0.05-0.02 m(3) m(-3) across tallgrass prairie, cropland, mixed hardwood forest, and loblolly pine plantation sites. Model-estimated soil moisture under each land cover type was more accurate than both measured data from the nearest long-term grassland monitoring site and data from the NASA-USDA Enhanced Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) soil moisture product, providing evidence that in-situ meteorological data and remotely sensed VI data may be integrated into a simple water balance model to better estimate root zone soil moisture across diverse land cover types.

TI  - Geometry and adjacency effects in urban land surface temperature retrieval from high-spatial-resolution thermal infrared images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land surface temperature (ULST) is a key surface feature parameter in urban heat island studies. However, the geometry and adjacency effects are usually neglected in conventional land surface temperature (LST) retrieval methods. In this study, considering the geometry and adjacency effects, a new urban canopy multiple-scattering thermal radiative transfer (UCM-RT) model and an urban temperature-emissivity separation (UTES) algorithm were developed for ULST retrieval from Chinese GaoFen-5 (GF-5) satellite thermal infrared (TIR) images. The UCM-RT model and the UTES algorithm incorporate multiple scattering within the urban building canopy and consider the thermal radiance contribution from adjacent pixels and the atmosphere. Two schemes were designed to evaluate the geometry and adjacency effects quantitatively in this study: (1) evaluating their impact on ground temperature and top of atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperature for GF-5 four TIR bands from the simulation dataset, and (2) comparing the retrieval temperature difference between the UTES algorithm and conventional temperature-emissivity separation (TES) algorithm (without considering geometry and adjacency effects). For a specific simulation situation, the magnitude of the geometric effects on urban ground temperatures were found to be approximately 3.2 K, 4.2 K, 4.0 K, and 3.9 K for the four GF-5 TIR bands, while the effects on the TOA brightness temperature reached 2.4 K, 3.3 K, 3.3 K, and 3.0 K for those bands, respectively. The results show that the geometry effects have a significant influence on the thermal radiative transfer process. The temperature error of the UTES algorithm was generally up to 0.8 K, much lower than that of the conventional TES algorithm (similar to 2.2 K) in urban surface. The results indicate that the UTES algorithm is suitable for ULST retrieval, and the retrieval temperature difference between the UTES algorithm and conventional TES algorithm ranges from 0.1 K to 2.1 K, especially for dense building pixels. Additionally, the thermal radiation from adjacent pixels in high-spatial-resolution TIR images has significant influence on ULST retrieval. The comparison between the ULST algorithm for urban land surface and the conventional TES algorithm for the flat surface indicated that the three-dimensional structure inside the pixel has a significant influence on the ULST retrieval. The findings of this study indicate that the geometry and adjacency effects must be considered in ULST retrieval for highly accurate results.

TI  - Evaluation of NLDAS-2 and Downscaled Air Temperature data in Florida
T2  - PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - A broad spectrum of model-derived weather datasets are available in the US. Because each product integrates atmospheric conditions with different model processes, each produces different statistical biases. This study validated air temperature from NLDAS-2 and a novel statistically downscaled NLDAS-2 against observational weather station data for the state of Florida. We statistically downscaled NLDAS-2 to a 1-km grid product using MODIS land surface temperature. We investigated mean biases and Pearson correlation coefficients between daily observational data and the two model-derived datasets. We then calculated multiple Climate Extremes Indices to further scrutinize differences in capturing extreme temperatures. Finally, we quantified potential causes of systematic NLDAS-2 biases related to distance from the coast, urban heat island, land cover, and type of observational stations. Two model-derived datasets showed similar mean biases and correspondence with observational data, underestimating maximum temperature by 1 degrees C and overestimating minimum temperature by 2 degrees C. Extreme temperatures were well simulated in both datasets. However, we still found overestimated extreme minimum temperatures and underestimated extreme maximum temperatures. Systematic biases tended to be higher for coastal stations and grids having a high fraction of water. Our study suggests that including physical processes covering land surface and ocean interactions may improve the model accuracy.

TI  - Detecting high-temperature anomalies from Sentinel-2 MSI images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-temperature anomalies (HTAs) of the earth's surface, such as fires, volcanic activities, and industrial heat sources, have a profound impact on Earth's system. Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) provides spatiallyspecific information for precisely measuring the location and extent of HTAs at a fine scale. However, detecting HTAs from MSI images remains challenging because the emitted radiance of an HTA in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands can be easily mixed with the reflected solar radiance background in the daytime; and an increasing number of atypical cases in MSI images need to be treated with the enhanced spatial resolution. A generic HTA detection approach that handles both anthropogenic and natural HTAs will broaden the scope of MSI applications. In this study, (i) we highlight two spectral characteristics of HTAs in the far-SWIR, near-SWIR, and NIR bands (i.e., (rho(far-SWIR) - rho(near-SWIR))/rho(NIR) >= 0.45 and (rho(far-SWIR) - rho(near-SWIR)) >= rho(near-SWIR) - rho(NIR)) that can effectively enhance HTAs from background geo-features, based on the reflectance spectra in airborne imaging spectrometer data. (ii) We propose a tri-spectral thermal anomaly index (TAI) that jointly uses the two high-temperature-sensitive SWIR bands and the high-temperature-insensitive NIR band to enhance HTAs, based on the above characteristics and a comprehensive sampling of different types of HTAs from 1,974 MSI images. (iii) We develop a TAI-based approach for MSI images to detect HTAs in general. The proposed approach was applied to detect different types of HTAs, including different biomass burnings, active volcanoes, and industrial HTAs, over a wide range of land-cover scenarios. Validations and comparisons demonstrate the proposed approach is reliable and performs better than the existing state-of-the-art HTA detection approaches. Evaluations on two types of small industrial HTAs, including operating kilns and enclosed landfill gas flares, show that the HTA detection probability of the TAI-based approach from time-series MSI images is similar to 84.91% and 88.23%, respectively. Further investigations show that the TAI-based approach also has good transferability in detecting HTAs from multispectral images acquired by Landsat-family satellites.

TI  - Mapping oil palm density at country scale: An active learning approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of oil palm is important for understanding its past and future impact on the environment. We propose to map and count oil palms by estimating tree densities per pixel for large-scale analysis. This allows for fine-grained analysis, for example regarding different planting patterns. To that end, we propose a new, active deep learning method to estimate oil palm density at large scale from Sentinel-2 satellite images, and apply it to generate complete maps for Malaysia and Indonesia. What makes the regression of oil palm density challenging is the need for representative reference data that covers all relevant geographical conditions across a large territory. Specifically for density estimation, generating reference data involves counting individual trees. To keep the associated labelling effort low we propose an active learning (AL) approach that automatically chooses the most relevant samples to be labelled. Our method relies on estimates of the epistemic model uncertainty and of the diversity among samples, making it possible to retrieve an entire batch of relevant samples in a single iteration. Moreover, our algorithm has linear computational complexity and is easily parallelisable to cover large areas. We use our method to compute the first oil palm density map with 10m Ground Sampling Distance (GSD), for all of Indonesia and Malaysia and for two different years, 2017 and 2019. The maps have a mean absolute error of +/- 7.3 trees/ha, estimated from an independent validation set. We also analyse density variations between different states within a country and compare them to official estimates. According to our estimates there are, in total, >1.2 billion oil palms in Indonesia covering >15 million ha, and > 0.5 billion oil palms in Malaysia covering >6 million ha.

T2  - Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology]
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To explore the method of predicting high lymph node load in patients with early breast cancer to avoid unnecessary sentinel lymph node biopsy. Methods: The clinicopathological and thoracic multi-slice spiral CT (MSCT) data of 2620 patients with early (cT1~2N0M0) breast cancer treated in the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 1, 2014 to August 1, 2018 were collected. According to the postoperative pathological results, the patients were divided into the group with axillaryhigh lymph node burden (HNB) and the non-HNB group. The influencing factors of axillary lymph node burden in patients with early breast cancer were determined by univariate and multivariate analysis, and the diagnostic model of MSCT to HNB was established. The best cutoff value for the diagnosis of HNB was determined through analyzing the receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curve, and the consistency between MSCT diagnosis and pathological diagnosis was evaluated by Kappa test. Results: Among the 2 620 patients, 168 were diagnosed of HNB. Univariate analysis showed that the tumor size, the status of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), the number of abnormal lymph nodes showed in MSCT, the ratio of the length to the diameter of the maximum abnormal lymph node as shown in MSCT, the condition of the maximum abnormal lymph node door, and the parenchyma of the maximum abnormal lymph node were related to axillary lymph node burden in patients with early breast cancer (P<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that the number of abnormal lymph nodes showed in MSCT was an independent influencing factor of axillary HNB in patients with early breast cancer. Compared with patients without abnormal lymph nodes, the OR values of patients with 1, 2, 3 or more abnormal lymph nodes displayed by MSCT and in axillary HNB status were 3.305, 9.379, 126.163 and 780.953, respectively. Using 3 or more abnormal lymph nodes detected by MSCT to predict the area under the ROC curve of axillary HNB in patients with early breast cancer, the area was 0.928, the sensitivity was 82.1%, the specificity was 95.4%, and the accuracy was 94.5%. Kappa test showed that the consistency between MSCT diagnosis and pathological diagnosis was relatively high (Kappa=0.629, P<0.001). Conclusions: The number of abnormal lymph nodes showed in MSCT is an independent influencing factor of axillary HNB in patients with early breast cancer. Taking 3 or more abnormal lymph nodes showed in MSCT as the threshold can help to predict the axillary HNB status of early breast cancer patients and exempt some of them from unnecessary sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Incidence of severe exacerbation in patients diagnosed with diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Cohort study
T2  - ATENCION PRIMARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To estimate the incidence of hospitalizations for severe exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and its associated factors in a cohort of patients diagnosed with COPD and diabetes type 2.Design: Prospective cohort study. Site: Primary care centres of Lleida city (7 centres totally).Participants: Based on a sample of 716 patients diagnosed by COPD and diabetes. The inclusion criteria was carried out by patients of both genders, equal to or older than 40 years, ordinarily residents in the geographical area of Lleida city, with the diagnosis of COPD according to GOLD guideline, with recent spirometry and FEY/ /FY[ ratio <0.7; diagnosed with diabetes type 2 according to the guidelines of the International Diabetes Federation. The exclusion criteria were suffering from a serious physical or mental illness.Main measurements: The study variables were comprised by gender, age, primary care centre of Lleida, body mass index, waist circumference, smoking and enolic habit, blood pressure, heart failure, chronic renal failure, FEVi, FEY/ /FY[. GOLD categorization, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c). There were registered by influenza and pneumococcal vaccine. The dependent variable was severe exacerbation. In statistical analysis, the association of the dependent variable with the independent variables was determined by calculating the Hazard ratio (HR) with the 95% confidence interval. HR was estimated in an adjusted way by using unconditional Cox regression model. Results: The incidence for severe exacerbation of COPD was 9.98%; that means that an increased risk of severe exacerbation was registered in patients diagnosed with heart failure (HR =2.27; p =.002), and with lower FEVi /FVC ratio. The influenza and pneumococcal vaccines provided weak protection to prevent exacerbations, however it was not statistically significant.Conclusion: It documents a significant incidence of exacerbation in patients diagnosed with DM2 and COPD. Heart failure and a lower FEVi /FVC could increase the exacerbation risk. 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

TI  - Vegetation degradation in ENSO events: Drought assessment, soil use and vegetation evapotranspiration in the Western Brazilian Amazon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the degradation of the Amazon forest has been the target of studies at the global level to identify elements and factors influencing this process. Thus, this study had as objective to study the vegetation degradation during the years of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon in the State of Amazonas. We used remote sensing data, forest typologies, and weather elements from 14 conventional stations located in Amazonas. Evapotranspiration images obtained from the MODIS Global Evapotranspiration Project (MOD16A2), and data from fire sources from the Terra and Aqua collection (MOD146) platforms were used. The 6 different forms of forest typologies found in the region were also used, in addition to the climatic elements maximum, minimum temperature, relative humidity, sunshine and wind speed of 14 conventional stations in the state of Amazonas. The weather station data were used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration, using the empirical methods Val-1, Val-2, Val-3, Val-4, Irmak-1, Irmak-2 and Alex. The results show differences in the correlations between the evapotranspiration methods used. The highest evapotranspiration was found in the Open Ombrophilous Forest. Fire foci were concentrated in Dense Ombrophilous Forest areas. The Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) showed to be an efficient index to characterize the drought in El Nino events, besides showing the agricultural expansion in the region. The largest trends of the weather elements and the SPEI were during the El Nino phenomenon. A better understanding of the ENSO effects on vegetation could prevent uncontrolled forest loss. Governance interventions involving national and financial actors, as well as local populations, also play a role in this.

TI  - A decadal (2008-2017) daily evapotranspiration data set of 1 km spatial resolution and spatial completeness across the North China Plain using TSEB and data fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Daily continuous evapotranspiration (ET) estimates of 1 km spatial resolution can benefit agricultural water resources management at regional scales. Thermal infrared remote sensing-derived land surface temperature (LST) is a critical variable for ET estimation using energy balance-based models. However, missing LST information under cloudy conditions remains a long-standing barrier for spatiotemporally continuous monitoring of daily ET at regional scales. In this study, LST data of 1 km spatial resolution at 11:00 local solar time under allweather conditions across the North China Plain (NCP) were first generated using a data fusion approach developed previously. Second, combined with the generated LST data, MODIS products, and meteorological forcing from the China Land Data Assimilation System, the Two-Source Energy Balance model (TSEB) and a temporal upscaling method were jointly used to estimate daily ET at 1 km spatial resolution across the NCP for a decade from 2008 to 2017. In particular, to better incorporate the impact of crop phenology on ET and improve the ET estimation, the fraction of greenness in TSEB was determined in terms of a leaf area index threshold during the crop growth period. Compared with observed instantaneous latent heat flux (LE) corrected for energy balance closure, the estimated LE reasonably captures inter- and intra-annual variations in LE measured at the Huailai, Daxing, Weishan, and Guantao flux towers, with R2 of 0.63-0.79. Estimated daily ET against in situ ET measurements with energy balance closure at the Huailai, Daxing, and Guantao sites showed good performance in terms of R2 greater than 0.70 and RMSE below 0.91 mm/d. These accuracies are comparable with published results, with our ET data set validated by many more observations than previous studies and featuring spatiotemporal continuity and high spatial resolution across the entire NCP for a decade. Furthermore, seasonal ET variations reflected by our product outperform two widely used global products in capturing water consumption characteristics in the winter wheat-summer maize rotation system. In terms of temporal trends, annual ET estimates across the NCP show a decreasing and then increasing trend over the past decade, which is attributed to the increased cropping intensity over the recent years reflected by an increase in leaf area index.

TI  - Combined deep prior with low-rank tensor SVD for thick cloud removal in multitemporal images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The thick cloud coverage phenomenon severely disturbs optical satellite observation missions (covering approximately 40-60% areas in the global scale). Therefore, the manner by which to eliminate thick cloud in remote sensing imagery is greatly significant and indispensable. In this study, we combine the deep spatio-temporal prior with low-rank tensor singular value decomposition (DP-LRTSVD) for thick cloud removal in multitemporal images. On the one hand, DP-LRTSVD utilizes the low-rank characteristic of multitemporal images via the third-order tensor SVD and completion. On the other hand, DP-LRTSVD employs the deep spatio-temporal feature expression ability by 3D convolutional neural network. The proposed framework can effectively eliminate thick cloud in multitemporal images through combining the model-driven and data-driven strategies. Moreover, DP-LRTSVD outperforms on thick cloud removal in the simulated and real multitemporal Sentinel-2/GF-1 experiments compared with model-driven or data-driven methods. In contrast with most methods that can only use a single reference image for thick cloud removal, the proposed method can simultaneously eliminate thick cloud in time-series images.

TI  - Sea of possibilities: Old and new uses of remote sensing data for the enforcement of the Ascension Island marine protected area
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Very large marine protected areas are in danger of becoming 'paper parks'. This paper uses an interdisciplinary team to investigate the use of remote sensing technologies to provide sufficient evidence for effective fisheries management. It uses the intended marine protected area around Ascension Island as a case study. Satellite technology provides opportunities to detect the presence of fishing vessels but because of difficulties with data interpretation, it is unlikely to be a sole source of evidence for prosecutions. Developing drone technology and traditional over-flights by aerial surveillance may supplement satellite technology with 'eyewitness' evidence. Well-crafted regulations will be able to make some use of this data, but the evidential requirements of criminal courts make prosecutions difficult to pursue. There is some scope to expand management opportunities through vesting the fishery in a public body and pursuing offenders through civil law, this approach having a different suite of remedies. Other opportunities lie in giving very large marine protected areas legal personality which has similar advantages and additional reputational benefits. Using remote sensing data in the civil court poses evidential problems. An alternative approach is to collate data around frequent infringers and, by negatively impacting on their reputation, restrict their ability to obtain insurance, finance, access to fisheries and market access. This is exemplified in port state measures by fisheries authorities and chain of custody requirements by labelling bodies. Data sharing raises challenges with intellectual property and coordination. The paper demonstrates that there are opportunities to make VLMPAs work more effectively.

TI  - Comparative evaluation of geospatial scenario-based land change simulation models using landscape metrics
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the performance of land change simulation models is a critical step when predicting the future landscape scenario. The study was conducted in the district of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India because the city being "the oldest living city in the world" attracts a vast population to reside here for short and long-term, leaving the city's ecosystem more exposed to fragility and less resilient. In this work, an approach based on landscape metrics is introduced for comparing the performance of the ensemble models designed to simulate the landscape changes. A set of landscape metrics were applied in this study that offered comprehensive information on the performance of scenario-based simulation models from the viewpoint of the spatial ordering of simulated results against the related reference maps. A supervised support vector machine classification technique was applied to derive the LULC maps using Landsat satellite images of the year 1988, 2001, and 2015. The LULC maps of 1988 and 2001 were used to simulate the LULC scenario for 2015 using three Markov chain-based simulation models namely, multi-layer perceptron-Markov chain (MLP_Markov), cellular automata-Markov chain (CA_Markov), and stochastic-Markov chain (ST_Markov) respectively. The mean relative error (MRE), as a measure of the success of simulation models, was calculated for metrics. The MRE values at both the class and landscape levels were accounted for 21.63 and 11.45% respectively using MLP_Markov simulation model. The MRE values at both the class and landscape levels were accounted for 39.61 and 28.31% respectively using CA_Markov simulation model. The MRE values at both the class and landscape levels were accounted for 55.36 and 45.75% respectively using ST_Markov simulation model. The MRE values considered at class and landscape levels are further evaluated qualitatively for comparing the performance of simulation models. The results indicate that the MLP_Markov performed excellently, followed by CA_Markov and ST_Markov simulation models. This work showed an ordered and multi-level spatial evaluation of the models' performance into the decision-making process of selecting the optimum approach among them. Landscape metrics as a vital characteristic of the utilized method, employ the maximum potential of the reference and simulated layers for a performance evaluation process. It extends the insight into the main strengths and drawbacks of a specific model when simulating the spatio-temporal pattern. The quantified information of transition among landscape categories also provides land policy managers a better perception to build a sustainable city master plan.

TI  - Impact of RNA degradation on influenza diagnosis in the surveillance system
T2  - DIAGNOSTIC MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The continuous evolution of influenza viruses is monitored by the World Health Organization Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. Sample quality is essential for surveillance quality.Methods: To evaluate the RNA degradation of clinical samples, influenza-like illness samples were collected from four sentinel hospitals, and seasonal influenza was tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and quantified by digital reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at different time points.Results: RNA degradation was observed in the majority of samples eight days after sample collection. A significant and faster rate of RNA content reduction was observed in low viral load samples (10 copies/ml) than in high viral load samples (10 copies/ml), stored at 2 to 8 degrees C for up to eight days. RNase P (RNP) RNA, which is a key indicator to evaluate sample collection quality, was detected. Sample collection quality was uneven in different hospitals.Conclusion: Low viral load samples increase the risk of false negatives due to RNA degradation to undetectable levels.

TI  - Adverse Events Among Emergency Department Patients With Cardiovascular Conditions: A Multicenter Study
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Study objective: We aim to determine incidence and type of adverse events (adverse outcomes related to emergency care) among emergency department (ED) patients discharged with recent-onset atrial fibrillation, acute heart failure, and syncope.Methods: This 5-year prospective cohort study included high-acuity adult patients discharged with the 3 sentinel diagnoses from 6 tertiary care CanadianEDs. We screened all EDvisits for eligibility and performed telephone interviews 14 days postdischarge to identify flagged outcomes: death, hospital admission, return ED visit, health care provider visit, and new or worsening symptoms. We created case summaries describing index ED visit and flagged outcomes, and trained emergency physicians reviewed case summaries to identify adverse events. We reported adverse event incidence and rates with 95% confidence intervals and contributing factor themes.Results: Among 4,741 subjects (mean age 70.2 years; 51.2% men), we observed 170 adverse events (3.6 per 100 patients; 95% confidence interval 3.1 to 4.2). Patients discharged with acute heart failure were most likely to experience adverse events (5.3%), followed by those with atrial fibrillation (2.0%) and syncope (0.8%). We noted variation in absolute adverse event rates across sites from 0.7 to 6.0 per 100 patients. The most common adverse event types were management issues, diagnostic issues, and unsafe disposition decisions. Frequent contributing factor themes included failure to recognize underlying causes and inappropriate management of dual diagnoses.Conclusion: Among adverse events after ED discharge for patients with these 3 sentinel cardiovascular diagnoses, we identified quality improvement opportunities such as strengthening dual diagnosis detection and evidence-based clinical practice guideline adherence.

TI  - Integrated InSAR monitoring and structural assessment of tunnelling-induced building deformations
T2  - STRUCTURAL CONTROL & HEALTH MONITORING
M3  - Article
AB  - Structural deformation monitoring is crucial for the identification of early signs of tunnelling-induced damage to adjacent structures and for the improvement of current damage assessment procedures. Satellite multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) techniques enable measurement of building displacements over time with millimetre-scale accuracy. Compared to traditional ground-based monitoring, MT-InSAR can yield denser and cheaper building observations, representing a cost-effective monitoring tool. However, without integrating MT-InSAR techniques and structural assessment, the potential of InSAR monitoring cannot be fully exploited. This integration is particularly demanding for large construction projects, where big datasets need to be processed. In this paper, we present a new automated methodology that integrates MT-InSAR-based building deformations and damage assessment procedures to evaluate settlement-induced damage to buildings adjacent to tunnel excavations. The developed methodology was applied to the buildings along an 8-km segment of the Crossrail tunnel route in London, using COSMO-SkyMed MT-InSAR data from 2011 to 2015. The methodology enabled the identification of damage levels for 858 buildings along the Crossrail twin tunnels, providing an unprecedented number of high quality field observations for building response to settlements. The proposed methodology can be used to improve current damage assessment procedures, for the benefit of future underground excavation projects in urban areas.

TI  - Variation in the rate of land subsidence induced by groundwater extraction and its effect on the response pattern of soil microbial communities
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Excessive extraction of groundwater leads to (irreversible) changes in the physical soil properties, causing land subsidence associated with soil compaction to occur. Using a combined image processing and field approach, we examined: (1) how variation in the land subsidence rate induces different soil compaction degrees; and (2) the response patterns of microbial communities to such variations. By using Sentinel Synthetic Aperture Radar image processing, we selected three locations that exhibited different land subsidence rates, including high (HSR), moderate (MSR), and low (LSR). Then, soil sampling was undertaken within these representative locations. Indicators of soil compaction, including total porosity, air-filled porosity, water-filled porosity, and bulk density, were measured. The soil microbial community was determined using qPCR and sequencing. The highest and lowest values for bulk density were observed in the HSR-MSR and LSR zones, respectively. The greatest values of total porosity and macropore volume were displayed in the LSR zone compared to other zones. Bacterial abundance in the LSR zone was significantly greater than that in the HSR and MSR zones. The relative abundances of bacterial taxa indirectly demonstrated that the anaerobic phyla were significantly increased (by 10-13%), and the aerobic phyla decreased (by 30-40%) in the HSR zone compared to the LSR zone. This result demonstrates that the aerobes declined as larger volumes of the soil became more anaerobic. Indeed, the increased abundance of anaerobes was not able to compensate for the larger decrease in the abundance of aerobes. Our work showed that at the increased rates of land subsidence, the abundance distribution of the microbial community critically declined. These findings highlight the critical impacts of increasing the land subsidence rate on the emergence of high soil compaction degrees, which can significantly affect the resilience thresholds of the microbial communities in dryland soils.

TI  - Evaluating the impacts of land use/land cover changes across topography against land surface temperature in Cameron Highlands
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cameron Highlands has experienced multiple land encroachment activities and repeated deforestation, leading to extensive land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) during the past six decades. This study aims to determine the LULCC against topography in Cameron Highlands between 2009 and 2019 by using geospatial techniques to analyze Landsat 7 (ETM+) and 8 (OLI/TIRS), ASTER GDEM and MODIS imaging sensors. The results showed a decline of 35.98 km(2) in primary forests over ten years across the Cameron Highlands, while agricultural lands and urban areas flourished by a rise of 51.61 km(2) and 11.00 km(2) respectively. It can be noted that the elevation most affected is between 1000 and 1500 m, across all classes. Further results showed the expansion of both agriculture and urban development onto slopes above 35 degrees, leading to an instability of soil structure. In a comparison of the base years of 2009 with 2019, mean LST results have shown temperatures rising by 7.5 degrees C, while an average between 3 and 4 degrees C across the region is recorded. The results obtained provide new information for government bodies and land planners to coordinate their actions without further jeopardizing the environment of the Cameron Highlands.

AB  - Background: A 31-gene genetic expression profile (31-GEP; Class 1 = low risk, Class 2 = high risk) developed to predict outcome in cutaneous melanoma (CM) has been validated by retrospective, industry-sponsored, or small series.Methods: Tumor features, sentinel node biopsy (SNB) results, and outcomes were extracted from a prospective database of 383 C M patients who underwent SNB and had a 31-GEP run on their primary tumor. Groups were compared by uni- and multi-variable analysis. Relapse-free and distant metastasis-free survival (RFS, DMFS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method.Results: Breslow thickness, T stage, and SNB positivity were significantly higher in Class 2 patients. Recurrence rates were higher for Class 2 vs Class 1 patients and highest in patients who were Class 2 and SNB positive. GEP class was predictive of RFS and DMFS and independently predicted relapse in AJCC "low risk" (stages IA-IIA) patients.Conclusions: 31-GEP adds prognostic information in CM patents undergoing SNB.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - Understanding and researching water level changes are fundamental to many aspects, including climate change, environmental balance and the necessary conservation measures that have been better taken. Deep learning (DL) methods have become increasingly crucial for predicting drought and water levels using remote sensing satellite imagery. In this work, the Landsat-Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is used to predict the drought and water level based on the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) in the Chennai region, using time series data sets. DCNN has separately trained these NDWI values in both areas of future dynamics prediction. To compute Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) the Deep Convolutional Neural Network's is used. Also, unexpected changes in the NDWI sequence trend are well adapted through the network. According to the prediction of the future NDWI value and reasonable accuracy, the RMSE is kept less than 0.03% without providing supplementary data. By adopting the method specified in work, the water level change can be accurately carried out in advance. Active measures are taken to ensure and improve the water content in any area.

TI  - Monitoring cyanoHABs and water quality in Laguna Lake (Philippines) with Sentinel-2 satellites during the 2020 Pacific typhoon season
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Laguna Lake, the largest freshwater lake in the Philippines, is permanently subject to nutrient-driven eutrophication and pollution and experiences harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) periodically with serious socio-economic implications. The aim of this study is to evaluate the suitability of the Sentinel-2 imagery of the European Commission's Copernicus Earth Observation programme for lake monitoring during the 2020 Pacific typhoon season (September-November 2020). The Case-2 Regional Coast Colour processor is used to atmospherically correct Level 1 data and generate water quality parameters, such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM) at 10 m. Results show that Super Typhoon Goni and Typhoon Vamco delivered high suspended sediment loads to the reservoir at concentrations above 170 g/m(3) compared to pre-storm situations (0-35 g/m(3)). The typhoons also affect Chl-a, with a mean concentration of 10 mg/m(3) and 30 mg/m(3) for pre- and post-typhoons, respectively. In addition, the normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI) is used in the Google Earth Engine platform for near-real time monitoring of cyano HABs at 20 m spatial resolution. Satellite maps are key for detecting the distribution of the blooms due to the patchiness of the green algae species, which usually form scum and elongated slicks in the lake. Maximum records of bloom detection during the study period occur in the Central Bay, one of the lake sections with major aquaculture and fisheries activities. The Sentinel-2 mission improves synoptic mapping of cyanoHABs and enables trends in their extent and severity to be documented. These available methods provide an essential tool for rapid detection after extreme events and for regularwater quality monitoring, which will assist and benefit the cost-effective management of Laguna Lake.

TI  - Scaled biomass estimation in woodland ecosystems: Testing the individual and combined capacities of satellite multispectral and lidar data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data enable accurate modeling and mapping of aboveground biomass (AGB), but the limited spatial and temporal extents of ALS data collection limit the capacity for broad-scale carbon accounting. Conversely, while space-based remote sensing instruments provide increased spatial and temporal coverage, it can be difficult to directly link field-level vegetation biometrics to satellite data due to coarser spatial resolution and positional uncertainty. The combined use of ALS and satellite remote sensing data may offer a solution to efficient, accurate, and consistent AGB mapping across time and space. Such airborne-spaceborne data fusion has been demonstrated successfully in high-biomass settings; however, the unique structural conditions of dryland woodland ecosystems, with open canopies and low leaf area indices, pose mapping challenges that require further study. These challenges are particularly acute with large footprint spaceborne lidar, where short, widely-spaced trees may limit the capacity for accurate AGB estimation. In this study, we present a scaled methodological framework for linking field-measured woodland AGB to ALS data and, in turn, linking ALSmodeled AGB to satellite data, using pin similar to on-juniper woodlands in southeastern Utah as a case study. We compare the effectiveness of this scaling approach using two satellite sensors, Landsat 8 OLI (multispectral) and GEDI (lidar). Since the predicted outputs of our local-scale model are being used as inputs to our regional-scale model, we also demonstrate an approach for propagating uncertainty throughout this nested, multiscale analytical framework, leveraging the inherent variability within a random forest's decision trees. Given the positional uncertainty of GEDI footprints, we test a range of different footprint sizes for their relative effects on ALS-GEDI AGB model accuracy. Our local-scale (field-ALS) predictive model was able to account for 74% of variance in AGB, and estimate AGB with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 14 Mg/ha, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 11.09 Mg/ha. Our regional-scale (ALS-Landsat/GEDI) analysis with propagated uncertainty revealed that the combined use of Landsat and GEDI metrics produced the best predictive model (R2 = 0.68; RMSE = 12.71 Mg/ha; MAE = 9.40 Mg/ha), followed by Landsat-only metrics (R2 = 0.66, RMSE = 13.08 Mg/ha; MAE = 9.71 Mg/ha), and GEDI-only metrics (R2 = 0.49, RMSE = 16.01 Mg/ha; MAE = 12.14 Mg/ha). These results suggest that Landsat may be better-suited than GEDI for estimating AGB in woodland environments where low canopy covers and short trees limit the capacity for precisely characterizing vegetation structure within largefootprint, waveform lidar data. The footprint size analysis revealed that larger simulated footprints (e.g., 30 m radius and greater) produced higher GEDI model accuracies; however, increasing footprint radii beyond 30 m does not significantly increase model accuracy. This research represents an important step forward in improving our capacity for reliably mapping woodland AGB, and provides an early test case for the application of GEDI data to woodland AGB mapping.

TI  - Climatic and non-climatic vegetation cover changes in the rangelands of Africa
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - About 21% of the African population directly depends on rangeland resources. As this number is predicted to grow, it is important to understand the response of African rangelands to global environmental change and formulate, in turn, better hypotheses on their capacity to support livelihoods. Here we used three decades of satellite data and a dynamic global vegetation model to study the response of rangeland vegetation to recent climate change and to describe changes in the vegetation structure accompanying greening and browning trends. Long-term climate change was the dominant driver of vegetation dynamics in ca. 2,495,000 km2 of African rangelands (22.7% of the total extent). Examples of these rangelands are in Mauritania, Senegal, Chad, Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa, where the vegetation greened up due to an overall increase in trees, shrubs, and short herbaceous vegetation. We further identified a more extended different type of rangeland (ca. 2,915,000 km2) where vegetation dynamics appeared to be largely unrelated to long-term climate variations. In these rangelands, we observed opposite trends between woody cover (trees and shrubs) and short vegetation (mostly representative of the herbaceous layer). Greening (West Africa, South Sudan) was associated with an overall increase in woody cover (+4.4%) and a concomitant decline in short vegetation (-3.4%), while browning (Angola, Mozambique) resulted from a decrease in woody cover (-2.6%) and an increase in short vegetation (+4.3%) (total per cent change average during 1982-2015). Our results offer a nuanced perspective to frame greening and browning trends in rangeland systems. While greening may mitigate climate change via higher carbon uptake, the encroachment of less palatable woody species reduces the resources available to pastoral communities. On the other hand, browning due to a reduction in the woody cover attenuates carbon sequestration rates, but the observed increase in short herbaceous vegetation may hint a relative increase in forage resources.

TI  - The evolution of built-up areas in Ghana since 1975
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - We use high resolution satellite data on the proportion of buildings in a 250x250 meter cell to study the evolution of human settlement in Ghana over a 40 year period. We find a strong increase in built-up area over time, mostly concentrated in the vicinity of roads, and also directly on the coast. We find strong evidence of agglomeration effects both in the static sense-buildup in one cell predicts buildup in a nearby cell-and in a dynamic sense-buildup in a cell predicts buildup in that cell later on and an increase in buildup in nearby cells. These effects are strongest over a 3 to 15 Km radius, which corresponds to a natural hinterland for a population without mechanized transportation. We find no evidence that human settlements are spaced more or less equally either over the landscape or along roads. This suggests that arable land is not yet fully utilized, allowing rural settlements to be separated by areas of un-farmed land. By fitting a transition matrix to the data, we predict a sharp increase in the proportion of the country that is densely built-up by the middle and the end of the century, but no increase in the proportion of partially built-up locations.

TI  - Calibration of the DSCOVR EPIC Visible and NIR Channels using Multiple LEO Radiometers
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The first five years of operation of the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) at the Lagrange one point have produced results that uniquely complement the data from currently operating low orbit Earth-observing instruments. In this paper we describe an updated unified approach to EPIC calibration. In this approach, calibration coefficients and their trends were obtained by comparing EPIC observations to the measurements from polar orbiting radiometers. In this study L1B reflectances from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua and Terra satellites, Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) onboard Terra and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) spacecraft were used to infer calibration coefficients for four EPIC visible and near-infrared channels: 443 nm, 551 nm, 680 nm, and 780 nm. EPIC Version three measurements made between June 2015 and August 2020 were used for comparison. The calibration procedure identifies the most homogeneous low Earth orbit radiometer scenes matching scattering angles that are temporarily and spatially collocated with EPIC observations. These scenes are used to determine reflectance to count (R/C) ratios in spectrally analogous channels. Seasonal average R/C ratios were analyzed to obtain EPIC calibration gains and trends. The trends for the full dataset period are not statistically significant except in the 443 nm channel. No significant changes in calibration were found after the instrument's exit from safe hold in March 2020. The R/C ratios were also used to determine the differences in EPIC gains resulting from separate calibrations: against MODIS Aqua or Terra, as well as against forward or aftward MISR cameras. Statistical tests indicate that the differences between the two datasets are not significant except in the 780 nm channels where Aqua-derived coefficients may be around 2% lower compared to Terra. The dependence of EPIC calibration gains on the instrument scattering angle and on DSCOVR-Earth distance were investigated. Lastly, model Low Earth Orbit (LEO) reflectances calculated to match the EPIC viewing geometry were employed to study how EPIC calibration coefficients depend on EPIC-LEO viewing geometry differences. The effect of LEO and EPIC angular mismatch on calibration was shown to be small.

TI  - A novel approach for estimation of aboveground biomass of a carbon-rich mangrove site in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves can play a crucial part in climate change mitigation policies due to their high carbon-storing capacity. However, the carbon sequestration potential of Indian mangroves generally remained unexplored to date. In this study, multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and 2 data-derived variables were used to estimate the AGB of a tropical carbon-rich mangrove forest of India. Ensemble prediction of multiple machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Model (GBM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were used for AGB prediction. The multi-temporal dataset was used in two different ways to find the most suitable method of using them. The results of the analysis showed that the modeling field measured AGB with individual date data values results in estimates with root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 149.242 t/ha for XGB to 151.149 t/ha for the RF. Modeling AGB with the average and percentile metrics of the multi-temporal image stack improves the prediction accuracy of AGB, with RMSE ranging from 81.882 t/ha for the XGB to 74.493 t/ha for the RF. The AGB modeling using ensemble prediction showed further improvement in accuracy with an RMSE of 72.864 t/ha and normalized RMSE of 11.38%. In this study, the intra-seasonal variation of Sentinel-1 and 2 data for mangrove ecosystems was explored for the first time. The variations in remotely sensed variables could be attributed mainly to soil moisture availability and rainfall in the mangrove ecosystem. The efficiency of Sentinel1 and 2 data-derived variables and ensemble prediction of machine learning models for Indian mangroves were also explored for the first time. The methodologies established in this study can be used in the future for accurate prediction and repeated monitoring of AGB for mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Wildlife-friendly farming recouples grazing regimes to stimulate recovery in semi-arid rangelands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - While rangeland ecosystems are globally important for livestock production, they also support diverse wildlife assemblages and are crucial for biodiversity conservation. As rangelands around the world have become increas-ingly degraded and fragmented, rethinking farming practice in these landscapes is vital for achieving conserva-tion goals, rangeland recovery, and food security. An example is reinstating livestock shepherding, which aims to recouple grazing regimes to vegetation conditioned to semi-arid climates and improve productivity by reduc-ing overgrazing and rewiring past ecological functions. Tracking the large-scale ecosystem responses to shifts in land management in such sparsely vegetated environments have so far proven elusive. Therefore, our goal was to develop a remote tracking method capable of detecting vegetation changes and environmental responses on rangeland farms engaging in contrasting farming practices in South Africa: wildlife friendly farming (WFF) implementing livestock shepherding with wildlife protection, or rotational grazing livestock farming with wild-life removal. To do so, we ground-truthed Sentinel-2 satellite imagery using drone imagery and machine learning methods to trace historical vegetation change on four farms over a four-year period. First, we successfully classi-fied land cover maps cover using drone footage and modelled vegetation cover using satellite vegetation indices, achieving 93.4% accuracy (k = 0.901) and an r-squared of 0.862 (RMSE = 0.058) respectively. We then used this model to compare the WFF farm to three neighbouring rotational grazing farms, finding that satellite-derived vegetation productivity was greater and responded more strongly to rainfall events on the WFF farm. Furthermore, vegetation cover and grass cover, patch size, and aggregation were greater on the WFF farm when classified using drone data. Overall, we found that remotely assessing regional environmental benefits from contrasting farming practices in rangeland ecosystems could aid further adoption of wildlife-friendly practices and help to assess the generality of this case study.

TI  - A new method of extracting built-up area based on multi-source remote sensing data: a case study of Baoding central city, China
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate extraction of Built-Up Areas (BUAs) is of great significance for analysing urban spatial evolution patterns. In this study, we proposed a new method for high-precision extraction of BUA based on multi-source remote sensing data. Firstly, Built-Up Area Extraction Index (BAEI) was used to preliminarily identify the BUA based on Landsat 8 imagery. Secondly, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was used for improving the extraction precision of BUA, whose selected training sample was established on the Nighttime Light (NTL) data. Then, images fusion and continuity correction were carried out. Finally, the Neighbourhood Statistics Analysis (NSA) was used to adjust and remove the part of the non-urban centre which was misjudged as the BUA. Our results show that this method has better performance on both overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient compared with other classic methods, which provides empirical reference for understanding law of land expansion and rational land planning.

TI  - Multisensor fusion of remotely sensed vegetation indices using space-time dynamic linear models
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatiotemporal resolution maps of surface vegetation from remote sensing data are desirable for vegetation and disturbance monitoring. However, due to the current limitations of imaging spectrometers, remote sensing datasets of vegetation with high temporal frequency of measurements have lower spatial resolution, and vice versa. In this research, we propose a space-time dynamic linear model to fuse high temporal frequency data (MODIS) with high spatial resolution data (Landsat) to create high spatiotemporal resolution data products of a vegetation greenness index. The model incorporates the spatial misalignment of the data and models dependence within and across land cover types with a latent multivariate Matern process. To handle the large size of the data, we introduce a fast estimation procedure and a moving window Kalman smoother to produce a daily, 30-m resolution data product with associated uncertainty.

TI  - Demonstrating critically reflexive ICT4D project conduct in rural South Africa
T2  - INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem with many ICT4D projects designed for African developmental contexts is that there is a tendency towards deterministic assumptions, in that arguments and implementation guidelines are often presented a-contextually. The reality of the author's lived experience, however, was that ICT4D practices in the African context imply cross-cultural working and worldview collisions. Simply adopting Western values and advice wholesale without adequate reflection, may lead to a design-reality gap, oppressive ICT transfer, and ultimately failure. Understanding cultural context and local development realities may present challenges, because it is interwoven with the assumptions and prejudices of those identifying and representing context from the outside. While there are attempts at addressing these issues, more nuanced examples adequately sensitized to ethical reasoning, insider knowledge, and power dynamics in cross-cultural working, are needed. This paper reflects on how a critical ethnography informed and transformed ICT4D project practices for the developmental realities of a traditional Zulu community in South Africa. Confessional narratives, representing both method and phenomena, are used as case analogies for outsider researchers and practitioners to draw on, firstly; to self-reflect on their own false consciousness and misguided assumptions, and secondly; to make sense of the typical abstractness of ICT4D project guidance and principles.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an optimal integration of multi-sensor datasets, including Advanced Spaceborne Thermal and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), Sentinel-1, and digital elevation model for lithological classification using Machine Learning Models (MLMs). Different input features such as spectral, spectral and transformed spectral, spectral and morphological, spectral and textural, and optimum hybrid features were derived and evaluated to accurately classify different rock types found in the Chhatarpur district (Madhya Pradesh), India using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). The SVM achieves better classification accuracy and shows less sensitivity to the number of samples used in model development. The optimum hybrid features outperform other input features with an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 77.78% and 0.74, which is around 15% higher as obtained using ASTER spectral data alone. Thus, the proposed multi-sensor optimal integration approach is recommended for successful lithological classification using MLMs.

TI  - Prevention of Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Tremendous progress has been made over the past several decades in the treatment of breast cancer. Mortality and recurrence rates continue to decline. Our ability to tailor patient- and tumor-specific treatments has rapidly advanced. The vast majority of our patients can safely have breast conservation. Unfortunately, for many patients, survivorship is burdened by ongoing quality-of-life issues. Most breast cancer patients are asymptomatic at presentation, and the onus is on us to preser ve this. Surgery, radiation, and systemic therapy can result in long-term toxicities that can be amplified with multimodality approaches. We must strive to apply minimally effective therapies rather than a maximally tolerated approach. Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a particularly dreaded chronic complication. This review strives to give the reader a better understanding of BCRL and shed light on wisely choosing an integration of treatment modalities that minimizes BCRL risk. Key literature on emerging concepts is highlighted. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban fringe is areas where land use changes and develops rapidly, analyzing land use changes and driving forces in urban fringe area is of great significance for landscape pattern and ecological environment construction. This study takes the Hunhe Bird Island area of Shenyang City as the research object, uses Landsat remote sensing images from 2005 to 2019 as the basic data, and uses the land transfer matrix and landscape index method to analyze the overall landscape environment and six land types. Using government policies and statistical data to analyze the driving forces of landscape changes. The research results show that the landscape matrix had changed, the overall landscape structure had changed drastically, the ecological environment was unstable, and human interference factors had increased, and the fragmentation phenomenon had become more and more serious. Each land type has different environmental changes. Except for the relatively stable water environment, other land types have different degrees of fragmentation. The reason is that the driving force of landscape pattern changes mainly comes from the influence of human factors, which is closely related to population, economic development and government policies. Therefore, future development and protection strategies are proposed for each land type in the urban fringe area. For the overall development of urban fringe area, it is advocated to make full use of land resources, strengthen the correct judgment and forecast of urban population and economy, formulate the correct urban boundary strategy for sustainable development, avoid the ecological environment problems faced by excessive land development, and realize the "Rational expansion" of cities.

TI  - The recovery and repatriation of the remains of Japanese war dead and the roles of physical anthropologists
T2  - FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - During and after World War II, around 2.4 million Japanese died overseas. The bodies of nearly half of them are still missing as they remain in the field where they fell and have never been repatriated. The tasks of recovering and repatriating the remains of Japanese war dead started in 1953 by the former Ministry of Health and Welfare, and are now carried out by the Social Welfare and War Victims' Relief Bureau of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW). In 2016, the "Act on Promoting the Recovery of the Remains of Japanese War Dead (Act No. 12 of 2016)" was enacted. The Act designates Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 (from April 2016 to March 2017) to FY 2024 as the period of intensive implementation and stipulates that the state shall establish a process to promote the identification of the war dead. In line with this Act, physical anthropologists were employed as full-time experts by the MHLW to conduct scientific analysis on the remains in the field, and since then, they have accompanied all overseas delegations for repatriation. The authors of this paper have been sent to the sites in the partner countries overseas such as the former Soviet Union, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands, and nationally to Ioto (Iwo Jima) to analyze the minimum number of individuals (MNI), ancestry, age at death, and sex of the remains. Along with the morphological investigations, DNA analyses of mitochondrial polymorphism and Y-chromosomal/autosomal short tandem repeat (STR) have been applied for estimation of the ancestry and identification of the individual. By narrowing down the possible candidates based on the historical records such as name list of the missing, if individual identification of the remains is achieved, the remains are returned to the be-reaved families, and if not, they are placed in the Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery in Tokyo to rest in peace. Also, the implementation of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses with next generation sequencing (NGS) for ancestry is under discussion. This paper provides an overview of the process of recovery and identification of the missing bodies from World War II in Japan. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Evolution and application of digital technologies to predict crop type and crop phenology in agriculture
T2  - IN SILICO PLANTS
M3  - Review
AB  - The downside risk of crop production affects the entire supply chain of the agricultural industry nationally and globally. This also has a profound impact on food security, and thus livelihoods, in many parts of the world. The advent of high temporal, spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing platforms, specifically during the last 5 years, and the advancement in software pipelines and cloud computing have resulted in the collating, analysing and application of 'BIG DATA' systems, especially in agriculture. Furthermore, the application of traditional and novel computational and machine learning approaches is assisting in resolving complex interactions, to reveal components of ecophysiological systems that were previously deemed either 'too difficult' to solve or 'unseen'. In this review, digital technologies encompass mathematical, computational, proximal and remote sensing technologies. Here, we review the current state of digital technologies and their application in broad-acre cropping systems globally and in Australia. More specifically, we discuss the advances in (i) remote sensing platforms, (ii) machine learning approaches to discriminate between crops and (iii) the prediction of crop phenological stages from both sensing and crop simulation systems for major Australian winter crops. An integrated solution is proposed to allow accurate development, validation and scalability of predictive tools for crop phenology mapping at within-field scales, across extensive cropping areas.

TI  - Enhanced spatiotemporal heterogeneity and the climatic and biotic controls of autumn phenology in northern grasslands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the response of grassland phenology towards climatic factors is essential to improve our understanding of ecological processes under global warming. To date, however, it remains unclear how climate change and associated changes in vegetation dynamics might affect autumn phenology of grasslands at the global scale. In this study, the trends in start of growing season (SOS) and end of growing season (EOS) dates were explored using remote sensing data (1981-2014). The responses of EOS to preseason temperature, rainfall, SOS, and net primary productivity (NPP) were then investigated for the mid-latitude (30 degrees N similar to 55 degrees N) grasslands of the Northern Hemisphere. The remotely-sensed SOS/EOS and PhenoCam-based SOS/EOS were first compared and a good correlation was observed. Trend analysis revealed that the time span of SOS/EOS (from the earliest SOS/EOS to the last SOS/EOS) and the growing season length (from SOS to EOS) have extended for the entire study region. Furthermore, a forward shift in all SOS pixels was observed in Central-West Asian grasslands, whereas no such significant trend was observed for North American grasslands and East Asian grasslands. The duration of EOS completion had shortened within North American grasslands but lengthened in Asian grasslands. Next, correlation analysis uncovered a stronger relationship between EOS and previous rainfall than between EOS and temperature, indicating the key role of water availability in controlling autumn phenology. The sensitivity of EOS to both temperature and rainfall was higher in drier and warmer locations. Moreover, a significant negative correlation between EOS and SOS was observed in part of the study region, but no significant relationship between NPP and EOS was observed. Overall, this study highlights the spatially intensified heterogeneity of spring and autumn phenology in northern grasslands and that climatic changes in precipitation might act as key drivers for modifying autumn phenology of grassland vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere.

TI  - Increasing canopy mortality affects the future demographic structure of Europe's forests
T2  - ONE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing tree mortality can have pervasive impacts on forest dynamics. Yet, large-scale trends in tree mortality and their effects on forest demography remain poorly quantified despite the important role of forest demography for forest carbon pools and biodiversity. Analyzing satellite data at 19,896 plots, we here show that canopy mortality in 35 European countries increased from 1985 to 2018 (+1.5% +/- 0.28% yr(-1)). Using simulations, we demonstrate that recent levels of canopy mortality will halt the aging trend of Europe's forests and that a further increase in canopy mortality has the potential to strongly alter Europe's forest demography toward younger forests. These demographic changes will have cascading negative effects on forest biodiversity and carbon storage. Developing strategies to address the increasing canopy mortality should thus be a key priority of forest policy and management in Europe.

TI  - Malignant Cutaneous Adnexal Tumors and Role of SLNB
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malignant cutaneous adnexal tumors (MCATs) are rare and their natural history is poorly understood. Available literature indicates aggressive behavior with a significant risk of metastasis.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of our institutional surgical oncology databases was performed for patients diagnosed with MCATs (2001-2020). We hypothesized that most patients have a low risk of lymph node involvement, recurrence, and death. Kaplan-Meier statistical analysis was used to assess risk of recurrence and 5-year survival.RESULTS: We identified 41 patients diagnosed with MCATs (median age 59 years, 68% were men). Most patients had long-standing cutaneous lesions (median 24 months) and no palpable adenopathy. Most patients had stage I or II disease (98%). Primary tumors were treated with wide local excision (n = 28 [68%]), Mohs surgery (n = 5 [12%]), or amputation (n = 8 [19%]). Of 25 patients who underwent SLNB (61%), 1 had lymphatic metastasis. These include apocrine carcinoma (1 of 3), digital papillary adenocarcinoma (0 of 8), porocarcinoma (0 of 4), and additional MCAT sub-types (0 of 10). Three patients (7%) had disease recurrence at a median interval of 3.6 years (interquartile range 1.5 to 4.4 years). Five patients (12%) died at a median interval of 7 years (interquartile range 6.7 to 9.2 years), but only 1 patient was known to have succumbed to MCAT. Overall 5-year survival rate was 96% (95% CI, 75% to 99%).CONCLUSIONS: Despite the historical impression that MCATs have a high metastatic potential, most patients have low recurrence rates and excellent 5-year survival rates. Lymphatic disease identified after SLNB in early-stage tumors is rare and the value of this staging procedure in MCAT remains unclear.

TI  - The Role of Field Survey in the Identification of Farmland Abandonment in Slovakia Using Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land abandonment is a dynamic process characterized by both significant spectral variability and spectral similarity to areas of agricultural land. The identification of abandoned agricultural land (AAL) based on remote sensing data must be preceded by field surveys that are focused on the acquisition of the physiognomic characteristics (the composition of species, height of vegetation, textures, and clustering into patterns) of these areas. This study aims to document the physiognomic and spectral differences between AAL and other land cover/land use classes in Slovakia. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from Sentinel-2 time series for vegetation from April to September 2018, was applied. NDVI values were calculated for each Sentinel-2 scene, and NDVI profiles for selected samples were used to create phenological profiles for each AAL and land cover/land use class. The dispersion of the NDVI values for these classes, their median, and the root mean square error between NDVI data show that overgrowth by herbaceous plants is characterized by more significant dynamics (0.40-0.75), resulting in better spectral discriminability than classes overgrown by shrubs and trees (0.70-0.80). Field survey data are a fundamental prerequisite for the correct explanation of the discriminability of these AAL classes.

TI  - Comprehensive evaluation of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reanalysis against independent observations: Reactive gases
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) is operationally providing forecast and reanalysis products of air quality and atmospheric composition. In this article, we present an extended evaluation of the CAMS global reanalysis data set of four reactive gases, namely, ozone (O-3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and formaldehyde (HCHO), using multiple independent observations. Our results show that the CAMS model system mostly provides a stable and accurate representation of the global distribution of reactive gases over time. Our findings highlight the crucial impact of satellite data assimilation and emissions, investigated through comparison with a model run without assimilated data. Stratospheric and tropospheric O-3 are mostly well constrained by the data assimilation, except over Antarctica after 2012/2013 due to changes in the assimilated data. Challenges remain for O-3 in the Tropics and high-latitude regions during winter and spring. At the surface and for short-lived species (NO2), data assimilation is less effective. Total column CO in the CAMS reanalysis is well constrained by the assimilated satellite data. The control run, however, shows large overestimations of total column CO in the Southern Hemisphere and larger year-to-year variability in all regions. Concerning the long-term stability of the CAMS model, we note drifts in the time series of biases for surface O-3 and CO in the Northern midlatitudes and Tropics and for NO2 over East Asia, which point to biased emissions. Compared to the previous Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate reanalysis, changes in the CAMS chemistry module and assimilation system helped to reduce biases and enhance the long-term temporal consistency of model results for the CAMS reanalysis.

TI  - A black hole particle swarm optimization method for the source parameters inversion: application to the 2015 Calbuco eruption, Chile
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The traditional genetic algorithm and simulated annealing methods have been widely used in geophysical modeling. However, these nonlinear inversion methods require a lot of calculations, many control parameters and are unstable. In this paper, a particle swarm optimization algorithm combined with black hole strategy (BH-PSO) is proposed to solve these problems. The comprehensive experiments show that the BH-PSO method consumes less time than the simulated annealing (SA) method and has a higher accuracy than the genetic algorithm (GA). It is more applicable to the inversion of parameters of volcanic magma chamber, and easier to be generalized to other kinematic source parameters inversion. Based on BH-PSO method, Sentinel-1 data, composite dislocation model (CDM), Yang model and Mogi model, the magma chamber parameters of Calbuco eruption in 2015 were retrieved. The results show that the RMSE of CDM model is 1.1 cm, which can better fit the surface deformation than the Mogi model and Yang model. The final results show that the magma chamber is located about 0.8 km northeast of the crater, about 9 km below the surface, and the total volume of the erupted volcanic material obtained with the CDM Model is of 0.209 km(3), without considering dense rock equivalent.

TI  - <i>Enskilment</i>: an Ecological-Anthropological Worldview of Skill, Learning and Education in Sport
T2  - SPORTS MEDICINE-OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper is to explore a different, more relational worldview of skill, learning and education in sport. To do this, we turn to the work of social anthropologist, Tim Ingold, leaning on the notion of enskilment, which proposes that learning is inseparable from doing and place. From this worldview, what is learned is not an established body of knowledge, transmitted into the mind of a passive recipient from an authorised being, but is a progressively deepening embodied-embedded attentiveness, where an individual learns to self-regulate by becoming more responsive to people and environmental features by 'looking, listening and feeling'. As we discuss, Ingold's perspectives on enskilment are rooted in the etymological connotations of education-ex-ducere, which roughly means 'to lead out'. In applying this notion to sport, we unpack three of its entangled components, taskscapes, guided attention, and wayfinding, detailing the implications of each for the growth of enskilled sports performers. To promote the translation of these ideas, in addition to encouraging their inquiry beyond the scope of what is discussed here, sporting examples are threaded throughout the paper.

M3  - Review
AB  - Background: There has been a greater call for greener and eco-friendly processes and bioproducts to meet the 2030's core agenda on 17 global sustainable development goals. The challenge lies in incorporating systems thinking with a comprehensive worldview as a guiding principle to develop the economy, whilst taking cognisance of the need to safeguard the environment, and to embrace the socio-cultural diversity dimension as an equal component. Any discussion on climate change, destruction of eco-system and habitat for wildlife, poverty and starvation, and the spread of infectious diseases, must be addressed together with the emphasis on the development of cleaner energy, air and water, better management of resources and biodiversity, improved agro-practices for food production and distribution, and affordable health care, as the outcomes and key performance indicators to be evaluated. Strict regulation, monitoring and enforcement to minimize emission, pollution and wastage must also be put in place.Conclusion: This review article focuses on the research and development efforts to achieve sustainable bioenergy production, environmental remediation, and transformation of agro-materials into value-added bioproducts through the integrated algal and oil palm biorefinery. Recent development in microalgal research with nanotechnology as anti-cancer and antimicrobial agents and for biopharmaceutical applications are discussed. The life-cycle analysis in the context of palm oil mill processes is evaluated. The way forward from this integrated biorefinery concept is to strive for inclusive development strategies, and to address the immediate and pressing problems facing the Planet and the People, whilst still reaping the Profit.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Nile rose or water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is an aquatic species threaten socio-economic and ecological systems, by invading freshwater ecosystems, affecting their productivity and functionality, as well as causing unfixable damage to key hydrological processes. Spectral signature differences can play a common role through using remote identification for these invasive plants, by using hyperspectral data, while many other studies showed that textural and phrenological differences are also can be considered as an effective strategy in this critical problem. New generation sensors like Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 sensors of recently launched crop with improved sensing characteristics, unlike the previous broadband multispectral sensors has been provided untapped prospective alternatives. New insights were introduced in the detecting, mapping, and monitoring the spread of Nile Rose aquatic plant in the Tigris River at Wasit province in Iraq which has caused damage to fishing nets and make it difficult for fishermen to paddle on the river. Vegetation indices have been used to assess the impacts on major socio-economic activities in the study area. Spectral reflectance of Landsat 8 operational land imager OLI (acquired at Oct 6, 2016) was used to differentiate the spectral signature of the water hyacinth from other plants. These indices recorded the highest reflection of the Nile Rose plant relative to the rest of the plants. The result showed that the green Chlorophyll Index (CL Green) with overall accuracy of 89% which proved that this study has established a promising method for monitoring the invasion of the Nile Rose in the Tigris River to insure the availability of safe drinking water as a main source for the people such as in the study area nearby the part of Tigris River.

TI  - Instance segmentation of center pivot irrigation systems using multi-temporal SENTINEL-1 SAR images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The mapping of Center Pivot Irrigation Systems (CPIS) is essential for agricultural and water resource management. In this context, methods based on Deep Learning (DL) have reached state-of-the-art in the classification of remote sensing images. However, the mapping of CPIS with DL is still restricted to optical images with limitations in tropical environments due to the extensive cloud cover for long periods. The present research proposes the detection of CPIS using instance segmentation from multi-temporal SAR images that are cloud-free. The research developed a CPIS database for the Cerrado biome based on visual interpretation, totaling 3675 instances in the Common Objects in Context (COCO) annotation format. The training used the Mask-RCNN with the ResNeXt-101-32x8d backbone considering different data arrangements: (a) variation in the number of Sentinel-1 temporal images with an interval of 12 days (from 1 to 11 images), and (b) comparison of VV, VH, and VV + VH polarizations. For mapping large areas, we applied mosaicking with a sliding window technique. The results show an accuracy improvement with the increase in the number of temporal images, reaching a difference greater than 15% AP when comparing a single temporal image with the optimal number of temporal images in the VV (eight), VH (ten) and VV + VH (nine) polarizations. The combined use of the two polarizations (VV + VH) had slightly better results (75% AP, 91% AP50, and 86% AP75) than the others. However, VV polarization may have an advantage, obtaining close results from less image and computational cost. The instance segmentation with the sliding window provides the automatic identification of different objects belonging to the same class in large areas, allowing the total CPIS count and the size calculation.

TI  - Ecological Niche Modeling and Status of Threatened Alpine Medicinal Plant <i>Dactylorhiza Hatagirea</i> D.Don in Western Himalaya
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Medicinal plants are known for their traditional and modern medicinal values to treat health disorders. Dactylorhiza hatagirea (known as Hattajari and Salampanja) is one of these medicinal plants, which is highly praised and valued medicinal plant in alpine regions. The plant has been widely used by the local inhabitants for treating various ailments due to which its demand has increased in the herbal industries. The present study evaluates the distribution and threat status using extensive field surveys and MaxEnt computer package. The distribution was assessed using environmental variables derived from WorldClim data set and slope, aspect, elevation, drainage, soil, geomorphology, land use/land cover (derived from IRS Landsat-8), and 53 well-dispersed field and literature survey species occurrence points. Phyto-sociological information collected using Rapid Mapping Exercise (RME) (50 transects of 500 m in length, each transect having four plots of 1 x 1 m in size at every 50 m distance in east, west, north, and south direction, with a total of 40 plots in one transect) were laid in 26 population sites. The results reveal that the highly suitable habitat of D. hatagirea is only similar to 177.13 km(2) where the species ranges between 0.1 and 2.2 individual/m(2) in the alpine regions of Uttarakhand Himalaya. However, about 740 km(2) area was found less suitable. Mean diurnal range, aspect, and slope were the most predictor variables for the species occurrence. The collection for domestic use, trade, and habitat loss due to excessive grazing by the heavy-bodied animal was recorded as the major reasons behind the population decline of this medicinally important plant. These findings assist in the identification of new populating and suitable areas for monitoring and in-situ conservation using field survey and range of environment factors that determine the distribution of species.

TI  - An Emergency Department Clinical Algorithm to Increase Early Palliative Care Consultation: Pilot Project
T2  - JOURNAL OF PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The emergency department (ED) is a primary entry point of hospitals but does not have a system to identify and consult palliative care (PC) early in patients who meet criteria.Objectives: To determine the measurable effects of an ED PC consultation on patients who meet criteria, hypothesizing that ED PC consultation would lead to decreased average length of stay (ALOS), average direct cost per patient, decreased number of surgeries, and radiological tests performed per patient.Materials and Methods: A physician-led data-driven evidence-based algorithm was designed and piloted with implementation in two hospitals during January-March 2019 in Orlando, FL. A retrospective review of health record data was completed, comparing patients receiving PC consultation ordered in the ED versus those ordered after admission.Results: ED patients (n = 662) met PC criteria. PC consultation was ordered in ED for 80 (12.1%) cases. The following outcomes were lower for patients who received ED PC consultation than those who did not: ALOS by 6.4 days (6.74 vs. 13.14 days; p < 0.001), in-hospital mortality (12.5% vs. 19.1%; p = 0.11), surgery (11% vs. 37%; p < 0.01), radiological tests per patient (4.01 vs. 10.57; p < 0.001), and average direct cost per patient ($7,193 vs. $22,354). However, 30-day hospital revisit rates were relatively higher in those who did receive ED PC consultation than those who did not (20% vs. 13% p = 0.15).Conclusions: In this pilot project, PC patients can be identified in the ED with an algorithm that leads to earlier consultation and improved patient outcomes. Larger research trials are needed to replicate this strategy and results.

TI  - Reducing hydrological modelling uncertainty by using MODIS snow cover data and a topography-based distribution function snowmelt model
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This work introduces a general multi-objective parameter estimation framework to exploit MODIS-based snow cover maps to reduce predictive streamflow uncertainty in snow-dominated catchments. The well-known GLUE methodology is applied with a multi-objective approach, combining streamflow observations recorded at the outlet section and satellite-derived snow cover maps, aggregated to fractional values of the catchment area. The hydrological model used in this study includes a snowpack routine which exploits a statistical representation of the distribution of clear sky potential solar radiation - a significant advantage when parameter sensitivity and uncertainty estimation procedures are carried out. The study provides an assessment of this approach based on operational quality data from two medium-size mountainous basins (a nested one included in a larger parent basin) located in the eastern Italian Alps. The nested basin is considered as ungauged, thus allowing a spatial assessment of the multi-objective approach. Results show a positive feedback between streamflow and snow cover area likelihoods, highlighted by means of the Pareto plot. Moreover, a better identifiability of the parameters driving snowmelt rate is found and consequently a shrink of the predictive streamflow uncertainty is observed. A containing ratio of 0.54 and a mean sharpness of 0.11 are found at the outlet of the parent basin, while a containing ratio equal to 0.65 and a mean sharpness equal to 0.17 are estimated at the nested basin, used as a validation test. These results confirm the potential of MODIS snow cover maps as additional data to inform hydrological models leading to more reliable and sharper streamflow simulations. This approach might be also appealing when streamflow simulations are required for ungauged basins.

TI  - Variations of Colored Dissolved Organic Matter in the Mandovi Estuary, Goa, During Spring Inter-Monsoon: A Comparison With COVID-19 Outbreak Imposed Lockdown Period
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is one of the important fractions of dissolved organic matter (DOM) that controls the availability of light in water and plays a crucial role in the cycling of carbon. High CDOM absorption in the Mandovi Estuary (Goa) during spring inter-monsoon (SIM) is largely driven by both in-situ production and anthropogenic activities. Here we have presented the CDOM variation in the estuary during SIM of 2014-2018 and compared it with that of 2020 when the COVID-19 outbreak imposed lockdown was implemented. During 2020, low CDOM absorption was observed at the mid-stream of the estuary as compared to the previous years, which could be attributed to low autochthonous production and less input from anthropogenic activities. On the other hand, high CDOM observed at the mouth during 2020 is linked to autochthonous production, as seen from the high concentrations of chlorophyll a. High CDOM in the upstream region could be due to both autochthonous production and terrestrially derived organic matter. Sentinel-2 satellite data was also used to look at the variations of CDOM in the study region which is consistent with in-situ observations. Apart from this, the concentration of nutrients (NO3-, NH4+, and SiO44-) in 2020 was also low compared to the previous reports. Hence, our study clearly showed the impact of anthropogenic activities on CDOM build-up and nutrients, as the COVID-19 imposed lockdown drastically controlled such activities in the estuary.

TI  - Risk of Severe Abnormal Uterine Bleeding Associated with Rivaroxaban Compared with Apixaban, Dabigatran and Warfarin
T2  - DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction There have been reports of clinically relevant uterine bleeding events among women of reproductive age exposed to rivaroxaban. Objective The aim of this study was to compare the risk of severe abnormal uterine bleeding (SAUB) resulting in transfusion or surgical intervention among women on rivaroxaban versus apixaban, dabigatran and warfarin. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study in the FDA's Sentinel System (10/2010-09/2015) among females aged 18+ years with venous thromboembolism (VTE), or atrial flutter/fibrillation (AF) who newly initiated a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC; rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran) or warfarin. We followed women from dispensing date until the earliest of transfusion or surgery following vaginal bleeding, disenrollment, exposure or study end date, or recorded death. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox proportional hazards regression via propensity score stratification. Four pairwise comparisons were conducted for each intervention. Results Overall, there was an increased risk of surgical intervention with rivaroxaban when compared with dabigatran (HR 1.19; 95% CI 1.03-1.38), apixaban (1.23; 1.04-1.47), and warfarin (1.34; 1.22-1.47). No difference in risk for surgical intervention was observed for dabigatran-apixaban comparisons. Increased risk of transfusion was observed for rivaroxaban compared with dabigatran (1.49; 1.03-2.17) only. For patients with no gynecological history, rivaroxaban was associated with risk of surgical intervention compared with dabigatran (1.22; 1.05-1.42), apixaban (1.25; 1.04-1.49), and warfarin (1.36; 1.23-1.50). Conclusion Our study found increased SAUB risk with rivaroxaban use compared with other DOACs or warfarin. Increased risk with rivaroxaban was present among women without underlying gynecological conditions. Women on anticoagulant therapy should be aware of a risk of SAUB.

TI  - Variability of NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over China and effect on air quality derived from satellite and ground-based observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The variation of NO2 concentrations in mainland China is analyzed on different timescales, from decadal to weekly, using both satellite data and data from ground-based monitoring networks. TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) data were used to study the spatial variations of tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (TVCDs) over the study area during 16-20 weeks after the Chinese Spring Festival (25 January 2020). These data were used to select 11 regions for more detailed analysis of the variation of NO2 TVCDs on a decadal timescale. In this analysis, monthly and annual averaged NO2 TVCDs derived from OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) observations were used for the years 2011 to 2019. The results show the NO2 TVCD trends for different regions, all decreasing in response to emission reduction policies but with a different onset and a possible halt of the decrease in recent years; trends and period in the south of the study area are different from those in the north. Variations of NO2 TVCDs on shorter timescales, monthly and weekly, were analyzed using TROPOMI data. In addition, the variations of weekly-averaged ground-based NO2 concentrations in 11 major cities were analyzed together with those for O-3 and PM2.5. In particular these data were used to determine their effect on the air quality as expressed by the air quality index (AQI). For quantitative estimates, the use of weekly concentrations is more accurate than the use of monthly values, and the effects of long-term trends and their reversal needs to be taken into account for the separation of effects of the lockdown and the Spring Festival. Neglecting the possible reversal of the trends leads to overestimation of the lockdown effect in the south and underestimation in the north. The ground-based data confirm earlier reports, based on satellite observations, that the expected improvement of air quality due to the reduction of NO2 concentrations was offset by the increase of the concentrations of O-3 and the different effects of the lockdown measures on PM2.5, as well as effects of meteorological influences and heterogeneous chemistry. The AQI seems to be mostly influenced by PM2.5 rather than NO2. A qualitative comparison between time series of satellite and ground-based NO2 observations shows both similarities and differences. The study further shows the different behaviors in city clusters in the north and south of China, as well as inland in the Sichuan and Guanzhong basins. Effects of other holidays and events are small, except in Beijing where the air quality in 2020 was notably better than in previous years. This study was undertaken for China, but the methodology and results have consequences for air quality studies in other areas, and part of the conclusions are generally applicable.

TI  - Early prediction of the seed yield in winter oilseed rape based on the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv)
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Demands for rape seeds oil rapidly increase in recent years. The empirical model based on the remotely sensed data provides an efficient approach to predict the rapeseed yield at small scale. The vegetation indices (VIs) derived from the remotely sensed data at the stage of the peak leaf area index (LAI) are usually the main determinant of the empirical model. The LAI of oilseed rape reaches the peak during the flowering stage. However, yellow flowers elevate the reflectance in the red band, making it difficult to capture the maximum LAI with the commonly-used VIs, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This study tested the hypothesis that the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) may be more sensitive to the LAI in the oilseed rape throughout different growth stages, particularly in the flowering stage, and thus may provide more accurate early prediction of the rapeseed yield as well as the above-ground dry mass (DM). In addition, a random forest (RF) regression model based on the multi-stage NIRv was built to predict the rapeseed yield. Three small-plot experiments with different nitrogen and potassium fertilizer treatments were conducted at two sites in Hubei province, China. NIRv and the studied VIs were derived from multi-spectral images captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle. NIRv was calculated with the DN values (NIRv_DN) and the reflectance values (NIRv_refl) of the near-infrared band separately. Results demonstrated that NIRv_DN and NIRv_refl were strongly and consistently correlated with the LAI before the flowering stage and in the flowering stage. In comparison, the relationships between the studied VIs and LAI in the flowering stage deviated from the relationships of all growth stages. The NIRv features and VIs were all significantly correlated with the above-ground DM, but the DM estimation by NIRv_DN had a lower RMSE value. The NIRv_DN and NIRv_refl in the flowering stage showed the strongest correlation with the rapeseed yield (Cali_ R2 = 0.74 and Vali_RMSE = 389.84 kg/ha for NIRv_DN; Cali_ R2 = 0.73 and Vali_RMSE = 410.85 kg/ha for NIRv_refl). The NIRv_DN, NIRv_refl, and the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) in the budding stage were also strongly correlated with the rapeseed yield. The variable importance score derived from the RF model corroborated the significant contribution of the NIRv in the flowering and budding stage to the yield prediction. The RF model using the NIRv_DN in the flowering and budding stage achieved the high accuracy of the rapeseed yield prediction (Cali_ R2 = 0.91, Cali_RMSE = 248.48 kg/ha, and Vali_RMSE = 282.44 kg/ha). Results from this research demonstrated the great potential of the NIRv in the flowering stage to provide the accurate early prediction of the rapeseed yield.

TI  - A CT-based Radiomics Model for Prediction of Lymph Node Metastasis in Early Stage Gastric Cancer
T2  - ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale and Objectives: To develop and validate a CT-based radiomics model for preoperative prediction of lymph node metastasis (LNM) in early stage gastric cancer (EGC).Materials and Methods: Four hundred and sixty-three consecutive EGC patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. Radiomics features were extracted from portal venous phase CT scans. A radiomics signature was built based on highly reproducible features using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method. The predictive performance of radiomics signature was tested in the training and testing cohorts. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to build a radiomics-based model combined radiomics signature and lymph node status according to CT. Performance of the model was determined by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness.Results: The radiomics signature comprised six robust features showed significant association with LNM in both cohorts. A radiomics model that incorporated radiomics signature and CT-reported lymph node status showed good calibration and discrimination in the training cohort (AUC = 0.91) and testing cohort (AUC = 0.89). Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical utility of this model.Conclusion: The CT-based radiomics model showed favorable accuracy for prediction of LNM in EGC and may help to improve clinical decision-making.

TI  - Survey of artificial intelligence approaches in the study of anthropogenic impacts on symbiotic organisms - a holistic view
T2  - SYMBIOSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are successfully used to investigate several biological problems. The present survey of the literature is aimed at identifying the applications of AI methods (machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision) to symbiotic organisms including the associations of both macro and microorganisms. It was relevant to extend this review to applications in metagenomic and image data analysis, those being the dominant methods in the study of environmental impacts to symbiosis. The survey involved 161 papers from 2020-2021to draw conclusions. This analysis revealed that the application of AI methods is crucial for both metagenomic and image data (camera and remote sensing data) analysis for taxon identification, interaction, and phenotyping, and biomonitoring studies in almost all symbiotic associations from bacteria, lichens to coral reefs. The survey further revealed that AI methods have been adopted for inferring the environmental impacts because they can overcome some of the difficulties associated with modelling highly dimensional and nonlinear environmental data with complex interactions. These methods proved to be especially useful if the sample size was small, has mixed data types, or missing values and can be applied to reduce computation time. Different supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms such as random forest, support vector machines, k-mers, etc. are being applied at every step in metagenomic data analysis, from the taxonomic assignment, binning to gene and functional annotation, and are gradually replacing the manual methods with automated AI-based annotation. Similarly, the applications of deep learning and computer vision algorithms e.g., convolutional neural network are progressing steadily towards automation of image annotation in the monitoring of marine and terrestrial symbiosis. However, before we can use these methods to their full potential in understanding the multidimensional effects of environmental factors including the impact of anthropogenic activities, there are several gap areas. For example, the identification of novel and cryptic species, limited reference databases, and big data challenges, need to be addressed with further research. There needs to be better communication between biologists and machine learning research communities so that good quality labelled data is generated in future experiments.

TI  - Quantifying ocean surface oil thickness using thermal remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal remote sensing has been used in assessing oil spills in the ocean, mostly based on empirical interpretations. This study designs a ground-based experiment to measure brightness temperatures (BTs) of oil-inwater (OW) emulsions with different concentrations and oil-free water as a function of time in 32 consecutive hours. Compared with a previous thermal experiment to measure oil slicks (i.e., non-emulsified oil) with different thicknesses and considering the similarity between oil slicks and water-in-oil (WO) emulsions, it is found that (1) the diurnal response of brightness temperature difference (BTD, between oil samples and oil-free sample) to oil emulsion types (OW or WO) is similar, making it difficult to classify oil emulsion types using thermal remote sensing; (2) in contrast, BTD under thermal balance during the optimal time window appears to be a function of equivalent oil thickness (EOT) (oil volume per area, mm) regardless of oil emulsion type, suggesting that EOT could be estimated from BTD. Application of such experimental results to Landsat imagery over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico suggests that although their ability to quantify oil footprint is limited, thermal data show potentials in providing unique information (e.g., estimating EOTs for up to 4 mm without the need of differentiating sub-pixel heterogeneity) to complement optical data in characterizing oil type and oil quantity when the spilled oil is thick (> 0.4 mm).

TI  - GIS-based hazard and vulnerability assessment of a torrential watershed
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Torrents are ephemeral streams which usually carry heavy bedload and flash flows. The frequent changes in its course caused by meandering and migration lead to extensive damage to environment in valley and alluvial land. In the present study, application programming interface (API) was developed to analyze temporal Landsat data in Google Earth Engine(GEE) to understand land use/land cover and vegetation characteristics in the Tangri (Dangri) River, India, and Indian Remote Sensing Satellites data were used for hazard and vulnerability assessment. It is observed that because of various conservation activities as well as due to watershed inhabitants' intervention, the areas under cropland, orchard/plantation and grass/scrub have increased. The monthly mean enhanced vegetation index (EVI) has also increased in the watershed. Although, the average annual soil loss is high, i.e., 40.4 t/ha/yr. It is highest for mountain physiographic unit (67.6 t/ha/yr.) and scrub forest (61.5 t/ha/yr.). Based on flood inundation modeling, it is estimated that for two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and hundred-year return periods, 1.42-16.14% areas of watershed are likely to get inundated. Torrents' vulnerability analysis was carried out using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to derive composite vulnerability index by aggregating weights of various parameters and sub-parameters. The alternatives for the treatment of vulnerable sections in torrential regime were evaluated using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and ELimination Et Choice Translating REality (ELECTRE) models. The methodology demonstrated has potential to analyze torrential systems and also for their proficient planning, monitoring and management.

TI  - Variability, predictability, and uncertainty in global aerosols inferred from gap-filled satellite observations and an econometric modeling approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series analyses and stochastic modeling assessments of aerosols are critical for climate change and human health studies. However, the precise characterization of the aerosol optical depth (AOD), its variability, trends, and predictability, and its associated uncertainty at the global scale is largely unexplored. In addition, gaps in satellite-retrieved AODs across space and time remain an obstacle to accurately revealing aerosol properties. This study uses MODIS Collection 6 AOD retrievals for a time series analysis and modeling of global aerosols from 2003 to 2015. Random forest (RF) regression is first applied to replace the missing data in the satellite AOD retrievals. AOD variations and trends are then investigated and future values are predicted using a Mann-Kendall analysis approach and an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, respectively. The results indicate that the developed RF model enhances the AOD data coverage significantly, with the root mean square error and mean absolute error statistical metrics well below 0.13 and 0.08, respectively. High AOD loadings are found over East, South, and Southwest Asia, West and Central Africa, and northern South America. Prominent discrepancies are shown in aerosol variations and trends likely because of dust emissions, biomass burning, fossil fuel combustion, and socioeconomic practices, which has significant implications for climate systems and mitigation policy-making. The ARIMA model delineates AOD features with clear annual and seasonal variations and with high accuracy over most regions. The performance of the model is jointly impacted by the data quality and data values. Overall, our study suggests the feasibility and applicability of the RF model in reconstructing area-scale satellite missing AOD retrievals, as well as the ability of the stochastic ARIMA model to accurately depict and forecast AOD profiles. The globally simulated and predicted aerosols will improve evaluations of aerosol effects for climate and epidemiological studies.

TI  - "ENCLOSURES WITH INCLUSION" VIS-A-VIS "BOUNDARIES" IN ANCIENT MEXICO
T2  - ANCIENT MESOAMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent in-depth research on the Nahua Corpus Xolotl, as well as on a large variety of compatible sources, has led to new insights on what were "boundaries" in preconquest Nahua thought. The present article proposes that our modern Western concept of borders and political boundaries was foreign to ancient Mexican societies and to Aztec-era polities in general. Consequently, the article aims to add a novel angle to our understanding of the notions of space, territoriality, and limits in the indigenous worldview in central Mexico during preconquest times, and their repercussions for the internal social and political relations that evolved within the Nahua-Acolhua ethnic states (altepetl). Furthermore, taking its cue from the Corpus Xolotl, the article reconsiders the validity of ethnic entities and polities in ancient Mexico and claims that many of these polities were ethnic and territorial amalgams, in which components of ethnic outsiders formed internal enclaves and powerbases. I argue that in ancient Mexico one is able to observe yet another kind of conceptualization of borders/frontiers: "enclosures with inclusion," which served as the indigenous concept of porous and inclusive boundaries, well up to the era of the formation of the so-called Triple Alliance, and beyond.

TI  - Towards a highly adaptive software-defined radio transmitter for small satellite platforms
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Institute of Space Systems (IRS) of the University of Stuttgart is currently analysing a mission to explore the inner Van Allen radiation belt using a small satellite of about 60 kg. The satellite shall be launched to an orbit of approximately 600 km and then use its orbital control system to reach an elliptical orbit of 330 km x 2500 km. In addition to the scientific mission goals, the mission shall demonstrate new components in the harsh radiation environment; these include an orbit control system using water-based propulsion, a highly integrated core avionic system and a ham radio X-Band data downlink system.The data downlink system for this mission is currently being developed at the IRS. Due to the highly elliptic final orbit, the need for an adaptive data downlink transmitter platform arises, that is capable of adapting its waveform to the current link conditions. Moreover, this transmitter shall be fully compliant with the Consultative Committee for Space Data System (CCSDS) recommendations for the physical and the data link layers while implementing the adaptive coding and modulation of the Digital Video Broadcast - Second Generation (DVB-52) standard.Furthermore, this development focusses on low-power consumption, use of commercial-off-the-shelf components, re-configurability and miniaturisation. The transmitter platform is based on a System on a Chip which implements the CCSDS as well as the DVB-52 protocol stacks. The analog components are chosen to provide possible scaling of the platform to commercial X-Band, K-u and K-a-Band. The transmitter is able to support data rates up to 200 Mbps and delivers up to 2 Watts RF power. The use of the DVB-52 standard allows to increase the downlink capacity by 66% using variable coding and modulation. An increase by 130% or even more is possible using adaptive coding and modulation.This adaptive platform is crucial for the mission success in order to transmit the high data volume, which could not be downlinked with a platform using a fixed waveform only. The increase in downlink capacity by adapting to the link conditions can also be useful for other missions, e.g. where ground terminals are located in regions with high rain loss or for satellite constellations where each satellite has limited ground station contact. The development of this transmitter platform that can be adapted in nearly-real time to the existing link conditions is presented in this paper.

TI  - Geodetic imaging of shallow creep along the Xianshuihe fault and its frictional properties
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Xianshuihe fault is one of the most tectonically active faults in the eastern Tibetan plateau. Understanding its slip behaviour and frictional properties is essential for determining the seismic potential. We use Sentinel-1A/B data from ascending and descending tracks to estimate the deformation field and retrieve three-dimensional velocities during the period of 2014-2019. We find that shallow creep is widely distributed along the entire Xianshuihe fault. Elastic dislocation modelling based on fault-parallel velocities reveals that the tectonic loading rate along the Xianshuihe fault is in the range of 8.8-17.9 mm/yr with a locking depth of 7.6-18.5 km. The shallow aseismic slip rate ranges from 3.3-7.8 mm/yr on the Daofu and Qianning segments, to 16.3-19.8 mm/yr on the western Kangding segment; the high aseismic slip rate on the western Kangding segment is likely due to postseismic relaxation of the 2014 Kangding M-w 5.6 and 5.9 earthquakes. The seismic moment accumulated on the Qianning segment since the last major event is equivalent to a M-w 6.6 earthquake. Analysis of the evolution of aseismic slip in the framework of rate-and-state friction shows that the Kangding segment has a much smaller (a-b) (0.0030) than the Daofu segment, (a-b) = 0.0162. The difference is potentially controlled by different rock types between the Kangding segment (granite) and other segments of the Xianshuihe fault (quartz-rich sandstone). (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Impact of soil water regimes and partial root-zone drying in field-grown papaya in semi-arid conditions
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate in the papaya Tainung genotype, the effects of partial root-zone drying (PRD) technique on soil water regimes by using different frequencies of shifting irrigation-side of plant row and the effects of PRD technique on (1) crop agronomic performance, (2) titratable fruit acidity (TA), (3) total soluble solids (TSS), and TSS/TA ratio. Also, we analyze the spatial dynamic of papaya condition using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from different satellite images. The study was conducted in the semi-arid region of Bahia (BA) and Minas Gerais (MG), Brazil. The combination of 100% (Full irrigation-FU), 50%, and 35% in the irrigation depth (WID) and frequencies of shifting plant-row side irrigation of 0 (Fixed Irrigation-FX), 7, 14, and 21 days were applied. Nine treatments were studied in BA and five in MG. The water available in the soil was reduced to 44% for frequencies of shifting plant-row side irrigation of 7 days, 50% for 14 days, and 85% for 21 days, compared to the soil water availability at field capacity. Partial water deficit in the soil through the PRD technique did not significantly reduce the total root length, effective root depth, and root effective horizontal distance of the papaya Tainung genotype. However, PRD treatments showed leaf abscission, which resulted in reduced leaf area and NDVI values, especially in the MG experiment. Papaya yield and fruit quality were not affected. However, except for PRD 21 35%, irrigation water depth reduced to 50 and 35% under PRD increased crop water productivity (CWP) in papaya plants. Thus, the PRD technique may save 35% of WID using the alternation of lateral shift irrigation of crop row every 7 days under water scarcity in semi-arid regions. The NDVI index was important to compare the papaya canopy vigor between the experimental areas studied. We also confirmed the potential of NDVI to monitor the vigor of papaya canopy, since we could notice the sensibility of NDVI to identify water stress in papaya in higher vapor pressure deficit (VPD) conditions occurred in October 2016 and January 2017 in Bom Jesus da Lapa-BA. Therefore, the PRD strategy can be a useful tool to save water in papaya cultivation under semi-arid conditions.

TI  - Human or natural? Landscape context improves the attribution of forest disturbances mapped from Landsat in Central Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbances have increased in Central Europe's forests, but whether changes in disturbance regimes are driven by natural or human causes remains unclear. Satellite-based remote sensing provides an important data source for quantifying forest disturbance change. Separating causes of forest disturbance is challenging, however, particularly in areas such as Central Europe where disturbance patches are small and disturbance agents interact strongly. Here we present a novel approach for the causal attribution of forest disturbance agents and illustrate its utility for 1.01 million disturbance patches mapped from Landsat data in Austria for the period 1986-2016. We gathered reference data on 2620 disturbance patches by conducting targeted field observations and structured interviews with 21 forest managers. We developed a novel indicator class characterizing the landscape context of a disturbance patch (i.e., the spatio-temporal autocorrelation of disturbance patches on the landscape), and combined it with other predictor variables describing the spectral signal, topography, and patch form of each disturbance patch. We used these predictors to identify the causal agents for disturbances mapped in Austria using Random Forest classification. Landscape context was the most important predictor of disturbance agent, improving model performance by up to 26 percentage points. Wind, bark beetles and timber harvesting were separated with an overall accuracy of 63%. Bark beetle patches were most difficult to identify correctly (producer's accuracy = 15%, user's accuracy = 30%), while regular timber harvesting was classified with highest certainty (producer's accuracy = 68%, user's accuracy = 82%). Harvesting dominates the disturbance regime of Austria's forests, with 70.5% of the disturbed area (76.7% of the disturbed patches) attributed to human causes and 29.5% (23.3%) to natural causes (wind: 23.0% [14.8%], bark beetles: 6.5% [8.5%]). Increases in disturbance since 1986 were driven by natural causes, with wind increasing by 408% and bark beetles increasing by 99% between the first and the second half of the observation period. Wind-disturbed patches were also considerably larger than those caused by bark beetles and harvesting (+102% and + 67%, respectively). Our novel approach to mapping causal agents of forest disturbance, applicable also to highly complex and interactive disturbance regimes, provides an important step towards a comprehensive monitoring and management of forest disturbances in a changing world.

TI  - cAMP Bursts Control T Cell Directionality by Actomyosin Cytoskeleton Remodeling
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - T lymphocyte migration is an essential step to mounting an efficient immune response. The rapid and random motility of these cells which favors their sentinel role is conditioned by chemokines as well as by the physical environment. Morphological changes, underlaid by dynamic actin cytoskeleton remodeling, are observed throughout migration but especially when the cell modifies its trajectory. However, the signaling cascade regulating the directional changes remains largely unknown. Using dynamic cell imaging, we investigated in this paper the signaling pathways involved in T cell directionality. We monitored cyclic adenosine 3 '-5 ' monosphosphate (cAMP) variation concomitantly with actomyosin distribution upon T lymphocyte migration and highlighted the fact that spontaneous bursts in cAMP starting from the leading edge, are sufficient to promote actomyosin redistribution triggering trajectory modification. Although cAMP is commonly considered as an immunosuppressive factor, our results suggest that, when transient, it rather favors the exploratory behavior of T cells.

TI  - Maize and sorghum field segregation using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data in central Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop segregation in optical remote sensing cannot always be easily achieved among similar species since their spectral response can be similar. We aimed to distinguish fields of two C4 gramineae with similar plant structure and crop calendar, maize (Zea mays) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), in an agricultural area of the state of Guanajuato, in central Mexico. One hundred and forty-three fields of these two crops were identified and their average spectral signatures were derived at different phenological stages, using digital information from 11 Sentinel 2A/B images, corresponding to the 2019 spring-summer cycle. We also calculated the temporal profile of six spectral indices for each crop, to evaluate seasonal variations and conducted a cropland classification, using the random forests algorithm and different combinations of dates and indices. Results show that segregation of maize and sorghum fields can be achieved due to small differences in the near-infrared region of their spectral signatures and disparities in the rate of decay during the senescence stage. Classification results also confirmed the separability of these two crops, obtaining a very high overall accuracy and kappa values (98.43% and 97.07%, correspondingly) based on the reflectance of nine images and only three spectral indices: the normalized difference vegetation index, the normalized difference water index, and the structure insensitive pigment index. This investigation demonstrates that the combined use of time series of high-resolution images and spectral indices can contribute to distinguish fields of similar crop species.

TI  - Semi-field evaluation of the exposure-free mosquito electrocuting trap and BG-Sentinel trap as an alternative to the human landing catch for measuring the efficacy of transfluthrin emanators against <i>Aedes aegypti</i>
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe human landing catch (HLC) measures human exposure to mosquito bites and evaluates the efficacy of vector control tools. However, it may expose volunteers to potentially infected mosquitoes. The mosquito electrocuting trap (MET) and BG-Sentinel traps (BGS) represent alternative, exposure-free methods for sampling host-seeking mosquitoes. This study investigates whether these methods can be effectively used as alternatives to HLC for measuring the efficacy of transfluthrin emanator against Aedes aegypti.MethodsThe protective efficacy (PE) of freestanding passive transfluthrin emanators (FTPEs), measured by HLC, MET and BGS, was compared in no-choice and choice tests. The collection methods were conducted 2 m from an experimental hut with FTPEs positioned at 3 m on either side of them. For the choice experiment, a competitor HLC was included 10 m from the first collection point. One hundred laboratory-reared Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were released and collected for 3 consecutive h.ResultsIn the no-choice test, each method measured similar PE: HLC: 66% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 50-82), MET: 55% (95% CI: 48-63) and BGS: 64% (95% CI: 54-73). The proportion of mosquitoes recaptured was consistent between methods (20-24%) in treatment and varied (47-71%) in the control. However, in choice tests, the PE measured by each method varied: HLC: 37% (95% CI: 25-50%), MET: 76% (95% CI: 61-92) and BGS trap: 0% (95% CI: 0-100). Recaptured mosquitoes were no longer consistent between methods in treatment (2-26%) and remained variable in the control (7-42%). FTPE provided 50% PE to the second HLC 10 m away. In the control, the MET and the BGS were less efficacious in collecting mosquitoes in the presence of a second HLC.ConclusionsMeasuring the PE in isolation was fairly consistent for HLC, MET and BGS. Because HLC is not advisable, it is reasonable to use either MET or BGS as a proxy for HLC for testing volatile pyrethroid (VP) in areas of active arbovirus-endemic areas. The presence of a human host in close proximity invalidated the PE estimates from BGS and METs. Findings also indicated that transfluthrin can protect multiple people in the peridomestic area and that at short range mosquitoes select humans over the BGS.

TI  - Growing season leaf carbon:nitrogen dynamics in Arctic tundra vegetation from ground and Sentinel-2 observations reveal reallocation timing and upscaling potential
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant nitrogen (N) use is an essential component of the N cycle in Arctic terrestrial ecosystems, and important processes include plant N uptake and reallocation during the growing season. While the availability of N to deciduous tundra plants in part relies on their internal reallocation of N from leaves to stems and roots during autumn senescence, the species-specific importance of reallocation timing and its community-wide implications on landscape- and regional-scales remains not well known. Here, we quantified leaf N contents and C:N ratios of four widespread shrub species in West Greenland from June through October and compared plot observations to landscape scale based on a new Sentinel-2-derived index. Our Sentinel-2 index captures overall N reallocation trends well across time and space at the plot level (R-2 = 0.81, p < 0.001). Using this novel approach is therefore relevant for upscaling of current and future changes in plant C:N dynamics. Using satellite data, we estimate the leaf N mass reallocated during senescence equaled about 0.8 g N m(-2) from leaves to stems and roots. We conclude that (1) in-situ data from the entire growing season is critical to quantify timing and contrasting strategies of N allocation at species level, (2) key species such as Salix glauca are capable of halving their leaf N content during senescence, (3) Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellite data is a strong candidate for quantifying these plant functional dynamics in space and time. Our study has implications for research on competition among Arctic plants, litter decomposition and consequently carbon accumulation in tundra soils from a climate change perspective. Further, it captures plant functional dynamics during critical parts of the growing season, including autumn senescence which is generally more complex than capturing spring greenup. Lastly, our new index has important implications for remotely mapping temporal and spatial variation in substrate quality for both wild and domesticated herbivores, as it is a first step towards a tool to assess the tundra vegetation and fodder quality for cold region animal husbandry.
