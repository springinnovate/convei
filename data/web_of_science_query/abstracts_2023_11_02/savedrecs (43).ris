TI  - The responses of weathering carbon sink to eco-hydrological processes in global rocks
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Eco-hydrological processes affect the chemical weathering carbon sink (CS) of rocks. However, due to data quality limitations, the magnitude of the CS of rocks and their responses to eco-hydrological processes are not accurately understood. Therefore, based on Global Erosion Model for CO2 fluxes (GEM-CO2 model), hydrological site data, and multi-source remote sensing data, we produced a 0.05 degrees & times; 0.05 degrees resolution dataset of CS for 11 types of rocks from 2001 to 2018. The results show that the total amount of CS of global rocks is 0.32 +/- 0.02 Pg C, with an average flux of 2.7 t C km & minus;2 yr & minus;1, accounting for 53% and 3% of the "missing" carbon sink and fossil fuel emissions, respectively. This is 23% higher than previous research results, which may be due to the increased resolution. Although about 60% of the CS of global rocks are in a stable state, there are obvious differences among rocks. For example, the CS of carbonate rocks exhibited a significant increase (0.30 Tg C/yr), while the CS of siliceous clastic sedimentary rocks exhibited a significant decrease (& minus;0.06 Tg C/yr). Although temperature is an important factor affecting the CS, the proportion of soil moisture in arid and temperate climate zones is higher (accounting for 24%), which is 3.6 times that of temperature. Simulations based on representative concentration pathways scenarios indicate that the global CS of rocks may increase by about 28% from 2050 to 2100. In short, we produced a set of high-resolution datasets for the CS of global rocks, which makes up for the lack of datasets in previous studies and improves our understanding of the magnitude and spatial pattern of the CS and its responses to eco-hydrological processes.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A locust remote sensing monitoring system based on dynamic model library
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Locusts (insect pest) often cause serious loss to crops world-wide. Monitoring the occurrence of locust plagues through remote sensing technology has become a common method. However, with the abundance of remote sensing data resources, the corresponding locust remote sensing monitoring models are also diversified, and the selection of model parameters are more complex. How to manage these models scientifically for better reuse is an important problem that needs to be addressed. In order to solve these problems, we designed and implemented a locust remote sensing monitoring system (LRSMS) based on dynamic model library (DML), which is composed of model file library, model dictionary library, and model library management module. In terms of data to match the remote sensing monitoring models, there is more integration of locust habitat data in LRSMS, such as plantation, soil, which are closely related to the locust plague breeding environment. In addition, to improve the scalability of the system, a data interface is designed for the interaction between the DML and the Structured Query Language (SQL) server database. At the end of the paper, two application cases from China are given, and the results show that the LRSMS can well integrate multi-source data sets and carry out locust plague monitoring research through the dynamic model library. The approaches and methodologies presented in this paper can serve as a reference for those who are interested in remote sensing monitoring applications.

TI  - Research on the peak energy spectrum of the solar cosmic ray ground level enhancement event (GLE72)
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The ground level enhancement (GLE) event energy spectrum provides important information about the acceleration and propagation of cosmic ray. In this paper, we analyze the proton flux peak energy spectrum of recent GLE event (2017.09 GLE72) by using GOES15 satellite and neutron monitor experiment data. The method of adjacent averaging smoothing and weighted average are applied to study GOES15 satellite data, and obtain the flux peak and flux peak time. By fitting, the energy spectrum index of proton flux peak is 1.88 in the satellite observation energy range. Again, the energy spectrum index of the neutron monitor observation energy range, 4.86, is obtained by using the new neutron monitor yield function. It can be seen that the peak energy spectrum index given by satellites in the lower energy range (5-433 MeV) is much smaller than that given by the neutron monitor in the higher energy range (0.44-19 GeV). This means that, the energy spectrum in the lower energy range is harder than that in the higher energy range. Hence, the results of the energy spectrum could be explained qualitatively by the re-acceleration mechanism of high energy solar particles. In the low corona region, first, the particles released by the solar flare are accelerated, and the energy spectrum index of the high-energy range is twice that of the low-energy range. Then part of the solar high energy particles from the low corona enter into the CME, where they will be re-acceleration by the shock wave. The GLE72 event high energy range energy spectrum index given by the neutron monitor experiment is 4.86, so the energy spectrum index in low energy range should be 4.86/2 = 2.43. However, the low energy range energy spectrum index is 1.88 (lower than 2.43 in low energy range). The reason may be that the energy spectrum index is further reduced due to the re-acceleration effect in the shock wave generated by the CME. The observation of GLE event is one of the main research subjects of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Also, the GLE72 proton peak energy spectrum results provide important information to observe solar high energy particles in the LHAASO experiment.

TI  - Investigating the flood damages in Lower Indus Basin since 2000: Spatiotemporal analyses of the major flood events
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - While historically significant for ancient civilizations, the Indus basin is also known for its floods and complex anthropogenic management history. Resulting from years of modifications by the pre-British era Mughal rulers followed by the post-partition division of river waters among the two neighbors, India and Pakistan, Pakistan faces severe management and financial challenges of water management. This study investigates the intricacies arising from this complicated management doctrine for the lower Indus basin. A detailed remote sensing-based analysis of the significant floods to hit the lower Indus basin since 2000 has been provided. Flood years were identified, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for the years 2003, 2005, 2006, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2016 were used to map their spatiotemporal extents. Almost all the flood water accumulated in the north is released in one river channel of the lower Indus basin. Further, the challenges were exacerbated due to the excessive rainfall in 2011 and 2012 in southeastern Sindh. A trend analysis of rainfall data shows an increase in the southern basin in the last 21 years, particularly toward the central plains and Sindh Province. The floodwater accumulated in the lower basin for as many as similar to 425 days on average, stretching to similar to 800 days of stagnancy in some places. The water stagnation period has been the highest in the river floodplain, highly populated and cultivated. The analyses of the current study suggest that the riverine channel has been better managed after the 2010 floods; however, the monsoon's shift in 2011 and 2012 led to widespread disaster in low-lying regions of Sindh Province.

TI  - Moralization East and West: Moralizing different transgressions among Chinese, Americans, and Lithuanians
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we report a cross-cultural study on how different types of social transgressions are moralised by Chinese, Americans, and Lithuanians. We hypothesised that given the continuing influences of Confucian worldview on contemporary Chinese societies, the Chinese will not make a distinction between moral (daode (sic)(sic)) and conventional cultural norms (wenming (sic)(sic)). Following Turiel's moral/conventional task, we characterised moral transgressions in terms of two dimensions: Their wrongness is perceived to be independent of any authorities' opinion and general in scope. The results indicate that Chinese participants were slightly more "moralising" than Americans and Lithuanians in the typical (Haidtean) moral domains. More importantly, unlike Americans and Lithuanians, the Chinese strongly moralised uncultured (wenming (sic)(sic)) behaviour. Results also indicate that explicit considerations about purity were quite important across all three cultural groups. These mixed results are discussed in the light of recent debates about the scope of morality and the moral/conventional distinction.

T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In this feasibility study we aimed to evaluate the value of previously reported molecular tumor biomarkers associated with lymph node metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) to optimize neck strategy selection criteria.Methods The association between expression of cortactin, cyclin D1, FADD, RAB25, and S100A9 and sentinel lymph node status was evaluated in a series of 87 (cT1-2N0) patients with OSCC treated with primary resection and SLNB procedure.Results Tumor infiltration depth and tumor pattern of invasion were independent prognostic markers for SLN status, while none of the tumor makers showed a better prognostic value to replace SLNB as neck staging technique in the total cohort. However, in the subgroup of patients with pT1N0 OSCC, cortactin expression (OR 16.0, 95%CI 2.0-127.9) was associated with SLN classification.Conclusions Expression of cortactin is a promising immunohistochemical tumor marker to identify patients at low risk that may not benefit from SLNB or END.

TI  - Retrieval of digital elevation models from Sentinel-1 radar data - open applications, techniques, and limitations
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - With the launch of Sentinel-1 in 2014, a new era of openly accessible spaceborne radar imagery was begun, and its potential has been demonstrated throughout all fields of applications. However, while interferometric approaches to detect surface deformations are continuously being published, only a few studies address the derivation of digital elevation models (DEMs) from Sentinel-1 data. This is mainly because of the narrow orbital tube, which was primarily designed for subsidence measurements using differential interferometry. Nonetheless, the technical conditions are provided for successful applications involving DEM generation. These are outlined in the first part of this article with a focus on potential error sources and the impact of the most important constraints, namely, temporal and perpendicular baselines. The second part evaluates 21 studies on this topic, their aims, and how they dealt with error sources and the necessity of validation. These studies are then discussed based on the main challenges and potentials including how these can be tackled in the future to lay a solid foundation for scientific discourse.

TI  - Interfaith Experiences and Their Relationship with Heterosexual Collegians' Attitudes toward Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual People
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOMOSEXUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - For queer-spectrum students, college and university campuses are often sites of marginalization, discrimination, and/or harassment. Though such experiences are not singularly attributable to worldview, research highlights the role that religious identity plays in shaping individuals' perspectives on lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people. Absent from current scholarship, however, is insight into the ways in which interfaith experiences may influence those attitudes. As such, this study uses data from the Interfaith Diversity Experiences and Attitudes Longitudinal Survey (IDEALS) to explore how formal and informal campus interfaith experiences and provocative encounters with worldview diversity relate to heterosexual students' appreciative attitudes toward LGB people. In addition to reinforcing the importance of friendships with individuals of different sexual orientations, our findings underscore the roles that campus space for support and spiritual expression, provocative encounters with worldview diversity, and interfaith behaviors play in fostering heterosexual students' appreciative attitudes toward LGB people.

TI  - A workflow based on Sentinel-1 SAR data and open-source algorithms for unsupervised burned area detection in Mediterranean ecosystems
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the capability of the free synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 (S-1) C-band data for burned area mapping through unsupervised machine learning open-source processing solutions in the Mediterranean forest ecosystems. The study was carried out in two Mediterranean sites located in Portugal (PO) and Italy (IT). The entire processing workflow was developed in Python-based scripts. We analyzed two time-series covering about one month before and after the fire events and using both VH and VV polarizations for each study site. The speckle noise effects were reduced by performing a multitemporal filter and the backscatter time averages of pre- and post-fire datasets. The spectral contrast between changed and unchanged areas was enhanced by calculating two single-polarization radar indices: the radar burn difference (RBD) and the logarithmic radar burn ratio (LogRBR); and two temporal differences of dual-polarimetric indices: the delta modified radar vegetation index (Delta RVI) and the delta dual-polarization SAR vegetation index (Delta DPSVI), all exhibiting greater sensitivity to the backscatter changes. The scene's contrast was enhanced by extracting the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) textures (dissimilarity, entropy, correlation, mean, and variance). A principal component analysis (PCA) was applied for reducing the number of the GLCM image layers. The burned area was delineated through unsupervised classification using the k-means clustering algorithm. A suitable number of clusters (k value) were set using a silhouette score analysis. To assess the accuracy of the resulting detected burned areas, an official burned area map based on multispectral Sentinel-2 (S-2) was used for PO, while for IT, a reference map was produced from S-2 data, based on the normalized burned ratio difference (Delta NBR) index. Recall (r), precision (p) and the F-score accuracy metrics were calculated. Our approach reached the values of 0.805 (p), 0.801 (r) and 0.803 (F-score) for PO, and 0.851 (p), 0.856 (r) and 0.853 (F-score) for IT. These results confirm the suitability of our approach, based on SAR S-1 data, for burned area mapping in heterogeneous Mediterranean ecosystems. Moreover, the implemented workflow, completely based on free and open-source software and data, offers high adaptation flexibility, repeatability, and custom improvement.

TI  - Using fine-scale relatedness to infer natural enemy movement
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural enemies often move among habitats to track prey and resources. Indeed, biocontrol often depends on natural enemies dispersing into crops after disturbances such as tillage and pesticide applications. However, the small size of many natural enemies makes it difficult to observe such movements. Here we used genetic relatedness among entomopathogenic nematodes, tiny, soil-dwelling, and thus cryptic natural enemies, to infer their movement across an agricultural landscape. We collected strains of two nematode species, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and Steinernema feltiae, by placing sentinel hosts into eight irrigated Solanum tuberosum fields across arid central Washington State. We then used restriction site associated DNA sequencing to generate single nucleotide polymorphisms and infer relatedness among strains across our study sites. We identified 3,367 and 138,286 polymorphic loci for H. bacteriophora and S. feltiae, respectively. Genetic differentiation for both species increased with greater distance between sites, although there was considerable variation. While strains collected from the same field were generally more closely related than those from different sites, for both species, strains from different fields were sometimes quite closely related. Altogether, our results suggest a surprising amount of genetic similarity among nematodes from distant sites, despite the presumably limited distances that can be traversed by individual worms. This is consistent with the nematodes moving, at least occasionally, between far-apart locations. More generally, we suggest that recent advances in population genomics are providing powerful new tools for mapping natural enemy movement across broad landscapes.

TI  - Thirty years of clear-cutting maintain diversity and functional composition of woody-encroached Neotropical savannas
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Humans have changed vegetation dynamics in Neotropical savannas by suppressing fires, allowing trees and shrubs to expand into ancient savanna landscapes in a process known as woody encroachment. This woody encroachment drives the loss of biodiversity and modifies the functioning of savanna ecosystems. Here we combine satellite data analysis with an experimental approach to test the hypothesis that long-term management by clear-cutting helps restore the diversity and functional composition of open savannas. First, we used Landsat time series of the Normalized Difference Water Index, to assess changes in vegetation structure, comparing experimental areas with open savannas in the same region. We then obtained field experimental evidence comparing areas managed during 30 years versus unmanaged areas, including data on vegetation structure and composition. Our results from satellite image analyses indicate that, before the first clear-cutting, vegetation structure was similar in managed and unmanaged sites, and both differed from open savanna. When clear-cutting manipulation started, NDWI of managed areas became persistently lower than that of unmanaged control areas. In the field, we found that in managed areas, species diversity and richness of typical savanna species had increased, and that species composition had changed to become more similar to open savannas. We also observed the recovery of savanna functional composition, suggesting that ecosystem processes were restored by clearcutting management. Our findings reveal that the repeated removal of dominant woody species by clearcutting has contributed to maintain the diversity and functioning of savannas degraded by forest encroachment.

TI  - Estimation of river flow using CubeSats remote sensing
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - River flow characterizes the integrated response from watersheds, so it is essential to quantify to understand the changing water cycle and underpin the sustainable management of freshwaters. However, river gauging stations are in decline with ground-based observation networks shrinking. This study proposes a novel approach of estimating river flows using the Planet CubeSats constellation with the possibility to monitor on a daily basis at the sub-catchment scale through remote sensing. The methodology relates the river discharge to the water area that is extracted from the satellite image analysis. As a testbed, a series of Surface Reflectance PlanetScope images and observed streamflow data in Araguaia River (Brazil) were selected to develop and validate the methodology. The study involved the following steps: (1) survey of measurements of water level and river discharge using in-situ data from gauge-based Conventional Station (CS) and measurements of altimetry using remote data from JASON2 Virtual Station (JVS); (2) survey of Planet CubeSat images for dates in step 1 and without cloud cover; (3) image preparation including clipping based on different buffer areas and calculation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) per image; (4) water bodies areas calculation inside buffers in the Planet CubeSat images; and (5) correlation analysis of CubeSat water bodies areas with JVS and CS data. Significant correlations between the water bodies areas with JVS (R2 = 88.83%) and CS (R2 = 96.49%) were found, indicating that CubeSat images can be used as a CubeSat Virtual Station (CVS) to estimate the river flow. This newly proposed methodology using CubeSats allows for more accurate results than the JVS-based method used by the Brazilian National Water Agency (ANA) at present. Moreover, CVS requires small areas of remote sensing data to estimate with high accuracy the river flow and the height variation of the water in different timeframes. This method can be used to monitor sub-basin scale discharge and to improve water management, particularly in developing countries where the presence of conventional stations is often very limited.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Onsite age discrimination of an endangered medicinal and aromatic plant species <i>Valeriana jatamansi</i> using field hyperspectral remote sensing and machine learning techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Valeriana jatamansi Jones is an aromatic herb well known for its essential oil contents, and its high medicinal and commercial values. The amount of essential oils present in it increases with maturity (age) of the plant. In this study, Hyperspectral remote sensing data recorded in the field using Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) handheld spectroradiometer was used to discriminate the age (6, 12, 24 and 36 months) of V. jatamansi. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for feature selection and 06 machine learning classifiers were used to classify the plant based on their ages, i.e., Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Boosting Decision Tree (BDT), Decision Tree (DT) and k-Nearest Neighbourhood (kNN). For comparison, these classifiers were applied on full range of spectral reflectance data without feature selection and on feature-selected data using PCA. It was found that the accuracies of ANN, RF, BDT, SVM, DT and kNN were 91, 85, 57, 78, 35 and 42%, respectively for non-feature selected datasets. The accuracies of ANN and DT classifiers were, respectively, increased by 100% and 75% after applying PCA. The ANN classifiers resulted in 100% overall accuracy with a Kappa coefficient (K) of 1. The wavelength regions 860, 870 to 874, 876 to 885 nm in near-infrared (NIR), and 747 to 756 nm (red-edge) were identified as regions suitable for discriminate the age groups of V. jatamansi. The final trained model thus prepared was again validated on 60 plants (with different age group) grown in its natural habitat and the obtained accuracy was 88% (K = 0.84). Thus, the present study have provided a rapid technology for onsite identification of age of V. jatamansi in the field itself. The developed technology thus provides a scientific way for harvesting of this plant at its optimum age avoiding its wastage. The results of this study can also be applied to other endangered and valuable plants by way of finding its optimum growth stages for its harvesting.

TI  - An operational automated mapping algorithm for in-season estimation of wheat area for Punjab, Pakistan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of multi-spectral satellite data are a valuable option for crop-area monitoring, in particular by enabling rapid, accurate, and consistent estimation of crop area. In this study, we demonstrate the use of a turn-key wheat area mapping model using growing season Landsat time-series data to improve the precision of area estimates produced from a sample of field locations at which the presence of percent wheat per sample pixel was determined. The strata used in the sampling design to obtain the current season's in-situ reference data were created from a wheat map of the previous growing season. We then used a map for the current growing season to serve as an auxiliary variable in a regression estimator of the wheat area. This approach allows for rapid production of such maps and area estimates with less demand for technical expertise in an ongoing wheat monitoring system. Our automated, turn-key classification-tree algorithm produced wheat maps with comparable overall accuracy to those achieved by traditional supervised classification using manual training data collection. Pixel counts from turn-key maps for the years 2013 to 2017 over-estimated wheat area by 0.86% in 2014 to 7.26% in 2017 when compared to the official estimate from the Punjab Crop Reporting Service. Of the several approaches to estimating wheat area were compared, stratified random and simple random sampling augmented by a regression estimator were the two that yielded the smallest standard errors. Incorporating a current season, turn-key map in a regression estimator with data from a simple random sampling design represents a methodologically straightforward, operational implementation of timely, accurate, and precise monitoring of wheat area. Given the importance of wheat production in Punjab to Pakistan's national economy, this method represents an operationally efficient and effective monitoring of inter-annual shortages or surpluses in support of grain management. An automated, turn-key winter wheat mapping algorithm enables timely area estimation in advance of harvest.

TI  - Advancements in the remote sensing of landscape pattern of urban green spaces and vegetation fragmentation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent global urban expansion has seen a massive decline and loss in the connectivity of urban vegetation. In urban areas, some vegetation patches have increasingly become isolated and less connected by a matrix composed of impervious surfaces and transportation networks like roads. Vegetation fragmentation is a global threat to the remaining urban green spaces and has an impact on biodiversity conservation, environmental quality and urban microclimates. So far, a lot of work has been done on mapping and monitoring urban green spaces, some using conventional methods and of late using remotely sensed data. However, not much is known or well documented on the new developments in the remote sensing of vegetation fragmentation in urban areas over the last two decades. Thus, the objective of this research work is to present a detailed and comprehensive synthesis of the progress of remote sensing in assessing and monitoring landscape structure of urban green spaces and vegetation fragmentation. Specifically, scientific literature from the year 2000 to 2020 was reviewed to provide a state-of-the-art progress on the remote sensing of vegetation fragmentation in urban areas. Results indicate that between 2000 and 2020, there was a considerable increase in the number of scientific publications on vegetation fragmentation in urban landscapes. The discrete landscape pattern indices are the most widely used method. Comparatively, Land Remote Sensing Satellite System (Landsat) data was widely used due to its suitable spatial and temporal resolution, free availability and the presence of historical archival data that spans over a period of 40 years. The most commonly used scale was local (a city and/or municipality) followed by regional (more than one municipality in one continent) and then global (several selected cities and urban areas across continents). Only two studies were conducted at the global level. Further, geographic bias was observed in most of the accessed vegetation fragmentation studies. The review showed that vegetation fragmentation studies were done mostly for cities in China, North America and Europe while cities in most parts of Africa, Asia, Eurasia, Oceania and South America have not been comprehensively studied. The study also showed that the majority of cities across the globe have experienced severe vegetation fragmentation over the years. This review underscores the relevance of scientific findings in urban and spatial planning to minimize the loss of urban green spaces and to conserve and restore affected areas.

TI  - Fine resolution air quality dynamics related to socioeconomic and land use factors in the most polluted desert metropolitan in the American Southwest
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution kills approximately 4.2 million people every year. As air pollution varies significantly in different urban areas, the assessment of urban emissions is key to taking appropriate actions and formulating policies for sustainable built environments and to promote the wellbeing of people. The overarching goal of this study was to generate fine resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) using Landsat imagery and examine both the socioeconomic inequalities of air pollution exposure and the air quality variation related to different land-use categories. This study has focused on a period of unusual population growth, 2000-2010, in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area. It was found that socioeconomic factors, vegetation indexes, and land use land cover types are all strong predictors of AOD, and the negative coefficients of socioeconomic values reveal insight into the social inequality of air pollution exposure. Results suggest that the government regulation on air pollution during the study period helped to improve air quality. Meanwhile, planting vegetation to mitigate air pollution should be carefully examined in order to find the right vegetation species and spatial configuration of vegetation cover in urban settings.(c) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - SE<SUP>2</SUP>Net: semantic segmentation of remote sensing images based on self-attention and edge enhancement modules
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The semantic segmentation of optical satellite remote sensing images is more challenging than that of natural images, owing to the considerable differences in the texture, shape, topology, and scale of ground features in different areas and the coexistence of dense and sparse arrangements. To alleviate these difficulties and ensure a high accuracy, a semantic segmentation framework named the self-attention and edge enhancement network (SE(2)Net) is constructed considering two aspects. First, because the self-attention mechanism can capture more useful semantic information by modeling large neighborhood correlations, we embed a self-attention module known as spatial expectation maximization attention (SEMA) in the considered network. Second, the Laplace operator is adopted to explore the significant edge information to design an edge enhancement module (EEM). Finally, both SEMA and EEM are embedded in the proposed SE(2)Net, thereby forming an end-to-end network. To validate the performance of the proposed approach, we construct a semantic segmentation dataset (SSD) using Tian-Hui 1 satellite images and conduct extensive experiments on both the SSD and the gaofen image dataset (GID). The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art approaches and the effectiveness of the constructed SSD.

TI  - Risk factors associated with the incidence of self-reported COVID-19-like illness: data from a web-based syndromic surveillance system in the Netherlands
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - During the first wave of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 epidemic in the Netherlands, notifications consisted mostly of patients with relatively severe disease. To enable real-time monitoring of the incidence of mild coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) - for which medical consultation might not be required - the Infectieradar web-based syndromic surveillance system was launched in mid-March 2020. Our aim was to quantify associations between Infectieradar participant characteristics and the incidence of self-reported COVID-19-like illness. Recruitment for this cohort study was via a web announcement. After registering, participants completed weekly questionnaires, reporting the occurrence of a set of symptoms. The incidence rate of COVID-19-like illness was estimated and multivariable Poisson regression used to estimate the relative risks associated with sociodemographic variables, lifestyle factors and pre-existing medical conditions. Between 17 March and 24 May 2020, 25 663 active participants were identified, who reported 7060 episodes of COVID-19-like illness over 131 404 person-weeks of follow-up. The incidence rate declined over the analysis period, consistent with the decline in notified cases. Male sex, age 65+ years and higher education were associated with a significantly lower COVID-19-like illness incidence rate (adjusted rate ratios (RRs) of 0.80 (95% CI 0.76-0.84), 0.77 (0.70-0.85), 0.84 (0.80-0.88), respectively) and the baseline characteristics ever-smoker, asthma, allergies, diabetes, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease and children in the household were associated with a higher incidence (RRs of 1.11 (1.04-1.19) to 1.69 (1.50-1.90)). Web-based syndromic surveillance has proven useful for monitoring the temporal trends in, and risk factors associated with, the incidence of mild disease. Increased relative risks observed for several patient factors could reflect a combination of exposure risk, susceptibility to infection and propensity to report symptoms.

TI  - Evaluating the spatial and temporal variations of aquatic weeds (Biomass) on Lower Volta River using multi-sensor Landsat Images and machine learning
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquatic invasive weeds affect hydrological, ecological, and socio-economic activities on freshwater ecosystems. On the Lower Volta River (LVR) of Ghana, invasive aquatic weeds have been known to be nuisance to fishing, navigation, aquaculture, hydropower production and other agricultural practices in the area. While information on the spatial and temporal distribution of aquatic weeds would be beneficial in improving weed management and control measures on the river, such information is very scanty. Also, these aquatic weeds are also biomass resources, that can be transformed to bioenergy. Thus, this study evaluated the spatial and temporal variations of aquatic weeds on the Lower Volta River, and assessed their potential biomass for bioenergy production.Random Forest (RF) algorithm and Landsat images were used to map the distribution of the weeds in 1975, 2003, and 2020, respectively. Accuracy assessment results showed mean Overall Accuracy (OA) of 83.44% and mean User Accuracy (UA) of 79.24%. The results indicated that as of 1975, aquatic weeds covered only 1495 ha and appeared in some specific locations such as Kpong and Ada. However, by 2003, the weeds had spread to most parts of the river covering 5600 ha, which was an increase of approximately 4-fold within a period of 28 years. The area covered by the weeds, however declined by 1505 ha between 2003 and 2020. Thus, in 2020, water hyacinth covered about 36% of the aquatic weeds relative to 28% in 2003. The results showed that, the quantity of the water hyacinth biomass per unit area was 21.5 kg/m(2). This result can also be used as the basis for resource assessment as well as determination of its viability for bioenergy production and strategies for its modern utilisation. The conversion of water hyacinth into bioenergy remains one of the best aquatic weed management strategies that must be adopted in LVR.

TI  - Strong controls of daily minimum temperature on the autumn photosynthetic phenology of subtropical vegetation in China
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Vegetation phenology research has largely focused on temperate deciduous forests, thus limiting our understanding of the response of evergreen vegetation to climate change in tropical and subtropical regions. Results Using satellite solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data, we applied two methods to evaluate temporal and spatial patterns of the end of the growing season (EGS) in subtropical vegetation in China, and analyze the dependence of EGS on preseason maximum and minimum temperatures as well as cumulative precipitation. Our results indicated that the averaged EGS derived from the SIF and EVI based on the two methods (dynamic threshold method and derivative method) was later than that derived from gross primary productivity (GPP) based on the eddy covariance technique, and the time-lag for EGS(sif) and EGS(evi) was approximately 2 weeks and 4 weeks, respectively. We found that EGS was positively correlated with preseason minimum temperature and cumulative precipitation (accounting for more than 73% and 62% of the study areas, respectively), but negatively correlated with preseason maximum temperature (accounting for more than 59% of the study areas). In addition, EGS was more sensitive to the changes in the preseason minimum temperature than to other climatic factors, and an increase in the preseason minimum temperature significantly delayed the EGS in evergreen forests, shrub and grassland. Conclusions Our results indicated that the SIF outperformed traditional vegetation indices in capturing the autumn photosynthetic phenology of evergreen forest in the subtropical region of China. We found that minimum temperature plays a significant role in determining autumn photosynthetic phenology in the study region. These findings contribute to improving our understanding of the response of the EGS to climate change in subtropical vegetation of China, and provide a new perspective for accurately evaluating the role played by evergreen vegetation in the regional carbon budget.

TI  - Delineating fragmented grassland patches in the tropical region using multi-seasonal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, grasslands are declining and are in highly degraded conditions. In South Asia, grasslands are neglected and treated as wastelands. They remain unprotected, highly fragmented, and poorly understood, which has led to a loss of unique biodiversity and livelihoods. Mapping grasslands accurately is a challenge and current maps based on optical remote sensing often over- or underestimate grasslands in South Asia due to the prevalent complex landscape matrix, small patch sizes, and obscuring monsoonal clouds. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), fused with moderate spatial resolution optical data, has been used to delineate grasslands, but the high-resolution, freely available European Space Agency (ESA)'s Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (Optical) provide an opportunity to map small and fragmented patches. Further, high-resolution imageries require high computing power, which is often limited to stand-alone machines. Here, we demonstrate that using cloud computing and optimal use of multi-seasonal imagery, one can obtain a highly accurate land-cover land use (LCLU) classification for a complex habitat matrix. We performed LCLU classification using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (Combined) in Google Earth Engine (GEE). GEE is a freely accessible cloud computing platform. We compared the accuracy of grassland classes between a) Sentinel-1 seasonal (pre-, during, and post-monsoon), b) Sentinel-2 post-monsoon, and c) combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. We tested this method at two sites in a highly fragmented habitat matrix in arid and semi-arid areas of Western and Southern India. The classification results have shown that the overall accuracy for the combined image classification was higher than only Sentinel-2 or Sentinel-1 alone for both sites. Grassland class accuracy was also consistent with combined image classification across the sites. Our results identified newer grassland areas that coarse land use management maps used by the government did not. Since the computation was conducted in GEE, a regular laptop was sufficient for the user and processing was completed rapidly. We, therefore, suggest that this approach of using cloud computing and optimal use of resource-hungry (computation and storage) high-resolution Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data can be used to identify major LCLU classes and patchy grasslands in the arid and semi-arid regions of India and has the potential to map at a continent level.

TI  - Human-canid relationship in the Americas: an examination of canid biological attributes and domestication
T2  - MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nineteen species of wild canids interact with humans in the Americas in different ways. The zooarchaeological record of burials, shifts in diet, abundance at sites, and ethnological information document the various kinds of interactions of canids and humans in the Americas. However, none of these native canid species has been domesticated. To understand past and present interactions of canids and humans, and explore the biological attributes of native canids (diet, gestation length, occurrence in captivity, temperament, social system, weight, activity pattern, and relative abundance) in view of their suggested potential for domestication, we selected 163 publications from the zooarchaeological record and ethnological sources from the Americas. The compilation ranged between the years 1823 and 2021. The two species with the highest domestication potential based on their life history, social system, and diet are Canis latrans and Speothos venaticus. For the domestication of a canid species to occur, it is necessary to have the biological attributes to facilitate the process, and for the (human) potential domesticator the worldview consistent with this practice. The latter likely explains the lack of domesticated canids in the Amazon region.

TI  - Reducing the vulnerability of coastal communities in the Caribbean through sustainable mangrove management
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2017 Atlantic storm season caused widespread damage to Caribbean nations including the British Virgin Islands. The winds and rainfall associated with Hurricanes Irma and Maria played their part in the destruction of infrastructure, livelihoods and the environment. With an increased interest in nature-based solutions to reduce flood risk, increasing the resilience of coastal communities and a focus on three of the most vulnerable communities in the Virgin Islands, we report on the use of flood risk vulnerability models based on remotely sensed satellite data and ecosystem services principles. Models were created with 4 primary aims to: (1) monitor the impact of storms and the recovery of mangroves, (2) assess the risk of flooding due to hurricane storm surges and extra-tropical storms (ground seas), (3) model opportunity areas for the restoration of red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) and buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus) and (4) model and produce maps highlighting the predicted benefits that mangrove restoration will have on vulnerable coastal communities. Results highlight that between 75 and 94% of red mangroves in the three communities were negatively impacted by hurricanes in 2017. However, vulnerability models predict that even small-scale mangrove restoration initiatives can help to reduce the flood risk of homes and infrastructure up to 475 m inland. This work has provided the rationale for mangrove restoration in the Virgin Islands and presents an important tool for expansion across the wider Caribbean region that can be used to inform coastal restoration and resiliency building activities.

TI  - Songhua River basin's improving water quality since 2005 based on Landsat observation of water clarity
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity, denoted by the Secchi disk depth (SDD), is one of the most important indicators for monitoring water quality. In the Songhua River basin (SHRB), few studies have used Landsat to monitor long-term (3-4 decades) changes in lake SDD and explore the impact of natural and human factors on SDD interannual variation at the watershed scale. Lakes in the SHRB are of great significance to local populations. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of SDD could help policymakers manage, protect, and predict lake water quality. We utilized the Landsat red/blue band ratio in the Google Earth Engine to estimate the SDD of 77 lakes and generated annual mean SDD maps from 1990 to 2018. The results of the SDD interannual changes showed that the water quality in the SHRB has improved since 2005. Specifically, the SDD in the SHRB displayed a significant increasing trend (p < 0.05) from 0.29 m in 2005 to 0.37 m in 2018. Moreover, the number of lakes displaying a significant increasing trend for SDD increased from 18 between 1990 and 2005 to 31 between 2005 and 2018. We also found that use of chemical fertilizer significantly impacted lakes, followed by wastewater discharge and normalized difference vegetation index. Improvements in the quantity and ability of wastewater discharge treatment and increased vegetation cover have alleviated water pollution; however, the non-point pollution of agriculture still poses a threat to some lakes in the SHRB. Therefore, more efforts should be made to further improve the aquatic ecological environment of SHRBs.

TI  - pH-Amplified CRET Nanoparticles for In Vivo Imaging of Tumor Metastatic Lymph Nodes
T2  - ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Noninvasive imaging strategies have been extensively investigated for in vivo mapping of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). However, the current imaging strategies fail to accurately assess tumor metastatic status in SLNs with high sensitivity. Here we report pH-amplified self-illuminating near-infrared nanoparticles, which integrate chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) and signal amplification strategy, enabling accurate identification of metastatic SLNs. After draining into lymph nodes, the nanoparticles were phagocytosed and dissociated in acidic phagosomes of inflammatory macrophages to emit near-infrared luminescent light. Using these nanoparticles, we successfully differentiated tumor metastatic lymph nodes from benign ones. These nanoparticles also exhibited excellent imaging capability for early detection of metastatic SLNs in diverse animal tumor models with small tumor volume (100-200 mm(3)).

TI  - Monitoring drought dynamics in China using Optimized Meteorological Drought Index (OMDI) based on remote sensing data sets
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate monitoring of the spatiotemporal changes in drought is very important for the reduction in the social losses caused by drought. The Optimized Meteorological Drought Index (OMDI), originally established in southwestern China, showed great potential for drought monitoring over large regions on a large scale. However, the applicability of the index requires further evaluation, especially when used throughout China, which has a different agricultural divisions, variable climatic conditions, complex terrain and diverse land cover. In addition, the OMDI model relies on training data to construct local parameters for the model. On a large scale, it is of great significance to use multisource remote sensing data sets to construct OMDI model parameters. In this paper, the constrained optimization method was used to establish weights for the MODIS-derived Vegetation Conditional Index (VCI), TRMM-derived Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), and GLDAS-derived Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI) and calculate the OMDI based on the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and weather stations. The accuracy of the OMDI model was evaluated by using the correlation coefficient. Moreover, the spatiotemporal changes in drought were also analyzed through trend analysis, Mann-Kendall (MK) statistics and the Hurst index on the monthly and annual scales. The results showed that (1) the highest positive correlation between the OMDI and the SPI was SPI-1, which was higher than that for any other month interval, such as 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months of the SPI. The results indicated that the OMDI was suitable to monitor meteorological drought. (2) In the nine agricultural subareas in China, the degree of drought in the Yangtze River (DYR) area had the most severe evolution and change frequency. This region was very sensitive to drought in the past two decades. (3) The area with OMDI variation coefficient less than 0.1 accounted for 94%, indicating that the degree of drought fluctuates little; The linear tendency rate is 0.0004, and the area greater than 0 reaches 66.44%, indicating that the drought is developing in a lightning trend. (4) The Hurst index value is mostly higher than 0.5 (the area ratio is 56.31%), and the area of "Positive-Consistent" and "Negative- Opposite" accounted for 54.02%, indicating that more than half of China's area drought changes will show a trend of mitigation in the future.

TI  - Decoupling convolution network for characterizing the metastatic lymph nodes of breast cancer patients
T2  - MEDICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) technique is an emerging imaging tool that can better characterize material features and has the potential to be a noninvasive means of predicting lymph node metastasis. The purpose of this study was to establish a DECT-specified quantitative approach based on a neural network to characterize the sentinel lymph node (SLN).Methods With IRB approval, we retrospectively collected a total of 229 patients (100/229 metastasis) with biopsy proven breast cancer in this study. The chest and axillary spectral CT examinations were performed prior to the axillary lymph node (ALN) surgery. A decoupling convolution network with 11 ROIs from sequential keV (40 to 140 keV with 10 keV increment) was proposed to explicitly extract the spectral and spatial features in a DECT to predict the lymph node status. Focal loss was introduced as the loss function. The metric of the slope of the spectral Hounsfield unit curve measured at the venous phase was used as the baseline approach in comparison to our approach. In additional, a logistic model with radiomic features was also compared to our approach. The area under ROC curve (AUC) was used as the figure of merit to evaluate the classification performance.Results By introducing spectral convolution and focal loss, AUC on test set could be improved by 0.15 and 0.01 separately. Compared to the slope of the spectral curve with the average AUC of 0.611 and radiomic model with AUC of 0.825, the proposed approach demonstrates a considerably better performance, with test set AUC value of 0.837, by using decoupling spectral and spatial convolution together with focal loss function.Conclusions We presented a new decoupling neural network based quantification method for DECT analysis, which might have potential as a noninvasive tool to predict metastasis lymph node status for breast cancer in clinical practice.

TI  - Tracking historical chlorophyll-<i>a</i> change in the guanting reservoir, Northern China, based on landsat series inter-sensor normalization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Guanting Reservoir supplied drinking water to Beijing until 1997, following which the water quality of the reservoir deteriorated. The chlorophyll-a concentration (C (chl-a )) of water is an important indicator of eutrophication. Therefore, changes in the C (chl-a ) of the Guanting Reservoir should be monitored and analysed. For more than 30 years, the monitoring of C (chl-a ) in inland waterbodies has only been possible using the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). However, there are data consistency problems in monitoring C (chl-a ) using these sensors. To address this issue, this study utilized inter-sensor normalization models of the different sensors and a unified C (chl-a ) estimation model for Landsat series data with a long time span. After inter-sensor normalization, the mean relative error (MRE) of remote sensing reflectance (R (rs)) between OLI and TM/ETM+ was corrected to 1-5%. The unified model of C (chl-a ) estimation employed the normalized ratio index of blue R (B) and near-infrared R (NIR) remote sensing reflectance: (R (NIR) - R (B)): (R (NIR) + R (B)). The MRE for estimating C (chl-a ) was 25.7% and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 5.65 mg m(-3). The C (chl-a ) of the Guanting Reservoir was then estimated for years between 1985 and 2019. During this time, C (chl-a ) had a distinct seasonal distribution trend; the annual changes go through four stages, and each period shows different change characteristics. This study is the first to systematically understand the history of chlorophyll-a changes in the Guanting Reservoir over the past 30 years and provides references data for its eutrophication process and management.

TI  - Preliminary Assessment of Air Pollution Quality Levels of Lagos, Nigeria
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The low-cost sensors and IoT have come to the rescue due to the high cost and operational complexity of equipment and methodologies in environmental monitoring. They are relatively inexpensive and reliable. It is on this assumption that we have decided to use the World Air Quality satellite data supplied by air matters.com. This study is a 40-day preliminary work in which air quality [Air Quality Index (AQI), PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, and O-3] and meteorological (temperature, humidity, and wind speed) parameters were monitored. The data collected were for five locations in Lagos State, Nigeria (Ojodu, Opebi, Ikeja, Maryland, and Eti-Osa). The data obtained were subjected to basic statistical analyses. The findings showed that the Opebi had the highest mean value of PM2.5 (69.28 mu g/m(3)), PM10 (107.38 mu g/m(3)), and CO (1392 mu g/m(3)). The mean values of O-3 are as follows: 32.52, 38.7, 36.2, 37.85, and 36.13 mu g/m(3) for Ikeja, Maryland, Opebi, Ojodu, and Eti-Osa, respectively. Opebi had the highest value (3179 mu g/m(3)), followed by Eti-Osa (2978 mu g/m(3)), and the lowest value in Maryland (1943 mu g/m(3)) among the CO reference locations. AQI of all locations presented the levels of contamination as 'Unhealthy for Vulnerable Groups'. The pollutants were much higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. There were relationships between the parameters monitored and meteorological influences, and the effects of natural and man-made activities may be the sources of the elevated pollutants throughout the locations.

TI  - Smart pansharpening approach using kernel-based image filtering
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image fusion plays important roles in numerous applications, including monitoring, metrology, and agriculture. Image fusion gathers essential information from several image sources and consolidates them into a single image called a fused image. The fused image involves relevant data, and it is more informative than any other images extracted from one source. This study proposed a pansharpening technique based on image filtering utilising a bilateral filter to generate high-frequency details from panchromatic image. The various types of side window guided filters are employed to enhance the multispectral band from panchromatic image and then used these filters to adjust spatial data misfortune that happens when images are combined. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method provides consistent results concise with reported by the previous research in terms of subjective and objective assessments on remote sensing data.

TI  - Phase change in evolution of the modern Huanghe (Yellow River) Delta: Process, pattern, and mechanisms
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The modern Huanghe Delta used to be the most rapid land-building delta in the world. Its evolution has become a global concern because the sediment load of the Huanghe has decreased sharply in recent decades. However, few studies have revealed the full picture of Huanghe Delta evolution because of a lack of systematic bathymetric data off the delta. This study used 21 years of bathymetric data off the Huanghe Delta in combination with 34 scenes of Landsat imagery to study spatiotemporal evolution of the delta since 1976. Results indicate that the active lobe had an evolution distinct from the abandoned lobe. The temporal evolution of the active lobe had a four-phase pattern in both subaerial and subaqueous deltas, with different relationships with sediment load. In addition to sediment load, evolution of the active lobe was largely controlled by hydrodynamic-morphologic interactions and grain size of the Huanghe sediment. The abandoned lobe had a three-phase erosion since 1976 when the sediment supply from the river was cut off. A change in sediment dispersals might have dominated the evolution of the abandoned lobe. A newly assessed budget of the Huanghe sediment indicates that similar to 70% of the sediment load accumulated in the Huanghe Delta, which is much more than that estimated based on Pb-210-derived sedimentation rates or numerical studies. The present study comprehensively reveals the evolution of the modern Huanghe Delta and presents a typical example of the evolution of a large-river delta in response to global change.

TI  - A new global gridded sea surface temperature data product based on multisource data
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is an important geophysical parameter that is essential for studying global climate change. Although sea surface temperature can currently be obtained through a variety of sensors (MODIS, AVHRR, AMSR-E, AMSR2, WindSat, in situ sensors), the temperature values obtained by different sensors come from different ocean depths and different observation times, so different temperature products lack consistency. In addition, different thermal infrared temperature products have many invalid values due to the influence of clouds, and passive microwave temperature products have very low resolutions. These factors greatly limit the applications of ocean temperature products in practice. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper first took MODIS SST products as a reference benchmark and constructed a temperature depth and observation time correction model to correct the influences of the different sampling depths and observation times obtained by different sensors. Then, we built a reconstructed spatial model to overcome the effects of clouds, rainfall, and land interference that makes full use of the complementarities and advantages of SST data from different sensors. We applied these two models to generate a unique global 0.041 degrees gridded monthly SST product covering the years 2002-2019. In this dataset, approximately 25% of the invalid pixels in the original MODIS monthly images were effectively removed, and the accuracies of these reconstructed pixels were improved by more than 0.65 degrees C compared to the accuracies of the original pixels. The accuracy assessments indicate that the reconstructed dataset exhibits significant improvements and can be used for mesoscale ocean phenomenon analyses. The product will be of great use in research related to global change, disaster prevention, and mitigation and is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4419804 (Cao et al., 2021a).

TI  - X-chromosome variants are associated with aldosterone producing adenomas
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs) are a major cause of primary aldosteronism (PA) and are characterized by constitutively producing aldosterone, which leads to hypertension. Several mutations have been identified in ion channels or ion channel-associated genes that result in APAs. To date, no studies have used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach to search for predisposing loci for APAs. Thus, we investigated Scandinavian APA cases (n=35) and Swedish controls (n=60) in a GWAS and discovered a susceptibility locus on chromosome Xq13.3 (rs2224095, OR=7.9, 95% CI=2.8-22.4, P=1x10(-7)) in a 4-Mb region that was significantly associated with APA. Direct genotyping of sentinel SNP rs2224095 in a replication cohort of APAs (n=83) and a control group (n=740) revealed persistently strong significance (OR=6.1, 95% CI=3.5-10.6, p<0.0005). We sequenced an adjacent gene, MAGEE1, of the sentinel SNP and identified a rare variant in one APA, p.Gly327Glu, which is complementary to other mutations in our primary cohort. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) were investigated on the X-chromosome, and 24 trans-eQTL were identified. Some of the genes identified by trans-eQTL point towards a novel mechanistic explanation for the association of the SNPs with APAs. In conclusion, our study provides further insights into the genetic basis of APAs.

TI  - Multitemporal Intrinsic Image Decomposition With Temporal-Spatial Energy Constraints for Remote Sensing Image Analysis
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to interference with remote imaging by some natural factors, the multitemporal analysis ability is limited by the spectral drift between images. In this article, a new approach to optimize the existing multitemporal analysis system is proposed: multitemporal intrinsic image decomposition (MIID). The MIID method is designed to extract common spectral reflectance from multitemporal images. With MIID, multitemporal classification, changing detection, and index extracting will become extremely easy and more accurate. Firstly, without considering land cover change, the general MIID framework is proposed by adding local temporal-spatial energy constraints in traditional intrinsic images decomposition. On this basis, an improved MIID method with change detection (CD) (CD-MIID) capability is proposed to make the model adapt to the land cover change situation. Finally, specific steps of how to use MIID methods in the multitemporal analysis are given. Multitemporal multispectral/hyperspectral remote sensing images from GF-1, GF-2, GF-5, Landsat TM, and two groups of captured datasets with reflectance truth map are used to evaluate the performance. The experimental results show the following two points: first, the MIID methods achieve better extraction results of spectral reflectance. Second, the proposed MIID methods have better performance both on multitemporal classification and CD.

TI  - Prognosis according to clinical and pathologic lymph node status in breast cancer patients who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy alone after neoadjuvant therapy
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the prognosis of breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone as axillary surgery regardless of their clinical and pathological lymph node status. We reviewed the records of 1,795 patients from Asan Medical Center who were diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy during 2003-2014. We selected 760 patients who underwent SLNB alone as axillary surgery and divided these patients into four groups according to their clinical lymph node (cN) and pathological lymph node (pN) status: cN(-)pN(-) (n = 377), cN(-)pN(+) (n = 33), cN(+)pN(-) (n = 242), and cN(+)pN(+) (n = 108). We then compared axillary lymph node recurrence, locoregional recurrence (LRR), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS) among the four groups using Kaplan-Meier analysis. We compared prognosis between the cN(-)pN(-) and cN(+)pN(-) groups to determine whether SLNB alone is an adequate treatment modality even in patients with cN positive pathology before neoadjuvant therapy but SLNB-negative pathology after NAC. The 5-year axillary recurrence rates in the cN(-)pN(-) and cN(+)pN(-) groups were 1.4% and 2.9%, respectively, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.152). The axillary recurrence and LRR rates were significantly different among the four groups, with the pN-negative groups (cN[-]pN[-], cN[+]pN[-]) showing lower recurrence rates. DMFS and OS were also significantly different among the four groups, with the cN negative groups (cN[-]pN[-], cN[-]pN[+]) showing improved survival rates. Our study findings suggest that SLNB alone was associated with lower LRR rates even in patients with cN positive pathology before neoadjuvant therapy but cN negative pathology after SLNB. Moreover, recurrence and survival rates differ significantly according to clinical and pathological lymph node status.

TI  - Monthly resolved modelled oceanic emissions of carbonyl sulphide and carbon disulphide for the period 2000-2019
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Carbonyl sulphide (OCS) is the most abundant, long-lived sulphur gas in the atmosphere and a major supplier of sulphur to the stratospheric sulphate aerosol layer. The short-lived gas carbon disulphide (CS2) is oxidized to OCS and constitutes a major indirect source to the atmospheric OCS budget. The atmospheric budget of OCS is not well constrained due to a large missing source needed to compensate for substantial evidence that was provided for significantly higher sinks. Oceanic emissions are associated with major uncertainties. Here we provide a first, monthly resolved ocean emission inventory of both gases for the period 2000-2019 (available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4297010) (Lennartz et al., 2020a). Emissions are calculated with a numerical box model (2.8 degrees x 2.8 degrees resolution at the Equator, T42 grid) for the oceanic surface mixed layer, driven by ERA5 data from ECMWF and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) from Aqua MODIS. We find that interannual variability in OCS emissions is smaller than seasonal variability and is mainly driven by variations in CDOM, which influences both photochemical and light-independent production. A comparison with a global database of more than 2500 measurements reveals overall good agreement. Emissions of CS2 constitute a larger sulphur source to the atmosphere than OCS and equally show interannual variability connected to variability in CDOM. The emission estimate of CS2 is associated with higher uncertainties as process understanding of the marine cycling of CS2 is incomplete. We encourage the use of the data provided here as input for atmospheric modelling studies to further assess the atmospheric OCS budget and the role of OCS in climate.

TI  - Tuning the molar mass of P3HT <i>via</i> direct arylation polycondensation yields optimal interaction and high efficiency in nonfullerene organic solar cells
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the simple structure and excellent scalability, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has become much more popular as a low-cost donor polymer partner with the emerging nonfullerene acceptors in recent years. Presently, the application and the molar mass dependence of direct arylation polycondensation (DArP) prepared P3HT in fullerene-free organic solar cells have not been explored yet. In this work, five batches of P3HT with weight-average molar mass ranging from 8.9 kg mol(-1) to 89.1 kg mol(-1) were successfully prepared via DArP, with the aim to detail the interaction-performance relationships in the state-of-the-art P3HT:nonfullerene photovoltaic blend, namely P3HT:ZY-4Cl. Our thermodynamic analysis revealed that the amorphous-amorphous interaction parameters strongly depend on the P3HT molar mass and can be varied by a factor of 2.75. Owing to the best pi-pi stacking order deduced from grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and the smallest domain size, the blend based on the medium molar mass batch (25.5 kg mol(-1)) delivered the highest current density, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency up to similar to 10% among the five systems. Our study confirmed that DArP is an effective protocol for the synthesis of P3HT for efficient non-fullerene polymer solar cells and the established relationships can be applied to screen the best batch for P3HT-based organic photovoltaics.

TI  - Ice-marginal lakes associated with enhanced recession of the Greenland Ice Sheet
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been a progressive increase in the number and area of ice-marginal lakes situated along the southwestern margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) since the 1980s. The increased prevalence of ice-marginal lakes is notable because of their capacity to enhance mass loss and ice-margin recession through a number of thermo-mechanical controls. Although such effects have been extensively documented at alpine glaciers, an understanding of how ice-marginal lakes impact the dynamics of the GrIS has been limited by a sparsity of observational records. This study employs the Landsat archive to conduct a multi-decadal, regional-scale statistical analysis of ice-margin advance and recession along a similar to 5000 km length of the south-western margin of the GrIS, incorporating its terrestrial, lacustrine and marine ice-margins. We reveal an extended and accelerating phase of ice-margin recession in south-west Greenland from 1992 onwards, irrespective of margin type, but also observe considerable heterogeneity in the behaviour of the different ice-marginal environments. Marine icemargins exhibited the greatest magnitude and variability in ice-margin change, however lacustrine termini were notable for a progressive increase in ice-margin recession rates from 1987 to 2015, which increasingly outpaced those measured at terrestrial ice-margins. Furthermore, significant correlations were identified between lake parameters and rates of lacustrine ice-margin recession, including lake area, latitude, altitude and the length of the lake-ice-margin interface. These results suggest that ice-marginal lakes have become increasingly important drivers of ice-margin recession and thus mass loss at the GrIS, however further research is needed to better parameterise the causal connections between ice-marginal lake evolution and enhanced ice-margin recession. More widely, a detailed understanding of the impacts of ice-marginal lakes on ice-margin dynamics across Greenland is increasingly necessary to accurately forecast the response of the ice sheet to enhanced ice-marginal lake prevalence and thus refine projections of recession, mass loss and sea level rise.

TI  - Rock avalanche induced flash flood on 07 February 2021 in Uttarakhand, India-a photogeological reconstruction of the event
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - A large debris flow triggered by a rock avalanche in the Raunthi glaciated valley resulted in flash floods in the Rishiganga and Dhauliganga rivers on 07 February 2021 in Uttarakhand, India. Hydel projects, houses, roads and bridges in the path of debris flow were damaged resulting in many deaths. We have used high-resolution satellite data (e.g. Pleiades, WorldView, Kompsat, Cartosat, Resourcesat, Planet) to study the source of flash floods and cause of the slope failure. Our detailed geological assessment, carried out using stereoscopic Pleiades images (50 cm), revealed rock avalanche as the main source of slope failure. The slope failure has exposed a similar to 197-m-high head scarp near the crown and is controlled by two sets of joints and a foliation that helped in the wedge type failure. The volume of failed mass (rock and ice) estimated by cut and fill method using digital elevation models (DEMs) is similar to 29.3 million m(3). The rock and ice descended from a height of similar to 5474 m and then crashed onto the moraine and ice bridges present in the valley at similar to 3732 m after travelling similar to 2.9 km along a steep slope. The heat generated by friction during run out and conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy due to the crashing on valley floor melted snow and ice. The ice melt water along with enhanced snow melting due to high ambient temperature on that day got intermixed with debris and created a slush, which was mobilised as a channelised flash flood. Multi-temporal high-resolution satellite data analysis showed that the debris flow was initiated at similar to 10:08:45 h (IST), and it travelled with a velocity of similar to 10.6 m/s. The rock avalanche event lasted for similar to 50 min, and the crash impact created a severe air blast in the valley. The rock avalanche has also resulted in debris blocking the Raunthi gad valley. Estimated Morphological Obstruction Index (MOI) and Hydro-morphological Dam Stability Index (HDSI) indicate the debris dam to be in an unstable domain.

TI  - Reframing the rural experience in Aotearoa New Zealand: Incorporating the voices of the marginalised
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A scan of social research about rural New Zealand from the 1980s reveals power divisions which have muted the voices of 'others'. Listening to these voices could transform how we manage the economy, sustain the environment and promote social well-being in future. Rural sociological attention in New Zealand has focused on the people and communities associated with land and resource-based assets, with little attention to the rural majority not engaged in primary production. Indigenous voices are also missing. As Jessica Hutchings argues, decisions on economic development, the environment and social services continue to uphold colonial hegemony as the dominant worldview in Aotearoa New Zealand. By being open to the perspectives of people normally ignored and particularly engaging with indigenous approaches, application of capital and power in development can be rethought and structural inequalities addressed.

TI  - Comparative performance of semi-empirical based remote sensing and crop simulation model for cotton yield prediction
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Early prediction of crop yield serves as a strategic plan for policymakers in making suitable import-export policies. In this research, remote sensing driven semi-empirical light use efficiency (LUE) model and a process-based crop simulation model (CSM) approach were attempted to predict cotton yield in the five districts of Maharashtra state, India. Time-series satellite data from different earth observation (EO) missions were retrieved from 2011 to 2017. Satellite-based measurements of fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) data were directly incorporated into the LUE model. The LUE model approach used observed minimum (0.07) and maximum (0.12) lint harvest index (HI) values to predict the cotton yield. On the other hand, the CSM model was parameterized with observed field management, soil, weather, and cultivar data for crop yield prediction. The inter-evaluation of models has revealed that the LUE model with HI value 0.07 (HI0.07) performed better when compared to the LUE model with HI value 0.12 (HI0.12) and CSM model. LUE model HI0.07 had shown better accuracy in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) of 154 kg ha(-1) and correlation coefficient value of (R-2 = 0.46) when compared with LUE model HI0.12 (RMSE 310 kg ha(-1) and R-2 = 0.41) and CSM model (RMSE 235 kg ha(-1) and R-2 = 0.38). The predicted yield from the models was found satisfactory for the normal year with acceptable accuracy. However, overestimation of yield was seen for the years affected by drought. This study has shown the potential of geospatial data that can be coupled with crop models to predict the crop yield with limited field observations.

TI  - Satellite imagery and machine learning for identification of aridity risk in central Java Indonesia
T2  - PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to develop a software framework for predicting aridity using vegetation indices (VI) from LANDSAT 8 OLI images. VI data are predicted using machine learning (ml): Random Forest (RF) and Correlation and Regression Trees (CART). Comparison of prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (k-nn) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS). Prediction results are interpolated using Inverse Distance Weight (IDW). This study was conducted in stages: (1) Image preprocessing; (2) calculating numerical data extracted from the LANDSAT band imagery using vegetation indices; (3) analyzing correlation coefficients between VI; (4) prediction using RF and CART; (5) comparing performances between RF and CART using ANN, SVM, k-nn, and MARS; (6) testing the accuracy of prediction using Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE); (7) interpolating with IDW. Correlation coefficient of VI data shows a positive correlation, the lowest r (0.07) and the highest r (0.98). The experiments show that the RF and CART algorithms have efficiency and effectivity in determining the aridity areas better than the ANN, SVM, k-nn, and MARS algorithm. RF has a difference between the predicted results and 1.04% survey data MAPE and the smallest value close to zero is 0.05 MSE. CART has a difference between the predicted results and 1.05% survey data MAPE and the smallest value approaching to zero which is 0.05 MSE. The prediction results of VI show that in 2020 most of the study areas were low vegetation areas with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) < 0.21, had an indication of drought with the Vegetation Health Index (VHI) < 31.10, had a Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) in some areas between 35%-50% (moderate drought) and < 35% (high drought). The Burn Area Index (dBAI) values are between - 3, 971 and -2,376 that show the areas have a low fire risk, and index values are between -0, 208 and -0,412 that show the areas are starting vegetation growth. The result of this study shows that the machine learning algorithms is an accurate and stable algorithm in predicting the risks of drought and land fire based on the W data extracted from the LANDSAT 8 OLL imagery. The VI data contain the record of vegetation condition and its environment, including humidity, temperatures, and the environmental vegetation health.

TI  - Field assessment of dog as sentinel animal for plague in endemic foci of Madagascar
T2  - INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The epidemiology of Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, involves vectors and reservoirs in its transmission cycle. The passive plague surveillance in Madagascar targets mainly rodent and fleas. However, carnivores are routinely surveyed as sentinels of local plague activity in some countries. The aim of this study is to assess the use of domestic dog (Canis familiaris) as sentinel animal for field surveillance of plague in a highly endemic area in Madagascar. Cross-sectional surveys of plague antibody prevalence in C. familiaris were conducted in endemic areas with contrasting histories of plague cases in humans, as well as a plague free area. Rodent capture was done in parallel to evaluate evidence for Y. pestis circulation in the primary reservoirs. In 2 sites, dogs were later re-sampled to examine evidence of seroconversion and antibody persistence. Biological samplings were performed between March 2008 and February 2009. Plague antibody detection was assessed using anti-F1 ELISA. Our study showed a significant difference in dog prevalence rates between plague-endemic and plague-free areas, with no seropositive dogs detected in the plague free area. No correlation was found between rodents and dog prevalence rates, with an absence of seropositive rodents in some area where plague circulation was indicated by seropositive dogs. This is consistent with high mortality rates in rodents following infection. Re-sampling dogs identified individuals seropositive on both occasions, indicating high rates of re-exposure and/or persistence of plague antibodies for at least 9 months. Seroconversion or seropositive juvenile dogs indicated recent local plague circulation. In Madagascar, dog surveillance for plague antibody could be useful to identify plague circulation in new areas or quiescent areas within endemic zones. Within active endemic areas, monitoring of dog populations for seroconversion (negative to positive) or seropositive juvenile dogs could be useful for identifying areas at greatest risk of human outbreaks.

TI  - Damaged area assessment of cultivated agricultural lands affected by cyclone bulbul in coastal region of Bangladesh using Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclones cause tremendous damage to agricultural lands in global south countries almost every year. It is significantly important to identify the damage assessment for rice growing agricultural land areas in the south and south-east Asian countries. Therefore, the objective of this research was to develop a new damaged area assessment (DAA) method to measure the area of each damage type class (DTC) for cyclone-prone agricultural lands using Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS datasets. The weighted overlay method was incorporated with a pix-code sum (plus+) operation based on conditional pseudocode algorithm using NDVI, SAVI and SMI change detection (CD) and change type classes (CTC). The assessment of the damaged area classes was reported as (1) Not damaged (7.71 km(2), 2.5%); (2) slightly damaged (32.96 km(2), 10.66%); (3) moderately damaged (79 km(2), 5.56%); (4) very damaged (131.56 km(2), 42.56%); and (5) extremely damaged (57.85 km(2), 18.72%) at cyclone Bulbul affected Kalapara sub-district in the coastal region of Bangladesh. This cyclone-prone hotspot was adjacent with the Bay of Bengal and total 420 ground reference points were selected by their farmers' location to validate our research. In the study, it was randomly observed that totals of 4 (0.95%); 13 (3.10%); 52 (12.38%); 205 (48.81%); and 146 ground reference points (34.76%) were accurately distributed into the said damaged type classes (1-5) respectively. The DAA method with DTCs could be helpful for researchers creating new yield loss assessment policies to help affected farming communities to prepare an effective recovery plan for their needs fulfilment in the cyclone-prone countries.

T2  - OPTIK
M3  - Article
AB  - Though coastal blue spectrum is used in many domain of earth remote sensing, a majority of multispectral missions are still ignored it. This paper proposed a coastal blue reconstructing method by common-used blue spectrum with ZY-1(02D) data. The reconstructing method was established by three mathematical models: 1) the relation model of surface reflectance based on the responsivities for terrestrial objects; 2) the relation model of apparent radiances based on the radiance transferring model for earth-observing; 3) the relation model of image gray scale based on the imaging theory of multispectral cameras. Comparisons of image digital number and surface reflectance between the reconstructed coastal blue data and raw coastal blue data showed the relative errors of 4.87% with image gray scale and 3.15% with surface reflectance. The results demonstrate the feasibility of reconstructing and expanding spectrum for major multispectral missions without coastal blue.

TI  - Landslide susceptibility assessment in Wenchuan County after the 5.12 magnitude earthquake
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wenchuan was designated as one of the earthquake-stricken areas after the 2008 5.12-magnitude Wenchuan earthquake. During the decade following the earthquake, many post-earthquake landslides have occurred, seriously threatening the property of the local population's lives and property. At present, there are few long-term spatiotemporal changes studies on landslides generated after the earthquake. The main aim of the present study is to use Landsat multi-period remote sensing image data, combined with post-earthquake landslide interpretation point data, to extract landslide point information from 2011, 2014, and 2018 to analyze the spatial evolution of landslides and define reliable susceptibility models for landslides in 2018 using an assessed certainty factor (CF), an integrated CF with random forest (RF), and an integrated CF with logistic regression (LR). The area under cure (AUC) was used to test the accuracy of the three models and obtain the most reflective susceptibility map. The results show that the RF-CF model produced the optimal result in terms of its AUC value (0.84). Over the past decade, the high-density area has become more concentrated than that of other grades and its coverage small, and its proportion has gradually decreased; the proportion of landslides in low-density areas has been increasing, and its distribution has become more concentrated. These research results fill the gap in the study of temporal and spatial changes in landslides after an earthquake and provide a scientific basis for disaster management and prediction in landslide-prone areas such as Wenchuan.

TI  - A global assessment of PT-JPL soil evaporation in agroecosystems with optical, thermal, and microwave satellite data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) accounts for water movements from land to air and plays a vital role in the terrestrial water, energy, and carbon cycles. Reliable estimates of ET for agricultural landscapes can facilitate water resources management and food security analysis. The widely used Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PTJPL) model has the most potential to operationally simulate ET over large areas, but its inability to fully track soil evaporation dynamics using atmospheric humidity limits its application in agroecosystems. In this study, we isolated the uncertainties resulting from soil evaporation and assessed three Earth observation-based alternatives - apparent thermal inertia (ATI), microwave soil moisture (SM), and optical spectral indices based on shortwave infrared (SWIR) to formulate soil evaporation. Our results illustrate that the incorporation of the SWIR-based soil moisture divergence index (SMDI) and microwave-based SM into monthly soil evaporation led to 6% and 5% increase in explained ET variances and reduced RMSE by 23.2% and 13.1% for cropland and grassland, respectively, as compared to PT-JPL using atmospheric reanalysis data only. Further analyses demonstrated that PT-SMDI explained more observed ET variances than PT-JPL using in-situ measurements of atmospheric humidity during the crop growing season, particularly for irrigated cropland (R-2 = 0.65 for PT-SMDI; R-2 = 0.62 for PT-JPL). On the other hand, the use of microwave SM outperformed other indices for ET assessment in grasslands but had lower performance in croplands. Our results suggest that a combination of optical SWIR and microwave SM has good potential to improve the PT-JPL model accuracy for agricultural landscapes.

TI  - Does 'fast - track' axillary node clearance following positive core biopsy lead to overtreatment of axilla?
T2  - SURGEON-JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL COLLEGES OF SURGEONS OF EDINBURGH AND IRELAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the preferred axillary staging procedure, although axillary node clearance (ANC) is still indicated in subgroups of patients. This study aims to review our practice of axillary treatment in node positive cancer, to determine the proportion of patients requiring ANC and to identify if this can be avoided in some patients.Methods: Retrospective data for all breast cancer patients who underwent surgery between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2018 were included in this study. The histopathology results of ANC were correlated with axillary ultrasound findings, axillary biopsy or SLNB results and effect of neoadjuvant treatment. These were analysed against the available guidelines to evaluate the current practice.Results: 82 patients out of 520 had ANC (15.7%). Four groups were identified: Group A included 45 patients with nodal infiltration on preoperative biopsy; Group B included 24 patients with nodal infiltration who had neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT); Group C included 11 patients with involved nodes on SLNB; Group D included 2 patients with axillary recurrence. 35.5% of patients in Group A had only 1-2 positive nodes following ANC. Complete pathological response was observed in 37.5% patients following NACT. No further nodes were subsequently found in a majority of patients who underwent ANC following positive SLNB (63.6%).Conclusions: 15.7% of breast cancer patients required ANC. Few patients now require ANC following positive SLNB. The practice of direct (fast-track) ANC after axillary biopsy may lead to overtreatment of the axilla, which needs re-evaluation. Targeted axillary dissection could avoid unnecessary axillary dissection in patients with abnormal nodes and in patients who have received NACT.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea-level rise of the Caspian Sea (CS) during the early Khvalynian (approximately 40-25 ka BP) generated hundreds of giant landslides along the sea's ancient coastlines in western Kazakhstan, which extended hundreds of kilometers. Although similar landslides have been observed along the present-day coastlines of the CS in the area of a prominent high escarpment, it remains unclear whether some of these ancient landslides are still active and whether the movement is slow or catastrophic, as previously suggested. The present study is the first to show evidence proving that the geomorphic responses to sea-level changes of the CS that were triggered in the Pleistocene are currently active. Using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data, we show that one of these giant landslides occurring along the western shore of the Kara-Bogaz-Gol (KBG) lagoon of the CS presents active transient motion, which makes it the world's largest active landslide reported thus far. Extending more than 25 km along the eastern coast of the inundated KBG depression in a N-S direction with maximum landward expansion of 5 km from the shoreline to the flat Ustyurt Plateau, this landslide conveys-10 x 10(9) m(3) rocks toward the lagoon at a rate of similar to 2.5 cm/year. This event releases a nearly episodic aseismic moment of 6.0 x 10(10) Nm annually, which is equivalent to the response of an Mw 5.1 earthquake. We analyze the present-day evolution of this giant coastal landslide at high temporal and spatial resolutions using Sentinel-1 radar images acquired on descending and ascending modes every 12 days between 2014 and 2020. Modelling with elastic dislocations suggests that the KBG landslide was accommodated mostly by a shallow basal decollement with a nearly horizontal listric slip plane. Moreover, our analysis reveals week-long accelerating slip events at changing amplitudes that occur seasonally with slow, lateral spreading rather than sudden catastrophic motion. A strong correlation between the episodic slip events and seasonal water-level changes in the KBG lagoon suggests a causative mechanism for the transient accelerating slip events. Although water-level changes are widely acknowledged to trigger transient motion on a land mass, such movement, which is similar to a silent earthquake, has not been observed thus far at this mega scale; on an extremely low-angle detachment planes at <5 degrees with modulation by sea-level changes. This study suggests that present-day sea-level changes can reactivate giant landslides that originated 40-25 ka.

TI  - Monitoring long-term riparian vegetation trends to inform local habitat management in a mountainous environment
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian ecosystems provide critical habitat for many species, yet assessment of vegetation condition at local scales is difficult to measure when considering large areas over long time periods. We present a framework to map and monitor two deciduous cover types, upland and riparian, occupying a small fraction of an expansive, mountainous landscape in north-central Wyoming. Initially, we developed broad-scale predictions of predominant woody vegetation types by integrating Landsat data into species distribution models and combining subsequent outputs into a synthesis map. Then, we evaluated a 35-year Landsat time series (1985-2019) using the Mann-Kendall test to identify significant trends in the condition of upland and riparian deciduous vegetation and assessed the rate and direction of change using the Theil-Sen estimator. Finally, we used plot level data to assess the utility of the framework to detect bottom-up controls (ungulate browse pressure and management actions) on vegetation condition. The synthesis map had an overall correct classification rate of 87% and field data indicated deciduous vegetation within 45 m of coniferous forest faces increased pressure of conifer expansion. The trend assessment identified consistent patterns operating at the landscape scale across both upland and riparian deciduous vegetation; a predominant greening trend was observed for 12 years followed by a 9-year browning trend, before switching back to a greening trend for the last 13 years of the study. Our results indicate trends are driven by the climate of the measurement period at the landscape scale. Although we did not find conclusive evidence to establish a strong link between browse pressure and satellite data, we highlight examples where prevailing trends can be overridden by local disturbance or management intervention. This framework is transferable to other understudied riparian environments throughout western North America to provide insight on ecohydrological processes and assess global and local stressors across broad spatiotemporal scales.

TI  - Estimating lockdown-induced European NO<sub>2</sub> changes using satellite and surface observations and air quality models
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study provides a comprehensive assessment of NO2 changes across the main European urban areas induced by COVID-19 lockdowns using satellite retrievals from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5p satellite, surface site measurements, and simulations from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) regional ensemble of air quality models. Some recent TROPOMI-based estimates of changes in atmospheric NO2 concentrations have neglected the influence of weather variability between the reference and lockdown periods. Here we provide weather-normalized estimates based on a machine learning method (gradient boosting) along with an assessment of the biases that can be expected from methods that omit the influence of weather. We also compare the weather-normalized satellite-estimated NO2 column changes with weather-normalized surface NO2 concentration changes and the CAMS regional ensemble, composed of 11 models, using recently published estimates of emission reductions induced by the lockdown. All estimates show similar NO2 reductions. Locations where the lockdown measures were stricter show stronger reductions, and, conversely, locations where softer measures were implemented show milder reductions in NO2 pollution levels. Average reduction estimates based on either satellite observations (-23 %), surface stations (-43 %), or models (-32 %) are presented, showing the importance of vertical sampling but also the horizontal representativeness. Surface station estimates are significantly changed when sampled to the TROPOMI overpasses (-37 %), pointing out the importance of the variability in time of such estimates. Observation-based machine learning estimates show a stronger temporal variability than model-based estimates.

TI  - A Hybrid Level Set Based Approach for Surface Water Delineation using Landsat-8 Multispectral Images
T2  - ENGINEERING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection and delineation of surface water is a crucial step in change detection studies on water bodies using satellite images. Single band methods, spectral index methods, classification using machine learning and spectral unmixing methods are the widely used strategies for surface water mapping from multi-spectral images. Level set theory based algorithms have been successfully employed in image segmentation problems and are proven to be effective. This study presents a hybrid level set theory based segmentation algorithm which is a combination of edge based and region based approaches to detect and delineate surface water bodies in Landsat 8 images. Level set algorithms were applied in combination with Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) to further improve the delineation accuracy. Robustness of the proposed approach was established by successfully applying the algorithm to delineate water bodies of different sizes, ranging from 0.5 km(2) to 298 km(2) in surface area. The proposed algorithm was also compared with established machine learning based delineation methods and found to be faster than the algorithms those produced comparable delineation outputs. As the ground truth was not available for accuracy measurement, the output image of the proposed method was compared with the outputs of the machine learning algorithms using Pearsons correlation co-efficient, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Dice Similarity Index. The proposed algorithm was subsequently applied to multi-temporal Landsat data for water body change detection and analysis.

TI  - Patterns of bird species richness explained by annual variation in remotely sensed Dynamic Habitat Indices
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bird species richness is highly dependent on the amount of energy available in an ecosystem, with more available energy supporting higher species richness. A good indicator for available energy is Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), which can be estimated from satellite data.Our question was how temporal dynamics in GPP affect bird species richness. Specifically, we evaluated the potential of the Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) derived from MODIS GPP data together with environmental and climatic variables to explain annual patterns in bird richness across the conterminous United States. By focusing on annual DHIs, we expand on previous applications of multi-year composite DHIs, and could evaluate lag-effects between changes in GPP and species richness.We used 8-day GPP data from 2003 to 2013 to calculate annual DHIs, which capture three aspects of vegetation productivity: (1) annual cumulative productivity, (2) annual minimum productivity, and (3) annual seasonality expressed as the coefficient of variation in productivity. For each year from 2003 to 2013, we calculated total bird species richness and richness within six functional guilds, based on North American Breeding Bird Survey data.The DHIs alone explained up to 53% of the variation in annual bird richness within the different guilds (adjusted deviance-squared D-adj(2) = 0.20-0.52), and up to 75% of the variation (D-adj(2) = 0.28-0.75) when combined with other environmental and climatic variables. Annual DHIs had the highest explanatory power for habitat-based guilds, such as grassland (D-adj(2) = 0.67) and woodland breeding species (D-adj(2) = 0.75). We found some inter-annual variability in the explanatory power of annual DHIs, with a difference of 5-7 percentage points in explained variation among years in DHI-only models, and 3-7 points for models combining DHI, environmental and climatic variables. Our results using lagged year models did not deviate substantially from same-year annual models.We demonstrate the relevance of annual DHIs for biodiversity science, as effective predictors of temporal variation in species richness patterns. We suggest that the use of annual DHIs can improve conservation planning, by conveying the range of patterns of biodiversity response to global changes, over time.

TI  - Mapping fine-scale human disturbances in a working landscape with Landsat time series on Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large fractions of human-altered lands are working landscapes where people and nature interact to balance social, economic, and ecological needs. Achieving these sustainability goals requires tracking human footprints and landscape disturbance at fine scales over time-an effort facilitated by remote sensing but still under development. Here, we report a satellite time-series analysis approach to detecting fine-scale human disturbances in an Ohio watershed dominated by forests and pastures but with diverse small-scale industrial activities such as hydraulic fracturing (HF) and surface mining. We leveraged Google Earth Engine to stack decades of Landsat images and explored the effectiveness of a fuzzy change detection algorithm called the Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonality, and Trend (BEAST) to capture fine-scale disturbances. BEAST is an ensemble method, capable of estimating changepoints probabilistically and identifying sub-pixel disturbances. We found the algorithm can successfully capture the patterns and timings of small-scale disturbances, such as grazing, agriculture management, coal mining, HF, and right-of-ways for gas and power lines, many of which were not captured in the annual land cover maps from Cropland Data Layers-one of the most widely used classification-based land dynamics products in the US. For example, BEAST could detect the initial HF wellpad construction within 60 days of the registered drilling dates on 88.2% of the sites. The wellpad footprints were small, disturbing only 0.24% of the watershed in area, which was dwarfed by other activities (e.g., right-of-ways of utility transmission lines). Together, these known activities have disturbed 9.7% of the watershed from the year 2000 to 2017 with evergeen forests being the most affected land cover. This study provides empirical evidence on the effectiveness and reliability of BEAST for changepoint detection as well as its capability to detect disturbances from satellite images at sub-pixel levels and also documents the value of Google Earth Engine and satellite time-series imaging for monitoring human activities in complex working landscapes.

TI  - Contextualising assessment within Aotearoa New Zealand: drawing from matauranga Maori
T2  - ALTERNATIVE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
M3  - Article
AB  - There is long-standing disparity between the schooling success of many Maori (Indigenous peoples of Aotearoa New Zealand) learners and non-Maori learners. While much work internationally and nationally has focussed on culturally responsive pedagogies, the idea of culturally sustaining assessment has received less attention. Given the historical dominance of a West-centric education system, assessment practices within Aotearoa New Zealand schools have not necessarily embedded a Maori worldview. Informed by cultural advice, assessment constructs that embody manaakitanga (care, respect, hospitality), wananga (a forum, a sharing of knowledge, a place of learning) and culturally sustaining pedagogy were examined alongside a literature review and analysis of interviews with four education practitioners. Results show that assessment can be designed to acknowledge Maori learners' capabilities and educational successes. Findings, presented using a Hauora Approach to Assessment (Well-being Approach to Assessment) framework, provide much needed ways for teachers to contextualise assessment within matauranga Maori (Maori knowledge system).

TI  - A Nonconvex Pansharpening Model With Spatial and Spectral Gradient Difference-Induced Nonconvex Sparsity Priors
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposed a nonconvex variational model for pansharpening with spatial and spectral gradient difference-induced nonconvex sparsity priors (PSSGDNSP), which can fuse the panchromatic (Pan) and low-resolution (LR) multispectral (MS) images to generate the high-resolution (HR) MS image. More particularly, the proposed PSSGDNSP model exploits the spatial gradient difference-induced nonconvex l1/2 sparsity prior between HR MS and Pan, and the spectral gradient difference-induced nonconvex l1/2 sparsity prior between HR and LR MS. Consequently, our proposed PSSGDNSP model well preserves both the spatial and spectral information. In fact, our proposed band-coupled model treats the MS image like a third-order tensor so that the intrinsic band correlation of the MS image can be fully kept. Moreover, we solve our proposed PSSGDNSP model by applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method. Finally, the experiments fully validate the superiority and performance of our proposed PSSGDNSP method.

TI  - XGBoost-based method for flash flood risk assessment
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash flood risk assessment, a widely applied technology in preventing catastrophic flash flood disasters, has become the current research hotspot. However, most existing machine learning methods for assessing flash flood risk rely on a single classifier, which is suitable for processing small sets of sample data, but the resulting prediction accuracy and generalization ability are insufficient. Meanwhile, machine learning methods that integrate multiple classifiers are thus far unknown. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is an excellent algorithm for ensemble learning methods which has achieved remarkable results in many fields. It not only optimizes the algorithm but also automatically applies the CPU's multi-threading to perform parallel calculations, thus greatly improving the model training speed and prediction accuracy. Therefore, this article introduces the XGBoost model for the assessment of flash flood risk, and then combines the two input strategies and the Least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) model to verify its optimal effect, thus proposing the XGBoost-based method for flash flood risk assessment. Subsequently, an attribution analysis was implemented to assess the possible errors of this approach; and finally, a county-level flash flood risk map for Yunnan Province, China, was generated based on the proposed method. The results demonstrate that: (1) XGBoost performs well, with an accuracy of 0.84 in the testing period, and its five indices (precision, recall, accuracy, kappa, and F-score) are all higher than those of LSSVM. (2) The XGBoost-based approach provided the reliable flash flood risk maps, which were validated by another flash flood inventory, although some errors may be attributed to critical environmental factors and statistical disaster location accuracy. (3) The high-risk counties (including high-risk and highest-risk) accounted for 40.3%, with the highest-risk counties mainly concentrated in southeastern Yunnan. This article further addresses the limitations of XGBoost (e.g., as a time-consuming greedy algorithm, the non-necessity of multi-threaded optimization). All of the above results indicate that the XGBoost-based method is an effective method for obtaining high-quality county-level flash flood risk maps, which contributes to the theoretical basis for ongoing county-level flash flood prevention in China.

T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - tau he eddy covariance technique provides reliable ecosystem-level ET measurements. These measurements, when combined with models and satellite products, could offer high spatiotemporal coverage and valuable mechanistic interpretation of the underlying processes. This study address one-year eddy covariance measurements from a Robinia pseudoacacia site in Northern Greece and remote sensing products, we (a) provide a medium-term description of daily ET fluxes for a R. pseudoacacia plantation in a degraded land, (b) assess the contribution of environmental drivers (e.g., net radiation, temperature etc) on ET and (c) evaluate a simple satellite and meteorological driven model for larger-scale applications, based on the land surface water index (LSWI) and the FAO approach. R. pseudoacacia was found to have quite high water consumption, especially during leaf expansion. Net radiation and soil water content had the greatest effect on ecosystem evapotranspiration. LSWI was found to be correlated with both soil water content and evapotranspiration. Its use as an index for water limitation in models lead to high accuracy when compared to ET measurements. Our results (a) provide a significant contribution to the assessment of R. pseudoacacia ecophysiology and (b) highlight the potential of accurate ecosystem ET estimation with simple modeling approaches.

TI  - Health and sustainability of glaciers in High Mountain Asia
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in High Mountain Asia generate meltwater that supports the water needs of 250 million people, but current knowledge of annual accumulation and ablation is limited to sparse field measurements biased in location and glacier size. Here, we present altitudinally-resolved specific mass balances (surface, internal, and basal combined) for 5527 glaciers in High Mountain Asia for 2000-2016, derived by correcting observed glacier thinning patterns for mass redistribution due to ice flow. We find that 41% of glaciers accumulated mass over less than 20% of their area, and only 60% 10% of regional annual ablation was compensated by accumulation. Even without 21(st) century warming, 21% +/- 1% of ice volume will be lost by 2100 due to current climatic-geometric imbalance, representing a reduction in glacier ablation into rivers of 28% +/- 1%. The ablation of glaciers in the Himalayas and Tien Shan was mostly unsustainable and ice volume in these regions will reduce by at least 30% by 2100. The most important and vulnerable glacier-fed river basins (Amu Darya, Indus, Syr Darya, Tarim Interior) were supplied with >50% sustainable glacier ablation but will see long-term reductions in ice mass and glacier meltwater supply regardless of the Karakoram Anomaly.Glaciers in High Mountain Asia are a key water resource. The authors use remote sensing data and a regional implementation of the continuity equation to quantify glacier ablation and accumulation rates for 2000-2016, and establish current climatic-geometric imbalances that imply strong reductions in ice volume by 2100.

TI  - Evaluation of Nonparametric SAR Tomography Methods for Urban Building Reconstruction
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the synthetic aperture radar tomography (TomoSAR) technique has attracted significant attention owing to its 3-D reconstruction capability of complex urban environments. The availability of a high number of images is usually a requirement for nonparametric spectral estimation methods. This letter evaluates the potential of four nonparametric spectral estimation algorithms, that is: 1) linear prediction (LP); 2) minimum norm (MN); 3) singular value decomposition (SVD); and 4) Capon for improved tomographic reconstruction of the third dimension of built-up areas with a small number of observations. The performance analysis is carried out for both simulated and real SAR datasets. The returns from the employed techniques indicate the efficient and low-computational estimator of LP by minimizing the average output signal power at the array of antenna elements and make it possible to separate multiple scatters at a distance below the Rayleigh resolution and clean sidelobes' phenomena in the elevation profiles. The experimental results of a dataset acquired by the TerraSAR-X sensor verify the effectiveness of the LP spectral estimator algorithm in the reconstruction of urban buildings. The estimated height of scatterers with the LP method is considerably similar to the ground-observed data.

AB  - Aim The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of preoperative axillary ultrasonography (AUS) and preoperative axillary fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) from suspicious lymph nodes in clinically node-negative breast cancer to compare with radiologically positive and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) positive involvement.Method Clinically node-negative early-stage breast cancer patients were included in the study. These patients underwent preoperative AUS examination, suspicious lymph nodes were evaluated with FNAB. AUS-FNAB results were compared with those of SLNB or axillary dissection.Results Of 181 patients undergoing AUS, 32 were reported to have axillary metastasis, 25 suspicious, and 124 benign nodes. The suspicious group underwent FNAB examination and metastasis was found in 9 of them. The sensitivity of AUS-FNAB was found to be 64.06%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value 100%, and negative predictive value (NPV) 83.5%. The false negativity rate (FN) of this method was 16,4%. Lymphovascular invasion and tumour size were found statistically significant factors for false negativity.Conclusion It was concluded that axillary AUS-FNAB with its high NPV, low FN rate, may be a clinical alternative to SLNB for early-stage breast cancer patients.

TI  - Evidence for the Impact of Climate Change on Primary Producers in the Southern Ocean
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the framework of the Marine Ecosystem Assessment for the Southern Ocean (MEASO), this paper brings together analyses of recent trends in phytoplankton biomass, primary production and irradiance at the base of the mixed layer in the Southern Ocean and summarises future projections. Satellite observations suggest that phytoplankton biomass in the mixed-layer has increased over the last 20 years in most (but not all) parts of the Southern Ocean, whereas primary production at the base of the mixed-layer has likely decreased over the same period. Different satellite models of primary production (Vertically Generalised versus Carbon Based Production Models) give different patterns and directions of recent change in net primary production (NPP). At present, the satellite record is not long enough to distinguish between trends and climate-related cycles in primary production. Over the next 100 years, Earth system models project increasing NPP in the water column in the MEASO northern and Antarctic zones but decreases in the Subantarctic zone. Low confidence in these projections arises from: (1) the difficulty in mapping supply mechanisms for key nutrients (silicate, iron); and (2) understanding the effects of multiple stressors (including irradiance, nutrients, temperature, pCO(2), pH, grazing) on different species of Antarctic phytoplankton. Notwithstanding these uncertainties, there are likely to be changes to the seasonal patterns of production and the microbial community present over the next 50-100 years and these changes will have ecological consequences across Southern Ocean food-webs, especially on key species such as Antarctic krill and silverfish.

TI  - High-resolution and multi-year estimation of emissions from open biomass burning in Northeast China during 2001-2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Open biomass burning (OBB) significantly impacts regional and global air quality, climate change, and human health. Northeast China (NEC) is susceptible to OBB, including forest, shrubland, grassland, peatland, and cropland burning. Here, we develop a high-resolution (1 km x 1 km), multi-year (2001-2017), and monthly emission inventory associated with OBB in NEC using the burned area product (MCD64A1), satellite and observational biomass data, vegetation index-derived spatiotemporal variable combustion efficiency, and emission factors. The emissions produced from the burning of 11 types of crop-residues were calculated using measured and MODIS fire radiative power (FRP) data. The results showed that the average annual OBB emissions in NEC for 2001-2017 were 23.4, 95.1, 1538.0, 30,816.8, 18.8, 258.5, 69.8, 133.7, 225.3, 321.8, and 11.3 Gg of BC, CH4, CO, CO2, NH3, NMVOC, NOx, OC, PM2.5, PM10, and SO2, respectively. Taking CO2 as an example, crop residue burning was observed to be the largest contributor of CO2 overall, accounting for 68% (20.9 x 10 3 Gg a(-1)) of the total CO2 emissions, which was followed by forest (30%) and grassland (2%) fires. Heilongjiang Province was the largest emitter of CO2 (16.7 x 10(3) Gg a(-1)) compared to Jilin (5.8 x 10 3 Gg a(-1)), Inner Mongolia (5.3 x 10(3) Gg a(-1)), and Liaoning (3.0 x 10(3) Gg a(-1)). Crop residue burning was dominant in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning, while forest fires were dominant in Inner Mongolia. Furthermore, CO2 emissions showed considerable interannual variability, with peaks in 2003 and 2008. Extensive burning of crop residues in the four provinces jointly determined these peak CO2 emissions, which occurred in March and October. Our high-resolution and multi-year inventory of OBB emissions can be applied to air quality modeling, atmospheric transport simulation, and biogeochemical cycling studies.

TI  - DeepRivWidth : Deep learning based semantic segmentation approach for river identification and width measurement in SAR images of Coastal Karnataka
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - River width is an essential parameter for studying the river's hydrological process and has been widely used to estimate the river discharge. The existing approaches to measuring river width are based on remotely sensed imagery such as MODIS, Landsat to identify the river, and then estimate the river width. In this work, an alternate approach for river width estimation is proposed using the under-explored modality Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. SAR, unlike the traditional electro-optical sensors, can penetrate the clouds and can be used to collect the data in all weather conditions and even during the night. In this work, the river identification process is manifested as a binary semantic segmentation task in SAR images. For this, two state of the art deep learning algorithms (U-Net, DeepLabV3+) are utilized for river identification and subsequent width measurement. The proposed approach (DeepRivWidth) is used to estimate the width of the river of the Mangalore-Udupi region of Coastal Karnataka (India). These rivers originate or pass through Western Ghats (UNESCO world heritage site), and the proposed river width measurement approach could provide critical input for ecologists besides assisting efficient water management of the region. The estimated width is compared with the manually measured width, and significant improvement in the accuracy was obtained compared to existing river width measurement approaches. Besides, the performance evaluation of semantic segmentation approaches for river identification on a publicly available dataset provides valuable insights into segmenting rivers in SAR images.

TI  - Pan-Sharpening Based on Panchromatic Image Spectral Learning Using WorldView-2
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to adequately preserve the spatial information of panchromatic (PAN) image and the spectral information of multispectral (MS) image, this study proposes a method to learn the spectral information of MS based on the PAN image. In the spectral learning model, the PAN is degraded to the spatial resolution of the MS. Then, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is adopted to learn the spectral information between the degraded PAN and the original MS. In addition, the spectral evaluation index--spectral angle mapper (SAM) is used for controlling the spectral losses. Finally, the high spatial resolution MS (HMS) can be obtained through the trained model by using the original PAN as the test input. Besides, seven representative pan-sharpening algorithms and seven widely recognized objective fusion metrics are used to compare and evaluate the performance on the WorldView-2 experimental data, respectively. The results show that the proposed method achieves the purpose of pan-sharpening well, especially maintaining the optimal spectral information.

TI  - Assessment of the environmental changes in arid and semiarid mining areas using long time-series Landsat images
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal mining provides energy to support the development of society. However, mining affects the environment. Thus, substantial attention has been placed on environmental change in mining areas. Research assessing the environmental change in arid and semiarid mining areas has mainly been conducted by analyzing the variation in a single factor. However, the impact of coal mining on the environment is manifold, and there is no comprehensive assessment method. In this paper, we used a remote sensing index referred to as the comprehensive evaluation index (CEI) to comprehensively assess the environmental changes in arid and semiarid mining areas. The CEI in this study was calculated by integrating the changes in vegetation coverage (VC), land surface temperature (LST), and soil moisture (SM) using long time-series Landsat images. The Shendong mining area located in Northwest China was the study area. The results indicate that the environment of the Shendong mining area improved overall from 2000 to 2018. Environmentally degraded areas accounted for approximately 7.59% of the mining area and were concentrated in areas damaged by coal mining.

TI  - Dynamic landscapes and the driving forces in the Yellow River Delta wetland region in the past four decades
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands provide a broad range of ecosystem services, such as flood control, groundwater replenishment, and water purification. These services are particularly important in the Yellow River Delta, one of four estuarine deltas in China. The aim of this study was to examine the patterns and drivers forces of wetland landscape in the Yellow River Delta. We analyzed the spatio-temporal characteristics of land use change and dynamic landscape patterns changes between 1980 and 2018, divided into eight periods, from land use and remote sensing data. We also analyzed data for annual precipitation, annual temperature, annual evapotranspiration, digital elevation, slope, distance from the main river, built-up land, GDP, and population with principal component analysis, to identify the main drivers behind the changes in the wetland landscape. The results showed that, from 1980 to 2018, the total area of wetland decreased first and then increased the total area of wetland increased and was 1172.73 km(2) greater in 2018 than it was in 1980, and the types of wetland in the Yellow River Delta changed frequently. From 1980 to 2005, the area of wetland decreased and the landscape dominance and degree of fragmentation were relatively high. From 2006 to 2018, as environmental policies were implemented and wetland protection became more important, the rate of development of wetland areas increased in a north-south direction, the proportion of landscape types became more balanced, and the spatial distribution homogenized. The main drivers of change in the wetland landscapes were GDP, population, precipitation, and temperature which were included 81.852% of the original information. The findings from this study provide us with an improved understanding of how land use and wetland landscapes changed from 1980 and 2018 and may have implications for the protection of wetland ecosystems, species diversity, and sustainable development.

TI  - Characteristics of vegetation response to drought in the CONUS based on long-term remote sensing and meteorological data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the billion-dollar natural disasters and hard to trace and measure. In recent years drought monitoring becomes much easier with remote sensing. However, it is still difficult to pin vegetation variances on drought because of the delay of the caused vegetation stress. To assess vegetative drought, it is important to first understand the relationship between meteorological condition and vegetation condition, and measure the vegetation responses to meteorological drought. It would be very helpful for effective early warning about agricultural drought. This study uses the CONUS as the study area, and utilizes remote sensing products such as NDVI/VCI (normalized difference vegetation index/vegetation condition index) and SPI/SPEI (standardized precipitation index/standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index) to give a comparative evaluation to the vegetation's drought response. The used vegetation products and meteorological data are ensured to be consistent. The scale and lag of vegetation response to drought for various vegetation types and aridity levels were thoroughly investigated. The results show that: The AVHRR and MODIS NDVI series pairs and the meteorological drought index series pairs (SPEI and SPI) have fairly good consistencies. Among them, 69.5% and 84% have rho (correlation coefficient) values greater than 0.8 respectively. For the NDVI series pairs, the maximum rho value is 0.98, the minimum rho value is -0.47, and the mean rho value is 0.79, which are 0.97, 0.68, and 0.87 respectively for the meteorological index series pairs. Compared to rho values of the meteorological index series pairs, the rho values of the NDVI series pairs have more outliers indicating instability. The correlation between SPEI and VCI significantly relies on time lags and has high spatial inhomogeneity. 1- and 2-month lags of SPEI have more significant positive correlation with VCI in Arid, Semi-Arid and Dry sub-humid areas of central west CONUS with less precipitation and lower temperature. For various time scales (time scale is SPEI reference range), the most significant positive correlation between SPEI and VCI happens in the time scales of 6- to 12month in summer, the time scales of 3- and 6-month in spring and autumn, and the time scales of 2- and 3month in winter regardless of time lags. Despite of the different vegetation types and aridity levels, the maximum correlations between SPEI and VCI are observed in Hyper arid regions in January, Arid regions in April, Semi-arid regions in July, and Dry sub-humid regions in October. Shrub has prominent responses in January and April, grass responses appear in July and October, and Evergreen forest shows least responses in all seasons. The results add more insights of the connection between vegetation and climate, and guide the development of new technology leveraging remote sensing data for vegetation drought monitoring and earlywarning. The results are also helpful to provide important references for studying large-scale physiological and phenological properties of the vegetation under different climate conditions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations and long term trends analysis of aerosol optical depth over the United Arab Emirates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This research provides a comprehensive long term time series analysis of the spatiotemporal variability of aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the United Arab Emirates (UAE) using MODIS (Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) MAIAC (Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction) AOD (aerosol optical depth) product for the period 2003-2018. The UAE is located in one of the driest places on earth, the Arabian Peninsula, with two large extended desert regions that form major atmospheric dust sources in the world. The atmospheric dust emitted by these vast deserts is transported locally and regionally and it is the primary major contributor to the overall aerosol optical depth in this area. The investigation of the spatiotemporal trends of AOD over the UAE showed a significant obvious annual seasonal variability. Results showed a significant increase in AOD during summer due to high wind speed, resulting in scattered events of small to large scale haboobs within the study area, high temperature, and high relative humidity. The increased humidity levels are due to increased temperatures in the summer season leading to significant evaporation from the neighbouring water bodies (mainly the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman) leading to a significant increase in water vapour levels in the atmosphere. Summar AOD values during the study period ranged between 0.42 - 0.73. The second highest AOD was observed in spring followed by winter. Spring AOD values ranged between 0.33-0.58 and winter values ranged between 0.25 - 0.41. The spatial distributions of AOD showed higher values over the coastal and desert areas. Coastal areas portrayed higher values as well likely due to the high levels of evaporation and increased anthropogenic activities such as coastal urban developments and automobile pollution. Time series analysis of the multitemporal dataset confirmed the SARIMA forecast model as the best fit which can be used to provide an accurate and reliable monthly forecast for the AOD concentrations in the UAE.

TI  - An Aerosol Climatology and Implications for Clouds at a Remote Marine Site: Case Study Over Bermuda
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol characteristics and aerosol-cloud interactions remain uncertain in remote marine regions. We use over a decade of data (2000-2012) from the NASA AErosol RObotic NETwork, aerosol and wet deposition samples, satellite remote sensors, and models to examine aerosol and cloud droplet number characteristics at a representative open ocean site (Bermuda) over the Western North Atlantic Ocean (WNAO). Annual mean values were as follows: aerosol optical depth (AOD) = 0.12, angstrom ngstrom Exponent (440/870 nm) = 0.95, fine mode fraction = 0.51, asymmetry factor = 0.72 (440 nm) and 0.68 (1020 nm), and Aqua-MODIS cloud droplet number concentrations = 51.3 cm(-3). The winter season (December-February) was characterized by high sea salt optical thickness and the highest aerosol extinction in the lowest 2 km. Extensive precipitation over the WNAO in winter helps contribute to the low FMFs in winter (similar to 0.40-0.50) even though air trajectories often originate over North America. Spring and summer had more pronounced influence from sulfate, dust, organic carbon, and black carbon. Volume size distributions were bimodal with a dominant coarse mode (effective radii: 1.85-2.09 mu m) and less pronounced fine mode (0.14-0.16 mu m), with variability in the coarse mode likely due to different characteristic sizes for transported dust (smaller) versus regional sea salt (larger). Extreme pollution events highlight the sensitivity of this site to long-range transport of urban emissions, dust, and smoke. Differing annual cycles are identified between AOD and cloud droplet number concentrations, motivating a deeper look into aerosol-cloud interactions at this site.

TI  - A Modified Built-up Index (MBI) for automatic urban area extraction from Landsat 8 Imagery
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic extraction of built-up areas utilizing built-up indices has increased attention due to their use in monitoring urban growth and environment related problems. In this research study, a new Modified Built-up Index (MBI) is proposed utilizing Landsat 8 Imagery. This technique is developed by combining advanced slope based indexing technique built-up index (ASIT_BI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and brightness temperature (TB). For this study, the optimal threshold values are obtained using Otsu's thresholding method and modified two-stage multi-threshold Otsu (TSMO) method. Built-up area mapping/extraction using MBI is also compared with two other built-up indices namely ASIT_BI and MNDISI in term of accuracy assessment using recent Landsat 8 images. The results indicate that built-up indices are greatly affected by seasonality of image. The proposed Modified Built-up Index (MBI) results in highest mapping accuracy for all the four seasons with highest overall agreement of 97.8% for spring season. The proposed MBI method is more effective than previous built-up indexing methods because of the improved ability to separate built-up land from barren land.

TI  - Rice phenology mapping using novel target characterization parameters from polarimetric SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We require spatio-temporal information about rice for executing and planning diverse management practices. In this regard, data obtained from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors are well suited for tracking morphological developments of rice across its phenology stages. This study proposes different target characterization parameters from polarimetric SAR data for rice phenology mapping. Six C-band Radarsat-2 images acquired over Vijayawada, India, are used for complete analysis. It is known that polarimetric information provides excellent sensitivity for identifying crop phenology stages. Hence, in this study, we assessed phenology classification results using a scattering-type parameter and scattering powers for full-polarimetric (FP) and extracted dual-polarimetric (DP) SAR data. Here, we utilized the real 4. 4 Kennaugh matrix elements to derive these parameters equivalently for the two polarimetric modes (i.e. FP and DP). We obtained better overall classification accuracy for each phenology stages using the proposed parameters than the existing ones from FP and DP SAR data. We noted that the overall classification accuracy using the DP SAR data was only marginally lower than the FP SAR data. This marginal difference in the accuracies could be due to the absence of the cross-polarized component in the DP SAR data. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the scattering powers from DP SAR data for rice phenology monitoring.

TI  - Differences in the Diurnal Variation of Precipitation Estimated by Spaceborne Radar, Passive Microwave Radiometer, and IMERG
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate, high-resolution measurements of the precipitation diurnal cycle are important for understanding local variations in precipitation and the underlying processes which cause them. Combining 16 years of measurements from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) and 4 years from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) creates a 20-year mean of near surface precipitation rate at 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees, hourly resolution from 35 degrees N to 35 degrees S. Similar data sets are created using the same proportions of the TRMM Microwave Imager and GPM Microwave Imager measurements, and 18 years of the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) precipitation product. The phase and amplitude of the diurnal variation from each data set are calculated at each grid point using a fast Fourier transform (FFT). The satellite data are validated with 14 years of hourly National Climatic Data Center rain gauge measurements over the southeast United States by applying the same FFT method. Spaceborne radar best represents the unaveraged magnitude and diurnal phase measured by the gauges in this region. Time delays are found in precipitation retrievals from passive microwave observations as well as in the IMERG product. The strengths and weaknesses of these high-resolution data sets in determining the diurnal cycle of precipitation on a climatological scale are discussed across the tropics and subtropics. In general, when compared to PR and DPR retrievals, IMERG overestimates the global precipitation and has varying time lags, which tend to be larger and earlier over regions where organized convective systems are common.

TI  - Aerial scene understanding in the wild: Multi-scene recognition via prototype-based memory networks
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerial scene recognition is a fundamental visual task and has attracted an increasing research interest in the last few years. Most of current researches mainly deploy efforts to categorize an aerial image into one scene-level label, while in real-world scenarios, there often exist multiple scenes in a single image. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to take a step forward to a more practical and challenging task, namely multi-scene recognition in single images. Moreover, we note that manually yielding annotations for such a task is extraordinarily time- and labor-consuming. To address this, we propose a prototype-based memory network to recognize multiple scenes in a single image by leveraging massive well-annotated single-scene images. The proposed network consists of three key components: 1) a prototype learning module, 2) a prototype-inhabiting external memory, and 3) a multi-head attention-based memory retrieval module. To be more specific, we first learn the prototype representation of each aerial scene from single-scene aerial image datasets and store it in an external memory. Afterwards, a multi-head attention-based memory retrieval module is devised to retrieve scene prototypes relevant to query multi-scene images for final predictions. Notably, only a limited number of annotated multiscene images are needed in the training phase. To facilitate the progress of aerial scene recognition, we produce a new multi-scene aerial image (MAI) dataset. Experimental results on variant dataset configurations demonstrate the effectiveness of our network. Our dataset and codes are publicly available(1).

TI  - Opposite Contributions of Stationary and Traveling Planetary Waves in the Northern Hemisphere Winter Middle Atmosphere
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates contributions of planetary waves (PWs) to the mean flow in the middle atmosphere during the Northern Hemisphere winter when PW activities are strong, by analyzing satellite data from Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER). It is suggested that there would be opposite contributions between easterly acceleration by monthly mean stationary planetary waves (STPWs) and westerly acceleration by remaining traveling planetary waves (TRPWs) in the high-latitude lower mesosphere. When easterly winds appear in the mesosphere, STPWs propagating from the troposphere dissipate in the lower mesosphere to accelerate easterly winds because STPWs could not propagate in easterly wind regions. On the other hand, TRPWs develop there due to the zonal flow instability to accelerate westerly winds. The easterly wind in the mesosphere is frequently triggered by dissipation of westward TRPWs developed in the stratosphere, and would be maintained by these opposite contributions for more than 10 days. Further analyses suggest that the TRPW developing in the high-latitude lower mesosphere would be an eastward TRPW of zonal wavenumber 1 and a period of 10-40 days. This TRPW would develop and propagate downward to dismiss the baroclinic instability by eliminating warm temperature anomalies formed below the easterly wind region due to the PW dissipation in the mesosphere.

TI  - A Climatological View of Horizontal Ice Plates in Clouds: Findings From Nadir and Off-Nadir CALIPSO Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - We study horizontal ice plates in clouds using satellite lidar measurements of the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). This study investigates global microphysical and geographical properties of horizontal ice plates to obtain insights into ice-plate climatology based on lidar's long-term measurements during 2006-2014. We then summarize the effects of the lidar's viewing angle change from 0.3 degrees to 3.0 degrees in 2007 on satellite particle phase/shape classifications. Using a classification algorithm developed in the previous studies, we show that the ice plate detection decreases by 81.7% due the tilting. With an updated version of this algorithm, 30.8% of these are recovered, although 50.8% remain undetected. Nevertheless, this study also shows that geographical characteristics of ice plates are still preserved during the off-nadir period (within the remaining 50%), suggesting the undiscovered climatological information on ice plates in the post-2007 observations. According to our analysis, the tilting mainly affects horizontal ice plate detection, while the impacts on water and randomly oriented ice detections are limited. The temperature of the ice plates ranges from -25.5 degrees C and -7.5 degrees C, with a mode temperature of -13.5 degrees C, although the ice plates also occur ubiquitously across mid- to high-latitudes between -20 degrees C and -40 degrees C, which is much colder than what found in previous nadir studies. This study offers a detailed discussion on the fundamental characteristics of horizontal ice plates that will provide robust information for the algorithm preparation for future satellite lidar observations such as the Earth, Clouds, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE).

TI  - The 2-Day Photochemical Oscillations in the Mesopause Region: The First Experimental Evidence?
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyze the main features of the 2-day photochemical oscillations (2DPO) in the mesopause region (80-90 km) caused by the nonlinear response of mesospheric chemistry to 1-day variations of solar radiation. The main indicators of 2DPO useful for subsequent detection of this phenomenon in satellite data are extracted from the theoretical data sets obtained using different chemical-transport modeling approaches. The indicators are applied to find examples of these oscillations in the nighttime profiles of H and O concentration for the year 2003, taken from the SABER database. The 2DPO appearance/suppression is controlled by a local value of vertical eddy diffusion coefficient Dzz which is a critical parameter for three-dimensional constituent distributions in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Thus, the experimental registration of 2DPO can be used to validate and subsequently improve the retrieval procedures in future determinations of a detailed distribution of Dzz.

TI  - Towards physical habitat characterisation in the Antarctic Sor Rondane Mountains using satellite remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice-free areas occupy less than 0.25% of the Antarctic surface, and mainly occur along coastlines, or as inland nunataks protruding from the extensive ice sheet. Their extreme environment and geographical isolation have contributed to the evolution of highly adapted, and largely endemic terrestrial biota. Physical habitat mapping is important to identify the main drivers of spatial variation in soil biodiversity, to predict its response to climate change and to help conservation planning. In this paper we retrieved remotely sensed Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Digital Surface Models (DSM) for the Sor Rondane Mountains in East Antarctica from respectively the Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS) on Landsat 8 and the Pl eiades constellation of high resolution optical imagers. Satellite data were combined with ground truth temperature and elevation measurements with the aim to assess the performance of these remotely sensed data. Over a 2 year period, satellite derived LST corresponded to in situ temperature with Mean Average Difference (MAD) of 2.5 K, and Root Mean Squared Difference (RMSD) of - 6.3 K. Lower biases were observed for periods when the data loggers were frozen or snow covered (MAD 1.8K) compared to intervals where the devices were not frozen (MAD 4 K), with larger scatter (RMSD 7 K) being observed during the latter. These larger MAD and RMSD are caused by the differential heating of the top of the gravel/rocks as observed by the satellite compared to their underside, where the loggers were installed, and are also impacted by the time step of the in situ logging (3 h) and the non-linear heating of the surface. In addition, for the different study sites different biases were observed as a result of the spatial resolution of the TIRS, depending on the composition, structure, geomorphology, and the surroundings of the logger position. Sites on a narrow rock outcrop (e.g. the Perlebandet and Utsteinen nunataks) show a negative bias due to the surrounding ice fields decreasing the satellite pixel average temperature compared to the in situ measured temperatures. For sites with a more extensive rock and gravel composition further away from the ice sheet (Dry and Yuboku Valleys), a positive bias was found as a result of the temperature differential between the exposed top and covered bottom of the rocks and gravel. The DSM derived from Pl ' eiades (without bias correction) showed in general a bias of - 6 m (MAD) and scatter of - 9 m (RMSD) when compared to the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica and IceSAT-1 LIDAR data. Lowest errors were also found here for the extensive Dry and Yuboku Valley sites (respectively - 5 and 3 m MAD, 7 and 4 m RMSD). Correspondence with in situ logged GPS positions was slightly worse, with a positive bias of 12 m (MAD) and scatter of 15 m (RMSD) across the sites. An analysis on the basis of these LST and DSM datasets, show a clear separability of sites by their average temperature and solar exposition (in terms of slope and aspect) at the time of Landsat overpass. Due to the Landsat overpass times, the LST datasets are however strongly biased, and further work is needed for a better understanding of the light and temperature climate in the ice-free regions. This could for example be achieved by coupling the DSM to a solar irradiance and terrain shadowing model.

TI  - Quantifying Coastal Shoreline Erosion Due to Climatic Extremes Using Remote-Sensed Estimates from Sentinel-2A Data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper studies the shoreline alterations occurring along the Al Batinah region in the Sultanate of Oman and the impacts of Cyclone Kyarr on its shoreline. The methods used in this research employed Sentinel images and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System within the GIS environment to measure changes of the shoreline and explore Kyarr's impacts from 2017 to 2020. The results showed that from 2017 to 2020, the Al Batinah coast experienced erosion at a rate of 9 m/year. In addition, the Shoreline Change Envelop showed that the maximum shoreline change was reported from 2018 to 2019, with a 1145 m advancement that coincided with Kyarr in 2019. Further, data from the period between 2017 and 2018 showed that 73 % of the coastline was dominated by soil deposition at an average rate of 10 m/year, while the period between 2018 and 2019 showed erosion at an average rate of -40 m/year. The results of this study will be of interest to decision-makers involved in monitoring shoreline changes and would also be of immence importance in ensuring sustainable coastal zone management and development, especially in areas prone to extreme events such as tropical cyclones.

TI  - A Bayesian model to estimate land surface phenology parameters with harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We develop a Bayesian Land Surface Phenology (LSP) model and examine its performance using Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) observations derived from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset. Building on previous work, we propose a double logistic function that, once couched within a Bayesian model, yields posterior distributions for all LSP parameters. We assess the efficacy of the Normal, Truncated Normal, and Beta likelihoods to deliver robust LSP parameter estimates. Three case studies are presented and used to explore aspects of the proposed model. The first case study, conducted over forested pixels within an HLS tile, explores choice of likelihood and space-time varying HLS data availability for long-term average LSP parameter point and uncertainty estimation. The second case study, conducted over the same pixels using only 2018 data, compares annual LSP parameter estimates from our proposed models with those generated using methods described in Bolton et al. (2020). The third case study, conducted on a small area of interest within the HLS tile on an annual time-step (2014-2019), further examines the impact of sample size and choice of likelihood on annual LSP parameter estimates in addition to assessing potential for the proposed models to inform LSP change detection analysis. Results indicate that while the Truncated Normal and Beta likelihoods are theoretically preferable when the vegetation index is bounded, all three likelihoods performed similarly when the number of index observations is sufficiently large and values are not near the index bounds. The case studies demonstrate how pixel-level LSP parameter posterior distributions can be used to propagate uncertainty through subsequent analysis. As a companion to this article, we provide an open-source R package rsBayes and supplementary data and code used to reproduce the analysis results. The proposed model specification and software implementation delivers computationally efficient, statistically robust, and inferentially rich LSP parameter posterior distributions at the pixel-level across massive raster time series datasets. Modeling functions in the rsBayes package and supplementary code sections are threaded, allowing for the use of multiple processing cores to further speed up model fitting for massive datasets. Using a 64 CPU workstation, the first case study analysis took similar to 3 days to run using the Beta likelihood model. However, processing time decreases linearly as the number of CPU cores increases. We expect that run times for this LSP modeling approach will decrease substantially as the power of new computing systems increases over time.

TI  - "<i>The Awe is In the Process</i>": The nature and impact of professional scientists' experiences of awe
T2  - SCIENCE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, there has been a call in the research for greater attention to the role of affect in science learning and practice. Awe, which is characterized in the literature as an emotion that facilitates learning and motivates an orientation toward something larger than the self, appears frequently in scientists' descriptions of their work. Empirical evidence also suggests that awe has a unique relationship with scientific reasoning. However, this evidence comes primarily from tightly controlled laboratory research, a methodology that limits our ability to investigate more authentic manifestations of awe and any lingering effects that may extend beyond the initial moment of experience. This study, a qualitative analysis of interviews with professional scientists (n = 30), advances our understanding of the conditions that are likely to elicit awe in the context of scientific practice as well as the perceived impact of those experiences. For study participants, the emotion of awe was deeply connected to the process of learning and to personal moments of discovery. Scientists described their awe experiences as contributing to shifts in their perspective or worldview, including a greater appreciation for the vastness and complexity of the universe. In addition, participants reported that awe served as an important source of motivation for their continued pursuit of the work. The findings indicate that authentic inquiry and metacognition, which we already recognize as critical pedagogical practices for encouraging scientific reasoning, are just as valuable for helping students to experience the affective dimensions of the discipline.

T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Jiuzhaigou County in Sichuan, China is renowned for its beautiful natural scenery, recognized as a World Heritage Site and World Biosphere Reserve by the UNESCO. On August 8, 2017, a M-s 7.0 (M-w 6.5) earthquake struck the region, causing severe damage and casualties. The earthquake triggered thousands of landslides and the collapse of the natural travertine dam impounding Huohua Lake, an important tourist attraction in the reserve. In this study, the dam failure process was investigated through field surveys and remote sensing observations. The propagation of the flood surge was analyzed by Massflow, a depth-integrated continuum model based on the MacCormack-TVD finite difference algorithm. The model results were validated against vegetation maps evaluated from satellite multispectral data recorded before and after the event. The relation between changes in vegetation coverage and computed flooded areas, flow depth, and velocities was elucidated. This study is preliminary in nature, yet the proposed approach could be used, after further validation, in flood hazard and vegetation damage assessments, which may be especially valuable in nature reserves.

AB  - A miniature endoscope capable of imaging multiple tissue contrasts in high resolution is highly attractive, because it can provide complementary and detailed tissue information of internal organs. Here we present a photoacoustic (PA)-fluorescence (FL) endoscope for optical-resolution PA microscopy (PAM) and FL microscopy (FLM). The endoscope with a diameter of 2.8 mm achieves high lateral resolutions of 5.5 and 6.3 mu m for PAM and FLM modes, respectively. In vivo imaging of zebrafish larvae and a mouse ear is conducted, and high-quality images are obtained. Additionally, in vivo endoscopic imaging of a rat rectum is demonstrated, showing the endoscopic imaging capability of our endoscope. By providing dual contrasts with high resolution, the endoscope may open up new opportunities for clinical endoscopic imaging applications. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Distribution Characteristics of Aerosol Optical Properties in Urban Agglomerations on the North Slope of the Tianshan Mountains
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to explore the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of atmospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the urban agglomeration on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains, the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics and trends of changes in the AOD in the study area from 2000 to 2019 were analyzed by MODIS aerosol products(MCD19-A2). For 2016-2019, when the AOD was relatively stable, the parameters such as the AOD and Angstrom wavelength index (alpha) were analyzed using multi-band sun photometer ground-based remote sensing technology. The results showed that (1) the spatial distribution of AOD in the study area was consistent with the topography, and high values were mainly distributed in the low altitude area. The spatial distribution of AOD in the four seasons showed a strong seasonal change from spring (0.15 +/- 0.03) > autumn (0.14 +/- 0.03) > summer (0.14 +/- 0.02). (2) In terms of time, the annual average AOD value of the study area was 0.12 from 2000 to 2019 with an annual growth rate of 1.03%, thereby showing an overall increasing trend. The annual variation in the monthly mean value of AOD was bimodal; the first and second peaks were in May and November. The main reason for the increase in AOD was the release and transmission of dust from natural sources and heating. (3) Under the influence of dust weather, the AOD changed sharply in spring, and the size and change range of aerosol particles were larger than those in summer. The high value of AOD in the study area was mainly affected by coarse mode particles. The moisture absorption growth of fine mode particles caused a fluctuation in the AOD, but it was not the cause of the high value of AOD.

TI  - Vertical distributions and columnar properties of the aerosols during different seasons over Kattankulathur (12.82°N, 80.04°E): A semi-urban tropical coastal station
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal characteristics of the aerosols over Kattankulathur (12.83 degrees N, 80.04 degrees E) is studied using Micro Pulse Lidar observations during 2016-2018 and Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Ozone Monitoring Instrument datasets during 2006-2018. The vertical distribution of the aerosols is characterized as the steep decrease with altitude nearly exponentially up to 2-3 km during the northeast (NE) monsoon and winter seasons mainly dominated by clear marine and polluted continental aerosols. While it gradually decreases with altitude up to 4-5 km during pre-monsoon and southwest monsoon (SW) seasons mainly dominated by dust aerosols. The mean aerosol loadings near the surface are similar to 0.38 km(-1) during NE monsoon and winter, similar to 0.30 km(-1) pre-monsoon, and 0.22 km(-1) during SW monsoon seasons. Such difference in the seasonal distribution of aerosol loading is mainly attributed to the difference in surface insolation, convection, long-range transport, and the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) structure and dynamics. The ABL contributes 61%, 46%, 38%, and 63% of the overall aerosol optical depth (AOD) during the winter, pre-monsoon, SW monsoon, and NE monsoon seasons, respectively. The AOD shows a substantial seasonal variation with two local maxima during May and October and minima during January and July. The maximum and minimum AOD is found to be similar to 0.59 +/- 0.16 and 0.4 +/- 0.05, respectively. The Angstrom exponent (AE) (fine mode fraction (FMF)) shows a marked seasonal variation with a maximum value of 0.84 (0.60), indicating the dominance of finer particles during winter and minimum value of 0.54 (0.27), indicating dominance coarse particles during SW monsoon. The AE and UV aerosol index values suggest that Kattankulathur is mainly characterized by large-sized absorbing aerosols (30%) such as dust mixture and sea salt particles. Smallsized non-absorbing aerosols such as biogenic aerosols are rarely (<1%) observed.

TI  - Informing action for United Nations SDG target 8.7 and interdependent SDGs: Examining modern slavery from space
T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article provides an example of the ways in which remote sensing, Earth observation, and machine learning can be deployed to provide the most up to date quantitative portrait of the South Asian 'Brick Belt', with a view to understanding the extent of the prevalence of modern slavery and exploitative labour. This analysis represents the first of its kind in estimating the spatiotemporal patterns in the Bull's Trench Kilns across the Brick Belt, as well as its connections with various UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With a principal focus on Sustainable Development Goal Target 8.7 regarding the effective measures to end modern slavery by 2030, the article provides additional evidence on the intersections that exist between SDG 8.7 and those relating to urbanisation (SDG 11, 12), environmental degradation and pollution (SDG 3, 14, 15), and climate change (SDG 13). Our findings are then used to make a series of pragmatic suggestions for mitigating the most extreme SDG risks associated with brick production in ways that can improve human lives and human freedom.

TI  - A history of organizational behavior management
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Organizational behavior management (OBM) arose as early behavior analysts decided to use data in earnest to make the world a better place, first through education, then workplace training, and eventually through business and industry as a whole. The historical roots of the field are traced through the lessons learned by these pioneers and how their formative experiences created the tools and techniques that are common within the discipline today. This history also created a worldview and conceptual system that continues to distinguish OBM from alternative approaches and is reflected in recent publication trends seen today. As the levels of analysis, specializations, implementations, and problems faced continue to vary and expand within organizational behavior management, the mantra of performance-based empiricism has remained as a steady and consistent guide throughout the decades.

TI  - Bivalve haemocyte adhesion, aggregation and phagocytosis: A tool to reckon arsenic induced threats to freshwater ecosystem
T2  - FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The freshwater aquifers of the Indo-Gangetic plains support rich biodiversity which is under the threat of arsenic contamination. The filter feeding bivalve mollusc Lamellidens marginalis is a sessile and sentinel resident of these freshwater habitats. In the present study, the classical cell behaviours of adhesion and aggregation were monitored in the circulating haemocytes of the freshwater bivalve under the exposure of sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) at sublethal concentrations in controlled laboratory conditions for a maximum time-span of sixteen days. The toxic metalloid significantly inhibited non-self adhesion, inter-haemocyte interactions and haemocyte aggregation in a dose and time dependent manner. The natural occurrence of the filopods on the haemocytes was significantly diminished in the bivalves exposed to the inorganic arsenite. Moreover, a significant fall in the kinetics of phagocytosis index and haemocyte adhesion was observed under the in vitro exposure to NaAsO2. Compromised non-self adhesion, cell-cell aggregation and phagocytosis of non-self particles by the bivalve haemocytes probably indicate susceptible immunological status of the bivalve. Such vulnerable immunity of the bivalve probably signifies the nature of imminent threat to the freshwater ecosystem as a whole under inorganic arsenite exposure. The findings would be helpful to design bivalve haemocyte based inexpensive biomonitoring tool to assess the health of freshwater ecosystem under potential arsenic threat.

TI  - Mapping dynamic peri-urban land use transitions across Canada using Landsat time series: Spatial and temporal trends and associations with socio-demographic factors
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Transformations of agriculture and natural lands to urban use are dominant and well known effects of urbanization, but consistent and reliable methods to map regional-scale land transitions are limited. Herein, we develop a land use classification approach to assess spatiotemporal patterns of urban expansion and associated land use changes. We utilized a 33-year annual time series (1984-2016) of fractional land characteristics and cover data from Landsat satellite imagery to summarize multidecadal land use transitions on the pixel and census dissemination area level for 18 major Canadian cities. Across Canada, 41% of peri-urban areas analyzed experienced a transition, converting about 2,700 sq-km of natural and/or agriculture to an urban use. West coast peri-urban areas observed the greatest area conversion of natural to urban use (39%). In contrast, peri-urban areas of the Prairies (i.e. west-center stratum) experienced the greatest area transition from an agriculture to urban use (41%), while west- and east-center observed marked rates of natural to urban transitions (3.9 and 3.5% per annum per sq-km, respectively). Current high population densities were generally associated with historic losses of agriculture or natural use, while regional differences in correlations between land use trends and current levels of income, new residential construction, and single-detached housing highlight the potential influence of urban policies and historic socio-economic trajectories. The developed dynamic land use classification provides a reliable, transparent, and nationally consistent method to tabulate land use intensity across various spatiotemporal scales and may enhance interpretation of interdisciplinary studies involving social and community outcomes.

TI  - Spatial homogeneity from temporal stability: Exploiting the combined hyper-frequent revisit of Terra and Aqua to guide Earth System Science
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The terrestrial component of the Earth system has witnessed considerable changes in the past decades due to anthropogenic action. Throughout this period, the NASA Terra mission has been constantly monitoring the surface with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. When combined with the MODIS instrument on-board of the Aqua platform, we obtain a hyper-frequent revisit capability providing subdaily observations globally at a moderate resolution of similar to 250 m, but with a strong multi-angular variation of the observation footprint. Here we propose to exploit this particular configuration provided by the combined Terra + Aqua constellation to infer spatial homogeneity from the temporal stability of the observation time series. We thus designed a Temporal Coherence Index (TCI) based on the concept of information entropy. We test it on both synthetic and real landscapes showing its capacity to isolate which time series correspond to homogeneous targets based only on the MODIS measurements themselves. The index is calculated annually for the entirety of emerged surfaces for the period 2003-2020 by leveraging on the scaling capacity of the cloud computing Google Earth Engine (GEE). We foresee multiple practical applications for this index as a novel information layer that should foster the integration of surface data with satellite records, a practice that is increasingly necessary in Earth System Science.

TI  - Estimation of mustard and wheat phenology using multi-date Shannon entropy and Radar Vegetation Index from polarimetric Sentinel-1
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Dual-pol Shannon Entropy captures the dynamic crop growth parameters. It was used to evaluate biophysical parameters of important crops using Sentinel-1 data. Improved phenology information is vital input to crop-growth models. Mustard experienced increase as it advanced in phenology but for wheat, decreased due to absorption. A significant relationship at initial crop stages (height < 150 cm and biomass < 5 kg m(-2)) R-2 =0.65 between Shannon Entropy (SE) and crop parameters, though less strong (R-2=0.33) for entire mustard cycle and wheat (plant height < 80 cm and biomass < 6 kg m(-2)) was observed. The SE appeared sensitive to low-medium biomass and useful in monitoring crop phenology in low biomass and initial phenophases. The dynamic crop profile is manifested conjunctively as Radar Vegetation Index (RVI). Random Forest Regression (RFR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were evaluated to predict the phenophases. Phenology responses till peak/beyond were found to perform close to ground observations.

TI  - Is pre-operative axillary ultrasound alone sufficient to determine need for axillary dissection in early breast cancer patients?
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pre-operative status of axillary lymph node (ALN) in early breast cancer is usually initially assessed by pre-operative ultrasound, followed by ultrasound-guided needle biopsy (UNB) confirmation. Patients with positive nodal status will undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), while those with negative nodal status will have sentinel lymph node biopsy. ALND is associated with higher morbidity than Sentinel lymph node biopsy. The objective of this study is to determine if axillary ultrasound alone without UNB is predictive enough to assign patients to ALND and to identify ultrasound features that are significantly associated with pathologically positive ALN. 383 newly diagnosed primary breast cancer patients between 2012 and 2014, and who had undergone pre-operative axillary ultrasound in University Malaya Medical Centre with a complete histopathology report of the axillary surgery were retrospectively reviewed. ALN was considered positive if it had any of these features: cortical thickening > 3 mm, loss of fatty hilum, hypoechoic solid node, mass-like appearance, round shape and lymph node size > 5 mm. Post-operative histopathological reports were then analyzed for nodal involvement. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of pre-operative axillary ultrasound in detecting diseased nodes were 45.5%, 80.7%, and 60.3% respectively. The positive (PPV) and negative predictive values were 76.5% and 51.8%. Round shape, loss of fatty hilum and mass-like appearance had the highest PPVs of 87%, 83% and 81.6% respectively and significant odds ratios (ORs) of 5.22 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.52 - 17.86), ORs of 4.77 (95% CI: 2.62 - 8.70) and ORs of 4.26 (95% CI: 2.37 - 7.67) respectively (P-value < .05). Cortical thickness of > 3 mm was identified to have low PPV at 69.1%, ORs of 1.71 (95% CI: 0.86 - 3.41, P = .126). There are features on axillary ultrasound that confer high PPV for axillary involvement i.e. round shape, loss of fatty hilum, and mass-like appearance. In a low resource setting, these features may benefit from ALND without further pre-operative biopsies. However, pre-operative UNB for features with low PPV that is, cortical thickness > 3 mm should be considered to obviate the unnecessary morbidity associated with ALND.

TI  - Population dynamics of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) and their disease-harboring rates in Gyeonggi province, South Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIA-PACIFIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Population dynamics and species composition of mosquitoes were monitored in a suburban residential area and rural areas, including a migratory bird refuge area and a cattle farm area, from 2017 to 2019. Mosquitoes were collected every two weeks using one BG sentinel trap and two black-light traps in a suburban residential area and a migratory bird refuge area, and one black-light trap in a cattle farm area from March to November. From the surveillance, a total of 13,267, 9,697 and 6,688 mosquitoes were collected in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. The peak of the mosquito population was observed in August and September in both the suburban residential area and rural areas. In general, Culex pipiens pallens was the dominant species in the suburban residential area, whereas Aedes vexans nipponii and Anopheles spp. were the most dominant in the rural areas. Collected mosquitoes were pooled into groups for each collection site and species to investigate flavivirus harboring. Three pools were positive for Japanese encephalitis virus type V, one pool was positive for Chaoyang virus, and six pools were positive for Culex flavi virus from the 731 pools tested. When total numbers of collected mosquitoes were further analyzed by linear regression analysis for their interaction with ambient temperature and relative humidity, the number of mosquitoes were significantly affected by the ambient temperature. In contrast, relative humidity was significantly affecting the total number of mosquitoes only for the migratory bird refuge area.

TI  - An attack of <i>Ips</i> <i>amitinus</i> (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) on arboretum in West Siberia: New host of invasive bark beetle among exotic conifers
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIA-PACIFIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive populations of small spruce bark beetle Ips amitinus were first registered in 2019 in the southeast of Western Siberia. In natural stands of Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica Du Tour), several hundred hectares of outbreak foci of the alien bark beetle were identified. In 2020, a local focus of the bark beetle was found in the conifer collection in the arboretum "Kedr" of the Institute of Monitoring Climatic and Ecological Systems SB RAS, 30 km from Tomsk. The bark beetle caused the main damage to the collection of pines. I. amitinus colonized both host plants Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and mountain pine (Pinus mugo Turra), which were previously known to it in the native range in Europe, and the local Siberian species Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica Du Tour), Siberian spruce (Picea obovata Ledeb.) and introduced Far Eastern Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et Zucc.). Demographic characteristics of I. amitinus studied on damaged trees indicate its high reproduction potential in Siberia. The bark beetle outbreak focus was suppressed; however, this plantation requires further annual monitoring of pest abundance and distribution, both to preserve the scientific dendroecological field station and to study the implementation of sential plant conception in relation to the invasion of I. amitinus.

TI  - Combined SBAS-InSAR and geostatistics to detect topographic change and fluid paths in geothermal areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Topographic changes or ground surface deformation provide critical information regarding the fluid ascent paths that form in permeable fracture zones. This study combines surface displacement data using the small baseline subset-interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) technique, lineament density, topographic elevation, and water type in geothermally active areas to detect highly permeable zones to assess geothermal resource potential. The Bandung Basin (2000 km(2)) with several geothermal fields, including Kamojang (KGF), Wayang Windu (WWGF), and Tangkuban Parahu (TPGF), is selected as a case study. An ALOS PALSAR dataset composed of 20 descending and 24 ascending orbital modes acquired in 2007-2011 is used for SBAS-InSAR together with a digital elevation model dataset from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) for lineament analysis. Although interferograms are available in only half of the study area owing to low coherence, ordinary kriging is successfully applied to clarify the vertical and horizontal E-W displacement over the entire area. Both displacements are in agreement with the GPS data within a 95% confidence level. The detected uplift and subsidence depend on the activity and location of production and injection wells in KGF and WWGF, whereas topographic change in TPGF is dominated by magmatic activity. An important finding is the geologic structural control over topographic change, and in particular, that displacement tends to abruptly change near faults, and the displacement pattern becomes complicated in closely distributed fault zones. A weakly positive correlation between vertical displacement and lineament density is observed in water types classified as sulfate, chloride, and bicarbonate. The largest vertical displacement occurs in the sulfate water type, which shows advanced hydrothermal alteration, weakened rocks, and large topographic changes owing to natural and anthropogenic factors.

TI  - Nalini Jameela and the Itinerant Sex Pedagogy of a Veshya
T2  - SEXUALITY & CULTURE-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Nalini Jameela (1954-) is a sex worker and activist from Kerala, India. She is also an autobiographer. Sex workers are treated as the other of ideal Indian womanhood. In regular parlance, the other is known by the term "veshya" (prostitute). Jameela willfully embraces the cultural other. We give details of Jameela's feminist sex pedagogy, especially of an itinerant kind. Jameela knows for a fact that her male clients always see her as a veshya figure. Their transferences on her are based on the cultural imagination of the veshya. Also, due to constant battering her mirror of the body is not totally predictable and speckle-free. In fact, it remains broken. Via transferences, Jameela's male clients open up to her. In the process, they learn a good deal about sex, intimacy, and mutuality of pleasure. She offers an alternative worldview about sex to her male clients who are by and large driven by stereotypes and taboo concerning heterosexual intimacy. In psychoanalysis, mirroring or transference signifies non-judgmental listening on the part of the therapist who also reflects back psychological projections of the patients. Although Jameela is not a trained psychotherapist, she deploys them unwittingly. Eventually, she rehabilitates ill-conceived cultural notions concerning the veshya figure.

TI  - Fast recovery of soil macrofauna in regenerating forests of the Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of secondary forests in deforested tropical regions represents an opportunity to mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change, but there is still debate on how fast and to which level these forests can recover biodiversity. Recent studies have shown that the recovery of plant and vertebrate species richness is relatively fast, but the pace of recovery for other groups remains unclear. Soil macroinvertebrates play critical roles on litter decomposition and seed dispersal, therefore the pace of their recovery has consequences for the entire forest ecosystem.We investigated how fast broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna recover in the first 30 years of forest regeneration using forests older than 50 years as reference.We surveyed the number, diversity and abundance of 19 broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna in 85 sites located in Brazilian Amazon, covering forests of different ages and clearing frequencies. Forest age and clearing frequency were obtained accurately from Landsat images in forests up to 30 years old. We used regression analysis to determine (a) the effects forest age and clearing frequency on macrofauna groups in secondary forests up to 30 years old; and (b) the changes in macrofauna groups between young forests (up to 10 years old), median age forests (between 10 and 30 years old) and forests older than 50 years.We found that the number and diversity of macrofauna groups recover rapidly in the first 10 years of forest regrowth, but show slower change among older forests. This rapid recovery was also observed in the abundance of several taxonomic groups and for predators and detritivores as functional groups. Forest clearing frequency had no effect on the number or the diversity of macrofauna groups, but the abundance of ants increased as forest was cleared more often.Our results for soil macrofauna align with those in plant and vertebrate studies showing that secondary forests quickly recover a large part of their biodiversity and ecological functions. Therefore, global-scale conservation strategies are needed to ensure the opportunity for secondary forests to grow.

TI  - Deep network based on up and down blocks using wavelet transform and successive multi-scale spatial attention for cloud detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is not only a challenging task, but it also plays a major role in image processing. Due to the diversity of the cloud and the complexity of underlying surfaces, most of the current cloud detection methods still face great challenges, especially in detecting thin cloud. Therefore, we propose a method to detect cloud pixels in the GaoFen-1 WFV images. In our method, a deep network is used to learn the multi-scale global features so that the high-level semantic information obtained in the process of feature learning is integrated with the low-level spatial information in order to classify images into cloud and non-cloud regions. In addition, Up and Down blocks are designed using the Haar wavelet transform in order to fully exploit the structural information of images, and especially the texture information of the cloud, which can be learned targetedly. We pay attention to the original information of images in order to assist the learning for the network. In addition, we have also utilized dark channel prior and designed a Successive Multi-scale Spatial Attention Module by adding attention mechanisms to multi-scale feature maps in the network in order to provide a consistent improvement in the performance. The experimental results indicate that the proposed network performs well under different scenarios.

TI  - Mapping total suspended matter along Moroccan coast using satellite data series
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing techniques are a powerful technique for monitoring turbidity over the whole littoral areas. Different sensors can be used to quantify and analyze water quality parameters such as colored dissolved organic matter, total suspended sediments, chlorophyll-a, and pollutants. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to investigate the inter-annual and spatio-temporal variability's of total suspended matter (TSM) concentration in the water surface layer. The coastal of the Atlantic Ocean, Morocco is taken an application area. The results show that high TSM (18 g m(-3)) is observed during winter season, and lower TSM (2 g m(-3)) is observed during summer season. In addition, the relationship between TSM and wind speed; and with ocean current was analyzed, and the results show that: (1) sand dredging areas usually coincide with region that have high TSM levels; (2) the wind and ocean current were both important to TSM variation; (3) the increased level of sand dredging in response to rapid economic growth has deeply influenced the TSM pattern since 2012 due to the resuspension of sediment in some areas. Visual interpretation of location led to the conclusion that the dredging activities were more located on the northern and western Morocco. Time series of MODIS images revealed a significant increase in water turbidity from 2012 onwards on the northern Morocco. Moreover, strong wind events in the northern Sahara can significantly increase the TSM in turbid coastal waters.

TI  - Monitoring Vegetation Change in Tozeur Oases in Southern Tunisia by Using Trend Analysis of MODIS NDVI Time Series (2000-2016)
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oasis ecosystems are highly vulnerable to environmental changes. To determine the state of vegetation in these ecosystems, monitoring systems must be provided with data on cultivated areas. These data can be obtained in part by using satellite observation systems with high and moderate spatial resolution and high temporal repetitiveness; these systems offer a synoptic vision that makes them a particularly appropriate information source for effectively estimating such data. In this study, we describe an approach to monitor the changing dynamics of Tozeur oases in southwestern Tunisia. To this end, we used a time series decomposition method (seasonal and trend decomposition using loess) to extract the trends from a multi-year time series at the scale of a geographical point (250 m x 250 m pixel) across the MOD13Q1 time series (2000-2016) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, at a 250-m spatial resolution time series. These methods were tested with the final aim of setting up an oasis monitoring system based on the analysis of time signatures obtained from MODIS images. The results showed that it was possible to identify the main types of irrigated perimeters present in the Djerid region and retrospectively trace their recent development history.

TI  - Accounting for canopy structure improves hyperspectral radiative transfer and sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence representations in a new generation Earth System model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) vegetation canopy structure plays an important role in the way radiation interacts with the land surface. Accurately representing this process in Earth System models (ESMs) is crucial for the modeling of the global carbon, energy, and water cycles and hence future climate projections. Despite the importance of accounting for 3D canopy structure, the inability to represent such complexity at regional and global scales has impeded a successful implementation into ESMs. An alternative approach is to use an implicit clumping index to account for the horizontal heterogeneity in vegetation canopy representations in ESMs at global scale. This paper evaluates how modeled hyperspectral shortwave radiation partitioning of the terrestrial biosphere, as well as Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) are impacted when a clumping index parameterization is incorporated in the radiative transfer scheme of a new generation ESM, the Climate Model Alliance (CliMA). An accurate hyperspectral radiative transfer representation within ESMs is critical for accurately using of satellite data to confront, constrain, and improve land model processes. The newly implemented scheme is compared to Monte Carlo calculations for idealized scenes from the Radiation transfer Model Intercomparison for the Project for Intercomparison of Land-Surface Parameterizations (RAMI4PILPS), for open forest canopies both with and without snow on the ground. Results indicate that it is critical to account for canopy structural heterogeneity when calculating hyperspectral radiation transfer. The RMSE in shortwave radiation is reduced for reflectance (25%), absorptance (66%), and transmittance (75%) compared to the scenario without considering clumping. Calculated SIF is validated against satellite remote sensing data with the recently launched NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) 3, showing that including vertical and horizontal canopy structure when deriving SIF can improve model predictions in up to 51% in comparison to the scenario without clumping. By adding a clumping index into the CliMA-Land model, the relationship between canopy structure and SIF, Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), hyperspectral radiative transfer, and viewing geometry at the canopy scale can be explored in detail.

TI  - Assessing the potentials of largescale generation of solar energy in Eastern Nigeria with geospatial technologies
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - The quest to improve power supply in Nigeria has motivated the country to look for alternative energy resources to augment existing ones. Being in the tropics, Nigeria is well positioned to harness solar energy to improve its energy poverty status. Although, a number of solar energy projects have been initiated in the arid parts of the country, very little has been done in the humid Eastern part of the country. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the solar energy generation potential in Eastern Nigeria, using geospatial technologies. A spatially-explicit multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was implemented with GIS, using a number of geospatial data products including Landsat satellite images, NASA global direct normal irradiance (DNI), ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and National Forest Reserve map covering the study area. Various derivatives, including land use and land cover (LU/LC) map, slope, and factor maps were generated in other to produce a solar energy potential map of the region. This research found that over 59,000ha (0.67% of the region) were found to be suitable for the production of solar energy.

TI  - Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis imported into low-incidence countries-a GeoSentinel analysis, 2008-2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Early detection of imported multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is crucial, but knowledge gaps remain about migration- and travel-associated MDR-TB epidemiology. The aim was to describe epidemiologic characteristics among international travellers and migrants with MDR-TB.Methods: Clinician-determined and microbiologically confirmed MDR-TB diagnoses deemed to be related to travel or migration were extracted from GeoSentinel, a global surveillance network of travel and tropical medicine clinics, from January 2008 through December 2020. MDR-TB was defined as resistance to both isoniazid and rifampicin. Additional resistance to either a fluoroquinolone or a second-line injectable drug was categorized as pre-extensively drug-resistant (pre-XDR) TB, and as extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB when resistance was detected for both. Sub-analyses were performed based on degree of resistance and country of origin.Results: Of 201 patients, 136 had MDR-TB (67.7%), 25 had XDR-TB (12.4%), 23 had pre-XDR TB (11.4%) and 17 had unspecified MDR- or XDR-TB (8.5%); 196 (97.5%) were immigrants, of which 92 (45.8%) originated from the former Soviet Union. The median interval from arrival to presentation was 154 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 10-751 days); 34.3% of patients presented within 1 month after immigration, 30.9% between 1 and 12 months and 34.9% after >= 1 year. Pre-XDR- and XDR-TB patients from the former Soviet Union other than Georgia presented earlier than those with MDR-TB (26 days [IQR: 8-522] vs. 369 days [IQR: 84-827]), while patients from Georgia presented very early, irrespective of the level of resistance (8 days [IQR: 2-18] vs. 2 days [IQR: 1-17]).Conclusions: MDR-TB is uncommon in traditional travellers. Purposeful medical migration may partly explain differences in time to presentation among different groups. Public health resources are needed to better understand factors contributing to cross-border MDR-TB spread and to develop strategies to optimize care of TB-infected patients in their home countries before migration.

TI  - Properties of stream interaction regions at Earth and Mars during the declining phase of SC 24
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims. We inspect the evolution of stream interaction regions (SIRs) from Earth to Mars, covering the distance range 1-1.5 AU, over the declining phase of solar cycle 24 (2014-2018). So far, studies only analyzed SIRs measured at Earth and Mars at different times. We compare existing catalogs for both heliospheric distances and arrive at a clean dataset for the identical time range. This allows a well-sampled statistical analysis and for the opposition phases of the planets an in-depth analysis of SIRs as they evolve with distance.Methods. We use in situ solar wind data from OMNI and the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN spacecraft as well as remote sensing data from Solar Dynamics Observatory. A superposed epoch analysis is performed for bulk speed, proton density, temperature, magnetic field magnitude and total perpendicular pressure. Additionally, a study of events during the two opposition phases of Earth and Mars in the years 2016 and 2018 is conducted. SIR related coronal holes with their area as well as their latitudinal and longitudinal extent are extracted and correlated to the maximum bulk speed and duration of the corresponding high speed solar wind streams following the stream interaction regions.Results. We find that while the entire solar wind high speed stream shows no expansion as it evolves from Earth to Mars, the crest of the high speed stream profile broadens by about 17%, and the magnetic field and total pressure by about 45% around the stream interface. The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the normalized superposed profiles increases slightly or stagnates from 1-1.5 AU for all parameters, except for the temperature. A sharp drop at zero epoch time is observed in the superposed profiles for the magnetic field strength at both heliospheric distances. The two opposition phases reveal similar correlations of in situ data with coronal hole parameters for both planets. Maximum solar wind speed has a stronger dependence on the latitudinal extent of the respective coronal hole than on its longitudinal extent. We arrive at an occurrence rate of fast forward shocks three times higher at Mars than at Earth.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes of glacier and seasonal snow fluctuations over the Namcha Barwa-Gyala Peri massif using object-based classification from Landsat time series
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The glacier environment in the Namcha Barwa-Gyala Peri (NBGP) massif is regarded as one of the most sensitive areas to climate change, yet the change estimates remain inadequate due to the limited knowledge of the complex debris-covered glacier environment and the lack of available remote sensing data caused by continuously cloudy weather. To examine the changes of the complex glacial environment, a multiple hierarchical object- and rule-based classification (MHORC) scheme is proposed by combining Landsat time series images and topographic data. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is introduced due to its capabilities of handling data contextually and hierarchically and using multi-source data jointly so that multiple hierarchical rule-based classification can be developed to distinguish the objects with similar spectrum such as debris-covered glaciers and their surrounding terrain. All the available Landsat images from 1987 to 2019 are filtered by the cloud cover condition (less than 10%) and accordingly used in the MHORC to obtain spatial and temporal information of the glacier and snow over the NBGP massif. The images collected in the snow-free season are used to estimate the glacier extent state and the historical changes, and those in the snow-covered are used to estimate the snow cover fluctuation using harmonic analysis. The results show that the NBGP contains 65 glaciers(>= 0.1 km(2)) with a total area of 462.7 km(2), among which valley glaciers account for 21.5% in number but cover an area of 354.2 km(2), more than 76% of the total area. An accelerating reduction trend of the glacier area is confirmed as the area change velocity is -0.62 km(2) yr(-1) between 1999 and 2003 and reach -2.95 km(2) yr(-1) between 2003 and 2015. The seasonal snow cover area shows a reduction in the secular trend and an increase in fluctuation amplitude. Both glacier and seasonal snow display heterogeneity in the spatial and temporal patterns. Such heterogeneous dynamics might be related to the trade-off between water vapor supply and regional thermal conditions. This MHORC developed in this study demonstrates its effectiveness in delineating the debris-covered glacier environment and the potential of using Landsat time series to track glacial environment evolution. Besides, the analysis of seasonal snow fluctuations provides a novel perspective to re-recognize the glacial environment dynamics, and the knowledge of glacier extent changes and season snow fluctuations over the NBGP massif can improve the understanding of environmental effects from climate change.

TI  - Mapping soil salinity using a combined spectral and topographical indices with artificial neural network
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the status of natural and ecological resources is necessary for conservation and protection. Soil is one of the most important environmental resources in agricultural lands and natural resources. In this research study, we used Landsat 8 and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to monitor soil salinity in Qom plain. The geographical location of 72 surface soil samples from 7 land types was determined by the Latin hypercube method, and the samples were taken to determine the electrical conductivity (EC). Thirty percent of the data was considered as a validation set and 70% as a test set. In addition to the Landsat 8 bands, we used spectral indices of salinity, vegetation, topography, and drainage (DEM, TWI, and TCI) because of their impacts on soil formation and development. We used ANN with different algorithms to model soil salinity. We found that the GFF algorithm is the best for soil salinity modeling. Also, the TWI topography index and SI5 salinity index and NDVI vegetation index had the most effect on the outputs of the selected model. It was also found that flood plains and lowlands had the highest levels of salinity accumulation.

TI  - Correcting Ionospheric Error for MAI Based on Along-Track Gradient and 1-D Linear Fitting
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - As a supplement to synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR), multiple-aperture InSAR (MAI) can measure along-track surface deformation, but it is limited by ionospheric path delays, especially with the L- or P-band data. In this letter, we propose a method to correct an ionospheric error in the MAI measurement based on the along-track gradient and 1-D linear fitting. The method depends on the uniqueness of the spatial variation of the along-track gradient of ionospheric error in MAI measurements, which can be well distinguished from other components, such as deformation by using 1-D linear fitting. The method is first evaluated by employing the L-band ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 dataset of the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake, U.S., and then applied to estimate glacial movements of Grove Mountain, Antarctica, with the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 dataset.

TI  - Anomalous Reduction of the Total Suspended Matter During the COVID-19 Lockdown in the Hooghly Estuarine System
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown in the Hooghly estuarine region, India is assessed using the total suspended matter (TSM) concentration. The estimation of TSM is performed using Landsat-8/operational land imager (OLI), and an intercomparison of TSM load during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods is done. It is observed that during the lockdown period, TSM reduced by 30-50%. This is a significant observation considering the ecological balance of the region and the fact that it is home to the largest mangroves in the world. This change in suspended matter presumably reflects the influence of reduction in anthropogenic activities owing to the COVID-19 lockdowns, such as industries, closure of shipping activities (through less dredging), and brick kilns (through less sediment removal), which are generally the primary contributors in this region. Even though these observed changes are representative of the positive influence of the COVID-19 lockdown, its implications in estuarine biogeochemistry still remain poorly quantified. The decrease in TSM content may increase light penetration, thereby increasing the primary productivity. In addition, low sediment load reaching the Bay of Bengal could influence the carbon export due to reduction in ballasting effect as reported from this region. In summary, the influence of the COVID-19 lockdown on the biogeochemistry of the aquatic ecosystem appears rather complex than thought earlier and may vary regionally based on local hydrodynamics. The analysis elucidates the complex interplay of regional lockdown and its implication in modulation of local biogeochemistry. However, the relative importance of each process in the Hooghly estuary remains to be fully evaluated.

TI  - Cigarette smoke exposure and alveolar macrophages: mechanisms for lung disease
T2  - THORAX
M3  - Review
AB  - Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death worldwide. It causes chronic lung disease and predisposes individuals to acute lung injury and pulmonary infection. Alveolar macrophages are sentinel cells strategically positioned in the interface between the airway lumen and the alveolar spaces. These are the most abundant immune cells and are the first line of defence against inhaled particulates and pathogens. Recently, there has been a better understanding about the ontogeny, phenotype and function of alveolar macrophages and their role, not only in phagocytosis, but also in initiating and resolving immune response. Many of the functions of the alveolar macrophage have been shown to be dysregulated following exposure to cigarette smoke. While the mechanisms for these changes remain poorly understood, they are important in the understanding of cigarette smoking-induced lung disease. We review the mechanisms by which smoking influences alveolar macrophage: (1) recruitment, (2) phenotype, (3) immune function (bacterial killing, phagocytosis, proteinase/anti-proteinase release and reactive oxygen species production) and (4) homeostasis (surfactant/lipid processing, iron homeostasis and efferocytosis). Further understanding of the mechanisms of cigarette smoking on alveolar macrophages and other lung monocyte/macrophage populations may allow novel ways of restoring cellular function in those patients who have stopped smoking in order to reduce the risk of subsequent infection or further lung injury.

TI  - Observational constraints on low cloud feedback reduce uncertainty of climate sensitivity
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine low clouds strongly cool the planet. How this cooling effect will respond to climate change is a leading source of uncertainty in climate sensitivity, the planetary warming resulting from CO2 doubling. Here, we observationally constrain this low cloud feedback at a near-global scale. Satellite observations are used to estimate the sensitivity of low clouds to interannual meteorological perturbations. Combined with model predictions of meteorological changes under greenhouse warming, this permits quantification of spatially resolved cloud feedbacks. We predict positive feedbacks from midlatitude low clouds and eastern ocean stratocumulus, nearly unchanged trade cumulus and a near-global marine low cloud feedback of 0.19 +/- 0.12 W m(-2) K-1 (90% confidence). These constraints imply a moderate climate sensitivity (similar to 3 K). Despite improved midlatitude cloud feedback simulation by several current-generation climate models, their erroneously positive trade cumulus feedbacks produce unrealistically high climate sensitivities. Conversely, models simulating erroneously weak low cloud feedbacks produce unrealistically low climate sensitivities.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to utilise remotely sensed data to investigate the connection between monthly urban and rural land surface temperatures (LST) and heat stroke incident rates (HSIR) in Tokyo Prefecture. A ward, city, town, and village (WCTV) spatial comparative analysis and a categorical land type collective correlation analysis identified general trends of urban LSTs demonstrating a stronger correlation with HSIRs than rural LSTs. Normalised categorical land type data analysis results show that urban LSTs have a stronger correlation with HSIRs than rural LSTs, with R2 values of 0.59, 0.70, 0.78, and 0.85, for Rural, Sub-rural, Urban, and City Centre, respectively. LSTs cannot solely account for HSIR variation; however, urban LSTs are more influential in HSIR variation than rural LSTs which shows the usefulness of urban LSTs for urban heat island (UHI) and HSIR studies as an independent variable or part of a holistic assessment. Results also highlighted the counterintuitive nature of the relationship between LSTs and HSIRs with increased LSTs and UHI effects not always equating to higher HSIRs. Other factors which contribute to explaining this discrepancy while also being highlighted as significant for HSIR management were identified as working environments, building quality, density and height, elderly populations, and waterways.

TI  - Multiple trajectories of grassland fragmentation, degradation, and recovery in Russia's steppes
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the 20th century, the Eurasian steppes underwent drastic land-cover changes. Much progress was made studying cropland expansion and the post-1990 (i.e., post-Soviet) agricultural land abandonment in Eurasia. However, the alteration of steppe landscapes may include other disturbances, such as oil and gas development, formal and informal roads and garbage dumps, which were not systematically documented. Considering the example of the steppe Orenburg Province in Russia, we reconstructed agricultural land-cover change dynamics using Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery from 1990 to 2018. Furthermore, we used very high-resolution imagery and assessed the patterns and determinants of other steppe landscape anthropogenic disturbances. Our study showed that, despite steppe recovery due to widespread cropland abandonment from 1990 to 2018, the steppes, including the recovered steppe patches, underwent fragmentation due to informal roads, oil and gas development, shrub encroachment, garbage dumps and quarries, as well as abandonment of settlements and buildings. Only 6.4% of the sampled 7859 1x1 km blocks in 2018 showing grassland extent had no documented disturbances. The mapped disturbances occurred primarily near settlements and roads, while some disturbances occurred in remote areas. Given the accessibility of steppes, our study calls for a urgent need to systematically document alternatives to agricultural land uses in the steppes of Eurasia and other parts of the global grassland biome.

TI  - Rock glacier inventory of the western Nyainqentanglha Range, Tibetan Plateau, supported by InSAR time series and automated classification
T2  - PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The western Nyainqentanglha Range on the Tibetan Plateau reaches an elevation of 7,162 m and is characterized by an extensive periglacial environment under semi-arid climatic conditions. Rock glaciers play an important part of the water budget in high mountain areas and recent studies suggest that they may even act as climate-resistant water storages. In this study we present the first rock glacier inventory of this region containing 1,433 rock glaciers over an area of 4,622 km. To create the most reliable inventory we combine manually created rock glacier outlines with an automated classification approach. The manual outlines were generated based on surface elevation data, optical satellite imagery and a surface velocity estimation. This estimation was generated via InSAR time series analysis with Sentinel-1 data from 2016 to 2019. Our pixel-based automated classification was able to correctly identify 87.8% of all rock glaciers in the study area at a true positive rate of 69.5%. In total, 65.9% of rock glaciers are classified as transitional with surface velocities of 1-10 cm/yr. In total, 18.5% are classified as active with higher velocities of up to 87 cm/yr. The southern windward side of the mountain range contains more numerous and more active rock glaciers. We attribute this to higher moisture availability supplied by the Indian Monsoon.

TI  - Changing risky drinking practices in different types of social worlds: concepts and experiences
T2  - DRUGS-EDUCATION PREVENTION AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 'social worlds' concept has been underutilized in alcohol research. This is surprising given that drinking is primarily a social activity, often a secondary part of a sociable occasion in a social world whose members come together around something they have in common, such as an occupation, a hobby, or an identity. Social worlds which include drinking in their practices often entail encouragements or pressures to drink more, though they may also try to impose some limits on drinking or related behavior. Heavy drinking social worlds may be a useful target for public health interventions aimed at supporting less harmful drinking practices, and this paper moves beyond a theoretical discussion of social worlds and their utility to suggest how the concept might be applied in practical terms. We discuss the various influences and actors that potentially impact on heavy drinking social worlds, and suggest a pragmatic typology of social worlds in terms of five features: activity-based, identification-based, settings-based, worldview-based and social position-based. Most social worlds will be characterized by more than one feature, although it is likely that one will predominate in a given social world. Examples are discussed of changes in drinking norms in heavy-drinking social worlds primarily characterised in terms of each of the five features. Implications are considered for public health programming to reduce risky drinking in such social worlds.

TI  - Holocaust survivorship and trauma: agency and coping
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Determination, ingenuity, education, and religiosity have been associated with agency and resilience during trauma. Studies indicate that agency may be related to socioeconomic background and schemas prior to traumatic experience. This qualitative study thus examines agency as noted in the interviews of seventeen Holocaust survivors and members of the Holocaust Speaker's Bureau, reflecting on their experiences before, during, and after the Shoah. Themes related to individual agentic responses in terms of socioeconomic background, relationships, routine versus immediate (ad hoc) survival response, determination, hope, and worldview are discussed and their meaning for future study of trauma and clinical practice is addressed.

TI  - Priority list of biodiversity metrics to observe from space
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of geospatial biodiversity patterns is an important complement to field observations. This priority list suggests how remote sensing observations can be better integrated into the essential biodiversity variables.Monitoring global biodiversity from space through remotely sensing geospatial patterns has high potential to add to our knowledge acquired by field observation. Although a framework of essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) is emerging for monitoring biodiversity, its poor alignment with remote sensing products hinders interpolation between field observations. This study compiles a comprehensive, prioritized list of remote sensing biodiversity products that can further improve the monitoring of geospatial biodiversity patterns, enhancing the EBV framework and its applicability. The ecosystem structure and ecosystem function EBV classes, which capture the biological effects of disturbance as well as habitat structure, are shown by an expert review process to be the most relevant, feasible, accurate and mature for direct monitoring of biodiversity from satellites. Biodiversity products that require satellite remote sensing of a finer resolution that is still under development are given lower priority (for example, for the EBV class species traits). Some EBVs are not directly measurable by remote sensing from space, specifically the EBV class genetic composition. Linking remote sensing products to EBVs will accelerate product generation, improving reporting on the state of biodiversity from local to global scales.

TI  - Urban land cover and land use classification using multispectral sentinal-2 imagery
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, remote sensing data contains ample information about landcover due to the advancements in remote sensing technology. Humans can utilize this data in agriculture, forestry, disaster management, urbanization, and many more applications. The European Space Agency's Sentinel -2 satellite delivers freely accessible multispectral remote sensing data of different high spatial resolutions, which can be used in various remote sensing fields to extract meaningful information. In this work, the multispectral imagery of 10 m spatial resolution of a densely populated urban area, obtained from sentinel-2, is classified using Support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN) and maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). The results obtained using the classifiers SVM, ANN and MLC are compared in terms of the kappa coefficient, overall accuracy and accuracy of users and producers. An area of 14 x 14 km(2) of the South-West district of Delhi (India) is chosen for this study with five urban land-cover and land-use(ULCLU) classes, namely roads, water, buildings, vegetation, and barren land, with a training sample size of 150 pixels per class. The highly complex nature (high population density, urbanization) of the study area makes the classification task challenging and appealing. All the classification methods have more than 90% accuracy, but SVM obtains the best performance with 98.05% accuracy. The work presented in this paper can support policymakers in making better decisions and extracting meaningful information about ULCLU.

TI  - What shapes fire size and spread in African savannahs?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires play an important role in savannah ecosystems, shaping among other things vegetation structure and altering species composition. As direct and indirect anthropogenic pressures on these ecosystems increase, fire dynamics in savannahs are expected to change in the coming decades, with potential impacts on ecosystem functioning. Although the ecological impacts of fires are relatively well-known, the factors that shape fire dynamics in these ecosystems have received less research attention. Using Pendjari National Park (Benin) as a case study, we assessed the importance of different biotic and abiotic factors in shaping fire size and spread in the region. Our results show that fires spread faster (1) in the middle of the dry season compared to the early or late dry season, (2) in areas that are far away from natural and anthropogenic firebreaks, and (3) in areas that are covered with highly flammable vegetation. By contrast, most vegetation types had little influence on fire size, which seems to depend instead on rainfall. Our approach and results highlight new avenues for satellite data to improve our understanding of fire dynamics in large, remote savannah ecosystems and to improve our ability to predict how fires spread, a key variable for wildlife management in the face of rapidly changing environmental conditions.

TI  - Cooperative Self-Assembled Nanoparticle Induces Sequential Immunogenic Cell Death and Toll-Like Receptor Activation for Synergistic Chemo-immunotherapy
T2  - NANO LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anticancer immunotherapy is hampered by poor immunogenicity and a profoundly immunosuppressive microenvironment in solid tumors and lymph nodes. Herein, sequential pH/redox-responsive nanoparticles (SRNs) are engineered to activate the immune microenvironment of tumor sites and lymph nodes. The two-modular SRNs could sequentially respond to the acidic tumor microenvironment and endosome compartments of dendritic cells (DCs) to precisely deliver doxorubicin (DOX) and imidazoquinolines (IMDQs). In the tumor microenvironment, released DOX triggers immunogenic cell death. In sentinel lymph nodes, the IMDQ nanoparticle module is dissociated in the acidic endosome compartment to specifically stimulate toll-like receptor 7/8 for DC maturation. Thus, the orchestrated nanoparticle system could enhance the infiltration of CD8 alpha(+) T cells in tumors and provoke a strong antitumor immune response toward primary and abscopal tumors in B16-OVA and CT26 tumor-bearing mice models. The cooperative self-assembled nanoparticle strategy provides a potential candidate of nanomedicine to advance the synergistic cancer chemo-immunotherapy.

TI  - Satellite-derived bathymetry for maritime archaeology: Testing its effectiveness at two ancient harbours in the Eastern Mediterranean
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution bathymetry is an essential tool in maritime archaeology, often used for underwater prospection, imaging, palaeo-landscape reconstruction and change detection. The commonest acquisition method relies on shipborne acoustic systems (e.g. multibeam echosounder). However, most of the world's seabed has not been surveyed using these methods. Derivation of bathymetry from high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery (Satellite-Derived Bathymetry: SDB) can redress this in shallow (<20-30 m depth) clear water. It can be derived empirically using depth control points, or independent of control data through physics-based approaches. Given global satellite coverage, it is applicable almost anywhere with suitable water conditions and is becoming increasingly widespread in the hydrographic survey community. However, archaeological application of SDB is almost totally un-investigated. This paper examines the utility of SDB for maritime archaeology through 2 case studies: the ancient harbours of Tyre (Lebanon) and Ras Ibn Hani (Syria). Tested data comprise 2 m-resolution physics-based commercial SDB and medium-resolution (10-30 m) SDB empirically derived from open access multispectral imagery (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2). SDB was assessed for its ability to detect submerged cultural features and landforms and as input into palaeo-geographic reconstructions. Tested SDB performed poorly for feature detection, but was better-suited to landform identification and palaeo-geographic reconstruction. SDB also has clear advantages: low cost, wide area coverage, speed and data availability. Disadvantages include variable accuracy, technical limitations (e.g. need for clear water) and approach-specific requirements (e.g. depth control points for empirical and complex modelling for physics-based approaches). For maritime archaeology, its current limitations means that it will not replace acoustics for prospection and imaging but it does have utility for submerged landscape investigation and reconstruction, particularly in areas which now only have no/poor bathymetric data.

TI  - The features of the coastal fronts in the Eastern Guangdong coastal waters during the downwelling-favorable wind period
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A coastal front was detected in the eastern Guangdong (EGD) coastal waters during a downwelling-favorable wind period by using the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K-d(490)). Long-term satellite data, meteorological data and hydrographic data collected from 2003 to 2017 were jointly utilized to analyze the environmental factors affecting coastal fronts. The intensities of the coastal fronts were found to be associated with the downwelling intensity. The monthly mean K-d(490) anomalies in shallow coastal waters less than 25 m deep along the EGD coast and the monthly mean Ekman pumping velocities retrieved by the ERA5 dataset were negatively correlated, with a Pearson correlation of - 0.71. The fronts started in October, became weaker and gradually disappeared after January, extending southwestward from the southeastern coast of Guangdong Province to the Wanshan Archipelago in the South China Sea (SCS). The cross-frontal differences in the mean K-d(490) values could reach 3.7 m(-1). Noticeable peaks were found in the meridional distribution of the mean K-d(490) values at 22.5 degrees N and 22.2 degrees N and in the zonal distribution of the mean K-d(490) values at 114.7 degrees E and 114.4 degrees E. The peaks tended to narrow as the latitude increased. The average coastal surface currents obtained from the global Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) showed that waters with high nutrient and sediment contents in the Fujian and Zhejiang coastal areas in the southern part of the East China Sea could flow into the SCS. The directions and lengths of the fronts were found to be associated with the flow advection.

TI  - PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure exaggerates the risk of adverse birth outcomes in pregnant women with pre-existing hyperlipidemia: Modulation role of adipokines and lipidome
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The in-utero environmental exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) might lead to adverse birth outcomes, such as low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB), thereby increasing susceptibility to diseases in later life. However, no studies have examined the underlying mechanism through cross-omics of lipidome and adipokines profiling, as well as the possible effect modification by maternal hyperlipidemia. In total, 203 mother-newborn pairs were recruited in the birth cohort study ongoing since February 2017 in Beijing, China. Individual-level of PM2.5 exposure was estimated using a satellite data based random forest model. Cord blood lipidome and adipokines were assessed through the lipidomic approaches and antibody-based array. Multivariable logistic/linear regression models and moderation analysis were employed in this study. We observed a significantly increased risk of PTB associated with PM2.5 exposure during the second trimester, especially in pregnant women with pre-existing hyperlipidemia. 9 lipid classes and 21 adipokines were associated with PM2.5 exposure independently or significantly influenced by the interaction of maternal PM2.5 exposure and hyperlipidemia. In addition, 4 adipokines (ANGPTL4, IGFBP-2, IL-12p40, and TNF-RII) and 3 lipid classes [phosphatidylcholines (PCs), phosphatidylinositols (PIs), and triglycerides (TGs)] were related to the increased risk of PTB, indicating that inflammation, IGF/IGFBP axis, and lipolysis induced lipid homeostasis disorder of PCs, TGs, and PIs might be the possible mediators for the PM2.5-induced adverse birth outcomes. Our results substantiated the need for reducing exposure in susceptible populations. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Area-Wide estimation of seismic building structural types in rural areas by using decision tree and local knowledge in combination
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The seismic building structural type (SBST) represents critical information for accurately assessing seismic risk. Such risk is typically determined as a function of seismic hazards, assets such as buildings and people exposed to hazards, and the vulnerability of those exposed elements (especially buildings because SBSTs dictate the main load-bearing structures of buildings and their seismic vulnerability). China has vast rural areas that generally differ in building upgrade status. SBST distribution information for these areas is often outdated, missing, or nonexistent, thus hindering local governments' planning for earthquake preparedness and mitigation. This study presents a low-cost method for estimating SBSTs in large rural areas. According to building features (e.g., footprint, roof type) extracted from remote sensing data and buildingrelated local knowledge (BRLK) expressed as building group pattern-SBST correlations, a series of SBST recognition rules is established using the decision tree model and statistical methods. The results from experimental verification show the following. Using only decision tree-based recognition, the estimation of SBSTs reaches an overall accuracy of approximately 70%. After combining decision tree-based recognition with BRLK, the overall estimation accuracy exceeds 90%. The proposed method establishes reliable recognition rules for estimating SBSTs in large rural areas and has a strong potential for popularization and application. In the future, the proposed method can be further investigated according to the BRLK in various areas in terms of applicability and adjustment schemes.

TI  - New horizons in imaging and surgical assessment of breast cancer lymph node metastasis
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Axillary nodal status is one of the most important prognostic factors in breast cancer. While sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a safe and validated procedure for clinically node-negative patients, axillary management of clinically node-positive patients has been more controversial. Patients with clinically detected axillary metastases often benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Those who convert to node-negative disease following NAC are important to identify, since they can often be spared significant morbidity from axillary dissection. SLNB has shown widely varying false-negative rates (FNR) but with the use of dual mapping and surgical biopsy of 3 or more nodes, it is considered an acceptable method to stage the axilla in clinically node-positive patients who receive NAC. Various methods including targeted axillary dissection (TAD) have been shown to decrease the FNR of SLNB. We will review appropriate methods to identify a metastatic node and subsequent ultrasound-guided biopsy with tissue marking techniques. We underscore key points in monitoring axillary response, techniques to accurately localize the biopsied and clipped known metastatic node for surgical excision and the effect of various methods in reducing the FNR of SLNB, including the emerging concept of TAD on patient care.

TI  - Analysis of Intestinal Flora and Levels of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, Interleukin-32, and Gastrin 17 in Patients with Gastric Cancer via Carbon Nanoparticle Laparoscopy
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to explore the changes of intestinal flora and serum levels of relevant substances in patients with gastric cancer before and after surgery with carbon nanoparticle laparoscopy, a total of 180 patients with early distal gastric cancer who adopted laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for distal gastric cancer in the general surgery department of TCM Hospital of Shi Jia Zhuang City from January 2018 to January 2020 were selected and randomly divided into two groups: traditional laparoscopic operation (control group) and carbon nanoparticle laparoscopic operation (experimental group) were adopted for treatment for the two groups, respectively. Postoperative evaluation included the difference between the two groups in the operative time, the efficiency of intraoperative lymph node dissection, and the number of lymph node detection. The adverse reactions, changes of intestinal flora before and after surgery in the two groups, and the serum levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), interleukin-32 (IL-32), and gastrin 17 were evaluated. In the experimental group, the success rate of carbon nanoparticle tracer black staining reached 100%, and the operation time of the experimental group was significantly shorter than that of the control group (P<0.05). The lymph node detection rate of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group (P<0.05), but there was no significant difference in the lymph node metastasis rate between the two groups (P>0.05). The sentinel lymph node sensitivity of the experimental group reached 92.3%, and the specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative prediction rates reached 100%; the experimental group patients were with an obviously higher incidence of level I-II gastrointestinal reaction (P<0.05). Postoperative increases in Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus were observed in both groups, while decreases in Enterococcus and Escherichia coli were observed in both groups (P<0.05). Moreover, the degree of increase and decrease in the experimental group was greater than that in the control group (P<0.05). The serum levels of EGFR, IL-32, and gastrin 17 in the two groups were significantly lower than those in the control group on 3d, 7d, and 15d after surgery (P<0.05). In the radical gastrectomy for distal gastric cancer, carbon nanoparticle laparoscopy was not only helpful for the localization of small tumors but also for the thorough dissection of lymph nodes after the surgery, and the postoperative adverse reactions of carbon nanoparticle laparoscopy were also less, which was of great significance for the improvement of intestinal flora and the reduction of serum levels of EGFR, IL-32, and gastrin 17 in gastric cancer patients.

TI  - Interstitial multicatheter HDR-brachytherapy as accelerated partial breast irradiation after second breast-conserving surgery for locally recurrent breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF RADIATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of interstitial multicatheter high dose rate brachytherapy (imHDR-BRT) as accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) after second breast-conserving surgery (BCS) in patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). Between January 2010 and December 2019, 20 patients with IBTR who refused salvage mastectomy (sMT) were treated with second BCS and post-operative imHDR-BRT as APBI. All patients had undergone primary BCS followed by adjuvant external beam radiotherapy. Median imHDR-BRT dose was 32 Gy delivered in twice-daily fractions of 4 Gy. Five-year IBTR-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), overall survival (OS) as well as toxicity and cosmesis were evaluated in the present retrospective analysis. Median age at recurrence and median time from the first diagnosis to IBTR was 65.1 years and 12.2 years, respectively. After a median follow-up of 69.9 months, two patients developed a second local recurrence resulting in 5-year IBTR free-survival of 86.8%. Five-year DMFS and 5-year OS were 84.6% and 92.3%, respectively. Grade 1-2 fibrosis was noted in 60% of the patients with no grade 3 or higher toxicity. Two (10%) cases of asymptomatic fat necrosis were documented. Cosmetic outcome was classified as excellent in 6 (37.5%), good in 6 (37.5%), fair in 3 (18.75%) and poor in 1 (6.25%) patient, respectively. We conclude that imHDR-BRT as APBI re-irradiation is effective and safe for IBTR and should be considered in appropriately selected patients.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of traffic congestion, air pollution, and exposure vulnerability in Tanzania
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Using new satellite data from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-5P system, this article investigates the spatial and temporal dynamics of vehicular traffic congestion, air pollution, and the distributional impacts on vulnerable populations in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The metro region's rapid growth in vehicle traffic exceeds road network capacity, generating congestion, transport delays, and air pollution from excess fuel use. Dangerously high pollution levels from tailpipe emissions put the health of vulnerable residents at risk, calling for the need to adopt continuous air-quality monitoring and effective pollution control. Our results highlight significant impacts of seasonal weather and wind-speed factors on the spatial distribution and intensity of air pollution from vehicle emissions, which vary widely by area. In seasons when weather factors maximize pollution, the worst exposure occurs along the wind path of high-traffic roadways. The study identifies priority areas for reducing congestion to yield the greatest exposure reduction for young children and the elderly in poor households. This new research direction, based only on the use of free global information sources with the same coverage for all cities, offers metropolitan areas in developing regions the opportunity to benefit from the rigorous analyses traditionally limited to well-endowed cites in developing countries.(c) 2021 The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank.

TI  - Analysis of CO<sub>2</sub> spatio-temporal variations in China using a weather-biosphere online coupled model
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of atmospheric CO2 has received considerable attention in the literature, yet significant uncertainties remain within the estimates of contribution from the terrestrial flux and the influence of atmospheric mixing. In this study we apply the WRF-Chem model configured with the Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM) option for biomass fluxes in China to characterize the dynamics of CO2 in the atmosphere. The online coupled WRF-Chem model is able to simulate biosphere processes (photosynthetic uptake and ecosystem respiration) and meteorology in one coordinate system. We apply WRF-Chem for a multi-year simulation (2016-2018) with integrated data from a satellite product, flask samplings, and tower measurements to diagnose the spatio-temporal variations of CO2 fluxes and concentrations in China. We find that the spatial distribution of CO2 was dominated by anthropogenic emissions, while its seasonality (with maxima in April 15 ppmv higher than minima in August) was dominated by the terrestrial flux and background CO2. Observations and simulations revealed a consistent increasing trend in column-averaged CO2 (XCO2) of 2.46 ppmv (0.6% yr(-1)) resulting from anthropogenic emission growth and biosphere uptake. WRF-Chem successfully reproduced ground-based measurements of surface CO2 concentration with a mean bias of -0.79 ppmv and satellite-derived XCO2 with a mean bias of 0.76 ppmv. The model-simulated seasonality was also consistent with observations, with correlation coefficients of 0.90 and 0.89 for ground-based measurements and satellite data, respectively. Tower observations from a background site at Lin'an (30.30 degrees N, 119.75 degrees E) revealed a strong correlation (-0.98) between vertical CO2 and temperature gradients, suggesting a significant influence of boundary layer thermal structure on the accumulation and depletion of atmospheric CO2.

TI  - Flood modeling of a large transboundary river using WRF-Hydro and microwave remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brahmaputra River, a trans-boundary river between India and Bangladesh experiences large scale floods with frequent inundation events affecting millions of people annually. An integrated approach for quantitative understanding of flood wave characteristics and real time flood modeling framework can be helpful for effective decision making and planning of flood risk management strategies. In this study, we have characterized the flood wave propagation in the Brahmaputra River using gauge observations and model simulations. The spatio-temporal variation of flood lift is estimated using stage hydrograph of different gauge stations along the river. The temporal variation in flood hydrograph is characterized by different flood wave parameters for a gauge station which govern the flood condition in the Brahmaputra River. These flood wave characteristics are used in the categorization of different intensity of flood events. To estimate the river discharge, the WRF-Hydro model was set-up over the Brahmaputra river basin for hourly discharge estimation. The satellite observations form altimeter and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are used to estimate river flood-plain elevation and inundation. Altimetry data from Jason-3 satellite was used for water level retrieval and compared with gauge and simulated discharge time-series for further validation of model capabilities. Sentinel-1 satellite SAR images are used to assess the flood inundation extent and probability based on flood wave characteristics in the downstream flood-plain region of Guwahati. Finally, we have integrated these data-sets for a flood modeling and forecasting framework for a braided transboundary river system. This integrated system is studied in detail for an extreme event that occurred during July 2019 in the Brahmaputra River. An hourly estimate of each event for the flood period proved the capability of this system for operational deployment in near real-time flood assessment and forecasting purposes for the flood-prone region of South Asia.

TI  - Novel quinoline-based fluorescent bioimaging probe, KSNP117, for sentinel lymph node mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluorescent imaging agents with biocompatibility and high sensitivity are urgently required for the accurate detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Herein, we report the design of a novel quinoline-based fluorescent probe, designated KSNP117, which can be applied as a biomedical imaging agent in the sensitive and quantitative detection of SLNs. KSNP117 exerted no adverse effects on the proliferation of ovary and immune cells and also showed excellent serum stability with photo-brightening effects. In vivo fluorescent imaging revealed the accumulation of KSNP117 in the SLNs of nude mice within 10 min post injection, without in vivo toxicity, which was consistent with the findings of ex vivo imaging. These results support the potential of KSNP117 as a promising lymphatic tracer for biomedical imaging applications.

TI  - A Sea-Surface Temperature Homogenization Blend for the Northwest Atlantic
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As part of the Atlantic Zone Monitoring Program two different methods were applied to merge three Level-3 AVHRR SST products into a homogenized blend covering the time period from 1982 to present over the Northwest Atlantic, providing a regionally-tuned climatological base on which to assess whether current observations are below, near or above normal. Weekly and monthly SST composites were constructed by averaging daily anomalies within each time period and adding the result to the climatological mean for the period. This approach reduces biases introduced from missing data during a strong warming/cooling seasonal period. Since AVHRR SST data have many spatial and temporal gaps, a common difficulty is establishing how much data are sufficient to yield useful estimations of temperature anomalies. A statistical Monte Carlo method showed that monthly and weekly regional averages composed respectively of as little as 7% and 10% of possible data still yield useful results. A test case shows the increased usefulness of the blend for State of the Ocean reporting. Application of the data set confirmed the use of coastal air temperature as a useful proxy for SST allowing hindcasting past changes or forecasting future changes associated with global warming over Eastern Canadian waters.

TI  - Citizen Scientists Contribute to Real-Time Monitoring of Lake Water Quality Using 3D Printed Mini Secchi Disks
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Citizen science aims to mobilise the general public, motivated by curiosity, to collect scientific data and contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge. In this article, we describe a citizen science network that has been developed to assess the water quality in a 100 km long tropical lake-estuarine system (Vembanad Lake), which directly or indirectly influences the livelihood of around 1.6 million people. Deterioration of water quality in the lake has resulted in frequent outbreaks of water-associated diseases, leading to morbidity and occasionally, to mortality. Water colour and clarity are easily measurable and can be used to study water quality. Continuous observations on relevant spatial and temporal scales can be used to generate maps of water colour and clarity for identifying areas that are turbid or eutrophic. A network of citizen scientists was established with the support of students from 16 colleges affiliated with three universities of Kerala (India) and research institutions, and stakeholders such as houseboat owners, non-government organisations (NGOs), regular commuters, inland fishermen, and others residing in the vicinity of Vembanad Lake and keen to contribute. Mini Secchi disks, with Forel-Ule colour scale stickers, were used to measure the colour and clarity of the water. A mobile application, named "TurbAqua," was developed for easy transmission of data in near-real time. In-situ data from scientists were used to check the quality of a subset of the citizen observations. We highlight the major economic benefits from the citizen network, with stakeholders voluntarily monitoring water quality in the lake at low cost, and the increased potential for sustainable monitoring in the long term. The data can be used to validate satellite products of water quality and can provide scientific information on natural or anthropogenic events impacting the lake. Citizens provided with scientific tools can make their own judgement on the quality of water that they use, helping toward Sustainable Development Goal 6 of clean water. The study highlights potential for world-wide application of similar citizen-science initiatives, using simple tools for generating long-term time series data sets, which may also help monitor climate change.

TI  - Conventional suture with prolonged timing of drainage is as good as quilting suture in preventing seroma formation at pectoral area after mastectomy
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The aim of this study was to compare conventional suture with prolonged timing of drainage with quilting suture on the formation of seroma at pectoral area after mastectomy (ME) with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLN) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for breast cancer. Methods Three hundred and eighty-eight consecutive breast cancer patients were retrospectively analyzed and categorized into three groups. Patients in group 1 were with quilting suture, group 2 with conventional suture and 13-15 days drainage in situ, and group 3 with conventional suture and 20-22 days drainage. The primary outcome was the incidence of grades 2 and 3 seroma at anterior pectoral area within 1 month postoperatively. Cox regression was used for analysis. Results The incidence of grades 2 and 3 seroma was comparable among groups (9.5% vs. 7.9% vs. 5.3%, p = 0.437), as well as late grades 2 and 3 seroma among groups (4.3% vs. 2.9% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.412). Old age, high body mass index, and hypertension were independent risk factors for grades 2 and 3 seroma. Conclusions Prolonged timing of drainage to 13-15 days in conventional suture was long enough to decrease the incidence of grades 2 and 3 seroma as lower as that in quilting suture group at pectoral area within 1 month after mastectomy.

TI  - Predicting distribution of malaria vector larval habitats in Ethiopia by integrating distributed hydrologic modeling with remotely sensed data.
T2  - Scientific Reports
M3  - Article
AB  - Larval source management has gained renewed interest as a malaria control strategy in Africa but the widespread and transient nature of larval breeding sites poses a challenge to its implementation. To address this problem, we propose combining an integrated high resolution (50 m) distributed hydrological model and remotely sensed data to simulate potential malaria vector aquatic habitats. The novelty of our approach lies in its consideration of irrigation practices and its ability to resolve complex ponding processes that contribute to potential larval habitats. The simulation was performed for the year of 2018 using ParFlow-Common Land Model (CLM) in a sugarcane plantation in the Oromia region, Ethiopia to examine the effects of rainfall and irrigation. The model was calibrated using field observations of larval habitats to successfully predict ponding at all surveyed locations from the validation dataset. Results show that without irrigation, at least half of the area inside the farms had a 40% probability of potential larval habitat occurrence. With irrigation, the probability increased to 56%. Irrigation dampened the seasonality of the potential larval habitats such that the peak larval habitat occurrence window during the rainy season was extended into the dry season. Furthermore, the stability of the habitats was prolonged, with a significant shift from semi-permanent to permanent habitats. Our study provides a hydrological perspective on the impact of environmental modification on malaria vector ecology, which can potentially inform malaria control strategies through better water management.

TI  - Intensity of grass invasion negatively correlated with population density and age structure of an endangered dune plant across its range
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive species are a global threat to ecosystem biodiversity and function; non-native grass invasion has been particularly problematic in sparsely vegetated ecosystems such as open dunes. Native plant population responses to invasion, however, are infrequently translated to landscape scales, limiting the effectiveness of these data for addressing conservation issues. We quantified population density, total population size, and age class distribution of the federally-endangered plant species Antioch Dunes evening primrose (Oenothera deltoides subsp. howellii), at sites along a non-native grass invasion gradient in California, USA. We then scaled relationships between invasion and plant density across the species' range using spatial models and remote sensing data. Adult and juvenile O. deltoides subsp. howellii densities were more than 10 times higher in non-invaded areas (grids with 10% total plant cover) when compared to highly-invaded areas (grids with 80% total plant cover). The ratio of O. deltoides subsp. howellii juveniles to adults decreased to less than 1 at 54% total cover, highlighting sensitivity of the regeneration niche to invasion. Spatial models mapped hotspots of O. deltoides subsp. howellii abundance and population structure across the landscape at sub-meter scales. Scaling the impacts of increasing invasion on plant species of conservation concern holds promise when coupled with remote sensing approaches, especially in naturally low-cover ecosystems where readily available metrics (e.g., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) can be used to quantify invasion. These spatial models inform how future invasive species management may influence population size and spatial distribution of species of conservation concern.

TI  - Nahua biocultural richness: an ethnoherpetological perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Mexico harbours one of the greatest biocultural diversities of the world, where multiple social and natural elements and systems form complex networks of interactions in which both culture and nature are mutually influenced. Biocultural states and processes are studied by ethnosciences, among them ethnoherpetology, which seeks understanding material and non-material expressions of the interactions between humans, amphibians, and reptiles. Herpetofauna has been part of the magic-religious world and source of goods for Mesoamerican cultures. This study aims to document and analyse the complex body of knowledge, beliefs, and practices on these vertebrates in the Nahua culture, the factors that have influenced progressive risk and loss of culture, habitat, and species, and the potential contribution of contemporary Nahua knowledge to biocultural conservation. Methods Through 15 workshops with children and young people, and 16 semi-structured interviews to people 27 to 74 years old, we documented the contemporary Nahua knowledge in the communities of Aticpac and Xaltepec in the Sierra Negra, Puebla, central Mexico. Biological and ecological knowledge, use, management practices, legends, and perceptions on herpetofauna were emphasised in the study. Results We obtained an ethnoherpetological checklist, grouping species into four general classificatory categories: kohuatl (serpents), kalatl (frogs and toads), ayotsi (turtles), and ketzo (lizards and salamanders), which included 21, 10, 1, and 11 ethnocategories respectively, based on the local Nahua knowledge of herpetofauna. Serpents, used as medicine, are the most culturally relevant. Due to perceptions of danger, beliefs, and actual snake bites, the main interaction with serpents is their elimination; however, some snakes are tolerated and maintained in captivity. The remaining species of local herpetofauna recorded are tolerated. Cultural aspects of reptiles and amphibians in the Nahua worldview were documented to influence the regulation of interactions of people with these vertebrates, but for younger generations, such aspects are less frequent or absent. Conclusions Interactions and cultural relationships between the Nahua people, amphibians and reptiles are complex, maintaining some aspects of the local worldview but also influenced by external factors and being constantly recreated and re-signified. Documenting and understanding the contemporary relations is essential to generate strategies in biocultural conservation of herpetofauna.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposed a novel cultivated land planning approach coupling expected irrigation water prediction and crop planting structure optimization. Under the guidance of the expected irrigation water prediction, the development of agricultural planting strategies was proposed through the cultivated land planning method to improve the efficiency of water use and ensure agricultural production. This approach was consisted of two models: a combination forecasting model was developed for estimating expected irrigation water with help of remote sensing data (RSCM); and a bi-level multiobjective programming model for planning crop planting structure (BMPSOM) was formulated for crop planting structure programming. Then, the proposed approach applied to a real-world case in Northwest China for verifying its validity. Results show that: 1) the forecast accuracy of the combination forecast model has been greatly improved compared to the single forecast model, the accuracy test results are RMSE = 0.25 & times; 108 m3, MAPE = 0.78%; 2) the use of remote sensing data can reflect the soil moisture with spatial variability in the forecast; 3) BMPSOM model can well reflect the leader-follower relationship and make tradeoff among multiple objectives of each decision maker in tackling practical problem. Application has proved that the agricultural planting strategy formulated by this approach can not only ensure economic benefits but also increase food production under limited water resources. Therefore, this method has good application prospects in areas where water resources are scarce.

TI  - Deep learning-based crop mapping in the cloudy season using one-shot hyperspectral satellite imagery
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop mapping is essential for agricultural management, economic development planning, and ecological conservation. Remote sensing with a large field of view provides us with a potential technique for large-scale crop mapping. However, most of the previous studies have focused on multi-temporal crop mapping, requiring multiple imaging over a period of time, which is impossible in the cloudy season due to the absence of clear atmospheric windows. Recently, with the progress of spaceborne hyperspectral imaging technology, wide-width hyperspectral satellite images, which provide abundant spectral and spatial structure information, have made the precision crop mapping of large areas possible. This paper focuses on deep learning based crop mapping using one-shot hyperspectral satellite imagery, where three convolutional neural network (CNN) models, i.e., 1D-CNN, 2D-CNN, and 3D-CNN models, are applied for end-to-end crop mapping. In addition, a manifold learning based visualization approach, i.e., t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), is introduced to illustrate the discriminative ability of the deep semantic features extracted by the different CNN models. To demonstrate the advantages of one-shot hyperspectral satellite images, an experiment was designed to compare the crop mapping performance of different remote sensing data sources, where both mono-temporal and multi-temporal multispectral images (MSIs) of the same research area were introduced for a systematic comparison. The classification accuracy when using hyperspectral satellite images was found to reach more than 94%, which was much better than that when using mono-temporal MSIs, and was comparable to the result when using multi-temporal MSIs. These findings will be important for the application of hyperspectral data when mapping large-area crop landscapes, and they confirm the potential of CNN models, particularly 3D-CNN models, for crop recognition.

TI  - No peace for the forest: Rapid, widespread land changes in the Andes-Amazon region following the Colombian civil war
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Negative environmental impacts of violent conflict have been observed worldwide. Whether or not active global conflicts are declining in number remains hotly debated, the number of countries entering post-conflict periods is on the rise, and the impact of this transition on land cover changes remains poorly understood. In Colombia, though large-scale armed conflict has concluded, the post-conflict period represents an ongoing threat to forest conservation, putting at risk commitments to meet global conservation goals and even those stipulated in the peace accord. This paper aims to assess land cover change associated with the Colombian conflict in the AndesAmazon region between 1988 and 2019. First, we use the Landsat archive to map land cover and characterize the spatial patterns of change at the regional level. Second, to empirically identify the effect of conflict on land cover change, we employ a difference-in-difference approach using local conflict events data. During conflict (1988-2011), land cover in the Andes-Amazon remained relatively stable, however during the post-conflict period (2012-2019), the conversion from forest to agriculture increased by 40%. We find that forest cover surrounding conflict events (1 km radius) decreased significantly, on average by - 19% during conflict, which accelerated to - 30% in the post-conflict period. Similarly, agriculture expansion is most substantial during the post-conflict period, but exclusively in municipalities with population below the 50th percentile. Landscape metrics show that in peripheral municipalities (<50th), agriculture occurs in clumped distributions during the conflict period. Meanwhile, during the post-conflict period, this expansion happens more quickly, with significantly greater agricultural patch sizes than during the conflict period. We conclude that a slow implementation of conservation governance, the emergence of illegal land markets, and illicit land uses (i.e., coca and illegal cattle ranching) may accelerate land cover change in the coming years.

TI  - Contextualizing land-use and land-cover change with local knowledge: A case study from Pokot Central, Kenya
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rural communities in the drylands of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) derive their livelihoods primarily from their natural resource base. Unprecedented changes in these environments over the past few decades are likely to intensify in the future and land users need to develop sustainable adaptation strategies. This study aims to identify land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes and their drivers in a sub-Saharan dryland, between 1986 and 2017, by integrating local knowledge and remote sensing. Local knowledge and environmental perception are used as the basis for defining LULC classes and for training and validation of change detection. This study detects significant LULC changes in 41% of the investigated area, and identifies bush encroachment into former pastures as the dominant LULC change with an increase of woodland by 39% and a decrease of grassland by 74%. This process is perceived as severe degradation by local respondents and is linked to changing management regimes and unreliable rainfall patterns. Deforestation and woodland thinning account for 44% of the detected changes, and can be traced back to increased habitation and farming, although the local community also identifies charcoal production as a driving factor. The integration of remote sensing and local knowledge provides a holistic view on LULC change in Pokot Central, Kenya and offers a solid base for site-specific and actor-centred management approaches necessary for sustainable pathways of drylands. Our results emphasize the need to include local actors in the development of adaptation strategies and management guidelines for drylands.

TI  - 19-year remotely sensed data in the forecast of spectral models of the environment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aims of this study were: i) to compare no-till areas in two municipalities located in different regions of Brazil, along with the influence on CO(2)Flux and GPP, and ii) to verify the difference between environmental factors followed by the trends of these variables regarding future scenarios (ARIMA time-series model number). The study was carried out in two areas with different latitudes in the municipalities of Sinop-MT and Passo Fundo-RS, both in Brazil. A time series of 19 years was performed with data acquired by remote sensing from the following satellites: i) Landsat-8 (OLI and TIRS), and ii) TERRA/AQUA (MODIS). The results propound that the spectro-temporal variables are directly influenced by soil management and agricultural practices over the observation time, with a satisfactory correlation in future predictions of the variables for the next ten years, in which presented that the variation of GPP and albedo values for the two study sites would gradually increase until 2028 and the temperature remained constant between the range of its seasonality, and CO(2)Flux tends to decrease in its seasonality, indicating a higher CO2 absorption.

TI  - HazMapper: a global open-source natural hazard mapping application in Google Earth Engine
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern satellite networks with rapid image acquisition cycles allow for near-real-time imaging of areas impacted by natural hazards such as mass wasting, flooding, and volcanic eruptions. Publicly accessible multi-spectral datasets (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel-2) are particularly helpful in analyzing the spatial extent of disturbances, however, the datasets are large and require intensive processing on high-powered computers by trained analysts. HazMapper is an open-access hazard mapping application developed in Google Earth Engine that allows users to derive map and GIS-based products from Sentinel or Landsat datasets without the time- and cost-intensive resources required for traditional analysis. The first iteration of HazMapper relies on a vegetation-based metric, the relative difference in the normalized difference vegetation index (rdNDVI), to identify areas on the landscape where vegetation was removed following a natural disaster. Because of the vegetation-based metric, the tool is typically not suitable for use in desert or polar regions. HazMapper is not a semi-automated routine but makes rapid and repeatable analysis and visualization feasible for both recent and historical natural disasters. Case studies are included for the identification of landslides and debris flows, wildfires, pyroclastic flows, and lava flow inundation. HazMapper is intended for use by both scientists and non-scientists, such as emergency managers and public safety decision-makers.

TI  - The devil is in the detail: reflections on the value and application of cognitive interviewing to strengthen quantitative surveys in global health
T2  - HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cognitive interviewing is a qualitative research method for improving the validity of quantitative surveys, which has been underused by academic researchers and monitoring and evaluation teams in global health. Draft survey questions are administered to participants drawn from the same population as the respondent group for the survey itself. The interviewer facilitates a detailed discussion with the participant to assess how the participant interpreted each question and how they formulated their response. Draft survey questions are revised and undergo additional rounds of cognitive interviewing until they achieve high comprehension and cognitive match between the research team's intent and the target population's interpretation. This methodology is particularly important in global health when surveys involve translation or are developed by researchers who differ from the population being surveyed in terms of socio-demographic characteristics, worldview, or other aspects of identity. Without cognitive interviewing, surveys risk measurement error by including questions that respondents find incomprehensible, that respondents are unable to accurately answer, or that respondents interpret in unintended ways. This methodological musing seeks to encourage a wider uptake of cognitive interviewing in global public health research, provide practical guidance on its application, and prompt discussion on its value and practice. To this end, we define cognitive interviewing, discuss how cognitive interviewing compares to other forms of survey tool development and validation, and present practical steps for its application. These steps cover defining the scope of cognitive interviews, selecting and training researchers to conduct cognitive interviews, sampling participants, collecting data, debriefing, analysing the emerging findings, and ultimately generating revised, validated survey questions. We close by presenting recommendations to ensure quality in cognitive interviewing.

TI  - A Dark Target research aerosol algorithm for MODIS observations over eastern China: increasing coverage while maintaining accuracy at high aerosol loading
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite aerosol products such as the Dark Target (DT) produced from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are useful for monitoring the progress of air pollution. Unfortunately, the DT often fails to retrieve during the heaviest aerosol events as well as the more moderate events in winter. Some of the literature attributes this lack of retrieval to the cloud mask. However, we found this lack of retrieval is mainly traced to thresholds used for masking of inland water and snow. Modifications to these two masks greatly increase 50% of the retrievals of aerosol optical depth at 0.55 mu m (AOD) greater than 1.0. The "extra"-high-AOD retrievals tend to be biased when compared with a ground-based sun photometer (AErosol RObotic NETwork, AERONET). Reducing bias in new retrievals requires two additional steps. One is an update to the assumed aerosol optical properties (aerosol model); the haze in this region is both less absorbing and lower in altitude than what is assumed in the global algorithm. The second is accounting for the scale height of the aerosol, specifically that the heavy-aerosol events in the region are much closer to the surface than what is assumed by the global DT algorithm. The resulting combination of modified masking thresholds, new aerosol model, and lower aerosol layer scale height was applied to 3 months of MODIS observations (January-March 2013) over eastern China. After these two additional steps are implemented, the significant increase in new retrievals introduces no overall bias at a high-AOD regime but does degrade other overall validation statistics. We also find that the research algorithm is able to identify additional pollution events that AERONET instruments may not due to different spatial sampling. Mean AOD retrieved from the research algorithm increases from 0.11 to 0.18 compared to values calculated from the operational DT algorithm during January to March of 2013 over the study area. But near Beijing, where the severe pollution occurs, the new algorithm increases AOD by as much as 3.0 for each 0.5 degrees grid box over the previous operational-algorithm values.

TI  - Cutting out the middleman: calibrating and validating a dynamic vegetation model (ED2-PROSPECT5) using remotely sensed surface reflectance
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy radiative transfer is the primary mechanism by which models relate vegetation composition and state to the surface energy balance, which is important to light- and temperature-sensitive plant processes as well as understanding land-atmosphere feedbacks. In addition, certain parameters (e.g., specific leaf area, SLA) that have an outsized influence on vegetation model behavior can be constrained by observations of shortwave reflectance, thus reducing model predictive uncertainty. Importantly, calibrating against radiative transfer outputs allows models to directly use remote sensing reflectance products without relying on highly derived products (such as MODIS leaf area index) whose assumptions may be incompatible with the target vegetation model and whose uncertainties are usually not well quantified. Here, we created the EDR model by coupling the two-stream representation of canopy radiative transfer in the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 (ED2) with a leaf radiative transfer model (PROSPECT-5) and a simple soil reflectance model to predict full-range, high-spectral-resolution surface reflectance that is dependent on the underlying ED2 model state. We then calibrated this model against estimates of hemispherical reflectance (corrected for directional effects) from the NASA Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and survey data from 54 temperate forest plots in the northeastern United States. The calibration significantly reduced uncertainty in model parameters related to leaf biochemistry and morphology and canopy structure for five plant functional types. Using a single common set of parameters across all sites, the calibrated model was able to accurately reproduce surface reflectance for sites with highly varied forest composition and structure. However, the calibrated model's predictions of leaf area index (LAI) were less robust, capturing only 46 % of the variability in the observations. Comparing the ED2 radiative transfer model with another two-stream soil-leaf-canopy radiative transfer model commonly used in remote sensing studies (PRO4SAIL) illustrated structural errors in the ED2 representation of direct radiation backscatter that resulted in systematic underestimation of reflectance. In addition, we also highlight that, to directly compare with a two-stream radiative transfer model like EDR, we had to perform an additional processing step to convert the directional reflectance estimates of AVIRIS to hemispherical reflectance (also known as "albedo"). In future work, we recommend that vegetation models add the capability to predict directional reflectance, to allow them to more directly assimilate a wide range of airborne and satellite reflectance products. We ultimately conclude that despite these challenges, using dynamic vegetation models to predict surface reflectance is a promising avenue for model calibration and validation using remote sensing data.

TI  - Constructing Damage Indices Based on Publicly Available Spatial Data: Exemplified by Earthquakes and Volcanic Eruptions in Indonesia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article demonstrates the construction of earthquake and volcano damage indices using publicly available remote sensing sources and data on the physical characteristics of events. For earthquakes we use peak ground motion maps in conjunction with building type fragility curves to construct a local damage indicator. For volcanoes we employ volcanic ash data as a proxy for local damages. Both indices are then spatially aggregated by taking local economic exposure into account by assessing nightlight intensity derived from satellite images. We demonstrate the use of these indices with a case study of Indonesia, a country frequently exposed to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The results show that the indices capture the areas with the highest damage, and we provide overviews of the modeled aggregated damage for all provinces and districts in Indonesia for the time period 2004 to 2014. The indices were constructed using a combination of software programs-ArcGIS/Python, Matlab, and Stata. We also outline what potential freeware alternatives exist. Finally, for each index we highlight the assumptions and limitations that a potential practitioner needs to be aware of.

TI  - Satellite Observations and Malaria: New Opportunities for Research and Applications
T2  - TRENDS IN PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Satellite remote sensing provides a wealth of information about environmental factors that influence malaria transmission cycles and human populations at risk. Long-term observations facilitate analysis of climate-malaria relationships, and high-resolution data can be used to assess the effects of agriculture, urbanization, deforestation, and water management on malaria. New sources of very-high-resolution satellite imagery and synthetic aperture radar data will increase the precision and frequency of observations. Cloud computing platforms for remote sensing data combined with analysis-ready datasets and high-level data products have made satellite remote sensing more accessible to nonspecialists. Further collaboration between the malaria and remote sensing communities is needed to develop and implement useful geospatial data products that will support global efforts toward malaria control, elimination, and eradication.

T2  - GROWTH AND CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - An urban ecosystem carries the burden of urbanization and records the changes in the ecological environment . A scientific evaluation of the urban ecosystem can effectively assess and identify any system damage and degradation caused by nature or by human activities. In this paper, we construct an urban ecosystem health assessment system on the basis of a pressure-state-response (PSR)/vigor-organization-resilience (VOR) model along with the socioeconomic and remote sensing data related to Nanjing. Meanwhile, the factors hindering the stainable development of the Nanjing ecosystem are discussed. The results indicated that the health of the urban ecosystem in Nanjing is generally on the rise, improving from poor in 2000 to good in 2017; from the results obtained via the PSR model, the state layer continues to decrease, whereas the pressure and response layers continue to increase; the VOR model demonstrated that the urban ecosystem in Nanjing has been relatively stable over the past 20 years, and the obstacle degree model demonstrated that, over the next 10 years, the obstacle factors will be concentrated in the response layer in the early stage and in the pressure layer in the later period, mainly because of the pressure brought about by population growth.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Compression Evaluation Method Based on Neural Network Prediction and Fusion Quality Fidelity
T2  - MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lossy compression can produce false information, such as blockiness, noise, ringing, ghosting, aliasing, and blurring. This paper provides a comprehensive model for optical remote sensing image characteristics based on the block standard deviation's retention rate (BSV). We first propose a compression evaluation method, CR_CI, that combines neural network prediction and remote sensing image quality fidelity. Through the compression evaluation and improved experimental verification of multiple satellites (CBERS-02B satellite, ZY-1-02C satellite, CBERS-04 satellite, GF-1, GF-2, etc.), CR_CI can be stable, cleverly test changes in the information extraction performance of optical remote sensing images, and provide strong support for optimizing the design of compression schemes. In addition, a predictor of remote sensing image number compression is constructed based on deep neural networks, which combines compression efficiency (compression ratio), image quality, and protection. Empirical results demonstrate the image's highest compression efficiency under the premise of satisfying visual interpretation and quantitative application.

TI  - An extension-dominant 9-km-long ground failure along a buried geological fault on the eastern Beijing Plain, China
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the northern Beijing Plain (BPN), ground failures associated with land subsidence have occurred and rapidly progressed, damaging hundreds of buildings and roads in recent years. In 2016, an 8.7-km-long ground failure, named the Songzhuang (SZ) ground failure, was discovered in the eastern part of the Beijing Plain. Geological surveys, mapping, creep measurements, trenching, drilling, and geophysical exploration indicate that the SZ ground failure has geometric structural features and surface deformation that differ from those of other ground failures in the BPN: First, the SZ ground failure consists of one main fissure and many secondary fissures. Second, the SZ failure shows tensile deformation with negligible vertical dislocation. Third, in the profile, the SZ ground failure shows extensional cracks with limited extension depths that close gradually with depth. Based on the relationships between ground failures and influencing factors, including a pre-existing fault, earthquakes, and groundwater pumping, we conclude that this failure took shape after the earthquake, and was enlarged under the action of groundwater pumping. The pre-existing fault, which is a subsidiary fault of the northern section of the Nanyuan-Tongxian (NTN) fault, determined the area in which the SZ ground failure first formed.

TI  - Six distinct NFκB signaling codons convey discrete information to distinguish stimuli and enable appropriate macrophage responses
T2  - IMMUNITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Macrophages initiate inflammatory responses via the transcription factor NF kappa B. The temporal pattern of NF kappa B activity determines which genes are expressed and thus, the type of response that ensues. Here, we examined how information about the stimulus is encoded in the dynamics of NF kappa B activity. We generated an mVenus-RelA reporter mouse line to enable high-throughput live-cell analysis of primary macrophages responding to host- and pathogen-derived stimuli. An information-theoretic workflow identified six dynamical features-termed signaling codons-that convey stimulus information to the nucleus. In particular, oscillatory trajectories were a hallmark of responses to cytokine but not pathogen-derived stimuli. Single-cell imaging and RNA sequencing of macrophages from a mouse model of Sjogren's syndrome revealed inappropriate responses to stimuli, suggestive of confusion of two NF kappa B signaling codons. Thus, the dynamics of NF kappa B signaling classify immune threats through six signaling codons, and signal confusion based on defective codon deployment may underlie the etiology of some inflammatory diseases.

TI  - Canopy chlorophyll content retrieved from time series remote sensing data as a proxy for detecting bark beetle infestation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus, L.) is an invasive species resulting in a high degree of fragmentation, forest productivity, and phenology. Understanding its biology and its early detection based on its behaviour is essential for its successful management and eradication. This study demonstrates the potential of the canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) product retrieved from remote sensing datasets to detect early bark beetle infestations in the Bavarian Forest National Park. Time series CCC maps were generated through radiative transfer model inversion of images from RapidEye and Sentinel-2 (2011-2018). The CCC products were then classified into stressed and healthy classes using calculated CCC mean and variance values obtained for infected and healthy Norway spruce trees in 2016. The location of infected plots obtained from the interoperation of resolution (0.1 m) aerial photographs was used as reference data to validate the accuracy of the infestation maps generated from CCC. Validation of the infestation maps indicated a classification accuracy of up to 78%. Our results demonstrated that CCC products derived from satellite remote sensing data were a rigorous proxy for early detection of bark beetle infestation. Hence, CCC products may play a significant role in understanding the dynamics of the Infestation and improving the management of bark beetle outbreaks in forest ecosystems. Inclusion of other remotely sensed plant traits as additional parameters in the model, such as dry matter and nitrogen, may further improve the accuracy of early detection of bark beetle infestation using satellite remote sensing.

TI  - Indocyanine green versus technetium-99m with blue dye for sentinel lymph node detection in early-stage cervical cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background The fluorescent dye indocyanine green (ICG) has emerged as a promising tracer for intraoperative detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in early-stage cervical cancer. Although researchers suggest the SLN detection of ICG is equal to the more conventional combined approach of a radiotracer and blue dye, no consensus has been reached.Aims We aimed to assess the differences in overall and bilateral SLN detection rates with ICG versus the combined approach, the radiotracer technetium-99m (Tc-99m) with blue dye.Methods and Results We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to January 1, 2020 and included studies reporting on a comparison of SLN detection with ICG versus Tc-99m with blue dye in early-stage cervical cancer. The overall and bilateral detection rates were pooled with random-effects meta-analyses.From 118 studies retrieved seven studies (one cross-sectional; six retrospective cohorts) were included, encompassing 589 patients. No significant differences were found in the pooled overall SLN detection rate of ICG versus Tc-99m with blue dye. Meta-analyses of all studies showed ICG to result in a higher bilateral SLN detection rate than Tc-99m with blue dye; 90.3% (95%CI, 79.8-100.0%) with ICG versus 73.5% (95%CI, 66.4-80.6%) with 99mTc with blue dye. This resulted in a significant and clinically relevant risk difference of 16.6% (95%CI, 5.3-28.0%). With sensitivity analysis, the risk difference of the bilateral detection rate maintained in favor of ICG but was no longer significant (13.2%, 95%CI -0.8-27.3%).Conclusion ICG appears to provide higher bilateral SLN detection rates compared to Tc-99m with blue dye in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. However, in adherence with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines, the quality of evidence is too low to provide strong recommendations and directly omit the combined approach of Tc-99m with blue dye.

TI  - First comprehensive quantification of annual land use/cover from 1990 to 2020 across mainland Vietnam
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive studies have highlighted a need for frequently consistent land cover information for interdisciplinary studies. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for the automatic production of the first Vietnam-wide annual land use/land cover (LULC) data sets (VLUCDs) from 1990 to 2020, using available remotely sensed and inventory data. Classification accuracies ranged from 85.7 +/- 1.3 to 92.0 +/- 1.2% with the primary dominant LULC and 77.6 +/- 1.2% to 84.7 +/- 1.1% with the secondary dominant LULC. This confirmed the potential of the proposed framework for systematically long-term monitoring LULC in Vietnam. Results reveal that despite slight recoveries in 2000 and 2010, the net loss of forests (19,940 km(2)) mainly transformed to croplands over 30 years. Meanwhile, productive croplands were converted to urban areas, which increased approximately ten times. A threefold increase in aquaculture was a major driver of the wetland loss (1914 km(2)). The spatial-temporal changes varied, but the most dynamic regions were the western north, the southern centre, and the south. These findings can provide evidence-based information on formulating and implementing coherent land management policies. The explicitly spatio-temporal VLUCDs can be benchmarks for global LULC validation, and utilized for a variety of applications in the research of environmental changes towards the Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - Effects of COVID-19 on the environment: An overview on air, water, wastewater, and solid waste
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the world hardly as of the beginning of 2020 and quickly spread worldwide from its first-reported point in early Dec. 2019. By mid-March 2021, the COVID-19 almost hit all countries worldwide, with about 122 and 2.7 million confirmed cases and deaths, respectively. As a strong measure to stop the infection spread and deaths, many countries have enforced quarantine and lockdown of many activities. The shutdown of these activities has resulted in large economic losses. However, it has been widely reported that these measures have resulted in improved air quality, more specifically in highly polluted areas characterized by massive population and industrial activities. The reduced levels of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and particulate matter emissions have been reported and confirmed worldwide in association with lockdown periods. On the other hand, ozone levels in ambient air have been found to increase, mainly in response to the reduced nitrogen emissions. In addition, improved water quality in natural water resources has been reported as well. Wastewater facilities have reported a higher level of organic load with persistent chemicals due to the increased use of sanitizers, disinfectants, and antibiotics. The solid waste generated due to the COVID-19 pandemic was found to increase both qualitatively and quantitatively. This work presents and summarizes the observed environmental effects of COVID-19 as reported in the literature for different countries worldwide. The work provides a distinct overview considering the effects imposed by COVID-19 on the air, water, wastewater, and solid waste as critical elements of the environment.

TI  - Co-seismic and post-seismic deformation, field observations and fault model of the 30 October 2020 M<sub>w</sub>=7.0 Samos earthquake, Aegean Sea
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - On 30 October 2020, a large M-w = 7.0 earthquake occurred north of the island of Samos, Greece. Here we present the characteristics of the seismic fault (location, geometry, geodetic moment) as inferred from the processing of geodetic data (InSAR and GNSS). We use the InSAR displacement data from Sentinel-1 interferograms (ascending orbit 29 and descending 36) and the GNSS offsets from fourteen (14) stations in Greece and Turkey to invert for the fault parameters. Our inversion modelling indicates the activation of a normal fault offshore Samos with a length of 40 km, width of 15 km, average slip of 1.7 m, a moderate dip-angle (37 degrees) and with a dip-direction towards North. The inferred fault is located immediately north of, and adjacent to Samos with the top of the slip similar to 0.6 km below surface, and similar to 1 km offshore at its closest to the island. Near the fault, the earthquake caused the permanent uplift of the island up to 10 cm with the exception of a coastal strip along part of the northern shore that subsided 2-6 cm. The co-seismic horizontal motion of GNSS station SAMO was 35.6 cm towards south and 3 cm towards west. A post-seismic signal (22-33% of the co-seismic on the vertical component) was observed at GNSS stations SAMO and SAMU, with a time constant of 30 days. The effects of the earthquake included liquefaction, rock falls, rock slides, road cracks and deep-seated landslides, all due to the strong ground motion and associated down-slope mobilization of soil cover and loose sediments.

TI  - Analysis and precision of the Terrestrial Surface Temperature using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 3 images: Study applied to the city of Granada (Spain)
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of Landsat 8 and Sentinel 3 satellite images to calculate the land surface temperature (LST) has become one of the most common methods in urban areas. Knowing its precision and seasonal variability will affect future studies of urban climate alteration, such as Urban Heat Island (UHI) that allow sustainable decisions that increase the resilience of cities. In this research, the LST of a medium-sized city, Granada (Spain), was determined using six split window (SW) algorithms: three for Landsat 8 and another three for Sentinel 3A and 3B. Data were validated by measurements in situ at different parts of the city, chosen to represent the different land covers established in the Corine Land Cover inventory (2020). This city has a unique geographical situation, substantial pollution and high daily temperature variations, making it very suitable for study. The data validation by means of statistical analysis gave R2 linear fitting coefficients, the mean square error (RMSE), the mean bias error (MBE) and standard deviation. Our results reveal that the methods based on Landsat 8 SW algorithms present higher mean values (8.16 K) than Sentinel 3 (5.07 K) and Sentinel 3B (2.21 K), the differences being even greater during dry periods. Still, the SWs analyzed can be considered effective and reliable for determining the city's LST. The use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in improving the quality of satellite images has reported significant improvements in the LST results obtained.

TI  - Hydrothermal index and entropy generation of a heated cylinder placed between two oppositely rotating cylinders in a vented cavity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, hydrothermal behavior and entropy generation of a heated cylinder placed between two oppositely rotating cylinders inside a vented cavity is studied numerically using the finite volume technique. The mixed convection of a steady, 2D, and laminar flow is considered for the flow through the vented cavity. For counter-rotating cylinders, according to the center of the heated cylinder, two different vertical distances, Zy and three different horizontal distances, Zx are investigated with angular rotational speeds, Omega ranging from 0 to 15. The influence of relevant parameters on hydrothermal behavior, such as Reynolds number (100 <= Re <= 500) and Grashof number (10(3) <= Gr <= 10(6) ) is taken into account throughout the simulations. The numerical results are exposed in terms of various qualitative and quantitative figures. Regardless of the position of counter-rotating cylinders, results show that the optimal thermal performance criterion, xi is achieved at low Reynolds number (Re = 100) over the ranges of angular rotational speeds, Omega.

TI  - Geo-spatial Analysis for Flash Flood Susceptibility Mapping in the North-East <i>Haor</i> (Wetland) Region in Bangladesh
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The north-eastern haor (wetland) area of Bangladesh is extremely vulnerable to flash flooding which damages crops, property, and infrastructures. The main objective of this research is to develop and test a methodology for delineation of flash flood hazard zones in the north-eastern haor (wetland) region of Bangladesh which would help to identify and prepare against the flash flood. After reviewing relevant literature, multiple indicators and indexes including slope, soil type, rainfall, land use land cover, drainage density, distance from the river, normalized difference vegetation index, topographic wetness index, and digital elevation model were used to assess the flood susceptibility in the study region. The Landsat 8 images and data from other secondary sources are used in AHP and GIS platforms to obtain the results. The findings show that among the seven haor districts, the susceptibility of flood hazard differs significantly. Significant areas from Brahmanbaria, Kishoreganj, Netrokona, Sunamganj district have been emerged as highly susceptible to flash flood hazard. About 756,970 ha areas were identified as high flood-prone areas. The other three haor districts such as Habiganj, Moulavibazar, and Sylhet are less susceptible to flash floods. About 255,587-ha areas were identified as low flood-prone. Model validity was tested through receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. In the ROC curve, the area under the curve (AUC) is 0.839 which means the model's predictive power is 84%. Similarly, the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the Friedman test also show that the model is valid. Furthermore, the correlation analysis between flood hazard map and inundation map (based on 2017s flood) was also performed where a moderately good R-2 value (0.72) was obtained which means the susceptibility map has delineated the flood-prone areas correctly in 73% of cases. In the changing scenario of climate, the risk of flash floods might increase even more. Therefore, the findings could help the policymakers and planners in developing a preparedness system that would limit the property loss and wealth in the north-eastern haor region of Bangladesh.

TI  - Electrification seeds-A fiexible approach for decentralized electricity supply in developing countries
T2  - ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There are currently more than 500 million people without access to electricity on the African continent alone. With an expected strong population growth and the global goals for reducing carbon emissions, the challenge of providing electricity for all is tremendous. We present an approach that tackles electrification bottom-up in a decentral approach from so-called electrification seeds: Business owners or public institutions that invest in an electricity system to ensure reliable electricity supply for themselves may serve as a seed by also selling elec-tricity in their surroundings via mini-or microgrids. This approach will allow for cheaper solutions due to economies of scale. While private households can also be addressed by simple solutions e.g. solar home systems, the power of the "electrification seed" approach is that it can also provide enough secure power for small and medium enterprises (SME) and thus drive economic development. It is important to address the individual environment of the respective electrification seed, since there is no standard solution. To do so, the method includes an entire toolchain from estimating demands and structures with satellite data and Geographic Information System (GIS) software over employing an energy system model for finding the optimal technological design. As a last step, the viability of the electrification seed concept is verified with an exemplary business plan. The results show positive business cases for the electrification seed and a reduction of electricity costs for end-customers by 11.3 %. Altogether, this gives a very optimistic outlook of the suggested approach to support the great challenge of sustainable electrification for economic growth in developing countries.(c) 2021 International Energy Initiative.

TI  - Analysis and prediction of land cover changes using the land change modeler (LCM) in a semiarid river basin, Iran
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting future land cover (LC) changes is an important step in the proper planning and management of watersheds. As a susceptible area to salinity and desertification, receiving only about 195 mm rainfall annually, the Hable-Rud River basin is especially sensitive to land use/cover changes. Based on corrected LANDSAT satellite images for the years 1986, 2000, and 2017, the LC were extracted using the maximum likelihood (ML) method. LC changes were predicted by applying the land change modeler (LCM) for the basin. The kappa index for classification in 1986, 2000, and 2017 was 75, 78, and 81%, respectively. Using LCM, the prediction was accomplished for the year 2017 with a kappa index of above 74%. The LC map was predicted for year 2040. The analysis indicates that over the past 32 years, bare land, saline land, agricultural, industrial, and residential areas have increased by about 8, 6.2, 2.7, 0.63, and 0.48%, respectively; while rangeland area was decreased by 18%. Results also indicate that given the predicted LC for year 2040 in comparison with the reference year (2017), saline land, agricultural, industrial, and residential areas will be likely to continue to increase by about 3, 1.5, 0.7, and 0.8%, respectively, whereas bare land and rangeland will most likely decrease by about 4.55 and 1.45%, respectively. The findings of this study assist in analyzing the future trends of LC changes in the basin. This information can be used as a guide for land planners and managers in future land use planning of the area.

TI  - Similarities and disparities in urban local heat islands responsive to regular-, stable-, and counter-urbanization: A case study of Guangzhou, China
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of the intra-city surface heat island (herein termed the surface urban heat island, SUHI) is critical for the design of urban heat mitigation strategies. Large disparities in the spatiotemporal variations of SUHIs are anticipated under different urbanization processes. However, most previous studies have focused solely on the inter-annual spatiotemporal SUHI variations of regular urbanization, while those for stable- and counter-urbanization remain largely unknown. Based on the remote identification of these three urbanization types over Guangzhou, China, we propose a novel strategy to investigate simultaneously the spatiotemporal variations and the associated controls of SUHIs. Our results indicate that: (1) Counter-, regular-, and stable-urbanization occurs mainly over the city center, city periphery, and the in-between areas, respectively. (2) The three urbanization types all demonstrate similar and significant growth in the daytime local SUHI intensity (SUHII). (3) There are significant disparities in the contributions of controls to the inter-annual daytime SUHII trends for these three urbanization processes. For the regular urbanization, the increase of the impervious surface percentage (ISP) dominates daytime SUHII growth, while the combination of ISP and residual factors (e.g., background climate and 3D urban geometry) leads for counter urbanization. For stable urbanization, the combination of residual controls and the increase in population density is the major factor. Urban divisional management may contribute to the mitigation of intra-city SUHI. Our findings potentially advance our understanding of changes in urban thermal environment under different urbanization processes.

TI  - Unmanned aerial vehicle to evaluate frost damage in coffee plants
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Damage caused by frost on coffee plants can impact significantly in the reduction of crop quality and productivity. Remote sensing can be used to evaluate the damage caused by frost, providing precise and timely agricultural information to producers, assisting in decision making, and consequently minimizing production losses. In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the potential use of multispectral images obtained by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to analyze and identify damage caused by frost in coffee plants in different climatic favorability zones. Visual evaluations of frost damage and chlorophyll content quantification were carried out in a commercial coffee plantation in Southern Minas Gerais, Brazil. The images were obtained from a multispectral camera coupled to a UAV with rotating wings. The results obtained demonstrated that the vegetation indices had a strong relationship and high accuracy with the frost damage. Among the indices studied the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was the one that had better performances (r = - 0.89, R-2 = 0.79, MAE = 10.87 e RMSE = 14.35). In a simple way, this study demonstrated that multispectral images, obtained from UAV, can provide a fast, continuous, and accessible method to identify and evaluate frost damage in coffee plants. This information is essential for the coffee producer for decision-making and adequate crop management.

TI  - Fidelity of reanalysis datasets in floodplain mapping: Investigating performance at inundation level over large regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface runoff estimates from atmospheric reanalysis datasets are increasingly preferred by hydrologists for modeling floods in regions where traditional observations are not sufficiently available. This study explores the fidelity of four widely used reanalyses runoff products from CFSR (6 hourly), ERA-Interim (3 hourly), MERRA (1 hourly), and NARR (3 hourly) as hydraulic forcings to a flood inundation model in describing inundation dynamics over Canada. The reanalysis datasets (duration: 1970 to 2010) are fed to the Catchment-based Macroscale Floodplain (CaMa-Flood) global hydrodynamic model, along with other relevant river and floodplain characteristic inputs, to derive high-resolution floodplain maps for 100 and 200-yr return periods. The floodplain maps derived from each reanalysis dataset are compared with the regional developed or 'benchmark floodplain maps' over six selected flood-prone basins (test basins) in Canada through a set of performance statistics. The NARR and ERA-Interim simulated flood maps are found to capture the high and very-high inundation spots fittingly over entire Canada than the remaining reanalysis datasets. While examining inundation dynamics over the six test regions, the NARR simulated floodplain maps are found to capture the majority of inundated areas by exhibiting the highest Hit-Rates between 0.78 and 0.88, and Critical Success Indexes between 0.7 and 0.82. ERA-Interim followed NARR in most of the cases, while CFSR and MERRA did not perform well on several occasions. On the basis of superior performance of NARR, a few historic flood events over the test basins are simulated and subsequently compared with MODIS satellite-derived floodplain information. We notice that more than 75% of the inundation is precisely captured for these events, leaving behind a few spots either due to the presence of a complex terrain and river geometry or due to impacts from other flood drivers such as snow-melt and tide inflow, which are not considered in the present analysis. This study strongly supports the need for careful selection of a reanalysis dataset while performing inundation modeling for large regions. Otherwise, an arbitrary choice may result in larger uncertainties in damage costs, population exposure, and flood risk values during the process. We hope that this study will provide additional insights into floodplain management practices and assist flood modelers and practitioners in a quest for selection of appropriate reanalysis data inputs for floodplain mapping.

TI  - Sex Differences in Opioid Use Disorder Prevalence and Multimorbidity Nationally in the Veterans Health Administration
T2  - JOURNAL OF DUAL DIAGNOSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a significant problem among US veterans with increasing rates of OUD and overdose, and thus has substantial importance for service delivery within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Among individuals with OUD, several sex- specific differences have begun to emerge regarding co-occurring medical, psychiatric and pain-related diagnoses. The rates of such multimorbidities are likely to vary between men and women with OUD and may have important implications for treatment within the VHA but have not yet been studied. Methods: The present study utilized a data set that included all veterans receiving VHA health care during Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 (October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2012), who were diagnosed during the year with opioid dependence or abuse. VHA patients diagnosed with OUD nationwide in FY 2012 were compared by sex on proportions with OUD, and among those with OUD, on sociodemographic characteristics, medical, psychiatric and pain-related diagnoses, as well as on service use, and psychotropic and opioid agonist prescription fills. Results: During FY 2012, 48,408 veterans were diagnosed with OUD, 5.77% of whom were women. Among those veterans with OUD, few sociodemographic differences were observed between sexes. Female veterans had a higher rate of psychiatric diagnoses, notably mood, anxiety and personality disorders, as well as higher rates of pain-related diagnoses, such as headaches and fibromyalgia, while male veterans were more likely to have concurrent, severe medical co-morbidities, including hepatic disease, HIV, cancers, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes and related complications, and renal disease. There were few differences in health service utilization, with women reporting greater receipt of prescriptions for anxiolytic/sedative/hypnotics, stimulants and lithium. Men and women did not differ in receipt of opioid agonist medications or mental health/substance use treatments. Conclusions: There are substantial sex-specific differences in patterns of multimorbidity among veterans with OUD, spanning medical, psychiatric and pain-related diagnoses. These results illustrate the need to view OUD as a multimorbid condition and design interventions to target such multimorbidities. The present study highlights the potential benefits of sex-specific treatment and prevention efforts among female veterans with OUD and related co-occurring disorders.

TI  - Projecting Land use change with neural network and GIS in northern Melbourne for 2014-2050
T2  - AUSTRALIAN GEOGRAPHER
M3  - Article
AB  - Melbourne is one of the most livable cities in the world and it is expected to become a global city of opportunities by 2050. These features along with some of the challenges Melbourne will face with in the future, necessitate land use change simulations. Therefore, land use changes in north Melbourne with an area of 2,425.42 km(2) during 2014-2019 and its future changes until 2030 and 2050 have been simulated. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks were used along with Markov chain model in ArcGIS and TerrSet software. Results showed that while proportions of residential and industrial-commercial land uses increased from 35.90% (870.70 km(2)) in 2014 to 38.53% (934.50 km(2)) in 2019, that of forest and agricultural-grassland decreased from 62.86% (1,524.01 km(2)) in 2014 to 57.76% (1,400.99 km(2)) in 2019. Similarly, the simulation results show that residential and industrial-commercial land use will increase to 42.86% (1,037.139 km(2)) and 44.53% (1,079.99 km(2)) by 2030 and 2050, respectively. In the same period, forest and grassland-agricultural land uses are respectively expected to decline from 53.53% (1298.53 km(2)) to 51.76% (1255.49 km(2)). Spatial changes will occur mostly in the north and northwest of the Melbourne.

T2  - PIGMENT CELL & MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The risk factors affecting acral melanoma metastasis and prognosis remain unclear. The study included 168 patients with invasive acral melanoma who were followed for >= 3 years. We evaluated patient demographics, stages, clinicopathological features, anatomic site of melanoma including nail versus volar surface, and degree of melanoma pigmentations, sentinel lymph node biopsy results, and the first metastasis sites. Of the 168 patients (mean age 64.5 years; 52.4% male), 43 (25.6%) had invasive melanoma without metastasis, 113 (67.3%) had invasive melanoma with a first lymph node metastasis, and 12 (7.1%) had invasive melanoma with invasive melanoma with a first distant metastasis. Advanced T stage, high mitotic rate, ulceration, and the degree of pigmentation were significant risk factors for metastasis. Amelanotic and mild pigmentation of acral melanoma was associated with first distant metastasis, whereas heavy pigmentation was associated with first lymph node metastasis. Advanced TNM stages, high mitotic rate, volar location (hazard ratio = 2.24, 95% confidence interval 1.18-4.26), and low-pigmentation (hazard ratio = 2.02, 95% confidence interval 1.17-3.49) were associated with melanoma-specific mortality.

TI  - Spatiotemporal change in urban landscape and its effect on behavior of diurnal temperature range: a case study of Pune District, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization plays a crucial role in the urban landscape dynamics, contributing to numerous ecosystems and urban climate changes. Diurnal variation of land surface temperature (LST) is a significant index for estimating local climate change as a response to urbanization. This research analyzes the impact of urbanization on the LST-based diurnal temperature range (DTR) for Pune, India, in three steps: (a) detection of spatiotemporal variation in DTR, (b) assessment of DTR behavior in different land use and land cover (LULC) classes, and (C) examining the interrelationship between urban density and DTR. The study utilizes a time series LST estimates from the MODIS satellite for 12 years (2003-2014). The preliminary spatiotemporal assessment shows a decrease in annual averaged DTR across Pune, from 25.79 degrees C in 2003 to 21.82 degrees C in 2014. Further investigation in LULC classes revealed a similar downward non-monotonic DTR trend in all classes except for the Built-up class, exhibiting a significant monotonous downtrend with a decrease of 5.67 degrees C, and the DTR anomalies are also consistent with this trend. The Mann-Kendall test confirms a significant trend with a p-value of 0.029, and Sen's slope analysis with - 0.167 establishes a decreasing DTR trend with a negative slope. The evaluation of urban density in Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) for DTR variation shows a rise in area under DTR (below 17 degrees C) in the Dense Built-up class from 0.1 to 7.52% across 2003-2014. Whereas DTR (above 25 degrees C) in Less Dense Built-up saw a sharp decrease in the area from 16.37 to 0.05% during the same period. Thus the DTR trend in varying urban densities signifies the role of intense urbanization on DTR behavior. These findings are alarming and provide insight into the local climate issues that should help policymakers and urban planners to make informed decisions toward sustainable development in the Pune Metropolitan Region.

M3  - Article
AB  - Among the greatest challenges of the arid and semiarid regions is the need for more crop production to meet the increasing demand of the growing population. This study aimed to compare SFI classes with both yield values and vegetation index values derived from satellite images. A total of 281 soil samples were taken at a 1-km resolution in order to quantify the spatial dynamics of soil physical, chemical and fertility indicators. Of the study area, 40.0% had very high fertile and high fertile soils, while 26.7% of the area had moderately fertile soils. Only about one-third of the total area had low and very low fertility. These results were validated using a 3-year yield values belong to parcels, and vegetation index derived from Sentinel 2A images. A strong relationship of SFI with yield (r2 = 0.88) and RE-OSAVI (r2 = 0.83) was found. Therefore, we suggested that SFI can be used to determine the sufficiency potential of soils for plant growing and management according to sustainable principles in similar ecologies provided that similar sample size should used.

TI  - Comparing deep learning with several typical methods in prediction of assessing chlorophyll-a by remote sensing: a case study in Taihu Lake, China
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is an important index in water quality assessment by remote sensing technology. For the study of Chl-a value measurement in rivers or lakes, there were many classical methods, such as curve fitting, back propagation (BP) neural network and radial basis function (RBF) neural network, and all of them had some corresponding applications. With the rise of computer power and deep learning, this study intended to analyze the measurement of water quality and Chl-a in deep learning (DL) and to compare with several classical methods, so as to explore and develop better methods. Taking Taihu Lake of China as the case, this study adopted the measured data of Chl-a in Taihu Lake in 2017 and the data corresponding to the same time of Landsat8. In this study, the four methods were used to inverse the distribution of Chl-a value in Taihu Lake. From the results of inversion, power curve fitting model with the n-ary sumation Residual(2) of fitting of 90.469 and inverse curve fitting model with the one of 602156.608 had the better results than other curve fitting models, however, were not as accurate as the machine learning method from segmentation results images. The machine learning method had better accuracy than the curve fitting methods from segmentation results images. The mean squared error of testing of the three methods of machine learning (BP, RBF, DL) were respectively 1.436, 4.479, 4.356. Thus, the BP method and DL method had better results in this study.

TI  - Islamic Religiosity and Auditors' Judgements: Evidence from Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We extend the literature by providing evidence that a cultural variable, intrinsic Islamic religiosity is important in understanding auditors' judgement in the Islamic context of Pakistan. The intrinsic Islamic religiosity theoretical construct examined is Islamic Worldview (IW) which represents deeply held enduring and stable values which are likely to be dominant in influencing professionals' judgements. Moreover, theoretical underpinning and empirical evidence in social psychology and organisational behaviour have established the critical role of intrinsic religiosity in influencing behaviour. Our first objective is to examine whether IW impacts auditors' judgements in the context of their acceptance of uncorroborated low-reliability client-provided evidence. Understanding the potential impact of cultural factors on auditors' acceptance of client-provided information is an essential factor in improving audit quality. Our findings support the hypothesis that auditors with high (low) IW scores are more (less) likely to accept uncorroborated low-reliability client-provided evidence. Our second objective is to examine the relationship between IW and auditors' preference for exercising more or less judgements. Examining this topic is important because auditing is a judgement-based process: auditors' judgements determine audit quality and, by extension, the quality of associated financial reports. Our findings provide overall support for the hypothesis that auditors with high (low) IW scores have a preference for exercising more (less) judgement. Our findings have implications for global and national standard setters, regulators, practitioners, and researchers. The results are also relevant to global audit firms and their affiliates, particularly networks operating in Islamic countries, in ensuring global consistency of audits.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The global outbreak of Novel Corona Virus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) has made worldwide lockdown including India since March 24, 2020. The current research aims at the improvements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) during the COVID-19 lockdown in India. This research has been done using both the open source data sets taken from satellite and ground based for better analysis. For the satellite-based analysis, the Sentinel 5 Precauser's Tropospheric NO2 from the European Space Agency and for the ground-based numeric data sets from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has been used. During the COVID-19 disease, outbreak the world has set in quarantine and as an overcome air quality improved in Asian countries after national lockdown, the average NO2 rates plummeted calculated by 40-50%. Similarly, it dramatically decreased in Asia during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine period. The basic statistical patterns of the NO2 concentration spectrum of historical data sets (2018-2020) bi-weekly showed during October to March were seen higher in each year. Related with National Ambient Air Quality Standards of mean of NO2 in India our result shown in the NO2 levels fall in 21 mu g/m(3) during the national lockdown, from the Central Pollution Control Board's air quality standards it almost decreased 50% of the hourly mean in India. This caused by the sudden restriction to the development of manufacturing and the transportations which ultimately minimized the fossil fuel burning which cause the most of the NO2 releases to the atmosphere. Nowadays, people are aware about comparatively prosperous future with clear blue skies and uses of renewable energy sources from the nature.

TI  - Source parameters of the 8 February 2016, Mw=4.2 Los Humeros earthquake by the inversion of InSAR-based ground deformation
T2  - GEOTHERMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate ground movements induced by the 8 February 2016, Mw=4.2 earthquake at the Los Humeros Geothermal Field (Mexico) using Sentinel-1 radar interferometry. Previous estimated focal mechanism solution based on seismic data with a hypocentral depth of 1900 m could not resolve the measured coseismic surface deformation pattern. In this study, we applied inverse elastic dislocation models to estimate the source parameters of the seismic event. Our models suggest the reverse reactivation of the Los Humeros normal fault at a shallower depth (<1000 m), with a more significant left lateral component below similar to 400 m depth. The occurrence of such shallow events at Los Humeros pose increased risks for the neighboring communities and infrastructure. Therefore, continuous monitoring of seismicity and cautious planning of field operations are crucial.A NNW-SSE striking fault swarm, including the Los Humeros fault, acts as a major boundary of the subsiding area observed by InSAR time-series between February 2016 and May 2019. A potential explanation of the reverse reactivation of the Los Humeros fault and following downward movement of the eastern fault block is the depressurization of the whole hydrothermal system. Such depressurization can occur due to the exploitation of the geothermal field and/or due to natural pressure/temperature changes related to magmatic activity.

TI  - Survival Outcomes of Hemoperfusion and Hemodialysis versus Hemodialysis in Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - BLOOD PURIFICATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The maintenance treatment of ESRD puts a great burden on individual patients, society, and the country of China as a whole. Hemoperfusion plus hemodialysis (HP + HD) in ESRD patients can yield modified outcomes such as prolonged life expectancy and improved dialysis quality and quality of life. This study aimed to systematically analyze the effect of HP + HD on the overall survival (OS) rates of ESRD patients and to provide support for clinical decision-making. Methods: A computerized search was performed in the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, WanFang Data and SinoMed databases for relevant original research articles. Studies were included or excluded based on their compliance with predefined selection criteria. Results: Twelve studies were included in the qualitative synthesis and quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis). The meta-analysis showed that the 1-year OS rate (odds ratio [OR]: 3.35, 95% CI: 1.89, 5.91, p < 0.05), 2-year OS rate (OR: 2.88, 95% CI: 1.84, 4.53, p < 0.05), and 5-year OS rate (chi(2) = 4.3092, p < 0.05) of patients with ESRD treated with HP + HD were better than those treated with HD, but there was no significant difference in 3-year OS rate (OR: 1.97, 95% CI: 0.76, 5.06, p > 0.05). Subgroup analysis showed the same outcomes in different study designs (1-year OS rate: randomized controlled trials [RCTs]: OR: 4.38, 95% CI: 1.61, 11.88, p < 0.05; cohort studies: OR: 2.90, 95% CI: 1.44, 5.85, p < 0.05; 2-year OS rate: RCTs: OR: 2.99, 95% CI: 1.84, 4.84, p < 0.05) and different age-groups (1-year OS rate: 45-50 years: OR: 3.19, 95% CI: 1.55, 6.57, p < 0.05; 55-60 years: OR: 3.37, 95% CI: 1.07, 10.61, p < 0.05; 2-year OS rate: 50-55 years: OR: 2.86, 95% CI: 1.59, 5.16, p < 0.05: 60-65 years: OR: 4.41, 95% CI: 1.19, 16.30, p < 0.05). Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that the OS rates of ESRD patients treated with HP + HD were better than those of patients treated with HD. A speculative hypothesis for why this is the case may be that HP + HD can achieve the complementary elimination of metabolites, effectively preventing and treating complications caused by long-term dialysis and prolonging life expectancy. Therefore, HP + HD should be widely used in ESRD patients.

TI  - Joint Supervised Classification and Reconstruction of Irregularly Sampled Satellite Image Times Series
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent satellite missions have led to a huge amount of Earth observation data, most of them being freely available. In such a context, satellite image time series have been used to study land use and land cover information. However, optical time series, such as Sentinel-2 or Landsat ones, are provided with an irregular time sampling for different spatial locations, and images may contain clouds and shadows. Thus, preprocessing techniques are usually required to properly classify such data. The proposed approach is able to deal with irregular temporal sampling and missing data directly in the classification process. It is based on Gaussian processes and allows to perform jointly the classification of the pixel labels as well as the reconstruction of the pixel time series. The method complexity scales linearly with the number of pixels, making it amenable in large-scale scenarios. Experimental classification and reconstruction results show that the method does not compete yet with state-of-the-art classifiers but yields reconstructions that are robust with respect to the presence of undetected clouds or shadows and does not require any temporal preprocessing.

TI  - Projecting the urbanization effect on soil organic carbon stocks in polar and steppe areas of European Russia by remote sensing
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the effect of urbanization on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks by projecting the main urban land cover classes over the initial pre-urban soil maps. Two cities different in climate and soil conditions as well as in availability of SOC data were chosen as the case studies. Rostov-on-Don is the center of Russian South, where croplands and natural steppes have been conventionally thoroughly studied by soil scientists. In contrast, soils of Murmansk located in Russian Arctics have always been overlooked due to low suitability for agriculture. Global, national and regional soil maps and databases were used to estimate pre-urban SOC stocks in the areas. The outcomes based on Harmonized World Soil Database were highly uncertain, underestimating 0-100 cm SOC stocks in the polar region and overestimating them in the steppe region, whereas the results based on Digital Soil Map of Russia and regional maps were comparable. Land cover structures of Rostov-on-Don and Murmansk were mapped based on the stepwise per-pixel and sub-pixel classification algorithms applied to Sentinel-2 and included the following classes: sealed soils, green lawns, trees and shrubs, bare soils and water. Murmansk was dominated by trees and shrubs (58.1%) with the proportion of area 17.5% covered by sealed soils. In Rostov-on-Don, less than 30% of the total area was covered by trees and shrubs which is also comparable with bare soils (19.6%)_and lawns (23.4%), whereas almost one third of the territory was sealed (27.6%). These land cover structures had a different impact on the topsoil SOC stocks: a 30-50% increase in Murmansk compared to the 18% decrease in Rostov-on-Don. An increase of the 0-100 cm SOC stocks was shown for both regions, however in the polar conditions it was two times higher compared to the steppe. In polar conditions, conversion of natural soils into urban non-sealed soils increased SOC stocks from 30% to more than 4 times in 0-10 cm layer and from 47% to almost 3 times in the 0-100 cm layer. The highest increase was reported for the lawns, whereas SOC under trees and shrublands were considerably lower. In Rostov-on-Don, sealed and bare soils stored less SOC compared to the initial natural soils. The conversion of natural areas into urban green infrastructure increased SOC up to 50-70%. Although the absolute SOC values based on the global and national legacy data are highly uncertain, especially for the polar areas, the research outcomes clearly reveal possible patterns in SOC changes induced by different urbanization pathways in contrast climatic conditions and highlight the complexity of the urbanization effect on soils

TI  - Agent-based modelling of post-disaster recovery with remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Disaster risk management, and post-disaster recovery (PDR) in particular, become increasingly important to assure resilient development. Yet, PDR is the most poorly understood phase of the disaster management cycle and can take years or even decades. The physical aspects of the recovery are relatively easy to monitor and evaluate using, e.g. geospatial remote sensing data compared to functional assessments that include social and economic processes. Therefore, there is a need to explore the impacts of different dimensions of the recovery, including individual behaviour and their interactions with socio-economic institutions. In this study, we develop an agent-based model to simulate and explore the PDR process in urban areas of Tacloban, the Philippines devastated by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. Formal and informal (slum) sector households are differentiated in the model to explore their resilience and different recovery patterns. Machine learning-derived land use maps are extracted from remote sensing images for pre- and post-disaster and are used to provide information on physical recovery. We use the empirical model to evaluate two realistic policy scenarios: the construction of relocation sites after a disaster and the investments in improving employment options. We find that the speed of the recovery of the slum dwellers is higher than formal sector households due to the quick reconstruction of slums and the availability of low-income jobs in the first months after the disaster. Finally, the results reveal that the households' commuting distance to their workplaces is one of the critical factors in households' decision to relocate after a disaster.

TI  - Lack of prognostic impact of sentinel node micro-metastases in endocrine receptor-positive early breast cancer: results from a large multicenter cohort
T2  - ESMO OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Prognostic impact of lymph node micro-metastases (pN1mi) has been discordantly reported in the literature. The need to clarify this point for decision-making regarding adjuvant therapy, particularly for patients with endocrine receptor (ER)-positive status and HER2-negative tumors, is further reinforced by the generalization of gene expression signatures using pN status in their recommendation algorithm.Patients and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 13 773 patients treated for ER-positive breast cancer in 13 French cancer centers from 1999 to 2014. Five categories of axillary lymph node (LN) status were defined: negative IN (pN0i-), isolated tumor cells [pN0i(+)], pN1mi, and pN1 divided into single (pN1 = 1) and multiple (pN1 > 1) macro-metastases (>2 mm). The effect of IN micro-metastases on outcomes was investigated both in the entire cohort of patients and in clinically relevant subgroups according to tumor subtypes. Propensity-score-based matching was used to balance differences in known prognostic variables associated with pN status.Results: As determined by sentinel LN biopsy, 9427 patients were pN0 (68.4%), 546 pN0(i+) (4.0%), 1446 pN1mi (10.5%) and 2354 pN1 with macro-metastases (17.1%). With a median follow-up of 61.25 months, pN1 status, but not pN1mi, significantly impacted overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), and breast-cancer-specific survival. In the subgroup of patients with known tumor subtype, pN1 > 1, as pN1 > 1, but not pN1mi, had a significant prognostic impact on OS. DFS and MFS were only impacted by pN1 > 1. Similar results were observed in the subgroup of patients with luminal A-like tumors (n = 7101). In the matched population analysis, pN1macro, but not pN1mi, had a statistically significant negative impact on MFS and OS.Conclusion: LN micro-metastases have no detectable prognostic impact and should not be considered as a determining factor in indicating adjuvant chemotherapy. The evaluation of the risk of recurrence using second-generation signatures should be calculated considering micro-metastases as pNO.

TI  - Mucosal ribosomal stress-induced PRDM1 promotes chemoresistance via stemness regulation
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The majorities of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases are sporadic in origin and a large proportion of etiologies are associated with environmental stress responses. In response to external and internal stress, the ribosome stands sentinel and stress-driven ribosomal dysfunction triggers the cellular decision pathways via transcriptional reprogramming. In the present study, PR domain zinc finger protein (PRDM) 1, a master transcriptional regulator, was found to be closely associated with ribosomal actions in patients with CRC and the murine models. Stress-driven ribosomal dysfunction enhanced PRDM1 levels in intestinal cancer cells, which contributed to their survival and enhanced cancer cell stemness against cancer treatment. Mechanistically, PRDM1 facilitated clustering modulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor-associated genes, which supported cancer cell growth and stemness-linked features. Ribosomal dysfunction-responsive PRDM1 facilitated signaling remodeling for the survival of tumor progenitors, providing compelling evidence for the progression of sporadic CRC.Kim and Moon find that the transcription factor PRDM1 is induced by ribosomal dysfunction in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and associated with chemoresistance through a pathway involving IGF signaling. The authors further suggest PRDM1 promotes cancer cell stemness and survival, altogether providing insights into environmental stress-mediated signaling in CRC.

TI  - Sentinel node tumor burden in cutaneous melanoma. Survival with competing risk analysis and influence in relapses and non-sentinel node status: retrospective cohort study with long follow-up in a Spanish population
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DERMATOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Several authors have studied the potential of sentinel lymph node (SLN) tumor burden as prognostic factor but the microscopic classifications used in different study groups were variable. We examined the prognostic role of tumor burden in SLN on melanoma specific-survival and competing causes of death. We also analysed clinical and histological factors as predictors of disease relapses and additional non sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastases. We included all patients with cutaneous melanoma that underwent SLN biopsy between 2002 and 2012 at Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra (Spain). The study end-points were death due to melanoma, melanoma relapse and involvement of NSLN. We used Fine-Gray test for competing risk analysis. A logistic regression model was performed to predict the risk of involvement of NSLN. Between 2002 and 2012, there were 348 patients who underwent SLN biopsy in our centre (308 were eligible for the study). 26.9% patients positive SLN. 88 patients died during the follow-up period and 66 (75%) died from melanoma. The 5-year cumulative incidence of melanoma death was 15.33% (95 % CI 15.25-15.42). The cumulative probability of death from melanoma was associated with gender, histological subtype, Breslow thickness, mitotic rate, ulceration and SLN tumor burden. In multivariable analysis, Breslow thickness and SLN tumor burden remained as independent prognostic factors. SLN tumor burden appears to be an important prognostic factor. It is very important reporting these characteristics in pathological reports. More prospective studies would be necessary to analyze these variables and to be able to make recommendations in management of melanoma patients.

TI  - A simple and easy method to quantify the cool island intensity of urban greenspace
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately and easily quantifying the greenspace cool island intensity (GCII) is important to understand the cooling effect of urban greenspace for better urban greenspace planning and management. This study proposed two new methods (i.e., equal area method and equal radius method) to estimate GCII and compared them with two old methods (i.e., turning point method and fixed radius method) in terms of the GCII magnitudes, spatial variations, relationships with greenspace size, and the estimation of optimal greenspace size in cooling the environment (i.e., threshold value of efficiency (TVoE)). We performed the analysis based on Landsat derived land surface temperature (LST) in seven Chinese cities with varied climate background and geographic variations. The results showed that: (1) Different methods significantly impacted the estimated GCIIs with higher values by the turning point method and lower values by the equal area method. (2) GCIIs by different methods were positively and significantly correlated with each other and characterized similar spatial heterogeneities. (3) GCIIs by all methods showed significantly positive logarithmic relationships with greenspace area with higher R2 observed by the equal area method. (4) The four methods estimated close TVoEs with no significant difference among them. We recommend the equal radius method to quantify GCII for its equal effectiveness but easier calculation compared to other methods.

TI  - Assessing and improving cloud-height-based parameterisations of global lightning flash rate, and their impact on lightning-produced NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> and tropospheric composition in a chemistry-climate model
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although lightning-generated oxides of nitrogen (LNOx) account for only approximately 10 % of the global NOx source, they have a disproportionately large impact on tropospheric photochemistry due to the conducive conditions in the tropical upper troposphere where lightning is mostly discharged. In most global composition models, lightning flash rates used to calculate LNOx are expressed in terms of convective cloud-top height via the Price and Rind (1992) (PR92) parameterisations for land and ocean, where the oceanic parameterisation is known to greatly underestimate flash rates. We conduct a critical assessment of flash-rate parameterisations that are based on cloud-top height and validate them within the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator - United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosol (ACCESS-UKCA) global chemistry-climate model using the Lightning Imaging Sensor and Optical Transient Detector (LIS/OTD) satellite data. While the PR92 parameterisation for land yields satisfactory predictions, the oceanic parameterisation, as expected, underestimates the observed flash-rate density severely, yielding a global average over the ocean of 0.33 flashes s(-1) compared to the observed 9.16 flashes s(-1) and leading to LNOx being underestimated proportionally. We formulate new flash-rate parameterisations following Boccippio's (2002) scaling relationships between thunderstorm electrical generator power and storm geometry coupled with available data. The new parameterisation for land performs very similarly to the corresponding PR92 one, as would be expected, whereas the new oceanic parameterisation simulates the flash-rate observations much more accurately, giving a global average over the ocean of 8.84 flashes s(-1). The use of the improved flash-rate parameterisations in ACCESS-UKCA changes the modelled tropospheric composition - global LNOx increases from 4.8 to 6.6 Tg N yr(-1); the ozone (O-3) burden increases by 8.5 %; there is an increase in the mid- to upper-tropospheric NOx by as much as 40 pptv, a 13 % increase in the global hydroxyl radical (OH), a decrease in the methane lifetime by 6.7 %, and a decrease in the lower-tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) by 3 %-7 %. Compared to observations, the modelled tropospheric NOx and ozone in the Southern Hemisphere and over the ocean are improved by this new flash-rate parameterisation.

TI  - Sun-induced fluorescence and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation track the seasonal dynamics of gross primary production over Africa
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon cycle of tropical terrestrial vegetation plays a vital role in the storage and exchange of atmospheric CO2. But large uncertainties surround the impacts of land-use change emissions, climate warming, the frequency of droughts, and CO2 fertilization. This culminates in poorly quantified carbon stocks and carbon fluxes even for the major ecosystems of Africa (savannas and tropical evergreen forests). Contributors to this uncertainty are the sparsity of (micro-)meteorological observations across Africa's vast land area, a lack of sufficient ground-based observation networks and validation data for CO2, and incomplete representation of important processes in numerical models. In this study, we therefore turn to two remotely sensed vegetation products that have been shown to correlate highly with gross primary production (GPP): sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv). The former is available from an updated product that we recently published (Sun-Induced Fluorescence of Terrestrial Ecosystems Retrieval - SIFTER v2), which specifically improves retrievals in tropical environments.A comparison against flux tower observations of daytime-partitioned net ecosystem exchange from six major biomes in Africa shows that SIF and NIRv reproduce the seasonal patterns of GPP well, resulting in correlation coefficients of > 0.9 (N = 12 months, four sites) over savannas in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These coefficients are slightly higher than for the widely used Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (MPI-BGC) GPP products and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). Similarly to SIF signals in the neighboring Amazon, peak productivity occurs in the wet season coinciding with peak soil moisture and is followed by an initial decline during the early dry season, which reverses when light availability peaks. This suggests similar leaf dynamics are at play. Spatially, SIF and NIRv show a strong linear relation (R > 0.9; N >= 250 pixels) with multi-year MPI-BGC GPP even within single biomes. Both MPI-BGC GPP and the EVI show saturation relative to peak NIRv and SIF signals during high-productivity months, which suggests that GPP in the most productive regions of Africa might be larger than suggested.

TI  - The Englishisation of personal names in Nigeria What Englishisation of Efik and Ibibio personal names suggests about English in Nigeria
T2  - ENGLISH TODAY
M3  - Article
AB  - Naming is a linguistic universal. Every known human society distinguishes and individuates its members by their names. In the context of Africa and beyond, names are not just ordinary labels for the identification of their bearers; they mirror the culture, tradition and worldview of the people. Essien (1986: 5) argues that 'naming is not an arbitrary affair, it is at once a mental, an emotional, a linguistic and a cultural matter'. It is widely believed that names and naming can influence the personality development and behaviour of their bearers. This claim justifies Camden's (1984: 43) admonition that 'names should be chosen with good and gracious significations to inspire the bearer to good action'. This implies that people are assumed to live according to the message contained in their names. Significantly, names also embed deep cultural insights that reflect their bearers' social lives, philosophy, religion, emotions and worldview. African names, for instance, are important cultural and symbolic resources that reflect the peculiarities of the African people, and capture their beliefs, values, identity and personality.

TI  - Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in bivalve mollusks and marine sediments
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater pose the question of whether this new pandemic virus could be released into watercourses and potentially continue to finally reach coastalwaters. In this study, we employed two bivalve molluscan species from the genus Ruditapes as sentinel organisms to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 signals in the marine coastal environment. Estuarine sediments from the natural clam banks were also analyzed. Viral RNA was detected by RT-qPCR, targeting IP4, E and N1 genomic regions. Positive samples were also subjected to a PMAxx-triton viability RT-qPCR assay in order to discriminate between intact and altered capsids, obtaining indirect information about the viability of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 RNA traces were detected in 9/12 clam samples by RT-qPCR, from which 4 were positive for two different target regions. Viral quantification ranged from <LoQ to 4.48 Log genomic copies/g of digestive tissue. Regarding the sediment samples, 3/12 were positive by RT-qPCR, but only IP4 region was successfully amplificated. Quantification values for sediment samples ranged from <LoQ to 3.60 Log genomic copies/g of sediment. RNA signals disappeared in the PMAxx-triton viability RT-qPCR assay, indicating non-infectious potential. In addition, the recently discovered human-specific gut associated bacteriophage crAssphage was also quantified as a biomarker for the presence of human-derived wastewater contamination on the study area. CrAssphage was detected in 100% of both types of samples with quantification values ranging from <LoQ to 5.94 Log gc/g digestive tissue and from <LoQ to 4.71 Log gc/g sediment. Statistical analysis also showed that quantification levels for the crAssphage in clams are significantly higher than in sediments. These findings represent the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the marine environment, demonstrating that it can reach these habitats and make contact with the marine life. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Evaluation of VIIRS and MODIS Snow Cover Fraction in High-Mountain Asia Using Landsat 8 OLI
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the first application of the Snow Covered Area and Grain size model (SCAG) to the Visible Infrared imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and assess these retrievals with finer-resolution fractional snow cover maps from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). Because Landsat 8 OLI avoids saturation issues common to Landsat 1-7 in the visible wavelengths, we re-assess the accuracy of the SCAG fractional snow cover maps from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) that were previously evaluated using data from earlier Landsat sensors. Use of the fractional snow cover maps from Landsat 8 OLI shows a negative bias of -0.5% for MODSCAG and -1.3% for VIIRSCAG, whereas previous MODSCAG evaluations found a bias of -7.6% in the Himalaya. We find similar root mean squared error (RMSE) values of 0.133 and 0.125 for MODIS and VIIRS, respectively. The Recall statistic (probability of detection) for cells with more than 15% snow cover in this challenging steep topography was found to be 0.90 for both MODSCAG and VIIRSCAG, significantly higher than previous evaluations based on Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). In addition, daily retrievals from MODIS and VIIRS are consistent across gradients of elevation, slope, and aspect. Different native resolutions of the gridded products at 1 km and 500 m for VIIRS and MODIS, respectively, result in snow cover maps showing a slightly different distribution of values with VIIRS having more mixed pixels and MODIS having 7% more pure snow pixels. Despite the resolution differences, the snow maps from both sensors produce similar total snow-covered areas and snow-line elevations in this region, with R2 values of 0.98 and 0.88, respectively. We find that the SCAG algorithm performs consistently across various spatial resolutions and that fractional snow cover maps from the VIIRS instruments aboard Suomi NPP, JPPS-1, and JPPS-2 can be a suitable replacement as MODIS sensors reach their ends of life.

TI  - Mapping surface-water area using time series landsat imagery on Google Earth Engine: a case study of Telangana, India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The extent of surface-water spread influences the hydrogeology and ecology of waterbodies. Remote sensing technology provides spatial and temporal datasets which aid in mapping the dynamics of surface waterbodies at the regional and global scale. In the present study, temporal changes in the surface area of waterbodies in Telangana, India, were monitored using indices like normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index and modified NDWI and machine learning algorithms like a random forest using Landsat-8 data. Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform was used for processing earth observation data, based on the time series images of Landsat and compared with real-time groundwater levels. The results showed a significant increase (P < 0.01) in both surface-water area and groundwater levels in Telangana, especially after 2015, which we hypothesize could be due to the specialized water conservation project being implemented by the Government of Telangana since 2015.

TI  - Genre Experiments: Thylias Moss's <i>Slave Moth</i> and the Poetic Neo-Slave Narrative
T2  - MELUS
M3  - Article
AB  - As histories of experimentation on the enslaved receive scholarly attention, so too are neo-slave narratives representing and commenting on this aspect of enslavement, in both their content and their form. This article examines Thylias Moss's genre-troubling Slave Moth: A Narrative in Verse (2004), a neo-slave text that depicts an enslaved woman named Varl treated as an object of psychological experimentation. Varl develops a strong subjectivity through becoming a subject performing experiments: aesthetic experiments in how she chooses to represent her narrative in stitched cloths. The subtly experimental poetic devices through which Moss crafts this representation highlight that this protagonist possesses an alternate, generative epistemology that differs meaningfully from her master's scientific worldview and thereby enables fugitive, temporary agency and freedom. By analyzing Slave Moth, I argue that the ethically problematic epistemology that generated experiments on the enslaved has certainly not dissipated and that it indirectly undergirds lyric theory's failure to engage form in texts by nonwhite poets. Through contrasting close attention to formal devices by which Moss undermines teleological narrative, this essay postulates that "lyric time" enables fleeting, yet nevertheless generative, subversions of the formal expectations readers impose on texts representing enslavement. Reading Slave Moth through such a lens suggests potential middle-ground formal alternatives to wholly rejecting either narrative or lyric as genres and to thereby asymptotically approaching adequate representation of enslavement.

TI  - Seasonal and interannual variations of sea surface temperature and influencing factors in the Yangtze River Estuary
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores seasonal and interannual variability in sea surface temperature (SST) in the Yangtze River Estuary, China based on remote sensing data from 1982 to 2017. The influences of climate and river flow on SST were explored using power spectrum and correlation analyses. The results show that SST had a warming trend of 0.48 degrees C per decade over the study period and exhibited significant oscillation periods of 10, 3.6, 2.4, and 1 years Seasonal SSTs showed warming trends, which were strongest in spring and weakest in autumn. Spatially, SSTs distinctly increased from the northwest to the southeast of the study area. This study represents that the runoff, air temperature, El Nino, and East Asian monsoon contribute to SST in the Yangtze River estuary. Monthly means indicate that higher runoff rates are associated with higher SSTs in the waters adjacent to the Yangtze River Estuary, and vice versa. River runoff, air temperature, and El Nino and East Asian monsoon events all influenced SST in the Yangtze River Estuary. After studying the correlation between long-term temperature and SST, it is found that temperature has forcing effect on SST, and overall trend is increasing. Heat transfer via ocean-atmosphere interactions has caused the SST in the Yangtze River Estuary to warm for many years. In addition, El Nino and monsoon intensities also affect SST; in El Nino years, the SST of the Yangtze River Estuary decreased but then increased abnormally in the following year. The meridional wind speed during the East Asian monsoon was negatively correlated with SST, while zonal wind speed was positively correlated, with meridional wind having the greater effect. This knowledge will allow more accurate predictions of local oceanography, with profound implications for fisheries, industry, and climate modeling. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Real-time population data are vital for urban planning and resource management for sustainable development. To complement satellite-based population estimation methods, geospatial social media data provide additional opportunities to estimate the distribution of population with high levels of efficacy and accuracy. Thus, this study attempts to assess the performance of various sensing data to disaggregate population data in China; the tested data include Tencent location-based service (LBS) data (about 0.8 billion users), satellite-derived land use/cover data, and nightlight imagery data. With the use of census data for validation, the experimental results show that Tencent LBS data are much better than satellite-derived land use/cover data and nightlight satellite data for mapping the population distribution. The overall mapping accuracy at the city level using Tencent LBS data was 88.9%, whereas the accuracy using land use/cover data was 87.1% and that using nightlight satellite data was 85.5%. The experimental results also indicate that LBS data and remote sensing data could both be well integrated to map the population distribution in China. Thus, a population spatialization model was further developed using all of the tested indicators; this model allowed the overall population estimation accuracy at the city level to reach 90.4%. This model could help determine the population distribution on various spatial scales quickly and efficiently, and the developed tool and the provided population estimates may be vital for the sustainable development of cities and regions for which population data are lacking.

TI  - Predicting sentinel node positivity in patients with melanoma: external validation of a risk-prediction calculator (the Melanoma Institute Australia nomogram) using a large European population-based patient cohort
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background A nomogram to predict sentinel node (SN) positivity [the Melanoma Institute Australia (MIA) nomogram] was recently developed and externally validated using two large single-institution databases. However, there remains a need to further validate the nomogram's performance using population-based data.Objectives To perform further validation of the nomogram using a European national patient cohort.Methods Patients with cutaneous melanoma who underwent SN biopsy in the Netherlands between 2000 and 2014 were included. Their data were obtained from the Dutch Pathology Registry. The predictive performance of the nomogram was assessed by discrimination (C-statistic) and calibration. Negative predictive values (NPVs) were calculated at various predicted probability cutoffs.Results Of the 3049 patients who met the eligibility criteria, 23% (691) were SN positive. Validation of the MIA nomogram (including the parameters Breslow thickness, ulceration, age, melanoma subtype and lymphovascular invasion) showed a good C-statistic of 0.69 (95% confidence interval 0.66-0.71) with excellent calibration (R-2 = 0.985, P = 0.40). The NPV of 90.1%, found at a 10% predicted probability cutoff for having a positive SN biopsy, implied that by using the nomogram, a 16.3% reduction in the rate of performing an SN biopsy could be achieved with an error rate of 1.6%. Validation of the MIA nomogram considering mitotic rate as present or absent showed a C-statistic of 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.68-0. 74).Conclusions This population-based validation study in European patients with melanoma confirmed the value of the MIA nomogram in predicting SN positivity. Its use will spare low-risk patients the inconvenience, cost and potential risks of SN biopsy while ensuring that high-risk patients are still identified.

TI  - In defense of the wrongly convicted-Ernst Borschmann's <i>Chinesische Architektur</i> and the controversial synchrony of the Chinese architecture survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN ARCHITECTURE AND BUILDING ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Writing the architecture survey remains one of the biggest challenges in the field. Nineteenth- and twentieth-century Western scholars usually followed a synchronic approach (literally "with-time") and described Chinese architecture without reference to its development and evolution over time. Although synchrony (attention to a particular moment in time) is not incorrect in principle, it is all too often attached with a negative connotation. A possible reason is that Liang Sicheng, and the generations after him, have understood all facets of synchrony as expression of the old dichotic worldview that once glorified Europe and deprived Asia of its history (non-historical timelessness) as formulated by the German philosophers Hegel and Herder and codified in Fletcher's and Fergusson's authoritative textbooks. Challenging the previous misconception of the generalization of synchronic textbooks, the paper attempts to examine the multiple facets of synchrony and identify the writing style of Borschmann's Chinesische Architektur, the prime example of the German-language survey on Chinese Architecture. In doing so, the paper hopefully can provide basis and arguments in defense of the work, presenting a reconciliation to the biased, subjective presentation of Chinese architecture once afflicted with prejudices and misapprehensions. The paper values Borschmann's Chinesische Architektur as a distinguished work different from other synchronic writings through its pioneering, value-neutral and formal approach.

TI  - Random forest regression results in accurate assessment of potato nitrogen status based on multispectral data from different platforms and the critical concentration approach
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing can be used for precision nutrient management to assess plant nitrogen (N) status in a spatially detailed and real-time manner. Despite recent advances in satellite- and drone technology and machine learning, neither differences between platforms nor methodological aspects for estimating plant N status have been sufficiently investigated. In this study, multispectral data obtained by ground (handheld Rapidscan), air- (unmanned aerial vehicle, UAV) and spaceborne (Sentinel-2) platforms were exploited to estimate plant N uptake (PNU), concentration (PNC) and N nutrition index (NNI). The test plant was potato grown for three years on a sandy soil in Denmark and the analysis was based on the critical N dilution curve. Parametric (PR) and nonparametric (random forest, RFR) regressions were conducted and compared in predicting mid-season PNU, PNC and NNI from band reflectances or vegetation indices (VIs) derived from each platform data. The results obtained by the UAV data had the highest accuracy, largely due to the fine spatial resolution. For both regression types, PNU and NNI correlated better than PNC to reflectance data. For the UAV data, validation Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) of PNU and NNI ranged between 0.64-0.95 and 0.41-0.92 respectively, with corresponding values for relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 7.1-22% and 5.86-22%. The lower end of NSE and higher end RRMSE intervals systematically being from the PR, which demonstrates the robustness and the high accuracy of RFR in predicting plant N status. The other platforms resulted in acceptable results, with validation NSE and RRMSE for PNU and NNI of, respectively, 0.60-0.79 and 14-20%, 0.25-0.79 and 10-17% for Rapidscan, and 0.48-0.83 and 17-28%, 0.42-0.82 and 12-19% for Sentinel-2. The band reflectance and the VIs were equally suited as input predictors for the RFR algorithm. The N requirement calculated from all three datasets reflected the field observations well. The study reveals the potential of different regression methods for detailed spatial estimation of plant N status to guide in-season fertilization by matching the plant growth demands, emphasizing the strengths of the RFR. The procedure is helpful for the digital agriculture and the smart farming industry aiming to avoid excess application of N.

AB  - Prayagraj City is one the biggest cities in the State of Uttar Pradesh which has been selected as Smart City by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, Government of India, in 2015. This city has rapidly evolved in the last three decades due to the urbanization process. This study has used multispectral imageries of Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor of four different time points at the interval of similar to 10 years, i.e., 1988, 1997, 2008, and 2018. These images have been preprocessed and then classified through supervised classification using Maximum Likelihood Classifier in ERDAS IMAGINE version 2014. The overall accuracy achieved is more than 88% in all the four time points. The periodical change results have revealed that all land use/land cover (LU/LC) classes has altered in all periods, i.e., 1988-1997, 1997-2008, 2008-2018, and 1988-2018 with remarkable trends, patterns, and magnitudes. The growth of Built-up land is a major concern. The results of the change matrix (1988-2018) have indicated that the most expanded class was built-up land which has evolved into 64.52% at the cost of Agriculture land by 24.41%, Forest land by 10.56%, and Barren land by 6.01%. The above results of LU/LC dynamics can help in making planning and policy development for restoring and enhancing the carrying capacity of land and sustainability of the environment in a city landscape.

TI  - Do catastrophic floods change the gender division of labor? Panel data evidence from Pakistan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines how large-scale environmental shocks alter the gender division of labor in traditional rural societies. Using individual-level time allocation data from the Pakistan Rural Household Panel Survey 2012, 2013, and 2014, I compare hours spent per week across productive and reproductive activities of more than 8000 adult men and women after the 2011, 2012, and 2013 floods in 76 villages from three provinces of Pakistan. Individual-level panel data is combined with village-level flood inundation depth data collected using remotely sensed (MODIS) satellite imagery. The panel fixed-effects regression results reveal a significant shift in the gender division of labor for both paid and unpaid work in the flood-affected villages. For a 1-m flood inundation depth, men's and women's weekly time use as hired labor increased by -2 and -1 h, respectively, women's weekly time allocation on child and elderly care decreased by -1.5 h, and men's weekly labor allocation for reproductive work and fuel collection increased by -2 h. Overall, a 1-m inundation depth increased the weekly time allocation for all activities for men by -6 h and women by -2 h. Women's time allocation changes were most pronounced for landless and marginal agricultural landowners (<0.5 ha), when compared with medium and large landowners. The favorable shift in the gender division of reproductive work was positively associated with women's decision-making power. Men who believed that both men and women should equally participate in income generation activities were more likely to increase their reproductive work time.

TI  - MOSEV: a global burn severity database from MODIS (2000-2020)
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - To make advances in the fire discipline, as well as in the study of CO2 emissions, it is of great interest to develop a global database with estimators of the degree of biomass consumed by fire, which is defined as burn severity. In this work we present the first global burn severity database (MOSEV database), which is based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance and burned area (BA) products from November 2000 to near real time. To build the database we combined Terra MOD09A1 and Aqua MYD09A1 surface reflectance products to obtain dense time series of the normalized burn ratio (NBR) spectral index, and we used the MCD64A1 product to identify BA and the date of burning. Then, we calculated for each burned pixel the difference of the NBR (dNBR) and its relativized version (RdNBR), as well as the post-burn NBR, which are the most commonly used burn severity spectral indices. The database also includes the pre-burn NBR used for calculations, the date of the pre- and post-burn NBR, and the date of burning. Moreover, in this work we have compared the burn severity metrics included in MOSEV (dNBR, RdNBR and post-burn NBR) with the same ones obtained from Landsat-8 scenes which have an original resolution of 30 m. We calculated the Pearson's correlation coefficients and the significance of the relationships using 13 pairs of Landsat scenes randomly distributed across the globe, with a total BA of 6904 km(2) (n = 32163). Results showed that MOSEV and Landsat-8 burn severity indices are highly correlated, particularly the post-burn NBR (R = 0 :88; P<0 :001), and dNBR (R = 0 :74; P<0 :001) showed stronger relationships than RdNBR (R = 0 :42; P<0 :001). Differences between MOSEV and Landsat-8 indices are attributable to variability in reflectance values and to the different temporal resolution of both satellites (MODIS: 1-2 d; Landsat: 16 d). The database is structured according to the MODIS tiling system and is freely downloadable at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4265209 (Alonso-Gonzalez and Fernandez-Garcia, 2020).

TI  - Cold-season atmospheric conditions associated with sudden changes in PM<sub>10</sub> concentration over Seoul, Korea
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have intensively studied the atmospheric conditions associated with high- and low-PM10 (particulate matter < 10 mu m) episodes according to air quality standards. However, the association with sudden changes in PM10 concentration has not been clearly understood. Here we defined a PM10 change of above one standard deviation as a sudden change and divided these changes into PM10-increasing days (294 days) and PM10-decreasing days (277 days). We then investigated the atmospheric conditions concerning sudden changes in PM10 in Seoul, Korea during 17 cold seasons (October to March) from 2001/2002 to 2017/2018. This study used the local and synoptic atmospheric variables obtained from ECMWF ERA-Interim and ERA5, and aerosol optical depth from MODIS/Terra. On PM10-increasing days, a high-pressure anomaly was dominant in the Korean Peninsula's upper and lower atmosphere. A southerly wind, intense atmospheric stagnation, and high aerosol optical depth over the eastern region of China may also have been responsible for the increase in PM10 regardless of the preceding concentration of PM10. On PM10-decreasing days, the prevailing atmospheric pattern was subject to the preceding concentration of PM10. From the moderate (40-80 mu g m(-3)) to the lower concentrations, a robust and low-pressure anomaly favorable for dispersion of PM10 was dominant over the Korean Peninsula. In contrast, from the high (>80 mu g m(-3)) to the moderate concentrations, there was no distinct pattern except for a high-pressure anomaly in the upper atmosphere. These results improve our understanding of the mechanisms behind the sudden changes in PM10 due to atmospheric conditions over East Asia.

TI  - Comparison of survival outcomes for axillary surgery extent based on intraoperative sentinel lymph node biopsy result after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To investigate the survival difference between limited axillary surgery and full axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with 1-3 positive sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNBs) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Method We retrospectively analyzed data from 676 patients who underwent surgery between 2007 and 2017 with cT1-4, cN0-3, cM0 breast cancer at the time of diagnosis and 1-3 positive SLNBs after NAC. The patients received either SLNB only or completed level I or II ALND based on SLNB results. After propensity score matching, 483 patients who had undergone SLNB only (n = 188) and ALND (n = 295) were included. We examined overall survival, axillary recurrence-free survival, regional recurrence-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival and compared them between the subgroups. Result At a median follow-up of 59.4 months, no significant statistical difference was observed in overall survival, axillary recurrence-free survival, regional recurrence-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival between SLNB only and ALND. No significant differences were observed in the 5-year axillary recurrence-free survival (93.1% vs. 94.0%, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.43-2.05, p = 0.876) and 5-year overall survival (97.7% vs. 97.3%, HR = 1.65, 95% CI = 0.58-4.65, p = 0.347) between the two groups. Conclusion Our analysis suggests that SLNB alone may be a possible option for patients with 1-3 sentinel node-positive breast cancer following NAC without significant compromise of recurrence or overall survival.

TI  - Marine plastic litter detection offshore Hawai'i by Sentinel-2
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine litter patches were detected from Sentinel-2 offshore Hawaii's Big Island (Hawaii) within 10 miles from the coast in the prevalent windward direction (NE), for a total sea surface of 3.0 km2. The patches have a filament-like shape with different orientation, lengths of several kilometers and width from tens to hundreds of meters. A comparison with the typical spectra of "sargassum" and "seaweed" patches emphasized differences in the red edge portion of the spectrum for large part of the filaments. Frequency of plastic pollution on Hawaiian beaches and spectral characteristics of the filaments suggest these patches largely consist of plastic debris. A detection method of plastic litter for Sentinel-2 data resampled at 20 m resolution based on the analysis of the red edge bands is proposed.

TI  - Improving spatial resolution of PM<sub>2.5</sub> measurements during wildfires
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes an approach to improve the spatial resolution of ground-level concentrations of PM2.5 that is required to assess health risks associated with exposure to pollutants released during wildfires. We use this approach to analyze the impact on air quality of the wildfire complex consisting of the Atlas, Nuns, Tubbs, Pocket, and Redwood Valley fires in northern California that started on October 8, 2017 and the Camp Fire in northern California that was first reported on November 8, 2018. The PM2.5 concentrations measured in populated areas downwind of these fires were well above the 24-h standard of 35 mu g/m3 during several days of both fires. To estimate health risks at locations where ground-based monitors did not provide sufficient spatial coverage we first estimate the emissions from the fires by fitting concentration estimates from two models, a Lagrangian model and a segmented plume dispersion model, to corresponding concentrations from ground monitors. We also use a power law model to fit the measured PM2.5 concentrations to the ratio of aerosol optical depth (AOD) to planetary boundary layer measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) carried by NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites. Dispersion model estimates are then combined with estimates from the AOD model to compute ground-level concentrations at a resolution of 1 km. Kriged residuals between estimates from the combined model and measured PM2.5 concentrations are then added to obtain high resolution maps that can be used for exposure studies.

TI  - Mapping large-scale and fine-grained urban functional zones from VHR images using a multi-scale semantic segmentation network and object based approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban functional zones (UFZs) are essential for characterizing both urban spatial configurations and socioeconomic properties and monitoring urbanization process, thus UFZs are fundamental to urban planning, management and renewal. Although many efforts in remote sensing field have been made to map UFZs, largescale and fine-grained UFZ maps required by a broad range of urban applications are still unavailable. Existing methods generally rely on pre-determined mapping units, such as image tiles and road blocks, which significantly limit the mapping quality and the automation degree of mapping UFZs. Given that UFZs are composed of diverse geographic objects, this study proposes a novel object-based UFZ mapping method using very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images. First, a multi-scale semantic segmentation network that achieves pixel-wised predictions is proposed to predict urban-functions for geographic objects by capturing multi-scale contextual information. Afterwards, a conditional random field (CRF) framework is designed to regroup objects into UFZs to produce the final UFZ map, wherein road vectors are incorporated to restrict the procedure. The presented object-as-analysis-unit scheme conquers the drawbacks of mapping-unit pre-determination and the semantic segmentation model provides accurate function information for objects, thus they can be applied for producing large-scale and fine-grained UFZ maps. In the experiment, the proposed method is evaluated by producing UFZ maps for Beijing and Shanghai, China, and competitive results with overall accuracy of 91.6% and 89.1% are achieved, respectively. Finally, the generated UFZ maps are utilized to analyze the urbanfunction structures of the two cities. The proposed method can be regarded as a significant development that appears to be promising and practical for mapping UFZ maps for real-world urban applications.

TI  - Predicting the ground-level pollutants concentrations and identifying the influencing factors using machine learning, wavelet transformation, and remote sensing techniques
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the support vector regression (SVR) model with and without applying wavelet transformation for predicting the PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 in Isfahan metropolis, central Iran. Ground-based data, TerraClimate, and MODIS products were used to predict air pollution parameters. These factors were first trained using the SVR and Wavelet-SVR models, and their performance was then compared using the error evaluation statistics. Uncertainties were evaluated using local errors and the clustering method. The influencing factors were lastly determined using the permutation features importance method. The results indicated that the Wavelet-SVR model resulted in improving the performance of prediction compared to the SVR model. The mean prediction interval values were also decreased after applying the wavelet transformation on the SVR model. It was found that the dominant agents affecting the temporal changes of study pollutants are soil moisture and meteorological drought. Urban development and increased energy consumption were observed in the areas with the highest air pollution. Researchers and stakeholders can use these findings to assess air pollution hazards and to improve air quality and human living conditions in metropolises.

TI  - Worldview psychology and the representation of spirituality, naturalism, and agnosticism: conceptualisation and psychometric measurement
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The study of spirituality, naturalism, and agnosticism has been hindered by assumptions about their organisation, where naturalism has been treated as a lack of spirituality, and agnosticism as a construct "in-between" spirituality and naturalism. The psychology of worldviews encourages conceptualisations of these belief systems as distinct constructs. The aim of this study was to develop conceptual definition and psychometric measurement for spirituality, naturalism, and agnosticism. Method: The current project used exploratory factor analysis (N = 412) to develop a measure for spirituality, naturalism, and agnosticism. Confirmatory factor analyses were then used in two further samples (N = 1056; 873) to refine and validate the measure. Results: The final inventory measured spirituality (and mysticism), naturalism, and agnosticism with 35-items across 8-factors. The measure showed good model fit and evidence of construct validity. Conclusions: Findings provide insight into the structural relationships between mysticism, spirituality, naturalism, and agnosticism. This study also provides a new tool for investigating these worldview constructs comprehensively. Rather than considered as mutually exclusive categories or linear positions on a unidimensional spectrum, they can be treated as distinct individual difference variables with both overlapping and diverse impacts. What is already known about this topic: (1) Worldviews are systems of belief about fundamental aspects of reality. (2) Spirituality, naturalism, and agnosticism are three distinct worldviews. (3) Naturalism and agnosticism have been overlooked in psychological research due to assumptions about their structure. What this topic adds: (1) Conceptual differentiation of spirituality, naturalism, and agnosticism as distinct worldviews in psychology. (2) Psychometric scale development to measure spirituality, naturalism, and agnosticism.

T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current land-use trends in Kenya's montane forest ecosystems show that land uses are changing fast due to natural and anthropogenic factors and these changes could have devastating effects on the environment. One such montane forest is the transboundary Mt. Elgon forest located in western Kenya. This study analysed trends in land use-land cover changes in Mt. Elgon forest ecosystem over the last 45 years. Landsat imageries downloaded from the United States Geological Survey archives were used to assess land use-land cover changes between 1973 and 2019 by applying supervised classification using Arc GIS 10.5. The IDRISI Selva 17.0 was used to calculate area under different land uses and generate change maps. The major Land Use-Land Cover (LULC) classified were mixed farming, natural forests, planted forests, bamboo forest, fallow land, tea plantation. The landsat images had an average overall classification accuracy of 87.12% and kappa coefficient (K) of 0.84. The kappa coefficient was rated as substantial and the classified images qualified for further analysis. Results established that there was an 18% decline in the natural forest cover between 1977 and 2019. There was a similar decline of 15.19% in bamboo forest cover. Plantation forests established in the 1990's also showed a 15.6% decline between 1999 and 2019. There was, however, a 29% increase in mixed farming, a 10% increase in fallow land and a 0.13% increase in tea plantations. These changes in land uses and land cover call for an urgent need to develop sustainable management plans to protect and conserve the Mt. Elgon forest ecosystem. Sustainable land management strategies to be used in the future may include education on the significance of the forest ecosystem, community participation in sustainable utilisation of forest eco-services and the introduction of sustainable alternative sources of livelihoods, such as bee farming.

TI  - Assessment and Error Analysis of Terra-MODIS and MISR Cloud-Top Heights Through Comparison With ISS-CATS Lidar
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud-top heights (CTH) from the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra constitute our longest-running single-platform CTH record from a stable orbit. Here, we provide the first evaluation of the Terra Level 2 CTH record against collocated International Space Station Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS) lidar observations between 50oN and 50oS. Bias and precision of Terra CTH relative to CATS is shown to be strongly tied to cloud horizontal and vertical heterogeneity and altitude. For single-layered, unbroken, optically thick clouds observed over all altitudes, the uncertainties in MODIS and MISR CTH are -540 +/- 690 m and -280 +/- 370 m, respectively. The uncertainties are generally smaller for lower altitude clouds and larger for optically thin clouds. For multi-layered clouds, errors are summarized herein using both absolute CTH and CATS-layer-altitude proximity to Terra CTH. We show that MISR detects the lower cloud in a two-layered system, provided top-layer optical depth <similar to 0.3, but MISR low-cloud CTH errors are unaltered by the presence of thin cirrus. Systematic and random errors are propagated to explain inter-sensor disagreements, as well as to provide the first estimate of the MISR stereo-opacity bias. For MISR, altitude-dependent wind-retrieval bias (-90 to -110 m) and stereo-opacity bias (-60 to -260 m) and for MODIS, CO2-slicing bias due to geometrically thick cirrus leads to overall negative CTH bias. MISR's precision is largely driven by precision in retrieved wind-speed (3.7 m s(-1)), whereas MODIS precision is driven by forward-modeling uncertainty.

TI  - Using mixed integer programming and airborne laser scanning to generate forest management units
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne laser scanning (ALS) has been widely applied to estimate tree and forest attributes, but it can also drive the segmentation of forest areas. Clustering algorithms are the dominant technique in segmentation but spatial optimization using exact methods remains untested. This study presents a novel approach to segmentation based on mixed integer programming to create forest management units (FMUs). This investigation focuses on using raster information derived from ALS surveys. Two mainstream clustering algorithms were compared to the new MIP formula that simultaneously accounts for area and adjacency restrictions, FMUs size and homogeneity in terms of vegetation height. The optimal problem solution was found when using less than 150 cells, showing the problem formulation is solvable. The results for MIP were better than for the clustering algorithms; FMUs were more compact based on the intra-variation of canopy height and the variability in size was lower. The MIP model allows the user to strictly control the size of FMUs, which is not possible in heuristic optimization and in the clustering algorithms tested. The definition of forest management units based on remote sensing data is an important operation and our study pioneers the use of MIP ALS-based optimal segmentation.

T2  - MOLECULAR GENETICS & GENOMIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Serological methods may not be reliable for RBC antigen typing, especially in multi-transfused patients. The blood group systems provoking the most severe transfusion reactions are mainly Rh, Kell, Kidd, and Duffy. We intended to determine the genotype of these blood group system antigens among Iranian alloimmunized thalassemia patients using molecular methods and compare the results with serological phenotyping.Methods Two hundred patients participated in this study. Blood group phenotype and genotype were determined using the serological method and PCR-SSP, respectively. The genotypes of patients with incompatibility between phenotype and genotype were re-evaluated by RFLP-PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing.Results Discrepancies between phenotype and genotype results were found in 132 alleles and 83 (41.5%) patients; however, there was complete accordance between the three genotyping methods. Most discrepancies were detected in Rh and Duffy systems with 47 and 45 cases, respectively, and the main discrepancy was in the FY*B/FY*B allele when serologically showed Fy(a+b+). All 39 undetermined phenotypes, due to mixed-field reactions, were resolved by molecular genotyping.Conclusion Molecular genotyping is more reliable compared with the serological method, especially in multi-transfused patients. Therefore, the addition of blood group genotyping to serological assays can lead to an antigen-matched transfusion in these patients.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion is associated with earlier diagnosis and improved care among lower socioeconomic status populations with cancer, but its impact on melanoma is undefined.Objective: To determine the association of Medicaid expansion with stage of diagnosis and use of sentinel lymph node biopsy in nonelderly adult patients with newly diagnosed clinically localized melanoma.Methods: Quasi-experimental, difference-in-differences retrospective cohort analysis using data from the National Cancer Database from 2010 to 2017. Patients from expansion versus nonexpansion states and diagnosed before (2010-2013) versus after (2014-2017) expansion were identified.Results: Of 83,322 patients, 46.6% were female, and the median age was 55 years (interquartile range, 4960). After risk adjustment, Medicaid expansion was associated with a decrease in the diagnosis of T1b stage or higher melanoma (odds ratio [OR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-0.98; P = .011) and decrease in uninsured status (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.52-0.72; P < .001) but was not associated with a difference in sentinel lymph node biopsy performance when indicated (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.95-1.20; P = .29).Limitations: Retrospective study using a national database.Conclusion: In this study of patients with clinically localized melanoma, Medicaid expansion was associated with a decrease in the diagnosis of later T-stage tumors.

TI  - Modeling urban evapotranspiration using remote sensing, flux footprints, and artificial intelligence
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As climate change progresses, urban areas are increasingly affected by water scarcity and the urban heat island effect. Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial component of urban greening initiatives of cities worldwide aimed at mitigating these issues. However, ET estimation methods in urban areas have so far been limited. An expanding number of flux towers in urban environments provide the opportunity to directly measure ET by the eddy covariance method. In this study, we present a novel approach to model urban ET by combining flux footprint modeling, remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) data, and deep learning and machine learning techniques. This approach facilitates spatio-temporal extrapolation of ET at a half-hourly resolution; we tested this approach with a two-year dataset from two flux towers in Berlin, Germany. The benefit of integrating remote sensing and GIS data into models was investigated by testing four predictor scenarios. Two algorithms (1D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and random forest (RF)) were compared. The best-performing models were then used to model ET values for the year 2019. The inclusion of GIS data extracted using flux footprints enhanced the predictive accuracy of models, particularly when meteorological data was more limited. The bestperforming scenario (meteorological and GIS data) showed an RMSE of 0.0239 mm/h and R2 of 0.840 with RF and an RMSE of 0.0250 mm/h and a R2 of 0.824 with 1D CNN for the more vegetated site. The 2019 ET sum was substantially higher at the site surrounded by more urban greenery (366 mm) than at the inner-city site (223 mm), demonstrating the substantial influence of vegetation on the urban water cycle. The proposed method is highly promising for modeling ET in a heterogeneous urban environment and can support climate change mitigation initiatives of urban areas worldwide.(c) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Spatio-temporal linking of multiple SAR satellite data from medium and high resolution Radarsat-2 images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A recent development in Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology is integrating multiple SAR satellite data to dynamically extract ground features. This paper addresses two relevant challenges: identification of common ground targets from different SAR datasets in space, and concatenation of time series when dealing with temporal dynamics. To address the first challenge, we describe the geolocation uncertainty of InSAR measurements as a three-dimensional error ellipsoid. The points, among InSAR measurements, which have error ellipsoids with a positive cross volume are identified as tie-point pairs representing common ground objects from multiple SAR datasets. The cross volumes are calculated using Monte Carlo methods and serve as weights to achieve the equivalent deformation time series. To address the second challenge, the deformation time series model for each tie-point pair is estimated using probabilistic methods, where potential deformation models are efficiently tested and evaluated. As an application, we integrated two Radarsat-2 datasets in Standard and Extra-Fine modes to map the subsidence of the west of the Netherlands between 2010 and 2017. We identified 18128 tie-point pairs, 5 intersection types of error ellipsoids, 5 deformation models, and constructed their long-term deformation time series. The detected maximum mean subsidence velocity in Line-Of-Sight direction is up to 15 mm yr(-1). We conclude that our method removes limitations that exist in single-viewing-geometry SAR when integrating multiple SAR data. In particular, the proposed time-series modeling method is useful to achieve a long-term deformation time series of multiple datasets.

TI  - Detection of cancer metastasis: past, present and future
T2  - CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The clinical importance of metastatic spread of cancer has been recognized for centuries, and melanoma has loomed large in historical descriptions of metastases, as well as the numerous mechanistic theories espoused. The "fatal black tumor" described by Hippocrates in 5000 BC that was later termed "melanose" by Rene Laennec in 1804 was recognized to have the propensity to metastasize by William Norris in 1820. And while the prognosis of melanoma was uniformly acknowledged to be dire, Samuel Cooper described surgical removal as having the potential to improve prognosis. Subsequent to this, in 1898 Herbert Snow was the first to recognize the potential clinical benefit of removing clinically normal lymph nodes at the time of initial cancer surgery. In describing "anticipatory gland excision," he noted that "it is essential to remove, whenever possible, those lymph glands which first receive the infective protoplasm, and bar its entrance into the blood, before they have undergone increase in bulk". This revolutionary concept marked the beginning of a debate that rages today: are regional lymph nodes the first stop for metastases ("incubator" hypothesis) or does their involvement serve as an indicator of aggressive disease with inherent metastatic potential ("marker" hypothesis). Is there a better way to improve prediction of disease outcome? This article attempts to address some of the resultant questions that were the subject of the session "Novel Frontiers in the Diagnosis of Cancer" at the 8th International Congress on Cancer Metastases, held in San Francisco, CA in October 2019. Some of these questions addressed include the significance of sentinel node metastasis in melanoma, and the optimal method for their pathologic analysis. The finding of circulating tumor cells in the blood may potentially supplant surgical techniques for detection of metastatic disease, and we are beginning to perfect techniques for their detection, understand how to apply the findings clinically, and develop clinical followup treatment algorithms based on these results. Finally, we will discuss the revolutionary field of machine learning and its applications in cancer diagnosis. Computer-based learning algorithms have the potential to improve efficiency and diagnostic accuracy of pathology, and can be used to develop novel predictors of prognosis, but significant challenges remain. This review will thus encompass latest concepts in the detection of cancer metastasis via the lymphatic system, the circulatory system, and the role of computers in enhancing our knowledge in this field.

TI  - How does the political enter the newsroom? The representation of the Kurdish 'Other' in Turkish journalism
T2  - JOURNALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, I examine how journalists working for the Turkish national mainstream televisual media represent Kurds - a significant national 'Other' of Turkish society - in the process of news production. My research is based on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews conducted between 2011 and 2014 in the newsrooms of two Turkish television channels with different political outlooks and experiences. The study reveals an unprecedented interest of mainstream television media in the inclusionary representation of Kurds during the research period due to a temporary change to the traditional Turkish state policy toward Kurds. In this new political context, I argue that the journalistic practice and discourse on Kurds is likely to be determined by political differences among Turkish journalists. The Turkish journalists working for these two different channels, for example, seek to justify and advance conflicting political agendas since they have contradicting political worldviews and political experiences. Based on these findings, this article demonstrates how the three factors of political worldview, political experience, and political context combine to shape journalistic values - the values which orient various stages of news production, at which journalists imagine, categorize, and articulate the Kurds and decide how to represent them in news outputs.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Degradation of land in any form (natural or anthropogenic) poses a threat to economic, social and sustainable development on global, national and local level. The study carried out in West Haryana extracts the area transformed to agro-forestry from the degraded area. A merge of different datasets LISS IV and Cartosat 2 for 2016-17 on a scale of 1:10,000 was used for the agro-forestry patches (Horticulture, Farm forests, miscellaneous and shrub land) to be identified. LISS III data on a scale of 1:50,000 were used for demarcation of degraded lands for the year 2005-2006 and 2015-2016. The conversion of degraded categories of land over a decade into various agro-forestry practices has been identified and mapped. The Hisar District is found to have maximum degraded area converted to agro-forestry while a total of 7236.9 hectares area is converted to agro-practices in West Haryana. With a total conversion of 7236.9 sq. km. of degradation to agro-practices, the maximum transformation has been brought about in category of partially stabilized dunes where a total of 5167.05 sq. km. of area is converted to assorted categories of agro-forestry. A district-wise variation was observed in the emergent categories on degraded lands. Bhiwani showed maximum conversion to miscellaneous plantations while horticulture surfaced Fatehabad and Sirsa districts. The study also aims to suggest floral species suitable to be planted in the degraded land based on their capability to survive the hostile conditions of soil .

TI  - Improving the estimation of canopy cover from UAV-LiDAR data using a pit-free CHM-based method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and rapid estimation of canopy cover (CC) is crucial for many ecological and environmental models and for forest management. Unmanned aerial vehicle-light detecting and ranging (UAV-LiDAR) systems represent a promising tool for CC estimation due to their high mobility, low cost, and high point density. However, the CC values from UAV-LiDAR point clouds may be underestimated due to the presence of large quantities of within-crown gaps. To alleviate the negative effects of within-crown gaps, we proposed a pit-free CHM-based method for estimating CC, in which a cloth simulation method was used to fill the within-crown gaps. To evaluate the effect of CC values and within-crown gap proportions on the proposed method, the performance of the proposed method was tested on 18 samples with different CC values (40-70%) and 6 samples with different within-crown gap proportions (10-60%). The results showed that the CC accuracy of the proposed method was higher than that of the method without filling within-crown gaps (R-2 = 0.99 vs 0.98; RMSE = 1.49% vs 2.2%). The proposed method was insensitive to within-crown gap proportions, although the CC accuracy decreased slightly with the increase in within-crown gap proportions.

TI  - A novel multi-source data fusion method based on Bayesian inference for accurate estimation of chlorophyll-a concentration over eutrophic lakes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel multi-source data fusion method based on Bayesian inference (BIF) was proposed in this study to blend the advantages of in-situ observations and remote sensing estimations for obtaining accurate chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration in Lake Taihu (China). Two error models (additive and multiplicative) were adopted to construct the likelihood function in BIF; the BIF method was also compared with three commonly used data fusion algorithms, including linear and nonlinear regression data fusion (LRF and NLRF) and cumulative distribution function matching data fusion (CDFF). The results showed the multiplicative error model had small normalized residual errors and was a more suitable choice. The BIF method largely outperformed the data fusion algorithms of CDFF, NLRF and LRF, with the largest correlation coefficients and smallest root mean square error. Moreover, the BIF results can capture the high Chla concentrations in the northwest and the low Chla concentrations in the east of Lake Taihu.

TI  - Assessing the capability of MODIS to monitor mixed pastures with high-intensity grazing at a fine-scale
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS time series carries valuable long-term data essential to support several studies such as biogeochemical modelling. However, there is a lack of validation studies applying MODIS data at a fine-scale to monitor pasture management practices. In this study, we assessed the potential of MODIS sensor in monitoring at a fine-scale four intensively managed mixed-pastures fields located in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The MODIS spectral response was compared with Sentinel-2, and the ability of the two sensors in predicting aboveground biomass (AGB) and canopy height (CH) was assessed using the Random Forest algorithm. EVI images from MODIS and Sentinel-2 were correlated with field measurements of AGB and CH. The prediction performance of AGB (R-2: Sentinel-2 = 38%; MODIS = 42%) and CH (R-2: Sentinel-2 = 69%; MODIS = 85%) models was superior using EVI data from MODIS than Sentinel-2, highlighting MODIS ability to monitor small and intensively managed pasture fields.

TI  - The role of residential air circulation and cooling demand for electrification planning: Implications of climate change in sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - ENERGY ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nearly 1 billion people live without electricity at home. Energy poverty limits their ability to take autonomous actions to improve air circulation and the cooling of their homes. It is therefore important that electricity access planners explicitly evaluate the current and future air circulation and cooling needs of energy-poor households, in addition to other basic energy needs. To address this issue, we combine climate, socio-economic, demographic and satellite data with scenario analysis to model spatially explicit estimates of potential cooling demand from households that currently lack access to electricity. We link these demand factors into a bottom-up electrification model for sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the world's highest concentration of energy poverty. Accounting for cooling needs on top of baseline household demand implies that the average electrification investment requirements grow robustly (a scenario mean of 65.5% more than when considering baseline household demand only), mostly due to the larger generation capacity needed. Future climate change could increase the investment requirements by an additional scenario mean of 4%. Moreover, the share of decentralised systems as the lowest-cost electrification option falls by a scenario mean 4.5 percentage points of all new connections. The crucial determinants for efficient investment pathways are the adoption and use of cooling appliances, the extent of climate change, and the baseline electricity demand. Our results call for a more explicit consideration of climate-adaptative energy needs by infrastructure planners in developing countries . (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Continual Learning With Structured Inheritance for Semantic Segmentation in Aerial Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid update and iteration of current aerial image data, the continual learning scenarios and catastrophic forgetting problem attracted increased attention, especially in the semantic segmentation task. However, the existing methods mainly focus on the class continual learning in a single task and are not satisfactory when extended to multiple tasks. In this article, we consider more realistic and complicated settings, namely task continual learning. We revisit the characteristics of semantic segmentation and knowledge distillation (KD) strategy, then propose a general and effective framework, named structured inheritance, to learn new tasks while retaining high performance on old tasks. Specifically, we present two structure-preserving penalties: pixel affinity structure loss and representation consistency structure loss. The former breaks the isolation of pixels and retains the pixel interactive information learned by the old tasks. At the same time, the latter protects high-frequency stationary information between sequence semantic segmentation tasks. Our approach does not need to add extra parameters nor does it need to access the data stream of the old tasks. Therefore, it can be applied in practical applications with strict computational burden, memory cost, and storage budget. Extensive continual learning experiments on four semantic segmentation datasets of Vaihingen, Potsdam, DeepGlobe, and Gaofen challenge semantic segmentation dataset (GCSS) prove the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods and even exceeds the theoretical upper-bound performance of multitask learning. The code and models will be made publicly available.

TI  - Integrated Pharmacological Analysis on the Mechanism of Fuyou Formula in Treating Precocious Puberty
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fu-you formula (FY), a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula composed of 12 herbs, as an in-hospital preparation, has been used treat to precocious puberty (PP) for decades. However, the lack of phytochemical characterization and mechanism of FY remains the main limitation for its spreading. In this study, we analyze the components and mechanisms of FY in PP, based on the integrated pharmacology. Investigated main constituents, targets, pathways of FY by using an integrative pharmacology, and recognized main constituents by HPLC-MS/MS. Then, observed the levels of Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estrogen (E-2) in danazol-induced PP in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Lastly, retrospective study analyzed the clinical data of 575 patients who were diagnosed PP, treated by the FY, and followed-up in our hospital from 2014-2020. The result that total of 116 important candidate targets were selected based on pharmacological analysis. Selected the top 10 values key targets such as the estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), were localized and the related gene functions were determined. Gene functions were associated with biological regulation, a cellular process, or signaling pathway, such as the Estrogen signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. By recognizing the five compounds related to the ESR1 and IGF1, which are Quercetin, kaempferol, Luteolin, Apigenin, and Emodin. The results of the molecular docking study further showed that the flavonoids had a strong binding affinity for ESR1 and IGF1 after docking into the crystal structure. The results showed that the FY could effectively reduce E-2, LH, and FSH levels in SD rats. Furthermore, the results of the retrospective analysis of medical records showed that the FY could remarkably reduce E-2 levels in girls with PP.

TI  - Current management of melanoma patients with nodal metastases
T2  - CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The management of melanoma patients with nodal metastases has undergone dramatic changes over the last decade. In the past, the standard of care for patients with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was a completion lymph node dissection (CLND), while patients with palpable macroscopic nodal disease underwent a therapeutic lymphadenectomy in cases with no evidence of systemic spread. However, studies have shown that SLN metastases present as a spectrum of disease, with certain SLN-based factors being prognostic of and correlated with outcomes. Furthermore, the results of key clinical trials demonstrate that CLND provides no survival benefit over nodal observation in positive SLN patients, while other clinical trials have shown that adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy or targeted therapy after CLND is associated with a recurrence-free survival benefit. Given the efficacy of these systemic therapies in the adjuvant setting, these agents are now being evaluated and utilized as neoadjuvant treatments in patients with regionally-localized or resectable metastatic melanoma. Multiple options now exist to treat melanoma patients with nodal disease, and determining the best treatment course for a particular case requires an in-depth knowledge of current data and an informed discussion with the patient. This review will provide an overview of the various options for treating melanoma patients with nodal metastases and will discuss the data that supported the development of these treatment options.

TI  - Present-day orogenic processes in the western Kalpin nappe explored by interseismic GNSS measurements and coseismic InSAR observations of the 2020 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.1 Kalpin event
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest and most active intracontinental orogenic belt on Earth, the Tien Shan (TS) is a natural laboratory for understanding the Cenozoic orogenic processes driven by the India-Asia collision. On 19 January 2020, a M-w 6.1 event stuck the Kalpin region, where the southern frontal TS interacts with the Tarim basin. To probe the local ongoing orogenic processes and potential seismic hazard in the Kalpin region, both interseismic and instantaneous deformation derived from geodetic observations are used in this study. With the constraint of interseismic global navigation satellite system (GNSS) velocities, we estimate the decollement plane parameters of the western Kalpin nappe based on a 2-D dislocation model, and the results suggest that the decollement plane is nearly subhorizontal with a dip of similar to 3 degrees at a depth of 24 km. Then, we collect both Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 satellite images to capture the coseismic displacements caused by the 2020 Kalpin event, and the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) images show a maximum displacement of 7 cm in the line of sight near the epicentral region. With these coseismic displacement measurements, we invert the source parameters of this event using a finite-fault model. We determine the optimal source mechanism in which the fault geometry is dominated by thrust faulting with an E-W strike of 275 degrees and a northward dip of 11.2 degrees, and the main rupture slip is concentrated within an area 28.0 km in length and 10.3 km in width, with a maximum slip of 0.3 m at a depth of 6-8 km. The total released moment of our preferred distributed slip model yields a geodetic moment of 1.59 x 10(18) N.m, equivalent to M-w 6.1. The contrast of the decollement plane depth from interseismic GNSS and the rupture depth from coseismic InSAR suggests that a compression still exists in the Kalpin nappe forefront, which is prone to frequent moderate events and may be at risk of a much more dangerous earthquake.

TI  - Variance of the impact of urban green space on the urban heat island effect among different urban functional zones: A case study in Wuhan
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island effect (UHI) is frequently observed in cities, and is associated with environmental effects. Urban green space (UGS) has been shown to play an important role in mitigating the UHI. However, impacts from the spatial pattern of UGS among different urban functional zones are largely ignored. This study established a spatial regression model to reveal the relationship between landscape metrics of UGS and land surface temperature (LST), in order to characterize the different effects of the spatial pattern of UGS on UHI among urban functional zones. The result shows that the proportion of UGS and shape complexity metric show a general negative impact on LST both overall and in individual urban functional zones; while none was found with aggregation, the fragmentation metric and connectivity. An area-related metric can be used to explain LST in public service zones and has a negative impact on LST. The research proves that UGS in different urban functional zones play different roles in mitigating the UHI effect. The cooling effects are related to the spatial pattern of UGS. Accordingly, it is recommended to consider the different roles of the spatial pattern of UGS in different urban functional zones in mitigating UHI for a liveable environment.

TI  - Improving orbital uncertainty realism through covariance determination
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Classical Orbit Determination algorithms provide an estimation of the state vector and its associated uncertainty assuming Gaussian processes and linear dynamics. However, a common problem of Orbit Determination processes is the misrepresentation of the Resident Space Object uncertainty through the estimated and predicted covariance. Ultimately, this causes a great impact in the quality and accuracy of Space Surveillance and Tracking products as the covariance is overly optimistic (too small) and the true uncertainty of the object is not properly captured. One of the causes for the unrealism of the covariance is found in the uncertainty of the dynamical and measurement models used to describe the motion of the objects.The aim of this work is to devise a novel methodology to improve the covariance realism of Orbit Determination and Orbit Propagation processes through the classical theory of consider parameters in batch least-squares estimators. The devised methodology uses the theory of consider parameters to add the uncertainty of dynamic and measurement models to the estimated covariance.The magnitude of the consider parameters is weighted using statistical inference techniques, proposing an innovative method to derive its contribution to the covariance. The conceived methodology is suitable for any type of measurement or object, although its primary goal is to correct unrealistic covariance of non-cooperative targets.Among the wide variety of uncertainty sources affecting covariance realism, the influence and effect of two relevant modelling uncertainties, the atmospheric drag force and the range bias, is discussed during this publication. The proposed methodology is first applied to a simulated scenario of tracking measurements, using a Monte Carlo approach. A case involving real radar observations is presented as well, where the uncertainty realism of the Sentinel-3A orbit determination and propagation is assessed and improved. Using the novel methodology of Covariance Determination, covariance realism improvement of a real tracking campaign is achieved and the uncertainty of the atmospheric drag force model quantified.

TI  - Validation of the Skane University Hospital nomogram for the preoperative prediction of a disease-free axilla in patients with breast cancer
T2  - BJS OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary staging via sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is performed for clinically node-negative (N0) breast cancer patients. The Skane University Hospital (SUS) nomogram was developed to assess the possibility of omitting SLNB for patients with a low risk of nodal metastasis. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.74. The aim was to validate the SUS nomogram using only routinely collected data from the Swedish National Quality Registry for Breast Cancer at two breast cancer centres during different time periods.Method: This retrospective study included patients with primary breast cancer who were treated at centres in Lund and Malmo during 2008-2013. Clinicopathological predictors in the SUS nomogram were age, mode of detection, tumour size, multifocality, lymphovascular invasion and surrogate molecular subtype. Multiple imputation was used for missing data. Validation performance was assessed using AUC and calibration.Results: The study included 2939 patients (1318 patients treated in Lund and 1621 treated in Malmo). Node-positive disease was detected in 1008 patients. The overall validation AUC was 0.74 (Lund cohort AUC: 0.75, Malmo cohort AUC: 0.73), and the calibration was satisfactory. Accepting a false-negative rate of 5 per cent for predicting N0, a possible SLNB reduction rate of 15 per cent was obtained in the overall cohort.Conclusion: The SUS nomogram provided acceptable power for predicting a disease-free axilla in the validation cohort. This tool may assist surgeons in identifying and counselling patients with a low risk of nodal metastasis on the omission of SLNB staging.

TI  - A new integrated geophysical-petrological global 3-D model of upper-mantle electrical conductivity validated by the Swarm M<sub>2</sub> tidal magnetic field
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A new global model of the present-day thermochemical state of the lithosphere and upper mantle based on global waveform inversion, satellite gravity and gradiometry measurements, surface elevation and heat flow data has been recently presented: WINTERC-G (Fullea et al. 2021). WINTERC-G is built within an integrated geophysical-petrological framework where the mantle seismic velocity and density fields are computed in a thermodynamically self-consistent framework, allowing for a direct parametrization in terms of the temperature, pressure and composition of the subsurface rocks. In this paper, we combine WINTERC-G thermal and compositional fields along with laboratory experiments constraining the electrical conductivity of mantle minerals, melt and water, and derive a set of new global three dimensional electrical conductivity models of the upper mantle. The new conductivity models, WINTERC-e, consist of two end-members corresponding to minimum and maximum conductivity of the in situ rock aggregate accounting for mantle melting, mineral water content and the individual conductivities of the main stable mantle mineral phases. The end-member models are validated over oceans by simulating the magnetic field induced by the ocean M-2 tidal currents and comparing the predicted fields with the M-2 tidal magnetic field estimated from 6-yr Swarm satellite observations. Our new conductivity model, derived independently from any surface or satellite magnetic data sets, is however able to predict tidal magnetic fields that are in good agreement with the Swarm M-2 tidal magnetic field models estimated by Sabaka et al. and Grayver & Olsen. Our predicted M-2 tidal magnetic fields differ in amplitudes by about 5-20 per cent from the Swarm M-2 tidal magnetic field, with the high conductivity WINTERC-e end-member model accounting for mantle melt and water content capturing the structure of Swarm data better than the low conductivity end-member model. Spherically symmetric conductivity models derived by averaging new W1NTERC-e conductivities over oceanic areas are slightly more conductive than the recent global conductivity models AA17 by Grayver et al. derived from Swarm and CHAMP satellite data in the 60-140 km depth range, while they are less conductive deeper in the mantle. The conductivities in WINTERC-e are about three to four times smaller than the AA17 conductivities at a depth of 400 km. Despite the differences in electrical conductivity, our spherically symmetric high conductivity end-member model WINTERC-e captures the structure of Swarm M-2 tidal magnetic field almost the same as a state of the art 1-D conductivity models derived entirely from magnetic data (AA17, Grayver et al.). Moreover, we show that realistic lateral electrical conductivity inhomogeneities of the oceanic upper mantle derived from the temperature, melt and water distributions in WINTERC-e contribute to the M-2 tidal magnetic field up to +/- 0.3 nT at 430 km altitude.

TI  - Observation policy for sentinel node metastasis of melanoma: Comparative study with completion lymph node dissection in Japanese patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the results of international multicenter randomized trials, completion lymph node dissection for patients with sentinel lymph node-positive melanoma is no longer routinely recommended. However, clinicians should take into consideration racial and medical resource differences when applying this evidence to clinical practice in Japan. To evaluate the clinical validity of the observation policy of omitting completion lymph node dissection, we retrospectively surveyed patients with sentinel lymph node-positive melanoma between 2002 and 2020 at Niigata Cancer Center Hospital. A total of 59 patients were categorized into the observation group (n = 19) and completion lymph node dissection group (n = 40). Newly developed anticancer agents, including targeted therapy and immunotherapy, were more commonly used in the observation group than in the completion lymph node dissection group as either adjuvant therapy (31.6% vs. 5.0%) or post-recurrence therapy (100% vs. 34.8%). The median overall survival in the observation group (not reached) was significantly longer than that in the completion lymph node dissection group (95.0 months; p = 0.02), which was mainly attributed to the difference in post-recurrence overall survival. There was no significant difference in recurrence-free survival between the two groups (p = 0.63). Although the use of new anticancer agents leads to bias, this study demonstrates that observation without prompt completion lymph node dissection provides a favorable overall survival without increasing the risk of recurrence compared with completion lymph node dissection. The observation policy for patients with sentinel lymph node-positive melanoma patients is considered to be clinically valid in real-world medical practice.

TI  - Tillage erosion as an important driver of in-field biomass patterns in an intensively used hummocky landscape
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tillage erosion causes substantial soil redistribution that can exceed water erosion especially in hummocky landscapes under highly mechanized large field agriculture. Consequently, truncated soil profiles can be found on hill shoulders and top slopes, whereas colluvial material is accumulated at footslopes, in depressions, and along downslope field borders. We tested the hypothesis that soil erosion substantially affects in-field patterns of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) of different crop types on landscape scale. The interrelation between the EVI (RAPIDEYE satellite data; 5 m spatial resolution) as a proxy for crop biomass and modeled total soil erosion (tillage and water erosion modeled using SPEROS-C) was analyzed for the Quillow catchment (size: 196 km(2)) in Northeast Germany in a wet versus normal year for four crop types (winter wheat, maize, winter rapeseed, winter barley). Our findings clearly indicate that eroded areas had the lowest EVI values, while the highest EVI values were found in depositional areas. The differences in the EVI between erosional and depositional sites are more pronounced in the analyzed normal year. The net effect of total erosion on the EVI compared to areas without pronounced erosion or deposition ranged from -10.2% for maize in the normal year to +3.7% for winter barley in the wet year. Tillage erosion has been identified as an important driver of soil degradation affecting in-field crop biomass patterns in a hummocky ground moraine landscape. While soil erosion estimates are to be made, more attention should be given toward tillage erosion.

TI  - Monitoring Spatial-Temporal Transition Dynamics of Transport Infrastructure Space in Urban Growth Phenomena: A Case Study of Lagos-Nigeria
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FUTURE TRANSPORTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Lagos is one of the fastest growing world mega-cities with a huge urban mobility crisis, the traditional aggregate city's development model could not provide reliable scientific solutions to monitor the competing demands of various land-use components and the urbanization's effects on transport infrastructure space. This study uses a disaggregated predictive spatial modeling approach to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of transportation infrastructure space to address the fragmented urban chain process. The methodology involves analysis and modeling of the land-use spatial transition changes that have occurred over the past three decades using three Landsat imagery epochs (1984, 2013, and 2019) in remote sensing ARC-GIS 10.7. Furthermore, the prediction of the two-temporal milestones (2030 and 2050) using hybrid cellular automata-Markov (CA-Markov) implemented in IDIRISI SELVA 17.0 software when the tides of social-demographic factors were expected to bring about significant urban spatial transformation. The forecast results are expected to increase the area for transport infrastructure spaces by 93 km(2) (7.3%) in 2030 and 157 km(2) (12.4%) in 2050. The model's kappa reliability coefficient estimates for the three temporal scales (k(1984) = 85%; k(2013) = 88% and k(2019) = 89%) are higher than the 80% minimum adjudged strong agreement between the ground truth and prediction classified images in literature. The model provides efficient tool in urban development planning and sustainable transport decisions.

TI  - Synergy of Sentinel-2A and Near-proximal sensor data for deriving biochemical parameters of paddy at different growth stages
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The biochemical parameters (i.e. chlorophyll and nitrogen content) of crops are essential to evaluate the health status and to monitor crop growth. The incorporation of near-proximal sensor data with satellite data has offered a new angle for rapid, detailed, and reliable assessment of crop biochemical parameters. This study aimed to utilize the higher spatial and spectral resolution of Sentinel-2A multi-spectral instrument (MSI) satellite data in conjunction with near-proximal sensor data to derive the chlorophyll (Chl) content and nitrogen balance index (NBI) of paddy at different growth stages during the monsoon season (2017) in Ranchi district, Jharkhand. The key findings revealed that the satellite-derived Chl content and NBI of paddy were overestimated as compared to the field-based measurements. The correlations between satellite-derived and empirical model-based Chl content and NBI of paddy revealed a R-2 of 0.92-0.99 (p < 0.001) at different growth stages. The Chl content was found higher (20-40 mu g/cm(2)) during the peak growing stage of paddy and subsequently, it decreased (< 20 mu g/cm(2)) by the start of the ripening stage. The root-mean-square error between the empirical model and satellite-based Chl content was from 7.7 to 8.5 mu g/cm2. Thereby, it can be concluded that the MSI sensor with three red-edge bands along with visible and near-infrared has a virtuous capability to quantify the crop biochemical parameters. However, it needs a bias correction to derive Chl content/NBI accurately. The adopted methods of retrieving biochemical parameters at different growth stages would be beneficial for decision-makers in agriculture monitoring and can be incorporated in crop growth modelling and yield predictions.

AB  - The explosive growth of the Melbourne metropolitan area (MMA) population in the last two decades and the spatial expansion of the city to the periphery have necessitated the analysis of land use land cover (LULC) changes. To this end, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks, Markov chain model, GIS and TerrSet software package were used. Initially, nine driving variables affecting the future development of the city were identified. Then, using the maximum probability estimation model, land uses were classified into six categories in the MMA with an area of 8819.6 km(2) for 2014, 2017 and 2020. During 2014-2020, two land uses have experienced positive changes (residential and cultivated land uses with 16.48% and 11.56% respectively) and four of them (forest cover with -5.74%, grass and green space with -9.72%, barren lands with -11.14% and water body with -1.45%) have experienced a decrease in area. To validate the prediction of land use changes until 2030, the kappa coefficient (0.617) was used. The result of using Cramer's V statistics (above 0.15) to measure the effect of driving variables on land use forecast was acceptable. LULC change was predicted by MLP and Markov chain model for 2030. The results showed that two land uses (residential and industrial land use with 26.3% and cultivated land with 6.99%) will have positive change and four of them (forest coverage with -17.11%, barren land with -9 29%, grass and green space with -5.33% and water bodies with -1.38%) should have negative growth. Spatial changes of land use will occur mostly in the northern and north-western regions on barren land, and on the east and southeast on forest and green spaces. Findings are useful for planning authorities in MMA where it is highly affected by population growth and LULC change.

TI  - Impact of crop residue burning in Haryana on the air quality of Delhi, India
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop residue burning (CRB) over northern India is a major air quality and human health issue. The present study assesses the impact of PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and SO2, emitted during CRB activities in Haryana on the air quality of Delhi. The transition from pre-burning to burning period, in both rabi and kharif seasons, shows considerable increase in pollutant concentrations. PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations exceeded NAAQS limits by 2-3 times, while NO2 and SO2 stayed within the limits. MODIS fire observations used to estimate CRB fire counts (confidence >= 80%) shows that rabi (burning period) fires in Haryana are similar to 3 times higher and more intense than in kharif. Furthermore, backward trajectories shows air mass movement from Haryana, Punjab and Pakistan. Thus, pollutants emitted reach Delhi via air masses, deteriorating its air quality.Meteorological conditions influence pollutant concentrations during both seasons. Frequent dust storms in rabi, and Dusshera and Diwali firework celebrations in kharif season exacerbate air pollution. In rabi, PM10 and PM2.5 have a significant negative association with (relative humidity) RH and positive association with (air temperature) AT. High AT during pre-monsoon, accompanied by low RH, loosens up soil particles and they can easily disperse. Stronger winds in rabi season promote NO2 and SO2 dispersion. In kharif, lower AT, higher RH and slower winds exist. Both PM10 and PM2.5 have a negative association with AT and (wind speed) WS. With lower temperature and slower winds during winter, pollutants are trapped within the boundary layer and are unable to disperse. As expected, NO2 has a significant negative association with AT in Haryana. However, in case of Delhi, the association is significant but positive, and could be due to the odd-even scheme imposed by the Delhi government. More research is needed to determine the health effects of Haryana's rabi CRB activities on Delhi.

TI  - Advances in satellite remote sensing of the wetland ecosystems in Sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Wetlands are highly productive systems that act as habitats for a variety of fauna and flora. Despite their ecohydrological significance, wetland ecosystems are severely under threat from global environmental changes as well as pressure from anthropogenic activities. Such changes results in severe disturbances of plant species composition, spatial distribution, productivity, diversity, and their ability to offer critical ecosystem goods and services . However, wetland degradation varies considerably from place to place with severe degradation in developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa due to poor management practices that leads to underutilization and over reliance on them for livelihoods. The lack of monitoring and assessment in this region has therefore led to the lack of consolidated detailed understanding on the rate of wetland loss. For example, the lack of up-to-date and reliable spatial explicit information further complicates the management of wetland ecosystems in semi-arid tropical environments. To monitor, understand and document wetland degradation rate, the use of remote sensing for accurate estimation and precise mapping of present and historic information remains imperative. Similarly, there is a need to develop robust methodologies to precisely assess and monitor wetland degradation, ecohydrological processes and wetland condition over space and time. This work thereof, provides a comprehensive overview of remote sensing applications in monitoring and mapping the wetland ecosystem. It also highlights the strength and challenges associated with the use of satellite data for purposes of wetland monitoring. Spatial explicit and periodic information offered by satellite remote sensing demonstrate a unique opportunity for documenting and understanding of wetlands, their ecohydrological processes, and environmental conditions.

TI  - Ecology of <i>Oobius rudnevi</i>, egg parasitoid of <i>Cerambyx cerdo</i> and <i>Cerambyx welensii</i> in oak forests
T2  - ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Oobius rudnevi (Nowicki) (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) is a gregarious egg parasitoid of Cerambyx cerdo L. and Cerambyx welensii (Kuster) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), two well-known large oak-living saproxylic beetles with different pest/legal status: whereas C. cerdo is a protected species, C. welensii is considered an emerging pest. Despite the potential interest of O. rudnevi as a native parasitoid, the knowledge of its biology remains very limited. We used sentinel eggs to assess the distribution of O. rudnevi in Extremadura (southwest Spain) and to explore its ecology, phenology, behavior, parasitism rates, and host preference. More than 13 500 sentinel eggs, housed in 1 030 wood disks, were field-exposed during 2016-2018 in 147 oak stands over an array of oak forests. Oobius rudnevi was the only egg parasitoid detected, being widespread and relatively abundant over the studied area (90/147 stands, 61.2%) with adults flying in May-July. Parasitoids were detected in both host species, but net parasitism (P-N) was significantly higher in C. cerdo (22.4%) than in C. welensii (9.5%). Net parasitism was affected by altitude (it was higher at 600-800 m) and tended to increase in colder aspects; P-N was poorly related to host egg density (no. eggs per disk) and unrelated to host population size (no. adults per trap). Most parasitoids overwintered and emerged in the following spring (synchronously with their hosts) but some phenotypes/lineages did not undergo obligate diapause and were bivoltine. Bivoltine wasps were spatially widespread (27/90 stands, 30%), even if their actual prevalence was rather low (60/1641 parasitized eggs, 3.7%). We also found that O. rudnevi was slightly protogynous, the sex ratio was female-biased, and the mean (+/- SEM) number of wasps emerging per parasitized egg was 9.3 +/- 0.1 (range 1-29). We discuss the potential role of O. rudnevi as a biological control agent from an evolutionary perspective.

TI  - Nonlinear Detector Response of Aqua MODIS Land Imaging Bands
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detectors in the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflective solar bands (RSBs) are calibrated assuming a linear relationship between the observed top-of-atmosphere radiance and the instrument output response. Any nonlinear behavior in the system response can contribute to errors in NASA's Level 1B MODIS reflectance and radiance products, which are used in a wide variety of Earth science applications. While most RSB detectors continue to have very linear behavior even after more than 18 years of operation, we present evidence that the detectors in Aqua MODIS bands 1 (645 nm) and 2 (858 nm) have deviations from gain linearity that change over the mission by up to 3%. We show a clear divergence between gain measurements made with the onboard solar diffuser (SD) at two different radiance levels, achieved by collecting data both with and without an attenuation screen. Radiance trends from lunar calibrations and typical desert and ocean scenes are also compared. We present a simple method to characterize the response nonlinearity using a quadratic function by combining the results of the two sets of SD calibrations. Applying this quadratic calibration algorithm to the desert and lunar data results in improved agreement in their long-term radiance trends. A clear understanding of the magnitude of the gain nonlinearity could be useful to help improve the quality of numerous MODIS science products, including the land imaging applications that rely heavily on these bands.

TI  - Evaluation of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) neural network cloud detection against current operational cloud masks
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud properties are critical to our understanding of weather and climate variability, but their estimation from satellite imagers is a nontrivial task. In this work, we aim to improve cloud detection, which is the most fundamental cloud property. We use a neural network applied to Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) measurements to determine whether an imager pixel is cloudy or cloudfree. The neural network is trained and evaluated using 4 years (2016-2019) of coincident measurements between VIIRS and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). We successfully address the lack of sun glint in the collocation dataset with a simple semi-supervised learning approach. The results of the neural network are then compared with two operational cloud masks: the Continuity MODIS-VIIRS Cloud Mask (MVCM) and the NOAA Enterprise Cloud Mask (ECM).We find that the neural network outperforms both operational cloud masks in most conditions examined with a few exceptions. The largest improvements we observe occur during the night over snow- or ice-covered surfaces in the high latitudes. In our analysis, we show that this improvement is not solely due to differences in optical-depth-based definitions of a cloud between each mask. We also analyze the differences in true-positive rate between day-night and land-water scenes as a function of optical depth. Such differences are a contributor to spatial artifacts in cloud masking, and we find that the neural network is the most consistent in cloud detection with respect to optical depth across these conditions. A regional analysis over Greenland illustrates the impact of such differences and shows that they can result in mean cloud fractions with very different spatial and temporal characteristics.

TI  - Cloud detection of GF-7 satellite laser footprint image
T2  - IET IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In November 2019, the GaoFen-7(GF-7) satellite was equipped with China's first laser altimeter with full waveform recording capability, which obtains high-precision long-range three-dimensional coordinates. The influence of clouds is noticeable for laser transmission, and a footprint camera is used to determine laser pointing and to image the ground. However, the cloud inevitably appears in the laser footprint image. In this study, the authors propose a cloud detection scheme for footprint images based on deep learning. First, an adaptive pooling model is proposed according to the characteristics of the cloud region. Next, model fusion was performed based on the SegNet and U-Net training results. Finally, test time augmentation was used to enhance the data and to improve cloud detection accuracy. The experimental results show that the fusion result of the model was approximately 5% better than that of the traditional cloud detection algorithm, which improved the shortcomings of the traditional algorithm, such as poor detection effect for thin clouds and complex underlying cloud surfaces. The related conclusions have certain reference significance for GF-7 data processing and related research on footprint images.

TI  - Land use/cover dynamics and its impact on the rural livelihood of potter communities
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was undertaken to examine impacts of land use/cover dynamics on the rural livelihood of potter communities in Domba Watershed, Southwestern Ethiopia. For the study, Landsat imageries of three periods 1976, 1995 and 2018 were used to analyze the land use/cover dynamics using ERDAS Imagine and ArcGIS. Additionally, bio-physical, demographic and socioeconomic data were collected from 98 sample households of the potter communities through interviews, focus group discussions, and transect walks. Descriptive statistics and Multinomial logistic regression model were utilized to analyze those data. The result revealed that at the beginning of the study period woodland (29.8%) and grassland (19.6%) occupied the dominant land use/cover types, which shared 49.4% of the area. Contrarily, croplands and settlements showed progressive expansion in 2018 and covered 67.57% of the total area. It was noted that over population and over stocking are the top mentioned drivers of land use/cover dynamics in the area. Furthermore, deep rooted and age-old social segregation, the absence of shop in the market to display and keep pottery products, deprived by other communities to access the raw material vicinity, low price of pottery products and the absence of handcrafts association are among the major constraints of potter community in the watershed. Appropriate soil and water conservation measures through public and community-based intervention approach has to be undertaken to rehabilitate progressively degrading landscapes. Additionally, minimizing the age-old social segregation and other related political and economic constraints of potter communities in the watershed shall get due attention.

TI  - Response of vegetation to submergence along Jingjiang Reach of the Yangtze River
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This work explores the changes in vegetation coverage and submergence time of floodplains along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (i.e., the Jingjiang River) and the relations between them. As the Three Gorges Dam has been operating for more than 10 years, the original vegetative environment has been greatly altered in this region. The two main aspects of these changes were discovered by analyzing year-end image data from remote sensing satellites using a dimidiate pixel model, based on the normalized difference vegetation index, and by calculating water level and topographic data over a distance of 360 km from 2003-2015. Given that the channels had adjusted laterally, thus exhibiting deeper and broader geometries due to the Three Gorges Dam, 11 floodplains were classified into three groups with distinctive features. The evidence shows that, the floodplains with high elevation have formed steady vegetation areas and could hardly be affected by runoff and usually occupied by humans. The low elevation group has not met the minimal threshold of submerging time for vegetation growth, and no plants were observed so far. Based on the facts summed up from the floodplains with variable elevation, days needed to spot vegetation ranges from 70 to 120 days which happened typically near 2006 and between 2008 and 2010, respectively, and a negative correlation was detected between submergence time and vegetation coverage within a certain range. Thus, floods optimized by the Three Gorges Dam have directly influenced plant growth in the floodplains and may also affect our ability to manage certain types of large floods. Our conclusions may provide a basis for establishing flood criteria to manage the floodplain vegetation and evaluating possible increases in resistance caused by high-flow flooding when these floodplains are submerged.

TI  - Sensitivity of Amphibians to Copper
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Amphibian populations are declining globally. Major drivers of these global declines are known. However, the contribution of these major drivers to population declines varies by the presence or absence and the interactive effect of drivers, thus creating local challenges for conservation of populations. Studies have determined that environmental contaminants contribute to amphibian population declines. However, there is a disagreement over the use of amphibians as sentinel species in ecotoxicological testing rather than the traditional taxa used, fish and invertebrates. Reviews of ecotoxicological studies have demonstrated that amphibians are generally less sensitive than fish and invertebrates to different groups of contaminants. Nonetheless, because of the distinct nature and mechanism of toxicity of various contaminants, it is necessary to study contaminants individually to be able to come to any conclusion on the relative sensitivity of amphibians. Copper is one of the most studied environmental contaminants. We conducted a literature review of Cu toxicity to amphibians and the relative sensitivity of amphibians to other aquatic animals. The available data suggest that although amphibians may be tolerant of acute Cu exposure, they are relatively sensitive to chronic exposure (i.e., 100-fold greater sensitivity to chronic compared to acute exposure). In addition, ecologically relevant endpoints specific to amphibians (e.g., duration of metamorphosis and behavior) are shown to provide a better understanding of their sensitivity compared to traditional endpoints (e.g., survival and growth). Our current knowledge on amphibian sensitivity is far from complete. Considering the current status of this globally threatened class of animals, it is necessary to fill the knowledge gaps regarding their sensitivity to individual contaminants, beginning with Cu.

M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper aims to determine the best spectral index for extraction of surface water bodies and considerable variation in water surface area during the period between 1990 and 2018. Five spectral indices are tested using Landsat series (1990, 2000, 2009 and 2018) and their performance in delineating surface water are assessed. The results of each algorithm have been matched and verified by Pearson correlation and root mean square error (RMSE). The results indicated that a modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) was created for 1990, 2000, 2009 and 2018 by RMSE with accurate spatial information on waterbodies of 23.54, 33.14, 22.87 and 17.28 respectively. The estimated area of surface water bodies is increased by 2207.28 ha (1990-2018) derived through MNDWI. Hence, the process could be very useful for accurately mapping and monitoring surface water.

TI  - Response of tidal creek networks and tidal connectivity to coastal squeeze of saltmarshes in the southern Bohai Bay
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal squeeze of saltmarshes (CSS) has substantially eliminated valuable intertidal habitats and worsened local tidal hydrological environment by disintegrating tidal creek networks and losing tidal connectivity (TC). In this study, we explored the process response of creek network structure and TC to CSS dynamics, taking the southern Bohai Bay of China as a case study area. With the Landsat series data and ArcGIS spatial analysis, the morphological and structural evolution of tidal creek systems were quantified by four parameters: creek order, creek length, creek branch point, and network catchment area. Also, the TC was assessed and visualised based on a geostatistical connectivity method. It was found that low-order small creeks were more sensitive and vulnerable to CSS and the creek network would face disintegration when about 50% of the saltmarsh squeeze degree occurred, which has been observed as a crucial threshold. In the seaward direction, the CSS process has led to the continuous replacement of high TC areas by low TC areas, greatly altering the original natural TC pattern. Revealing the relationship between CSS and creek network structure and TC will allow a further understanding of the degradation of intertidal ecosystems, and will promote their ecological and hydrological restoration.

TI  - Long-term, medium spatial resolution annual land surface phenology with a Bayesian hierarchical model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP) is a consistent and sensitive indicator of climate change effects on Earth's vegetation. Existing methods of estimating LSP require time series densities that, until recently, have only been available from coarse spatial resolution imagery such as MODIS (500 m) and AVHRR (1 km). LSP products from these datasets have improved our understanding of phenological change at the global scale, especially over the MODIS era (2001-present). Nevertheless, these products may obscure important finer scale spatial patterns and longer-term changes. Therefore, we have developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to retrieve complete annual sequences of LSP from Landsat imagery (1984-present), which has medium spatial resolution (30 m) but relatively sparse temporal frequency. Our approach uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to quantify individual phenometric uncertainty, which is especially important when considering long time series with variable observation quality and density, but has rarely been demonstrated. The estimated spring LSP had strong agreement with ground phenology records at Harvard Forest (R2 = 0.87) and Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (R2 = 0.67). The estimated LSP were consistent with the recently released 30 m LSP product, MSLSP30NA, in its time period of 2016 to 2018 (R2 of 0.86 and 0.73 for spring and autumn phenology, respectively). Our Bayesian hierarchical model is an important step forward in extending medium resolution LSP records back in time as it accomplishes both critical goals of retrieving annual LSP from sparse time series and accurately estimating uncertainty.

TI  - Measuring and modelling the complex-permittivity of hemp plant (Cannabis Sativa) at X band for microwave remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is vital to determine the dielectric characterization of hemp plant (Cannabis Sativa) for microwave remote sensing to increase its accuracy and to improve algorithms for satellite data interpretation. For that, this study provides the measurement results of complex permittivity of hemp stems and leaves in terms of various moisture contents (MC) in 8-12.4 GHz in a laboratory with a temperature of 25 degrees C and a relative humidity of 59%. With the measurement data, the dielectric properties are modelled as a second-order polynomial function based on a curve-fitting method depending on the frequency and MC. For hemp stems and leaves with various MC, while the real part of the relative complex permittivity (epsilon ') ranges between 2.1-7.2 and 1.5-6.1, the imaginary part of that (epsilon '') varies in 0.3-4.5 and 0.2-4.2, respectively. The measured and modelled results are compatible with each other.

TI  - Remote sensing and structural studies of the Central Asir Shear Zone, Western Arabian Shield: Implications for the late Neoproterozoic E-W Gondwana assembly
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Central Asir Shear Zone (CASZ) is a N- to NNE-oriented inhomogeneous strain zone parallel to the Nabitah shear belt in southern Saudi Arabia. It is -200 km long and 20 km wide, and traverses the Asir terrane. The deformed terrains in the vicinity of the CASZ have experienced a prolonged history involving three successive phases of deformation: arc-collision, dextral transpression and sinistral strike-slip faulting. Remote-sensing data analysis and field investigation provide insights into the geological and structural features along the CASZ. Image transformation and enhancement reveal faults and folds, and discriminate between granitoids, metavolcanics, gabbros and younger (Ablah Group) sediments. The obtained evidence points to polyphase deformation of the area, characterized by narrow zones of high strain, folding and shearing enclosing slices of less deformed rocks. Lineament analysis shows predominantly NNE, NNW, N and NE trends of folds and shear zones, and NW, NE and E fracture trends. The CASZ has a >100 m.y. long deformation history, including a change from dextral to sinistral shearing. Both shearing senses are found on the older N-S and younger NW-SE fault systems. N-S oriented shearing was accompanied by intrusion of granitoids and localized hydrothermal alteration along N to NNE trending shear zones. Strain analysis shows low strain in the Ablah basin sediments, consistent with Ablah deposition after the tectonic climax in the region.

TI  - Whole-genome sequencing association analysis of quantitative red blood cell phenotypes: The NHLBI TOPMed program
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Whole-genome sequencing (WGS), a powerful tool for detecting novel coding and non-coding disease-causing variants, has largely been applied to clinical diagnosis of inherited disorders. Here we leveraged WGS data in up to 62,653 ethnically diverse participants from the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program and assessed statistical association of variants with seven red blood cell (RBC) quantitative traits. We discovered 14 single variant-RBC trait associations at 12 genomic loci, which have not been reported previously. Several of the RBC trait-variant associations (RPN1, ELL2, MIDN, HBB, HBA1, PIEZO1, and G6PD) were replicated in independent GWAS datasets imputed to the TOPMed reference panel. Most of these discovered variants are rare/low frequency, and several are observed disproportionately among non-European Ancestry (African, Hispanic/Latino, or East Asian) populations. We identified a 3 bp indel p.Lys2169del (g.88717175_88717177TCT[4]) (common only in the Ashkenazi Jewish population) of PIEZO1, a gene responsible for the Mendelian red cell disorder hereditary xerocytosis (MIM: 194380), associated with higher mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). In stepwise conditional analysis and in gene-based rare variant aggregated association analysis, we identified several of the variants in HBB, HBA1, TMPRSS6, and G6PD that represent the carrier state for known coding, promoter, or splice site loss-of-function variants that cause inherited RBC disorders. Finally, we applied base and nuclease editing to demonstrate that the sentinel variant rs112097551 (nearest gene RPN1) acts through a cis-regulatory element that exerts long-range control of the gene RUVBL1 which is essential for hematopoiesis. Together, these results demonstrate the utility of WGS in ethnically diverse population-based samples and gene editing for expanding knowledge of the genetic architecture of quantitative hematologic traits and suggest a continuum between complex trait and Mendelian red cell disorders.

TI  - Intra-urban microclimate investigation in urban heat island through a novel mobile monitoring system
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring microclimate variables within cities with high accuracy is an ongoing challenge for a better urban resilience to climate change. Assessing the intra-urban characteristics of a city is of vital importance for ensuring fine living standards for citizens. Here, a novel mobile microclimate station is applied for monitoring the main microclimatic variables regulating urban and intra-urban environment, as well as directionally monitoring shortwave radiation and illuminance and hence systematically map for the first time the effect of urban surfaces and anthropogenic heat. We performed day-time and night-time monitoring campaigns within a historical city in Italy, characterized by substantial urban structure differentiations. We found significant intra-urban variations concerning variables such as air temperature and shortwave radiation. Moreover, the proposed experimental framework may capture, for the very first time, significant directional variations with respect to shortwave radiation and illuminance across the city at microclimate scale. The presented mobile station represents therefore the key missing piece for exhaustively identifying urban environmental quality, anthropogenic actions, and data driven modelling toward risk and resilience planning. It can be therefore used in combination with satellite data, stable weather station or other mobile stations, e.g. wearable sensing techniques, through a citizens' science approach in smart, livable, and sustainable cities in the near future.

TI  - A Multi-Objective Enhanced Fruit Fly Optimization (MO-EFOA) Framework for Despeckling SAR Images using DTCWT based Local Adaptive Thresholding
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of Satellite Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery systems is increasing day-by-day in various field such as earth observation, hi-technology war mechanisms, etc. The images captured by SAR imagery systems are mainly used to detect and classify objects captured in the images. Due to the complexity of the image capturing process, SAR images can be highly noisy - often consisting of multiplicative noise, also known as speckle. To detect or classify objects in SAR images, speckle noise must be removed from images. During despeckling process, the preservation of important information in the SAR images while removing noise such as edge or patterns is a crucial task. Despeckling methods are liable to compromise on edge preservation ability while aspiring for good quality denoised images. Many researchers have proposed wavelet transform based despeckling approaches such as Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Undecimated Wavelet Transform (UDWT), Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT). In these approaches, finding the best values of the coefficients plays an important role in yielding excellent denoised images with preserved edges. In this paper, we have proposed a novel optimization framework that optimizes thresholding coefficients of DTCWT despeckling method for SAR images. The proposed optimization framework is based on Fruit Fly Optimization (FOA) algorithm. The approach is a multi-objective optimization algorithm that is used to find maximum values for Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) and Equivalent number of look (ENL). The maximum value of MSSIM indicates high edge preservation capacity, whereas maximum PSNR value indicates good quality denoising of images. The maximum ENL value represents a good speckle-noise smoothing capability. We have applied our framework over some classical images as well as over SAR images of MSTAR dataset. In our experiments, we found that our proposed framework results in the excellent PSNR 36.87 dB, 35.4 dB and 37.8 dB, MSSIM values 0.92, 0.93 and 0.92, respectively, in the case of lena image, MSTAR dataset image and TerraSAR-X dataset image.

TI  - The value of the intraoperative assessment of the SLN via frozen section in the post Z0011 era
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY OBSTETRICS AND HUMAN REPRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel node (SN) assessment via frozen section (FS) has declined since the publication of Z0011 which modified the management of a specific group of patients with positive SN. The risk of misleading the surgeons to a preventable ALND and the cost are among the main factors for that. The aim of our study is to assess the value of FS in the post Z0011.Material and methods: 244 patients out of 434 were eligible for an upfront SLNB. Based on the final histology and the clinical data we selected the eligible for breast conserving surgery patients (55.4%). 78 patients had positive SN and 26 of them fulfilled the criteria of Z0011. We assessed the false negative findings, the impact on the management and the indications and value of FS in the post Z0011 era.Results: Overall, there were 12 FN cases out of which 7 were macrometastases (8.97%). Only in one case there were > 2 positive LN and 3 patients needed mastectomy. The remaining cases fulfilled the criteria of Z0011 and needed no further surgery hence in 96.1% of the cases the axillary status was correctly assessed via FS and the reoperation rate was 1.2%. On the contrary, if FS was not used, at least 21.3% of the patents would have needed reoperation based on the today's guidelines.Discussion: We believe FS is still valuable and may spare a significant percentage of patients from a second operation (SNB) without leading to axillary overtreatment if used wisely.

TI  - Detection of Potential Vernal Pools on the Canadian Shield (Ontario) Using Object-Based Image Analysis in Combination with Machine Learning
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vernal pools are small, temporary, forested wetlands of ecological importance with a high sensitivity to changing climate and land-use patterns. These ecosystems are under considerable development pressure in southeastern Georgian Bay, where mapping techniques are required to inform wise land-use decisions. Our mapping approach combines common machine learning techniques [random forest, support vector machines (SVMs)] with object-based image analysis. Using multispectral image segmentation on high-resolution orthoimagery, we first created objects and assigned classes based on field collected data. We then supplied machine learning algorithms with data from freely available sources (Ontario orthoimagery and Sentinel 2) and tested accuracy on a reserved dataset. We achieved producer's accuracies of 85 and 79% and user's accuracies of 78 and 84% for random forest and SVMs models, respectively. Difficulty differentiating between small, dark shadows and small, obscured pools accounted for many of the omission and commission errors. Our automated approach of vernal pool classification provides a relatively accurate, consistent, and fast mapping strategy compared to manual photointerpretation. Our models can be applied on a regional basis to help verify the locations of pools in an area of Ontario that is in critical need of more detailed ecological information.

TI  - Optimal multi-temporal Sentinel-1A SAR imagery for paddy rice field discrimination; a recommendation for operational mapping initiatives
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology-based rice mapping has mostly employed all satellite data over the growing season. This approach is not only time consuming but also requires huge data storage and is thus unsuitable for operational initiatives. Even with the use of feature selection algorithms that minimise data redundancy, the huge amount of time in data processing prior to optimal image subset selection is unavoidable. Thus, this study seeks to identify the rice development phase(s) whose Sentinel-1A data in vertical transmitted and horizontal received (VH) and vertical transmitted and vertical received (VV) polarizations offer the most accurate rice field discrimination. Using an area in southeast China during the 2017 growing season, VH + VV data of the vegetative and maturity phases recorded the highest overall accuracy (89.3%) based on Random Forest (RF). For the agro-ecology investigated in this study, therefore, potential users of Sentinel-1A in rice mapping can ex-ante select images acquired over the crop's vegetative and maturity phases to avoid the enormous computational time and storage attendant with entire-season data. These findings would complement algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM) that lack feature section tools. However, replications of this study at multiple years and ecologies, and comparison with classifications obtained from optimal data selection tools (variable importance) are strongly recommended to arrive at universally applicable conclusions.

TI  - Precision worm control in grazing lambs by targeting group treatment based on performance of sentinels
T2  - ANIMAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the economic impact of gastrointestinal nematode infection on livestock farming worldwide, and increasing anthelmintic resistance, it is imperative to develop practical, efficient and sustainable control strategies. Targeted selective treatment (TST), whereby anthelmintic treatments are administered to animals individually, based on selection criteria such as weight gain, has been shown to successfully maintain animal productivity whilst reducing the selection pressure for anthelmintic resistance and the economic cost of treatment in experimental and commercial settings. Despite the benefits of the TST approach, the equipment and time required to monitor animals individually make this strategy unsuitable for some farming enterprises. The sentinel group approach aims to maintain the benefits observed using TSTwhilst reducing these requirements. The study involved two experiments, each following a group of 80 lambs through their first grazing season. Anthelmintic treatment of the whole group was determined by monitoring the weight gain of identified sentinel lambs within it every 2 weeks: when 40% of the sentinel lambs failed to reach theirweight gain targets, thewhole groupwas treated. The sentinel lambs consisted of 45% of the group (n= 36) in experiment one and 20% (n= 16) in experiment two. A control group of 20 lambs was co-grazed with the main group during both experiments; in experiment one, the sentinel approach was compared with a TST approach, inwhich control lambs were treated on an individual basis in response to weight gain. In experiment two, the sentinel approach was compared with conventional prophylaxis, where all lambs in the control group were treated at strategic time points throughout the season (= strategic prophylactic treatment). The sentinel lambs were found to be representative of overall group performance regardless of the proportion of sentinels within the group: they recorded similar growth rates and reached weight gain targets simultaneously at each time point and overall. Live-weight gain was also similar between sentinel and control animals in both experiments. The findings of the current study suggest that monitoring sentinel lambs comprising 20% of a group of grazing lambs is sufficient to determine the need for anthelmintic treatment within the whole group, and that this approach maintains production in line with conventional or TST treatment regimes.

TI  - Spatial and temporal monitoring of drought conditions using the satellite rainfall estimates and remote sensing optical and thermal measurements
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is an important natural disaster that causes devastating impacts on the ecosystem, livestock, environment, and society. So far, various remote-sensing methods have been developed to estimate drought conditions, each of which has advantages and restrictions. This study aims to monitor the real-time drought indices at the field scales via the integration of various earth observations. Our proposed method consists of two steps. In the first step, the relationships between long-term standardized precipitation indices (SPI) derived from PERSIANN-CDR rainfall data and two drought-dependent parameters derived from MODIS products, including normalized NDVI and soil-air temperature gradient, are obtained at the spatial resolution of PERSIANN-CDR grid (approximately 25 km). As the next step, the corresponding relationships are applied to estimate the drought index maps at the spatial resolution of MODIS products (1 km). Numerous analyses are carried out to evaluate the proposed method. The results revealed that, from various drought indices, including SPIs of different timescales (1, 3, 6, and 12-months), SPI-3 and SPI-6 are more appropriate to the proposed method in terms of correlation with temperature and vegetation parameters. The findings also demonstrate the competency of the proposed method in estimating SPI indices with average RMSE 0.67 and the average correlation coefficient of 0.74. (C) 2021 COSPAR.

TI  - Survival models induced by zero-modified power series discrete frailty: Application with a melanoma data set
T2  - STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Survival models with a frailty term are presented as an extension of Cox's proportional hazard model, in which a random effect is introduced in the hazard function in a multiplicative form with the aim of modeling the unobserved heterogeneity in the population. Candidates for the frailty distribution are assumed to be continuous and non-negative. However, this assumption may not be true in some situations. In this paper, we consider a discretely distributed frailty model that allows units with zero frailty, that is, it can be interpreted as having long-term survivors. We propose a new discrete frailty-induced survival model with a zero-modified power series family, which can be zero-inflated or zero-deflated depending on the parameter value. Parameter estimation was obtained using the maximum likelihood method, and the performance of the proposed models was performed by Monte Carlo simulation studies. Finally, the applicability of the proposed models was illustrated with a real melanoma cancer data set.

TI  - A simple cloud-filling approach for remote sensing water cover assessments
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The empirical attribution of hydrologic change presents a unique data availability challenge in terms of establishing baseline prior conditions, as one cannot go back in time to retrospectively collect the necessary data. Although global remote sensing data can alleviate this challenge, most satellite missions are too recent to capture changes that happened long ago enough to provide sufficient observations for adequate statistical inference. In that context, the 4 decades of continuous global high-resolution monitoring enabled by the Landsat missions are an unrivaled source of information. However, constructing a time series of land cover observation across Landsat missions remains a significant challenge because cloud masking and inconsistent image quality complicate the automatized interpretation of optical imagery.Focusing on the monitoring of lake water extent, we present an automatized gap-filling approach to infer the class (wet or dry) of pixels masked by clouds or sensing errors. The classification outcome of unmasked pixels is compiled across images taken on different dates to estimate the inundation frequency of each pixel, based on the assumption that different pixels are masked at different times. The inundation frequency is then used to infer the inundation status of masked pixels on individual images through supervised classification. Applied to a variety of global lakes with substantial long term or seasonal fluctuations, the approach successfully captured water extent variations obtained from in situ gauges (where applicable), or from other Landsat missions during overlapping time periods. Although sensitive to classification errors in the input imagery, the gap-filling algorithm is straightforward to implement on Google's Earth Engine platform and stands as a scalable approach to reli-ably monitor, and ultimately attribute, historical changes in water bodies.

TI  - Rituals of ultimacy: a neurotheological account of James K.A. Smith's post-secular liturgy
T2  - PRACTICAL THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Andrew Newberg has argued for bringing neuroscience and theology into more fruitful dialogue through a methodology he calls neurotheology. Additionally, the Christian philosopher James K. A. Smith has argued for a shift in understanding theological formation, away from an emphasis on cognitive belief and towards an appreciation of embodied ritual and his definition of liturgy. Following Newberg's neurotheological methodology, this article argues that recent neuroscientific research supports Smith's conception of liturgy. Moreover, by rejecting the exaggerated importance of intellect-focused accounts of religious formation, a neurotheological account of liturgy can contribute to a reconceptualization of personal identity, worldview, knowledge, and learning in general.

TI  - A new strategy to map landslides with a generalized convolutional neural network
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid mapping of event landslides is crucial to identify the areas affected by damages as well as for effective disaster response. Traditionally, such maps are generated with visual interpretation of remote sensing imagery (manned/unmanned airborne systems or spaceborne sensors) and/or using pixel-based and object-based methods exploiting data-intensive machine learning algorithms. Recent works have explored the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN), a deep learning algorithm, for mapping landslides from remote sensing data. These methods follow a standard supervised learning workflow that involves training a model using a landslide inventory covering a relatively small area. The trained model is then used to predict landslides in the surrounding regions. Here, we propose a new strategy, i.e., a progressive CNN training relying on combined inventories to build a generalized model that can be applied directly to a new, unexplored area. We first prove the effectiveness of CNNs by training and validating on event landslides inventories in four regions after earthquakes and/or extreme meteorological events. Next, we use the trained CNNs to map landslides triggered by new events spread across different geographic regions. We found that CNNs trained on a combination of inventories have a better generalization performance, with a bias towards high precision and low recall scores. In our tests, the combined training model achieved the highest (Matthews correlation coefficient) MCC score of 0.69 when mapping landslides in new unseen regions. The mapping was done on images from different optical sensors, resampled to a spatial resolution of 6 m, 10 m, and 30 m. Despite a slightly reduced performance, the main advantage of combined training is to overcome the requirement of a local inventory for training a new deep learning model. This implementation can facilitate automated pipelines providing fast response for the generation of landslide maps in the post-disaster phase. In this study, the study areas were selected from seismically active zones with a high hydrological hazard distribution and vegetation coverage. Hence, future works should also include regions from less vegetated geographic locations.

TI  - Design and Synthesis of Cathepsin-K-Activated Osteoadsorptive Fluorogenic Sentinel (OFS) Probes for Detecting Early Osteoclastic Bone Resorption in a Multiple Myeloma Mouse Model
T2  - BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe the design and synthesis of OFS-1, an Osteoadsorptive Fluorogenic Sentinel imaging probe that is adsorbed by hydroxyapatite (HAp) and bone mineral surfaces, where it generates an external fluorescent signal in response to osteoclast-secreted cathepsin K (Ctsk). The probe consists of a bone-anchoring bisphosphonate moiety connected to a Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) internally quenched fluorescent (IQF) dye pair, linked by a Ctsk peptide substrate, GHPGGPQG. Key structural features contributing to the effectiveness of OFS-1 were defined by structure-activity relationship (S AR) and modeling studies comparing OFS-1 with two cognates, OFS-2 and OFS-3. In solution or when preadsorbed on HAp, OFS-1 exhibited strong fluorescence when exposed to Ctsk (2.5-20 nM). Time-lapse photomicrographs obtained after seeding human osteoclasts onto HAp-coated well plates containing preadsorbed OFS-1 revealed bright fluorescence at the periphery of resorbing cells. OFS-1 administered systemically detected early osteolysis colocalized with orthotopic engraftment of RPMI-8226-Luc human multiple myeloma cells at a metastatic skeletal site in a humanized mouse model. OFS-1 is thus a promising new imaging tool for detecting abnormal bone resorption.

TI  - Large-scale winter catch crop monitoring with Sentinel-2 time series and machine learning-An alternative to on-site controls?
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The European legislative guidelines on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) lead to an obligation of area-wide information about cross-compliant Greening measures in EU countries. But by on-site controlling, agricultural authorities can monitor only a small portion of all registered parcels. With the Copernicus Programme, the freely available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery increasingly supports remote sensing-based agricultural monitoring on a large-scale. However, most prototypes lack the topic of winter catch cropping. Therefore, we developed a new machine learning method for catch crop monitoring and detection at the parcel-level. To gain training and test data for supervised machine learning, we collected winter catch crop parcel data from different years (2016-2019) and four federal states in Germany. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series were calculated for each parcel from Sentinel-2 data within the typical winter catch crop cultivation season (July-April). We revealed distinctive temporal patterns of catch cropping and developed nineteen descriptive features for automatized prediction. Then, we trained fifteen Random Forest classifiers comprising different regions and years and conducted a multi-level validation to identify the model with the highest robustness on new data. The Random Forest classifier trained with the input data from all federal states and years outperformed the other models. It reached a mean prediction accuracy of 84% for both classes (catch crop and non-catch crop) across eleven different spatio-temporal domains. Under optimal annual weather conditions it reached accuracies close to 90%. Anomalies caused by heat waves and early frost events were found to have a high influence on the phenology of catch crops and thus lead to reduced prediction accuracies. From the set of predictors, those features with the highest importance measured the correlation between the observed time series and a simulated NDVI phenological profile. We concluded that catch cropping parcels are automatically separable from parcels with other winter cultivations (e.g., winter cereals, grasslands, fallow) with Sentinel-2 NDVI time series data. Different catch crop subgroups (i.e., seed mixes) could not be differentiated by our approach due to very similar phenological profiles. Nonetheless, the used approach allows for large-scale winter catch crop monitoring and supports authorities in the selection of parcels with high demand for on-site controlling. By merging the training datasets from different federal states and years, we could overcome the typical spatial and temporal overfitting problem in machine learning. Therefore, the study's final classifier can be reliably transferred to new datasets in Germany and other regions with similar bio-geographical conditions.

TI  - AEROCOM and AEROSAT AAOD and SSA study - Part 1: Evaluation and intercomparison of satellite measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global measurements of absorbing aerosol optical depth (AAOD) are scarce and mostly provided by the ground network AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork). In recent years, several satellite products of AAOD have been developed.This study's primary aim is to establish the usefulness of these datasets for AEROCOM (Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models) model evaluation with a focus on the years 2006, 2008 and 2010. The satellite products are super-observations consisting of 1 degrees x 1 degrees x 30 min aggregated retrievals. This study consists of two papers, the current one that deals with the assessment of satellite observations and a second paper (Schutgens et al., 2021) that deals with the evaluation of models using those satellite data. In particular, the current paper details an evaluation with AERONET observations from the sparse AERONET network as well as a global intercomparison of satellite datasets, with a focus on how minimum AOD (aerosol optical depth) thresholds and temporal averaging may improve agreement between satellite observations.All satellite datasets are shown to have reasonable skill for AAOD (three out of four datasets show correlations with AERONET in excess of 0.6) but less skill for SSA (singlescattering albedo; only one out of four datasets shows correlations with AERONET in excess of 0.6). In comparison, satellite AOD shows correlations from 0.72 to 0.88 against the same AERONET dataset. However, we show that performance vs. AERONET and inter-satellite agreements for SSA improve significantly at higher AOD. Temporal averaging also improves agreements between satellite datasets. Nevertheless multi-annual averages still show systematic differences, even at high AOD. In particular, we show that two POLDER (Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances) products appear to have a systematic SSA difference over land of similar to 0:04, independent of AOD. Identifying the cause of this bias offers the possibility of substantially improving current datasets.We also provide evidence that suggests that evaluation with AERONET observations leads to an underestimate of true biases in satellite SSA.In the second part of this study we show that, notwithstanding these biases in satellite AAOD and SSA, the datasets allow meaningful evaluation of AEROCOM models.

TI  - Operational prediction of forest attributes using standardised harvester data and airborne laser scanning data in Sweden
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - With cut-to-length harvesters, tree stems are measured and cut into different timber assortments at the time of felling. These measurement data collected from harvested trees can be used for decision-support at different levels of the forest industry chain and also for forest planning when combined with remote sensing data. The aim of this study was to examine the operational application for predicting merchantable stem volume, basal area, basal area-weighted mean tree height, basal area-weighted mean stem diameter and diameter distribution at stand level with airborne laser scanning data and harvester data from final felling operations. The area-based approach using k-MSN estimation was evaluated for six different variants of spatial partitioning. The results were stand level predictions with relative root mean square errors of 11-14%, 10-15%, 3-4% and 6-7% for merchantable stem volume, basal area, basal area-weighted mean tree height and basal area-weighted mean stem diameter, respectively. Predictions of stem diameter distributions resulted in error indices of 0.13-0.14. The results demonstrate that harvester data from cut forests may serve as ground truth to airborne laser scanning data and provide accurate forest estimates at stand level. The predicted diameter distributions could be useful for improving yield estimates and bucking simulations.

TI  - Serum metabolic profiling of traditional Chinese medicine syndromes in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE-JIM
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The clinical symptoms of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) can be effectively improved by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment, based on the usage of specific therapies for different TCM syndromes. However, in the stage of diagnosis, the standard criteria for the classification of TCM syndrome were still deficient. Through serum metabolic profiling, this study aimed to explore potential biomarkers in IBS-D patients with different TCM syndromes, which can assist in diagnosis of the disease.Methods: Serum samples were collected from healthy controls (30 cases), IBS-D patients with Liver Stagnation and Spleen-Deficiency syndrome (LSSD, 30 cases), Yang Deficiency of Spleen and Kidney syndrome (YDSK, 11 cases) and Damp Abundance due to Spleen-Deficiency syndrome (DASD, 22 cases). Serum metabolic profiling was conducted by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The potential biomarkers were screened by orthogonal partial least square-discriminate analysis, while metabolic pathways undergoing alterations were identified by pathway enrichment analysis in MetaboAnalyst 4.0.Results: Overall, 34 potential biomarkers were identified in LSSD group, 36 in YDSK group and 31 in DASD group. And the 13 metabolites shared by three groups were determined as the potential biomarkers of IBS-D. Glycerophospholipid metabolism was disturbed significantly in IBS-D patients, which may play a role in IBS-D through inflammation. What's more, three TCM syndromes have the specific potential biomarkers in glycerophospholipid metabolism.Conclusion: The serum metabolomics revealed that different TCM syndrome types in IBS-D may have different metabolic patterns during disease progression and glycerophospholipid metabolism was one of the pathways, whose metabolism was disturbed differently among three TCM syndromes in IBS-D. Therefore, the specific potential biomarkers in glycerophospholipid metabolism of three TCM syndromes in IBS-D can serve as the objective indicators, which can facilitate the TCM-syndrome objective classification of IBS-D.Please cite this article as: Tang SQ, Wang YL, Xie ZY, Zhang Y, Guo Y, Gao KL, Mao TY, Xie CE, Li JX, Gao XY.

TI  - Mask R-CNN-based building extraction from VHR satellite data in operational humanitarian action: An example related to Covid-19 response in Khartoum, Sudan
T2  - TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the constraints of operational work supporting humanitarian organizations in their response to the Covid-19 pandemic, we conducted building extraction for Khartoum, Sudan. We extracted approximately 1.2 million dwellings and buildings, using a Mask R-CNN deep learning approach from a Pleiades very high-resolution satellite image with 0.5 m pixel resolution. Starting from an untrained network, we digitized a few hundred samples and iteratively increased the number of samples by validating initial classification results and adding them to the sample collection. We were able to strike a balance between the need for timely information and the accuracy of the result by combining the output from three different models, each aiming at distinctive types of buildings, in a post-processing workflow. We obtained a recall of 0.78, precision of 0.77 and F-1 score of 0.78, and were able to deliver first results in only 10 days after the initial request. The procedure shows the great potential of convolutional neural network frameworks in combination with GIS routines for dwelling extraction even in an operational setting.

TI  - The analytical indicators to explain the distribution of oases in arid zones using the Oases Integrated Analysis Model
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the distribution of natural and artificial oases is essential for effective management of desert oases and water resources in arid regions. In order to explore characterization of Oases, we developed an ensemble method for the identification of factors influencing the distribution of oases in the upper reaches of the Tarim River Basin (TRB), China. To determine the affected elements of artificial and natural oases in arid lands through multi-function choices from 1990 to 2020, the Oases Integrated Analysis Model (OIAM) was used. The following input data was included in the OIAM: meteorological conditions, salinity, depth of groundwater, time sequence of Landsat images, and environmental chemicals such as calcium, bicarbonate, potassium, sodium, sulfate, and fluoride ions. Several functional methods were used to assess the efficiency of the OIAM. The results indicated that the OIAM consistently outperformed stable Wi (spatial contribution rate to Oases' indicators). Moreover, the results from OIAM indicated that salinity and meteorological indicators influenced the spatial distribution of artificial and natural oases. For environmental chemical, Na and Mg ions were strongly associated with the distribution of artificial and natural oases, respectively. This indicates that the OIAM model effectively identifies factors influencing the distribution of artificial and natural oases in arid regions, and thus can be applied to other similar regions.

TI  - Proposed quality performance indicators of sentinel lymph node biopsy for cutaneous melanoma
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Melanoma is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand has the highest melanoma incidence in the world alongside Australia at 54 per 100 000 persons. The aim of this study is to conduct a retrospective quality audit of sentinel lymph nodal biopsy (SLNB) practices from 2007 to 2019 of a high-volume melanoma surgeon. Primary outcome was false negative rate (FNR). Secondary outcomes were sentinel node (SN) identification and removal rate, and complication rates.Methods: A database was maintained, containing n = 553 consecutive SLNB's for cutaneous melanoma from 31 August 2007 to 31 August 2019. Patient characteristics and details of the primary lesion, sentinel lymph node biopsy, recurrence and complications were recorded.Results: SN's were successfully identified in 444 (99.6%) out of 446 patients with an FNR of 9.1%. Positive SN's were identified in 70 (12.7%) SLNB's. Complications occurred in 76 out of 553 (13.7%) SLNB's. A review of internationally published literature reveals an SN identification rate of 94.4-99.5% with an FNR of 4.0-37.5%. SLNB is the best staging tool for melanoma and gives potential access to adjuvant systemic treatment if >1 mm deposits are found. It is a day-stay procedure with a low-complication rate.Conclusion: SLNB is a safe and reliable procedure utilized for cutaneous melanoma. We propose our data should be used alongside international SN series to establish Quality Performance Indicators to improve melanoma management.

TI  - Assessing the effects of vegetation change on urban land surface temperature using remote sensing data: The case of Addis Ababa city, Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) plays an essential role in regulating the temperature and surface processes of land features. Advancement in remote sensing has paved the way for the use of satellite data to estimate land surface temperature. The objective of this study was to estimate changes in vegetation and LST from Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) of 1985 and Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) of 2015 for Addis Ababa City, Ethiopia. Land use/land cover classification using supervised image classification and the maximum likelihood algorithm method was applied to study changes in land use/land cover from 1985 to 2015. Brightness temperature, Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were computed to estimate land surface temperature. The result of the study showed a reduction of vegetation cover and rapid expansion of built-up area against grazing lands and other land use classes from 1985 to 2015. The area of builtup has increased from 18.23% in 1985 to 33.86% in 2015. In the centre of the city and areas with low vegetation cover, land surface temperature has shown an increase of 3-8. C from 1985 to 2015. Correlation analysis showed a negative correlation between NDVI and land surface temperature in all sub-cities of Addis Ababa. The findings of this study could support the designing of suitable strategies to mitigate urban heat stress.

TI  - Estimation of Crop Water Requirement Based on Planting Structure Extraction from Multi-Temporal MODIS EVI
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of crop water requirement (CWR) is key to the rational water use and agricultural water conservation in arid regions. Using remote sensing data to obtain long-term CWR over large areas helps water resources management in water-scarce areas. This study, taking the Kaidu-Kongqi River basin in arid northwest China as the study area, investigated the feasibility of synergistically using phenological characteristics, Savitzky-Golay filter, harmonic analysis and decision tree to extract crop planting structures (CPS) from MODIS EVI, and meanwhile analyzed the spatiotemporal variation in the estimated CWR. The results show that the integrated method for CPS identification and extraction is feasible and reliable with the classification accuracy over 80%. The mid-season stage requires the most water and cash crops need more water than cereal crops. Summer accounts for 69% the total growing season water use. The significant increase in the area of high water demand crops such as cotton raised the total CWR of the basin surging from 14.91x 10(8)m(3) in 2000 to 34.92x10(8)m(3) in 2017. The spatial distribution of CWR was more related to crop types and area than to climatic conditions. Controlling the expansion of arable land and optimizing the agricultural planting structure remain important tasks for the sustainable management of water resources in the basin.

TI  - Novel putative bluetongue virus serotype 29 isolated from inapparently infected goat in Xinjiang of China
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Bluetongue virus (BTV) is the 'type' species of the genus Orbivirus causing bluetongue (BT) in sheep, bovine and other ruminants. Twenty-four serotypes and several atypical serotypes of BTV were identified worldwide. In present study, a novel strain of BTV (V196/XJ/2014) was isolated from an asymptomatic sentinel goat in Yuli County, Xinjiang of China. Serotype identification of this isolate exhibited uniform negative results by serotype-specific conventional RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR for BTV-1 to BTV-27, and virus neutralization tests using reference sera of BTV-1 to BTV-24. Genomic analysis showed V196/XJ/2014 grouped with atypical serotypes of BTV-25 to BTV-28, BTV-X/XJ1407, BTV-X/ITL2015 and BTV-Y/TUN2017, while segment 2 and VP2 protein of V196/XJ/2014 shared <63.4%/61.4% nucleic acids and amino acids sequence identities with other recognized BTV serotypes and its segment 2 formed a separate 'nucleotype' in phylogenetic tree. These results indicated V196/XJ/2014 does not belong to any reported serotypes of BTV. Further studies of infectivity and pathogenicity showed that goats infected with V196/XJ/2014 did not exhibit observed clinical symptoms, but high level of virus amplification and homologous neutralization antibodies were detected post-infection. Our studies suggested a novel putative serotype of BTV-29 was isolated in Xinjiang of China, which expands our knowledge about the diversity of BTV.

TI  - Remote Sensing Method for Extracting Topographic Information on Tidal Flats Using Spatial Distribution Features
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - A remote sensing method combining remote sensing and ground surveying is proposed to extract tidal flat topographic information via the spatial distribution characteristics of tidal flat surface features. Based on the eastern Chongming beach of the Yangtze Estuary and Landsat-5 satellite images, this study identifies the spatial distribution characteristics of tidal flat features using field-based RTK data and spectral data. The remote sensing method for extracting the geometric and physical characteristics of linear and surface geographical elements on tidal flats and the elevation assignment method are discussed. The effectiveness of this method is verified by the quality of the resultant tidal flat DEM. The results show that the use of spatial distribution features in remote sensing images can provide rich topographic information. The DEM results have an accuracy of 0.16 m, are in line with the basic topographic patterns of tidal flats, and can describe local microscale geomorphic features. This technique solves the problem of a single topographic information source in current remote sensing measurement methods and provides technical support for detecting dynamic changes in coastal zones by using remote sensing technology.

TI  - Validation of non-linear split window algorithm for land surface temperature estimation using Sentinel-3 satellite imagery: Case study; Tehran Province, Iran
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, land surface temperature (LST) has become critical in environmental studies and earth science. Remote sensing technology enables spatiotemporal monitoring of this parameter on large scales. This parameter can be estimated by satellite images with at least one thermal band. Sentinel-3 SLSTR data provide LST products with a spatial resolution of 1 km. In this research, direct and indirect validation procedures were employed to evaluate the Sentinel-3 SLSTR LST products over the study area in different seasons from 2018 to 2019. The validation method was based on the absolute (direct) evaluation of this product with field data and comparison (indirect) evaluation with the MODIS LST product and the estimated LST using the non-linear split-window (NSW) algorithm. Also, two emissivity estimation methods, (1) NDVI thresholding method (NDVI-THM) and (2) classification-based emissivity method (CBEM), were used to estimate the LST using the NSW method according to the two thermal bands of Sentinel-3 images. Then, the accuracy of these methods in estimating LST was evaluated using field data and temporal changes of vegetation, which the NDVI-THM method generated better results. For indirect evaluation between the Sentinel-3 LST product, MODIS LST product, and LST estimated using NSW, four filters based on spatial and temporal separates between pairs of pixels and pixel quality were used to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the compared pairs of a pixel. In general, the accuracy results of the LST products of MODIS and Sentinel-3, and LST estimated using NSW showed a similar trend for LST changes during the seasons. With respect to the two absolute and comparative validations for the Sentinel-3 LST products, summer with the highest values of bias (-1.24 K), standard deviation (StDv = 2.66 K), and RMSE (2.43 K), and winter with the lowest ones (bias of 0.14 K, StDv of 1.13 K, and RMSE of 1.12 K) provided the worst and best results for the seasons in the period of 2018-2019, respectively. According to both absolute and comparative evaluation results, the Sentinel-3 SLSTR LST products provided reliable results for all seasons on a large temporal and spatial scale over our studied area.

TI  - Learning U-Net without forgetting for near real-time wildfire monitoring by the fusion of SAR and optical time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are increasing in intensity and frequency across the globe due to climate change and rising global temperature. Development of novel approach to Monitor wildfire progressions in near real-time is therefore of critical importance for emergency responses. The objective of this research is to investigate continuous learning with U-Net by exploiting both Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MSI time series for increasing the frequency and accuracy of wildfire progression mapping. In this study, optical-based burned areas prior to each SAR acquisition (when available) were accumulated into SAR-based pseudo progression masks to train a deep residual U-Net model. Unlike multi-temporal fusion of SAR and optical data, the temporal fusion of progression masks allows us to track as many wildfire progressions as possible. Specifically, two approaches were investigated to train the deep residual U-Net model for continuous learning: 1) Continuous joint training (CJT) with all historical data (including both SAR and optical data); 2) Learning without forgetting (LwF) based on newly incoming data alone (SAR or optical). For LwF, a mean squared loss was integrated to keep the capabilities learned before and prevent it from overfitting to newly incoming data only. By fusing optical-based burned areas, SAR-based progression pseudo masks improve significantly, which benefits both data sampling and model training, considering the challenges in SAR-based change extraction attributed to the variability in SAR backscatter of the surrounding environments. Pre-trained ResNet was frozen as the encoder of the U-Net model, and the decoder part was trained to further refine the derived burned area maps in a progression-wise manner. The experimental results demonstrated that LwF has the potential to match CJT in terms of the agreement between SAR-based results and optical-based ground truth, achieving a F1 score of 0.8423 on the Sydney Fire (2019-2020) and 0.7807 on the Chuckegg Creek Fire (2019). We also observed that the SAR cross-polarization ratio (VH/VV) shows good capability in suppressing multiplicative noise and detecting burned areas when VH and VV have diverse temporal behaviors.

TI  - Mapping alteration minerals in the Pulang porphyry copper ore district, SW China, using ASTER and WorldView-3 data: Implications for exploration targeting
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying alteration minerals of porphyry Cu deposits by using multispectral remote sensing data is a significant approach for ore prospecting. However, obtaining refined alteration information related to a porphyry Cu system is still challenging, especially in an area with complex geological background. In this study, the effectiveness of spectroscopic techniques for mapping alteration minerals associated with the Pulang porphyry copper deposit, SW China, which is located in high altitude and with tough terrain, were discussed by using ASTER and WorldView-3 data. The method of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) + Spectrum-Area (S-A) was developed to enhance the remote sensing information extraction of the alteration zones with quartz, sericite, chlorite and epidote. The results suggested that the extraction accuracy of porphyry alteration minerals based on WorldView3 data with the method of PCA + S-A is significantly improved comparing with that of ASTER data. Using the method, we identified a new alteration zone caused by sericite anomalies in the Pulang deposit, which was afterward confirmed by field investigation. Hence, the PCA + S-A method based on WorldView-3 data is an effective approach for mapping alteration zones and ore prospecting in the porphyry copper system.

TI  - Triple sulfur-oxygen-strontium isotopes probabilistic geographic assignment of archaeological remains using a novel sulfur isoscape of western Europe
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulfur isotope composition of organic tissues is a commonly used tool for gathering information about provenance and diet in archaeology and paleoecology. However, the lack of maps predicting sulfur isotope variations on the landscape limits the possibility to use this isotopic system in quantitative geographic assignments. We compiled a database of 2,680 sulfur isotope analyses in the collagen of archaeological human and animal teeth from 221 individual locations across Western Europe. We used this isotopic compilation and remote sensing data to apply a multivariate machine-learning regression, and to predict sulfur isotope variations across Western Europe. The resulting model shows that sulfur isotope patterns are highly predictable, with 65% of sulfur isotope variations explained using only 4 variables representing marine sulfate deposition and local geological conditions. We used this novel sulfur isoscape and existing strontium and oxygen isoscapes of Western Europe to apply triple isotopes continuous-surface probabilistic geographic assignments to assess the origin of a series of teeth from local animals and humans from Brittany. We accurately and precisely constrained the origin of these individuals to limited regions of Brittany. This approach is broadly transferable to studies in archaeology and paleoecology as illustrated in a companion paper (Colleter et al. 2021).

TI  - What drives daily precipitation over the central Amazon? Differences observed between wet and dry seasons
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study offers an alternative presentation regarding how diurnal precipitation is modulated by convective events that developed over the central Amazon during the preceding nighttime period. We use data collected during the Observations and Modelling of the Green Ocean Amazon (GoAmazon 2014/2015) field campaign that took place from 1 January 2014 to 30 November 2015 in the central Amazon. Local surface-based observations of cloud occurrence, soil temperature, surface fluxes, and planetary boundary layer characteristics are coupled with satellite data to identify the physical mechanisms that control the diurnal rainfall in central Amazon during the wet and dry seasons. This is accomplished through evaluation of the atmospheric properties during the nocturnal periods preceding raining and non-raining events. Comparisons between these non-raining and raining transitions are presented for the wet (January to April) and dry (June to September) seasons. The results suggest that wet-season diurnal precipitation is modulated by nighttime cloud coverage and local influences such as heating induced turbulence, whereas the dry-season rain events are controlled by large-scale circulations.

TI  - Hexachromatic bioinspired camera for image-guided cancer surgery
T2  - SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cancer affects one in three people worldwide. Surgery remains the primary curative option for localized cancers, but good prognoses require complete removal of primary tumors and timely recognition of metastases. To expand surgical capabilities and enhance patient outcomes, we developed a six-channel color/near-infrared image sensor inspired by the mantis shrimp visual system that enabled near-infrared fluorescence image guidance during surgery. The mantis shrimp's unique eye, which maximizes the number of photons contributing to and the amount of information contained in each glimpse of its surroundings, is recapitulated in our single-chip imaging system that integrates arrays of vertically stacked silicon photodetectors and pixelated spectral filters. To provide information about tumor location unavailable from a single instrument, we tuned three color channels to permit an intuitive perspective of the surgical procedure and three near-infrared channels to permit multifunctional imaging of optical probes highlighting cancerous tissue. In nude athymic mice bearing human prostate tumors, our image sensor enabled simultaneous detection of two tumor-targeted fluorophores, distinguishing diseased from healthy tissue in an estimated 92% of cases. It also permitted extraction of near-infrared structured illumination enabling the mapping of the three-dimensional topography of tumors and surgical sites to within 1.2-mm error. In the operating room, during surgical resection in 18 patients with breast cancer, our image sensor further enabled sentinel lymph node mapping using clinically approved near-infrared fluorophores. The flexibility and performance afforded by this simple and compact architecture highlights the benefits of biologically inspired sensors in image-guided surgery.

TI  - Effect of COVID-19 Anthropause on Water Clarity in the Belize Coastal Lagoon
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic halted human activities globally in multiple sectors including tourism. As a result, nations with heavy tourism, such as Belize, experienced improvements in water quality. Remote sensing technologies can detect impacts of ?anthropauses? on coastal water quality. In this study, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data were employed along the Belizean coast to investigate impacts of the COVID-19 shutdown on water quality. The attenuation coefficient at 490 nm, Kd(490), was used as an indicator of water quality, with a lower Kd(490) indicating increased water clarity. Four Coastal Management Zones were characterized by marine traffic as high traffic areas (HTAs) and two as low traffic areas (LTAs). Monthly composites for two periods, 2002?2019 (baseline) and 2020 were examined for Kd(490). For months prior to the COVID-19 shutdown in Belize, there was generally no significant difference in Kd(490) (p > 0.05) between 2020 and baseline period in HTAs and LTAs. Through the shutdown, Kd was lower in 2020 at HTAs, but not for LTAs. At the LTAs, the Kd(490)s observed in 2020 were similar to previous years through October. In November, an unusually active hurricane season in 2020 was associated with decreased water clarity along the entire coast of Belize. This study provides proof of concept that satellite-based monitoring of water quality can complement in situ data and provide evidence of significant water quality improvements due to the COVID-19 shutdown, likely due to reduced marine traffic. However, these improvements were no longer observed following an active hurricane season.

TI  - The impact of recent gully filling practices on wheat yield at the Campin∼a landscape in Southern Spain
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The significance of gully filling practices on agricultural production has been only rarely evaluated in literature. In this study, a medium-sized catchment was selected, for being representative of the conventional farming practices on annual crops in the Campin similar to a landscape in Southern Spain. During two wheat campaigns, an analysis of the spatial and temporal evolution of satellite-based vegetation indexes (NDVI, EVI and VH/VV radar polarization ratio) was conducted before and after gully filling practices associated to a rehabilitation project. The development of a linear model of topographic factors along with the calibration of a yield equation using a field survey allowed to determine the expected site-based productivities in the study area. The maximum EVI proved to be the best proxy for wheat yield in a location and was controlled mainly by rainfall and irradiation conditions. A significant yield reduction was found in the vicinity of those gullies affected by soil scraping within the rehabilitation project. Indirect yield losses in the productive land doubled the direct cost of unproductive areas caused by gullying and, when added up to the latter, between 15-25% of the expected yield was found to be lost. Although longer and broader studies are needed to confirm our results, this case study shows that current agricultural practices are not environmentally unsustainable but also economically detrimental. Moreover, it highlights that the impact assessment of gully erosion cannot only be circumscribed to the eroded area but the degradation of gully-adjacent locations must be also considered.

AB  - Climate change and the rapid expansion of the built environment have intensified heat stress worldwide. Due to environmental changes and urbanization, some studies show evidence of spatial and temporal changes in heat stress. The objective of this study is to apply spatial analysis to explore temporal and spatial changes in heat stress and to conduct a comparative analysis of land surface temperature (LST) and land use. The results show a significant expansion of the areas where the LST is over 35 ?C or between 30 ?C and 35 ?C. A comparative analysis between the expansion of areas with high LSTs and changing land use types shows that LSTs were indeed higher in 2014 than the values in 2008 and that LSTs remained relatively high in areas where the LST was over 35 ?C or between 30 ?C and 35 ?C. The temperature variation is not significant between urban and rural areas, indicating that heat stress has been extended toward particular rural areas. The cooling effect provided by open space is not significant, so city planners should exert more effort to mitigate extreme heat stress. As a whole, heat stress does change temporally and spatially, and the results of the comparative analysis could be further referenced in future efforts to improve the ability of areas to adapt to heat stress based on various land use patterns.

AB  - What is the status of travel medicine in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic? This article describes the evolution of travel medicine consultations at the University Hospital of Geneva with the introduction of pre-travel screening for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 9141 travelers were screened between August 2020 and January 2021 for various destinations, one third of which were intra-European. The various international restrictions led to the creation of thirteen separate medical certificates and a list of requirements for 150 countries updated weekly. A significant increase in positivity (up to 5%) in the asymptomatic traveler was associated with the months of October and November 2020 and with certain destinations. This rate of positivity in the asymptomatic traveler population could be a sentinel indicator of viral transmission in the community.

M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Lymphoma is a health outcome of interest for drug safety studies. Studies using administrative claims data require the accurate identification of lymphoma cases. We developed and validated an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)-based algorithm to identify lymphoma in healthcare claims data.Methods We developed a three-component algorithm to identify patients aged >= 15 years who were newly diagnosed with Hodgkin (HL) or non-Hodgkin (NHL) lymphoma from January 2016 through July 2018 among members of four Data Partners within the FDA's Sentinel System. The algorithm identified potential cases as patients with >= 2 ICD-10-CM lymphoma diagnosis codes on different dates within 183 days; >= 1 procedure code for a diagnostic procedure (e.g., biopsy, flow cytometry) and >= 1 procedure code for a relevant imaging study within 90 days of the first lymphoma diagnosis code. Cases identified by the algorithm were adjudicated via chart review and a positive predictive value (PPV) was calculated.Results We identified 8723 potential lymphoma cases via the algorithm and randomly sampled 213 for validation. We retrieved 138 charts (65%) and adjudicated 134 (63%). The overall PPV was 77% (95% confidence interval: 69%-84%). Most cases also had subtype information available, with 88% of cases identified as NHL and 11% as HL.Conclusions Seventy-seven percent of lymphoma cases identified by an algorithm based on ICD-10-CM diagnosis and procedure codes and applied to claims data were true cases. This novel algorithm represents an efficient, cost-effective way to target an important health outcome of interest for large-scale drug safety and public health surveillance studies.

TI  - Land cover and vegetation carbon stock changes in Greece: A 29-year assessment based on CORINE and Landsat land cover data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation of carbon sequestration in various land cover types is a valuable tool for environmental policies targeting towards minimization of CO2 emissions and climate change impacts. For the past few decades, remotely sensed information on land cover has been used as useful alternative to ground observations and has proved to be a robust tool for studying land use i land cover (LULC) changes. The present work deals with the assessment of land-cover changes in a Mediterranean country - Greece, where expected climate change impacts and desertification risk are stated to be severe. This work focused on the CORINE land cover inventory at a spatial resolution of 100 m from 1990 to 2018 and selected Landsat images at 30 m spatial resolution for 1990, 2000 and 2018. Results indicated that the dominant land-cover changes in Greece over the predefined 29-year period, are related to land transformation from Non-irrigated arable land to Irrigated areas, implying an intensification of agricultural practices. Natural grasslands lose a substantial part of their areas transforming into Sclerophyllus vegetation and Sparsely vegetated areas. Forests gain areas from Transitional woodland-shrub and Olive groves increase their extent indicating an overall transition to woody vegetation. Estimation of Vegetation Carbon Stocks indicated a moderate decrease in the 1990 decade followed by a significant increase up to 2012 and a slight decrease thereafter. Forests of all types are by far the most important carbon sinks. Possible implications of country's recent economic crisis were examined and results indicated that economic welfare of the country seems to favor certain land cover types such as Mixed Forests and Permanently Irrigated land, but also preservation of the Vegetation Carbon Stocks.

TI  - Improving the efficiency and accuracy of evaluating Aridland riparian habitat restoration using unmanned aerial vehicles
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer new opportunities for accurate, repeatable vegetation assessments, which are needed to adaptively manage restored habitat. We used UAVs, ground surveys, and satellite imagery to evaluate vegetation metrics for three riparian restoration sites along the Colorado River in Mexico and we compared the data accuracy and efficiency (cost and time requirements) between the three methods. We used an off-the-shelf UAV coupled with a multispectral sensor to determine Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and vegetation cover. We were unable to accurately classify vegetation by individual species, but by grouping riparian species of interest (cottonwood-willow, mesquite, shrubs), we achieved high overall model accuracies of 87-96% across sites (Kappa = 0.82-0.95). Producer's and user's accuracies were moderate to high for target vegetation classes (69-100%). UAV and ground-survey vegetation percent cover differed due to differences in methodologies (UAVs measure aerial cover; ground surveys measure foliar cover) and sources of error for each method. Correlations between UAV and ground survey vegetation cover were moderate (rs(90) = 0.24-0.58, p < 0.05). UAV NDVI (0.50-0.61) was significantly higher than Landsat NDVI (0.40-0.45) for all sites (p < 0.0001), likely due to presence of shadows with high NDVI values in UAV imagery. UAV NDVI, Landsat NDVI and UAV total vegetation cover were strongly correlated (rs(90) = 0.72-0.85, p < 0.05). UAV surveys were more labor- and cost- intensive than ground surveys in the first year, but were slightly less so in the second year. We conclude that UAVs can provide efficient, accurate assessments of riparian vegetation, which can be used in restoration site management. Due to UAV limitations to assess vegetation in a multi-layered canopy and inability to classify individual riparian species with similar spectral signals, we recommend a combined approach of UAV and ground surveys.

TI  - Variance of vegetation coverage and its sensitivity to climatic factors in the Irtysh River basin
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Climate change is an important factor driving vegetation changes in arid areas. Identifying the sensitivity of vegetation to climate variability is crucial for developing sustainable ecosystem management strategies. The Irtysh River is located in the westerly partition of China, and its vegetation cover is more sensitive to climate change. However, previous studies rarely studied the changes in the vegetation coverage of the Irtysh River and its sensitivity to climate factors from a spatiotemporal perspective.Methods. We adopted a vegetation sensitivity index based on remote sensing datasets of high temporal resolution to study the sensitivity of vegetation to climatic factors in the Irtysh River basin, then reveal the driving mechanism of vegetation cover change.Results. The results show that 88.09% of vegetated pixels show an increasing trend in vegetation coverage, and the sensitivity of vegetation to climate change presents spatial heterogeneity. Sensitivity of vegetation increases with the increase of coverage. Temperate steppe in the northern mountain and herbaceous swamp and broadleaf forest in the river valley, where the normalized difference vegetation index is the highest, show the strongest sensitivity, while the desert steppe in the northern plain, where the NDVI is the lowest, shows the strongest memory effect (or the strongest resilience). Relatively, the northern part of this area is more affected by a combination of precipitation and temperature, while the southern plains dominated by desert steppe are more sensitive to precipitation. The central river valley dominated by herbaceous swamp is more sensitive to temperature-vegetation dryness index. This study underscores that the sensitivity of vegetation cover to climate change is spatially differentiated at the regional scale.

TI  - How worldview and personal values can shape conservation conflict-The case of captive-bred lions
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation debates, fuelled by social media, are becoming increasingly polarised, especially where animal conservation and welfare are concerned. This study reveals how the 'evidence-based approach' founded on scientific knowledge and consensus-building can be insufficient when addressing conflicts that are driven by deeply held and opposing belief systems about nature, wildlife and their exploitation. Using targeted semistructured interviews grounded in inductive approaches, we unveil core attitudes and viewpoints of captive lion breeders in South Africa and compare them to those of key-informants from science and governance arenas. Further, we demonstrate how the value-systems and worldviews of stakeholders influence their interpretations of scientific knowledge when assessing the conservation value of captive-bred lions. Since polarised conflicts are frequent in conservation, the insights of this study highlight the need to create a deeper understanding of the social-psychological perspective of all main stakeholders to prepare the foundation for solution-building processes and evidence-based decision-making.

TI  - An automatic approach for detecting building fences from high-resolution images: the case study of Makkah, Saudi Arabia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOW-CARBON TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the light of the constantly expanding technological advancements concerning high-resolution satellites and imaging techniques for investigative and information uses it is important to look at how these algorithms progress to acquire more reliable data in a much efficient manner. This study aims to (1) investigate the ability to use remote sensing and geographic information system techniques to extract the detecting building edges in the City of Makkah and (2) investigate new machine learning techniques to derive the illegal building fences in the study area. Two WorldView-3 images will be the first obtained for the City of Makkah in 2016 and 2018. Convolutional neural networks algorithm will be investigated to detect all the fences within the two images. These traits have been utilized to create automated object detection techniques, which are a core requirement of information extraction and large frame analysis of images covering large expanses of land. In high-resolution images, object detection identifies objects belonging to a class, locating them using a bounding box. Based on satellite images time series, the outputs will detect the changes that occurred during 2016 and 2018. A web map application will be designed as the primary tool to make it easier, illustrating the differences between the main changes. Evaluation of binary classifiers approach will be used to evaluate the outcomes of building fences based on several performances that measure data interpretation. Preliminary findings will illustrate the precision and accuracy of the used machine learning algorithm. The research findings can contribute to the federal/municipal authorities and act as a generic indicator for targeting building fences for urban areas and/or suburban areas.

TI  - Glacier detachments and rock-ice avalanches in the Petra Pervogo range, Tajikistan (1973-2019)
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier detachments are a rare, but hazardous, phenomenon of glacier instability, whereof only a handful have been documented to date. Common to all known cases is that many million cubic meters of ice detached from the bed of relatively low-angle valley glaciers and turned into long-runout mass flows. Recently, two such detachments were observed in the Petra Pervogo range in Tajikistan. Using a variety of satellite imagery, including Landsat 1-8, Sentinel-2, ASTER, TanDEM-X, WorldView, and Keyhole, we characterized these events and identified in total 17 mass flows involving glacier ice (detachments, ice, and rock-ice avalanches; rock avalanches falling on glaciers) that clustered in four different catchments between 1973 and 2019. The runout distances range from 2 to 19 km, and the largest detached glacier volume was 8.8 x 10(6) m(3). A total of 11 out of 13 detachments, ice, or rock-ice avalanches occurred between July and September in years with mean annual air temperatures above the trend of the past 46 years. The relatively large number of locally clustered events indicates that the Petra Pervogo range has particularly favorable conditions for glacier instabilities. The images and geology of the region suggest that easily erodible lithologies are widespread. These soft lithologies may be also one reason for the high density of surging glaciers in the Petra Pervogo range and the wider Pamir region. We conclude that high temperatures, combined with soft, fine-grained sediments, may increase the likelihood of mass wasting events and appear to be critical factors facilitating the detachment of entire valley glaciers, whereas such events appear to be relatively robust against earthquakes for our study area. The observed recurrence of mass wasting events make the Petra Pervogo range a potential candidate to witness glacier detachments by field studies.

TI  - Spring and autumn phenology across the Tibetan Plateau inferred from normalized difference vegetation index and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant phenology is a key parameter for accurately modeling ecosystem dynamics. Limited by scarce ground observations and benefiting from the rapid growth of satellite-based Earth observations, satellite data have been widely used for broad-scale phenology studies. Commonly used reflectance vegetation indices represent the emergence and senescence of photosynthetic structures (leaves), but not necessarily that of photosynthetic activities. Leveraging data of the recently emerging solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) that is directly related to photosynthesis, and the traditional MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), we investigated the similarities and differences on the start and end of the growing season (SOS and EOS, respectively) of the Tibetan Plateau. We found similar spatiotemporal patterns in SIF-based SOS (SOSSIF) and NDVI-based SOS (SOSNDVI). These spatial patterns were mainly driven by temperature in the east and by precipitation in the west. Yet the two satellite products produced different spatial patterns in EOS, likely due to their different climate dependencies. Our work demonstrates the value of big Earth data for discovering broad-scale spatiotemporal patterns, especially on regions with scarce field data. This study provides insights into extending the definition of phenology and fosters a deeper understanding of ecosystem dynamics from big data.

TI  - Mechanisms of breast cancer metastasis
T2  - CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS
M3  - Review
AB  - Invasive breast cancer tends to metastasize to lymph nodes and systemic sites. The management of metastasis has evolved by focusing on controlling the growth of the disease in the breast/chest wall, and at metastatic sites, initially by surgery alone, then by a combination of surgery with radiation, and later by adding systemic treatments in the form of chemotherapy, hormone manipulation, targeted therapy, immunotherapy and other treatments aimed at inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells. It would be valuable for us to know how breast cancer metastasizes; such knowledge would likely encourage the development of therapies that focus on mechanisms of metastasis and might even allow us to avoid toxic therapies that are currently used for this disease. For example, if we had a drug that targeted a gene that is critical for metastasis, we might even be able to cure a vast majority of patients with breast cancer. By bringing together scientists with expertise in molecular aspects of breast cancer metastasis, and those with expertise in the mechanical aspects of metastasis, this paper probes interesting aspects of the metastasis cascade, further enlightening us in our efforts to improve the outcome from breast cancer treatments.

TI  - Seasonal to decadal scale shoreline changes along the Cameroonian coastline, Bay of Bonny (1986 to 2020)
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bay of Bonny, located along the Cameroon coastline, is home to diverse ecosystems. It is under significant pressure from large human activity, but remains very little studied, like much of the Gulf of Guinea. In order to understand its long-term shoreline variations and the role the wave regime plays in the evolution of the coastline, a study was conducted on the basis of optical image archives from Landsat 5/7/8 and Sentinel-2A/2B satellite missions acquired between October 1986 and May 2020, coupled with daily ERA-Interim wave re-analysis data covering the period from January 1986 to August 2019. Overall, the results show that the evolution of the coast is highly variable in space and time, as indicated by different levels of erosion (30.55 %), and accretion (27.7 %) on the decadal-scale, with the most significant variations occurring in estuarine areas. Nevertheless, 41.75% of the Cameroon shoreline remains stable during the study period. Three main periods (1986-1994; 1995-2005; 2006-2020) during which the coast underwent significant changes a different location were identified, reaching a retreat rate of up to -10 m/year in the northern section during the first period 1986-1994. The annual trend of significant wave heights anomaly along the coast (-5.6 to -4.1 mm/year) with wave height maxima estimated at 1.46 +/- 0.65 m, where observed during the summer months (July-August). Monthly shoreline changes are inversely correlated with wave climate in some segments. Eigenvalue orthogonal decomposition analyses (Mode 1, Empirical Orthogonal Function) show that 76.3% of the observed variability would be due to the relatively strong local influence of erosion and accretion. This local influence can be related to wave regime at shorter timescale (monthly to seasonal) and the sediment variability from the source inland to the coast at longer timescale (seasonal to decadal). These observations explain a complex pattern of shoreline changes with an almost continuous retreat shoreline during the period 1986-2013 and a reversal in trend towards accretion during the period 2013-2020. EOF mode 2 explains 23.7% of variability, which can be potentially associated with the synergetic relationship between tidal currents and wave-induced longshore current, tidal currents and possibly pockets of human activity. This is attributed to an overall decrease in the supply of sediment via the coastal transport system that prevails in the Gulf of Guinea. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing the utility of using current generation high-resolution satellites (Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8) to monitor large water supply dam in South Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Vaal Dam is one of the largest impounded water resources in South Africa with a capacity of 2330 x 10(6) m(3) and surface area of 321.07 km(2). The Dam is part of the Vaal river system with a catchment area of about 37 100 km(2) and is designed to supply water to the large metropolitan city of Johannesburg in the north and the surrounding areas in the Gauteng Province serving approximately 13 million people. The Dam is biologically productive and experiences frequent algal blooms especially during summer months (February to April). Recent studies have indicated the presence of toxic cyanobacteria genera such as Anabaena, Lyngbya, and Microcystis and these can be of great concern for ecosystem health as well as biodiversity. Currently, ground-based methods are employed to assess and monitor the water quality of the Dam. This method is costly and lacks the temporal and spatial resolution. Therefore, a more efficient observation tools are required for effective monitoring. Satellite remote sensing is an efficient tool that can allow accurate and timely detection of harmful algal blooms (HABs) such as the toxic cyanobacteria genera and other algal types. This study focuses on assessing the utility of using current generation Satellites (Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8) to characterize the water quality and estimate concentrations of chlorophyll a as a proxy for HABs and the total suspended matter (TSM). The optimal correlation between in-situ and chlorophyll a retrieved from blue-green band ratio of Landsat 8 [Rrs (560)/Rrs (443)], and red/NIR of Sentinel 2 [Rrs (705)/Rrs (665)] were found to be the best indices for Chl-a retrieval in the Vaal Dam. Results for Landsat OLI dataset (R-2 = 0.89; RMSE = 0.36 mu g/L, P < 0.05) and Sentinel MSI dataset (R-2 = 0.75; RMSE = 0.48 mu g/L, P < 0.05) show high degree of accuracy. Models developed in this study will significantly improve near-real time and long-term water quality monitoring of the Vaal Dam and will effectively help to address public health issues related to water quality.

TI  - Achieving High Poliovirus Antibody Seroprevalence in Areas at Risk of Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus Transmission-Niger Experience
T2  - OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Outbreaks of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) continue to expand across Africa. We conducted a serological survey of polio antibodies in high-polio risk areas of Niger to assess risk of poliovirus outbreaks.Methods. Children between 1 and 5 years of age were enrolled from structures randomly selected using satellite imaging enumeration in Diffa Province, Niger, in July 2019. After obtaining informed consent, dried blood spot cards were collected. Neutralizing antibodies against 3 poliovirus serotypes were detected using microneutralization assay at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Results. We obtained analyzable data from 309/322 (95.9%) enrolled children. Seroprevalence of polio antibodies was 290/309 (93.9%), 272/309 (88.0%), and 254/309 (82.2%) for serotypes 1, 2, and 3, respectively. For serotypes 1 and 2, the seroprevalence did not significantly change with age (P=.09 and P=.44, respectively); for serotype 3, it increased with age (from 65% in 1-2-year-olds to 91.1% in 4-5-year olds; P<.001). We did not identify any risk factors for type 2 seronegativity.Conclusions. With type 2 seroprevalence close to 90%, the risk of emergence of new cVDPV2 outbreaks in Niger is low; however, the risk of cVDPV2 importations from neighboring countries leading to local transmission persists. Niger should maintain its outbreak response readiness capacity and further strengthen its routine immunization.

TI  - Clear-sky land surface upward longwave radiation dataset derived from the ABI onboard the GOES-16 satellite
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Surface upward longwave radiation (SULR) is one of the four components of the surface radiation budget, which is defined as the total surface upward radiative flux in the spectral domain of 4-100 mu m. The SULR is an indicator of surface thermal conditions and greatly impacts weather, climate, and phenology. Big Earth data derived from satellite remote sensing have been an important tool for studying earth science. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-16) has greatly improved temporal and spectral resolution compared to the imager sensor of the previous GOES series and is a good data source for the generation of high spatiotemporal resolution SULR. In this study, based on the hybrid SULR estimation method and an upper hemisphere correction method for the SULR dataset, we developed a regional clear-sky land SULR dataset for GOES-16 with a half-hourly resolution for the period from 1st January 2018 to 30th June 2020. The dataset was validated against surface measurements collected at 65 Ameriflux radiation network sites. Compared with the SULR dataset of the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) longwave radiation product that is generated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the polar-orbiting Terra and Aqua satellites, the ABI/GOES-16 SULR dataset has commensurate accuracy (an RMSE of 15.9 W/m(2) vs 19.02 W/m(2) and an MBE of -4.4 W/m(2) vs -2.57 W/m(2)), coarser spatial resolution (2 km at nadir vs 1 km resolution), less spatial coverage (most of the Americas vs global), fewer weather conditions (clear-sky vs all-weather conditions) and a greatly improved temporal resolution (48 vs 4 observations a day). The published data are available at http://www.dx.doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.j00076.00062.

TI  - Evaluating the influence of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on Jordan Badia rangelands
T2  - ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore the effect of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on vegetation cover changes in Northern, Middle, and Eastern Jordan Badia rangelands, Landsat-8 (Operational Land Imager [OLI]) images were downloaded and processed to attain surface reflectance data for March and July 2018-2020. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was then derived from OLI-images, where the total area covered with water, bare soil, scattered vegetation, dense grasses and shrubs, and dense forests were estimated. Across the study period, 2019 had the highest rainfall (195 mm) and temperature (21.7 degrees C), while the lowest rainfall was recorded in 2018 (154 mm). The Northern Badia showed a consistently larger area of dense vegetation on average (407.4 km(2)) compared to the Eastern (149.3km(2)), and Middle (55.2 km(2)) Badia. The total area covered with scattered vegetation in 2020 was higher than in 2019 and 2018 across the years and studied area, except in Middle Badia. Vegetation cover classes were inconsistent for Middle Badia in March, scattered vegetation was higher in 2019 compared to 2020. However, the total area covered with vegetation in July was lower than in March across the years and studied area. The curfew allowed the regeneration of shrubs and grasses in the study area, which helped in restoring the rangeland vegetation. COVID-19 lockdown served as a conservation grazing technique and provided a real case of restoring the degraded rangeland cover through managed grazing.

AB  - I argue that philosophers of religion should not merely focus on religions but should pay much more attention to the secular outlooks on life emerging in contemporary society. To compare these outlooks, I suggest that we use the notion of worldview, and contrast religious worldviews with secular worldviews - rather than contrasting religions with nonreligions, which scholars of religion have recently tended to do. Accordingly, religious people should be contrasted with secular people and not with religious 'nones'. I also explore the specific contribution of philosophy of religion to worldviews studies, and discuss why such a contribution is considered controversial within religious studies circles. I contend that it should instead be a legitimate and essential part of the academic study of worldviews.

TI  - Real-Time <i>In Situ</i> Navigation System With Indocyanine Green Fluorescence for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients With Breast Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe naked-eye invisibility of indocyanine green fluorescence limits the application of near-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIR) systems for real-time navigation during sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with breast cancer undergoing surgery. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a novel NIR system in visualizing indocyanine green fluorescence images in the surgical field and the application value of combined methylene blue (MB) and the novel NIR system in SLNB.MethodsSixty patients with clinical node-negative breast cancer received indocyanine green (ICG) and MB as tracers. Two NIR system instruments, namely, lymphatic fluorescence imaging system (LFIS) designed by the University of Science and Technology of China and vascular imager by Langfang Mingde Medical Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Langfang vascular imager), were used as navigation assistance to locate sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Excising the lymph nodes developed by both MB and ICG by two NIR systems or palpably suspicious as SLNs and undergoing rapid pathological examination.ResultsBoth instruments exhibited 95% (57/60) success for real-time lymphatic fluorescent images. A total of 186 SLNs were identified, of which two were pathologically confirmed as lacking any lymph node tissue. SLN identification rate was 100% (184/184) for MB plus LFIS and 86.96% (160/184) for MB alone. The median number of SLNs identified by LFIS combined with MB was 3 (range of 1-8), which was significantly higher than that by MB alone at 2 (range 1-7) (P<0.05).ConclusionLFIS effectively detects SLNs in breast cancer, projects the fluorescence signals during surgery, and provides a continuous surgical navigation system without the need for a remote monitor. The ICG method navigated by combined LFIS and MB may be a promising alternative tracer for radioisotope in SLN mapping.

TI  - Number and nest-site selection of breeding black-necked cranes over the past 40 years in the Longbao Wetland Nature Reserve, Qinghai, China
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Black-necked crane (Grus nigricollis, BNC), facing serious threats from human activities and habitat variations, is an endangered species classified as vulnerable under the revised IUCN Red List. In this article, we investigated and analyzed the population and nesting microhabitat of BNCs in the Longbao National Nature Reserve (NNR) from 1978 to 2016, and found the number of BNCs increased from 24 in 1978 to 216 in 2016. This establishment of the Longbao NNR represented the activities of protecting endangered animal species are effective. However, the land cover classification results of Landsat images showed that the marsh wetland, which was the BNC's primary habitat, decreased during 1978-2016, while artificial buildings increased, which affected the habitat of BNCs. The increase in average temperature over the past 40 years has also had an impact on the number of BNCs. BNCs preferred to nest in marsh wetlands or on islands with open water or star-like distributions through observation. The results of the principal component analysis showed that the nearest distance between nests and habitat type were the primary factors influencing nesting site selection. To protect BNC, we suggest decreasing wetland fragmentation, reducing habitat degradation and providing an undisturbed habitat.

TI  - Sebaceous carcinoma of the vulva treated with sentinel lymph node biopsy: a case report and literature review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CANCER CONFERENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Sebaceous carcinoma (SC) is a rare and aggressive cutaneous malignancy. It often occurs on the eyelid, where it is called periocular SC, while extraocular SC mainly occurs on the head and heck. Extraocular vulvar SC is extremely rare; only nine cases have been described in the literature, and the optimal treatment strategy is unknown. We herein report a case of vulvar SC that was successfully treated with local excision in combination with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB). A 66-year-old female presented with vulvar discomfort. An 8 mm ulcerated mass was palpable in her left labia minora. Skin biopsy suggested SC. Imaging showed no swelling of the pelvic and inguinal lymph nodes and no metastasis. Sentinel lymph node scintigraphy using technetium-99 m showed three sentinel lymph nodes. The patient underwent local excision with SNB; intraoperative frozen-section examination revealed no nodal metastasis, and no further inguinal lymphadenectomy was performed. The final diagnosis was SC of the vulva, FIGO stage IB (pT1bN0M0). At the 14-month follow-up, she remained asymptomatic and had no signs of recurrence. The scientific rationale for SNB in extraocular SC has not yet been established, although SNB can be considered for periocular SC. However, considering the insufficient data on the management of vulvar SC and the aggressive nature of both periocular and extraocular SCs, SNB can be a reasonable and useful method for avoiding inadequate treatment and reducing the complications caused by unnecessary inguinal lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Assessing land surface phenology of the savanna ecosystem in Southeast Asia using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) leaf area index from 2002 to 2020
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The sustainability of the global savanna ecosystem is currently under threat from climate and anthropological change. Despite the immense threats, the existence of the savanna ecosystem is undervalued and understudied. This study examined the dynamics of the savanna ecosystem in the southern part of Southeast Asia (SEA) using MODIS leaf area index (LAI) data (MOD15A3H) with 500-m spatial resolution and 4-day data, from 2002 to 2020. The annual phenological metrics comprising the start of season (SOS), end of season (EOS), length of season (LOS), rate of greening, rate of browning, and the maximum peak values were derived from the daily interpolated data using the spline function. Additional oscillation and trend analysis using empirical ensemble decomposition methods (EEMD) was conducted to derive the nonlinear trend dynamics of the savanna ecosystem in East Nusa Tenggara (ENT). We found that the SOS at the Savanna ecosystem in SEA is 253.76 +/- 2.1 days, the EOS is 161.12 +/- 4.0 days, and the average LOS is 170.68 +/- 6.5 days. The rainfall variabilities can explain around 35% of the variability in the LAI of the savanna ecosystem. Our EEMD analysis captured the decreasing LAI trend, showing a net change between 2002 and 2015 from 1.08 LAI units (scale of 10(-2)) to - 0.17 LAI units (scale of 10(-2)) from 2015 onwards. The result indicated a declining trend of LAI values of savanna ecosystem in ENT, thus requiring further monitoring to ensure the sustainability of this ecosystem.

TI  - Deriving Planform Morphology and Vegetation Coverage From Remote Sensing to Support River Management Applications
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing availability of big geospatial data (e.g., multi-spectral satellite imagery) and access to platforms that support multi-temporal analyses (e.g., cloud-based computing, Geographical Information Systems, GIS), the use of remotely sensed information for monitoring riverine hydro-morpho-biodynamics is growing. Opportunities to map, quantify and detect changes in the wider riverscape (i.e., water, sediment and vegetation) at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution can support flood risk and river management applications. Focusing on a reach of the Po River (Italy), satellite imagery from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 for the period 1988-2018 were analyzed in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to investigate changes in river planform morphology and vegetation dynamics associated with transient hydrology. An improved understanding of these correlations can help in managing sediment transport and riparian vegetation to reduce flood risk, where biogeomorphic processes are commonly overlooked in flood risk mapping. In the study, two established indices were analyzed: the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) for monitoring changes in the wetted river planform morphology, inferring information about sediment dynamics, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for evaluating changes in vegetation coverage. Results suggest that planform changes are highly localized with most parts of the reach remaining stable. Using the wetted channel occurrence as a measure of planform stability, almost two-thirds of the wetted channel extent (total area = 86.4 km(2)) had an occurrence frequency >90% (indicating stability). A loss of planform complexity coincided with the position of former secondary channels, or zones where the active river channel had narrowed. Time series analysis of vegetation dynamics showed that NDVI maxima were recorded in May/June and coincided with the first peak in the hydrological regime (occurring in late spring and associated with snowmelt). Seasonal variation in vegetation coverage is potentially important for local hydrodynamics, influencing flood risk. We suggest that remotely sensed information can provide river scientists with new insights to support the management of highly anthropized watercourses.

TI  - Recent greening of grasslands in northern China driven by increasing precipitation
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Recent warmer and wetter climate in northern China remains a hot topic in recent years, yet its effect on vegetation growth has not been fully understood. This study investigated the temporal change of vegetation cover and its correlations with climatic variables from 1982 to 2018 for grasslands in northern China. Our aim is to clarify whether the warmer and wetter climate in recent years drives the greening of the vegetation in this region.Methods We investigated the temporal dynamic of vegetation normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and its driving forces based on long time-series data. Piecewise regression was used to examine whether there was a turning point of the trend of NDVI and climatic variables. Pearson correlation analyses were conducted to quantify the relationship between NDVI and climatic factors. Stepwise multivariable regression was used to quantify the contributions of climate variables to the temporal variations in NDVI.Important Findings We found a turning point of NDVI trend in 2008, with GIMMS NDVI indicating a slight increase of 0.00022 yr(-1) during 1982-2008 to an increase of 0.002 yr(-1) for GIMMS NDVI during 2008-2015 and 0.0018 yr(-1) for MODIS NDVI during 2008-2018. Precipitation was the predominant driver, and air temperature and vapor pressure deficit exerted a minor impact on the temporal dynamics of NDVI. Overall, our results suggest a turning point of NDVI trend, and that recent warmer and wetter climate has caused vegetation greening, which provides insights for better predicting the vegetation cover in this region under changing climate.

TI  - Impact of Grazing Intensity on Soil Properties in Teltele Rangeland, Ethiopia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Grazing intensity (GI) is a major determining factor that controls the functioning of rangelands and the overall nutrient cycle. The Teltele rangeland is used for communal grazing area by the local pastorals; however, to date, there is no documented study data about the impact of GI. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of grazing intensity on selected soil properties in the Teltele rangeland, Ethiopia. Soil samples were collected from different GI sites using different elevation gradient and soil depth from both open grazing and bush-encroached grazing land sand-assessed soil properties. Grazing intensity, elevation, and soil depth significantly (p < 0.05) affected both soils' physical and chemical properties but rangeland types had no significant effect. The correlation analysis of soil characteristics with the principal component analysis axes showed significant variation. The highly weighted and correlated properties under principal component 1 (PC1) were electrical conductivity, organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and potassium, and under principal component 2, sand and bulk density with equal loaded value (r = -0.998), clay and silt, with silt (0.962) a more loaded one. Soil pH (0.743) demonstrated a significant (p < 0.05) positive correlation with sodium (-0.960) at PC1 (r = 0.610). Based on our results, we recommend further model-based studies on spatial-temporal change of soil properties due to impact of grazing intensity, combined with GIS and remote sensing data to be developed for sustainable rangeland management.

TI  - Version 4 CALIPSO Imaging Infrared Radiometer ice and liquid water cloud microphysical properties - Part II: Results over oceans
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Following the release of the version 4 Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) data products from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) mission, a new version 4 (V4) of the CALIPSO Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR) Level 2 data products has been developed. The IIR Level 2 data products include cloud effective emissivities and cloud microphysical properties such as effective diameter (D-e) and water path estimates for ice and liquid clouds. This paper (Part II) shows retrievals over ocean and describes the improvements made with respect to version 3 (V3) as a result of the significant changes implemented in the V4 algorithms, which are presented in a companion paper (Part I). The analysis of the three-channel IIR observations (08.65, 10.6, and 12.05 mu m) is informed by the scene classification provided in the V4 CALIOP 5 km cloud layer and aerosol layer products. Thanks to the reduction of inter-channel effective emissivity biases in semi-transparent (ST) clouds when the oceanic background radiance is derived from model computations, the number of unbiased emissivity retrievals is increased by a factor of 3 in V4. In V3, these biases caused inconsistencies between the effective diameters retrieved from the 12/10 (beta(eff)12/10 = tau(a),12/tau(a,10)) and 12/08 (beta(eff)12/08 = tau(a),12/tau(a,08)) pairs of channels at emissivities smaller than 0.5. In V4, microphysical retrievals in ST ice clouds are possible in more than 80% of the pixels down to effective emissivities of 0.05 (or visible optical depth similar to 0.1). For the month of January 2008, which was chosen to illustrate the results, median ice D-e and ice water path (IWP) are, respectively, 38 mu m and 3 g m(-2) in ST clouds, with random uncertainty estimates of 50 %. The relationship between the V4 IIR 12/10 and 12/08 microphysical indices is in better agreement with the "severely roughened single column" ice habit model than with the "severely roughened eight-element aggregate" model for 80% of the pixels in the coldest clouds (<210 K) and 60% in the warmest clouds (>230 K). Retrievals in opaque ice clouds are improved in V4, especially at night and for 12/10 pair of channels, due to corrections of the V3 radiative temperature estimates derived from CALIOP geometric altitudes. Median ice D-e and IWP are 58 mu m and 97 g m(-2) at night in opaque clouds, with again random uncertainty estimates of 50 %. Comparisons of ice retrievals with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Aqua in the tropics show a better agreement of IIR D-e with MODIS visible-3.7 mu m than with MODIS visible-2.1 mu m in the coldest ST clouds and the opposite for opaque clouds. In prevailingly supercooled liquid water clouds with centroid altitudes above 4 km, retrieved median D-e and liquid water path are 13 mu m and 3.4 g m(-2) in ST clouds, with estimated random uncertainties of 45% and 35 %, respectively. In opaque liquid clouds, these values are 18 mu m and 31 g m(-2) at night, with estimated uncertainties of 50 %. IIR D-e in opaque liquid clouds is smaller than MODIS visible-2.1 mu m and visible-3.7 mu m by 8 and 3 mu m, respectively.

TI  - The smokescreen of Russian protected areas
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Russian forests preserve biodiversity, host endemic species, store carbon, and are inhabited by indigenous people. However, in the last years, large areas of these forests have been damaged by different factors, mainly by logging and fires. This led to important tree loss even in protected areas. Despite it, no previous comprehensive research has been conducted to understand the trends and the causes of this tree loss. This study aims to investigate how Russian protected areas effectively contribute to nature conservation and can reduce forest loss within their borders. For the first time, we analysed the longest time-series available (2001-2018) of tree loss and fires in 201 Russian protected areas (those with the highest protection level). Studying the temporal trends of forest loss, we hypothesized that uncontrolled wildfire should result as the main cause of the forest loss expected within the highest protection areas of Russia and that logging and other anthropogenic activities - because prohibited in these areas - should be a minor threat. Instead, from Earth Observation datasets, we detected that even in the 201 areas with the highest protection, more than 2Mha of forests have been lost between 2001 and 2018. Fire contributed about 25% to this loss but was not the major driver. From a year-by-year analysis of the time series, we were able to disentangle the potential contribution of "other-than-fire" causes of loss. We found that, in 15 out of 18 years of our time series, causes not due to fire were the main driver of tree loss in these strictly protected areas, which reached a peak recently, between 2013 and 2018. Overall, of the 201 strictly protected areas in Russia, 135 experienced tree loss between 2001 and 2018. In 34 of them, the loss was higher than 10,000 ha, where a major percentage was attributable to fire only in 3 sites. In the other 31 protected areas, fire contributed to the total forest loss less than 50%. Our analysis also showed that five strictly protected areas experienced a massive tree loss (> 100kha) from 2001 to 2018. Among them, Lake Baikal, a World Heritage site, suffered an astonishing forest loss of 485 k ha, whose only 21% may be attributed to fire. Considering that we discovered that most of the causes of forest loss may be related to human activities, the situation could be con-trolled through better management and policy.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on ground-based airglow observations over India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Airglow emissions which originate from the mesospheric and thermospheric altitudes have been routinely being monitored at Kolhapur (16.8 degrees N, 74.2 degrees E), Maharashtra, India, using ground base remote sensing imagers. We note that the observable amplitudes of very small-scale waves during April 2020 were significantly smaller than the regular observations. We investigate the reason for these low observable amplitudes. It is noted that drastic improvement in the quality of images was due to better contrast, which is attributed to significant reduction in greenhouse gases and aerosol loading in the atmosphere by the complete shutdown of local man-made emissions. Results suggest that lockdown had an important repercussion on the visibility through the improved air quality and thus better viewing conditions, which were reflected in the remotely sensed observations made with airglow imager.

TI  - Quantitative improvement of lymph nodes visualization of breast cancer using <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-nanocolloid SPECT/CT and updated reconstruction algorithm
T2  - RADIATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL BIOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the impact of attenuation and scatter correction on the contrast to noise ratio values of SPECT and SPECT/CT images in sentinel lymph nodes scintigraphy. In addition, the effect of using an iterative reconstruction algorithm with variable iterations number and fixed subsets was also investigated. 35 patients with a total of 44 lymph nodes were recruited in the current study. SPECT/CT scans were performed 3-4 h following peri-tumoral Tc-99m-nanocolloid injection (approximate to 1 mCi) at four points. Two image types were generated including SPECT with attenuation and scatter correction (AC-SC) and SPECT without any correction (NoAC-NoSC). The acquired projections were repeatedly reconstructed with eight subsets and 10, 20, 30 and 40 iterations. Afterwards, the calculated contrast to noise ratio values were used to investigate the effect of number of iteration and to compare the image quality of SPECT/CT and SPECT only. The mean contrast to noise (CNR) values of SPECT/CT scans were found to be 19,737, 26,418, 34,282 and 31,187 at 10, 20, 30 and 40 iterations, respectively. Whereas, the mean CNR values in SPECT (NoAC-NoSC) were as low as 8506, 10,582, 13,791 and 12,143 at 10, 20, 30 and 40 iterations, respectively. The CNR values of both SPECT and SPECT/CT improved with increasing number of iterations up to 30 iterations and then slightly decreased after 30-40 iterations. Likewise, no significant difference was found between 10 and 20 iterations (P-value = 0.06) in SPECT/CT, while a statistically significant difference was observed between 10 iterations and both 30 and 40 iterations (P-value < 0.05). It is concluded that the attenuation and scatter correction in SPECT/CT optimized the CNR values up to threefold compared to SPECT alone. Thus, a considerable improvement in the CNR values and the image quality can be obtained by increasing the iterations number to peak of 30 iterations.

TI  - Robot-assisted surgery for women with endometrial cancer: Surgical and oncologic outcomes within a Belgium gynaecological oncology group cohort
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate surgical and oncologic outcomes of patients treated by robot-assisted surgery for endometrial cancer within the Belgium Gynaecological Oncology Group (BGOG).Study design: We performed a retrospective analysis of women with clinically Stage I endometrial cancer who underwent surgical treatment from 2007 to 2018 in five institutions of the BGOG group.Results: A total of 598 consecutive women were identified. The rate of conversion to laparotomy was low (0.8%). The mean postoperative Complication Common Comprehensive Index (CCI) score was 3.4. The rate of perioperative complications did not differ between age groups, however the disease-free survival was significantly lower in patients over 75 years compared to patients under 65 years of age (p=0.008). Per-operative complications, conversion to laparotomy rate, post-operative hospital stay, CCI score and disease-free survival were not impacted by increasing BMI.Conclusion: Robot-assisted surgery for the surgical treatment of patients suffering from early-stage endometrial cancer is associated with favourable surgical and oncologic outcomes, particularly for unfavourable groups such as elderly and obese women, thus permitting a low morbidity minimally-invasive surgical approach for the majority of patients in expert centres.

TI  - The use of indocyanine green and near-infrared fluorescence imaging to assist sentinel lymph node biopsy in cutaneous melanoma: A systematic review
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - Background and objectives: Despite the use of blue dye and radioisotopes, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is still associated with a high false-negative rate (FNR). The off-label use of indocyanine green (ICG) and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging has been introduced with the objective of assisting SLNB and thereby improving regional control in melanoma. The objective of this study was to review and summarize the general experience, protocols and outcomes of the use of ICG and NIRF to assist SLNB in melanoma.Methods: A systematic literature review was performed in December 2019 as per the PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria were articles written in English describing the applications of ICG in patients with melanoma. Systematic reviews, animal studies, case reports and letters to editors were excluded.Results: Of the 585 studies retrieved, 13 articles met the inclusion criteria. The reported sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection rate using ICG was between 86 and 100% of nodes identified by lymphoscintigraphy. The average number of nodes per patient detected using ICG was 2. ICG fluorescence imaging contributed to the identification of 2.0% of the total number of SLNs harvested.Conclusions: ICG fluorescence may be a useful adjunct to lymphoscintigraphy, although high-level comparative data is lacking. It was found to be superior to blue dye at detecting sentinel lymph nodes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd, BASO similar to The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology.

TI  - Multibranch Feature Extraction and Feature Multiplexing Network for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous development of deep neural networks in the visual field, their application to panchromatic sharpening has received increasing attention from researchers; however, the existing panchromatic sharpening methods generally lack the ability to combine knowledge of the panchromatic sharpening field for feature extraction with neural networks, which have certain limitations in feature extraction and the discovery of new features. This article proposes a simple, modular, multibranched feature extraction and reuses network architecture designed not only to support feature reuse but to learn well-expressed new features for use in panchromatic sharpening approaches. In addition, we fused field knowledge of panchromatic sharpening to extract spatial structure information of panchromatic maps through gradient calculators and design structural and spectral compensation to fully extract and preserve the spatial structural and spectral information of images. We conducted experiments on the QuickBird and WorldView-3 satellite data sets, and the experimental results reveal that our proposed method has advantages over the best methods currently available, achieving excellent results not only on objective evaluation metrics, such as full-reference and no-reference metrics, but also on subjective visual evaluation.

TI  - Improving the Estimation of the Wavenumber Spectra From Altimeter Observations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimeters provide sea-level measurements along satellite track. A mean profile based on the measurements averaged over a time period is then subtracted to estimate the sea-level anomaly (SLA). In the spectral domain, SLA is characterized by a power spectral density (PSD) whose slope in a log-log scale is a parameter of great interest for ocean monitoring. Estimation of this spectral slope is usually done through a cumulated periodogram using a large number of signal samples. The location and dates of the data induce the spatial and temporal resolution of the slope estimates. To improve this resolution, this article studies a new parametric method based on an autoregressive model combined with a warping of the frequency scale (denoted as ARWARP). This ARWARP model provides a PSD estimate, with a lower variance than the classical Fourier-based ones and is reliable in the case of a small sample number. To give a reference in the performance of the SLA slope estimation, the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound is derived. Then, rather than performing linear regression on the spectral estimates, a new estimator of the slope is suggested, based on a model fitting of the PSD. A statistical validation is proposed on simulated SLA signals, showing the performance of slope estimation using this ARWARP spectral estimator, compared to classical Fourier-based methods. Application to Sentinel-3 real data highlights the main advantage of the ARWARP model, making possible SLA slope estimation on a short signal segment, i.e., with a high spatial and/or temporal resolution.

TI  - The role of sentinel lymph node status performed in melanoma patients with local recurrence or in transit metastasis
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel Node Biopsy (SNB) is routinely performed for primary melanoma, but its role in the treatment of Local Recurrence (LR) and In-Transit metastasis (IT) is controversial. This study aims to assess the role of SNB in melanoma patients who developed first loco-regional recurrence.Methods: A series of consecutive melanoma patients who received SNB for a first IT or LR at the National Cancer Institute of Milan, Italy, from 2000 to 2015 were selected from a prospective database. Clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed.Results: Seventy-two patients met selection criteria. Forty-three patients (59.7%) received SNB for LR and 29 (40.3%) for IT. The average interval between treatment of primitive melanoma and first recurrence diagnosis was 19 months (interquartile range: 6.9-49.0). SN identification rate was 97.2%. SN positivity was detected in 26 (37.1%) patients. The SN-positive ratein melanoma patients who had LR or IT was significantly higher than reported for primary tumours. Of patients with nodal involvement 17 had LR and 9 IT lesions. Disease Free Survival (DFS) was slightly higher in SN negative patients, in the absence of statistically significant differences. Overall Survival (OS) analysis showed similar values in the two groups.Conclusion: Since DFS and OS do not show significant differences between SN negative and positive patients, our data do not give clear indications about performing SNB in case of first LR or IT. However, we suggest submitting patients with LR to this procedure to obtain a more accurate staging and eventually candidate these patients to adjuvant treatment.

TI  - Varying weighted spatial quality assessment for high resolution satellite image pan-sharpening
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on spatial quality assessment of pan-sharpened imagery that contains valuable information of input images. Its aim is to show that fusion functions respond differently to different types of landscapes. It compares a quality assessment of an object-level procedure with that of a conventional pixel-level-based procedure which assigns uniform quality scores to all image pixels of pan-sharpened images. To do so, after performing a series of pan-sharpening evaluations, a weighted procedure for spatial quality assessments of pan-sharpening products, allocating spatially varying weight factors to the image pixels proportional to their level of spatial information content is proposed. All experiments are performed using five high-resolution image datasets using fusion products produced by three common pan-sharpening algorithms. The datasets are acquired from WorldView-2, QuickBird, and IKONOS. Experimental results show that the spatial distortion of fused images for the class vegetation cover exceeds that of man-made structures, reaching more than 4% in some cases. Our procedure can preclude illogical fidelity estimations occurring when pan-sharpened images contain different land covers. Since particular image structures are of high importance in remote sensing applications, our procedure provides a purpose-oriented estimation of the spatial quality for pan-sharpened images in comparison with conventional procedures.

TI  - Multi-fidelity Bayesian neural networks: Algorithms and applications
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a new class of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) that can be trained using noisy data of variable fidelity, and we apply them to learn function approximations as well as to solve inverse problems based on partial differential equations (PDEs). These multi-fidelity BNNs consist of three neural networks: The first is a fully connected neural network, which is trained following the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) method to fit the low-fidelity data; the second is a Bayesian neural network employed to capture the cross-correlation with uncertainty quantification between the low- and high-fidelity data; and the last one is the physics-informed neural network, which encodes the physical laws described by PDEs. For the training of the last two neural networks, we first employ the mean-field variational inference (VI) to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) to obtain informative prior distributions for the hyperparameters in the BNNs, and subsequently we use the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method to estimate accurately the posterior distributions for the corresponding hyperparameters. We demonstrate the accuracy of the present method using synthetic data as well as real measurements. Specifically, we first approximate a one- and four-dimensional function, and then infer the reaction rates in one- and two-dimensional diffusion-reaction systems. Moreover, we infer the sea surface temperature (SST) in the Massachusetts and Cape Cod Bays using satellite images and in-situ measurements. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the present method can capture both linear and nonlinear correlation between the low- and high-fidelity data adaptively, identify unknown parameters in PDEs, and quantify uncertainties in predictions, given a few scattered noisy high-fidelity data. Finally, we demonstrate that we can effectively and efficiently reduce the uncertainties and hence enhance the prediction accuracy with an active learning approach, using as examples a specific one-dimensional function approximation and an inverse PDE problem.

TI  - Multi-temporal mapping of flood damage to crops using sentinel-1 imagery: a case study of the Sesia River (October 2020)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring large-scale flood damage can be complicated and costly. Damages caused by floods affect also the agricultural sector. Permanence, height and quantity of stagnant water can significantly influence crop yield. Many studies exploit satellite data to map flooded areas, but only a few are focused on the timing of water persistence. This work refers to the river Sesia flooding event which occurred on 3 October 2020 in Northwest Italy with the aim of detecting damages to local crops. The analysis was based on Sentinel-1 data processed by Google Earth Engine platform. In particular, the Otsu's method was applied to test the difference between pre- and post-event images. Areas that were mapped as flooded were successively analysed to estimate local water persistence: specifically, 1-2-6 days after the event. According to the available Corine Land Cover 2018 dataset, it was found that flood mainly affected agricultural areas (about 3288 ha). Since damage also relies on water persistence, a focus area was selected to test the effectiveness of S1 multi-temporal in mapping its distribution. Results show that only 3.5% of the agricultural fields in the focus area remained underwater for at least 6 days and 69% for only 1 day.

TI  - Combined Frozen Section and Imprint Smear Assessment of Sentinel Node Improves Accuracy and Reduces False Negative Rates in Breast Cancer: A Prospective Study
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is standard of care for clinically negative operable breast cancer. However, the best technique for intra-operative assessment of SLN still remains a matter of research. Accuracy of frozen section (FS), which is widely used for detecting metastasis in SLN varies from 79 to 89% with false negative rate being 5.5 to 43%. This study was hence done to evaluate if combined intraoperative FS and imprint cytology (IC) evaluation improves accuracy and reduces false negative rate for SLN evaluation in breast cancer. In this prospective cohort study, patients with operable breast cancer with negative axillary lymph node status (N0) were included. SLNB was done using combination technique with a radionuclide tracer and blue dye. Smears were prepared from SLNs for imprint cytology evaluation and excised SLNs were then sent for frozen section. Diagnostic indices of frozen section, imprint cytology, and combined technique were assessed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratios, false negative rate, and overall accuracy with 95% confidence intervals taking final histopathology as "gold standard." Eighty-one cases of SLNB in which both FS and IC reports were available were included for analysis. Sensitivity (93.8%; CI 69.8-99.8%), specificity (100%; CI 89.3-100%), positive predictive value (100%; CI 66.3-100%), negative predictive value (98.4%; CI 91.6-100%), false negative rate (6.25%), and overall diagnostic accuracy (98.7%) of combined evaluation were superior as compared to either of the techniques. Combination of frozen section and imprint cytology has better diagnostic accuracy and reduced false negative rate as compared to either of them alone.

TI  - Determination of surface albedo and snow/ice content variation using the MODIS data in the past two decades (2001-2020)
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow/ice cover is an integral part of the Earth's climate system. Earth's snow/ice cover helps regulate the energy exchange between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere, directly regulating the surface (and near-surface) temperatures. This study utilizes measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD43C3 dataset to derive the albedo and snow cover variation over the past two decades (2001-2020). The snow cover and the albedo vary with local seasonal variation. The global and the southern hemisphere albedo drops by about 17.4% and 26.9%, respectively, during 2017-2020. However, the northern hemisphere albedo drops by about 10.3% from 2017 to 2019 and then increases by about 14.2% in 2020. For non-glaciated regions, the albedo drops from 2017 to 2019 is maximum during JJA (23.5%), followed by SON (19.2%), DJF (12.7%), and MAM (7.1%) months averages. The non-glaciated albedo in the southern hemisphere falls (2016 onwards) by about 40.6%, 47.5%, 55.8%, 30.8% for DJF, MAM, JJA, and SON month averages, respectively. Since the snow cover variation is minimal in the past two decades, an increase in the Northern Hemisphere's albedo in 2020 indicates a relatively fresher snow presence on the surface compared to previous years.

TI  - Near Real-Time Processing Chain for MSG SEVIRI Data for Free and Immediate Earth Monitoring Capabilities
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although numerous instruments are continuously observing our planet, the general public has a low access to these data, either being provided with a delay, or needing some scientific background to exploit them. Our objective here is to bridge this gap, by using the data we receive from our MSG-SEVIRI (Meteosat Second Generation-Spinning Enhanced Visible InfraRed Imager) station, by processing them to retrieve accurate characteristics of the surface, and uploading them within 5 min of image completion on a dedicated webpage, updated with every new data. For half our planet, we provide in real time a specifically designed quickook and surface temperature every 15 min, with an accuracy similar to the one achieved in previous works. We also provide every 15 min the hotspots detected using a validated approach. Once a day, we provide vegetation greenness [Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)] for the 12:00 UTC acquisition, corresponding to the best illumination case, as well as anomalies for NDVI and surface temperature. These parameters are provided freely as full resolution images, readily understandable for the end-user, in three different languages (English, Spanish and French): https://www.uv.es/iplsat. These data, along with short time lapse videos, can be used for educational, scientific and communication purposes.

TI  - The value of lymph node ultrasound and whole body <SUP>18</SUP>F-FDG PET/CT in stage IIB/C melanoma patients prior to SLNB
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Stage IIB/IIC (8th AJCC) melanoma patients are known to have high-risk primary tumors, however they follow the same routine to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) as more low risk tumors. Guidelines are not conclusive regarding the use of preoperative imaging for these patients. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the value of ultrasound (US) and F-18-FDG PET/CT prior to lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) and SLNB for stage IIB/C melanoma patients.Methods: From 2019-04 till 2020-01, all stage IIB/C melanoma patients underwent US of the regional lymph nodes and whole body F-18-FDG PET/CT before their planned LSG and SLNB. Suspected metastases were confirmed with fine needle aspiration (FNA), prior to surgery.Results: In total 23 patients were screened: six had metastases detected by imaging, two by US, one by F-18-FDG PET/CT and three were detected by both imaging modalities. All metastases were nodal and therefore treatment was altered to lymph node dissection and all but one also received adjuvant therapy. Eight (47%) of the 17 patients without macroscopic disease, still had a positive SN. Sensitivity, specificity and false negative rate for US and F-18-FDG PET/CT were 36%, 89%, 64% and 29%, 100% and 71%, respectively.Conclusion: Preoperative negative imaging does not exclude the presence of SN metastases, therefore SLNB cannot be foregone. However, US detected metastases in 22% of patients, altering their treatment, which suggests it is effective in the work-up of stage IIB/C melanoma. Staging with F-18-FDG PET/CT is not of added value prior to LSG and SLNB and should therefore not be used.

TI  - Spatially clustered count data provide more efficient search strategies in invasion biology and disease control
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographic profiling, a mathematical model originally developed in criminology, is increasingly being used in ecology and epidemiology. Geographic profiling boasts a wide range of applications, such as finding source populations of invasive species or breeding sites of vectors of infectious disease. The model provides a cost-effective approach for prioritizing search strategies for source locations and does so via simple data in the form of the positions of each observation, such as individual sightings of invasive species or cases of a disease. In doing so, however, classic geographic profiling approaches fail to make the distinction between those areas containing observed absences and those areas where no data were recorded. Absence data are generated via spatial sampling protocols but are often discarded during the inference process. Here we construct a geographic profiling model that resolves these issues by making inferences via count data, analyzing a set of discrete sentinel locations at which the number of encounters has been recorded. Crucially, in our model this number can be zero. We verify the ability of this new model to estimate source locations and other parameters of practical interest via a Bayesian power analysis. We also measure model performance via real-world data in which the model infers breeding locations of mosquitoes in bromeliads in Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA. In both cases, our novel model produces more efficient search strategies by shifting focus from those areas containing observed absences to those with no data, an improvement over existing models that treat these areas equally. Our model makes important improvements upon classic geographic profiling methods, which will significantly enhance real-world efforts to develop conservation management plans and targeted interventions.

TI  - Estimating global maximum gross primary productivity of vegetation based on the combination of MODIS greenness and temperature data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of the spatial-temporal variation of the maximum gross primary productivity (GPPmax) of vegetation is of great significance for predicting carbon fluxes and vegetation-climate feedback. In this study, the GPPmax estimation models were constructed based on driving variables derived from the MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and land surface temperature (LST) time series data using a stepwise regression analysis. The models were calibrated and validated with the observed GPPmax from 145 FLUXNET sites with 734 site-year data from 2000 to 2014. The GPPmax estimates and the changes in their trends at the global scale were also compared with other GPPmax products from the vegetation photosynthesis model and the eddy covariance-light use efficiency model. The results showed that the GPPmax for both forest and non-forest vegetation types were estimated well, with R2 of 0.47-0.86 and 0.47-0.95 and relative root mean square error of 10.14-35.14% and 11.25-30.02% for calibration and validation data, respectively. Summer EVI and spring EVI and LST played important roles in explaining the variation in GPPmax. The GPPmax estimates from this study and the changes in their trends were highly correlated with GPPmax estimates from the vegetation photosynthesis model, with R2 > 0.70 for most vegetation types. The GPPmax significantly increased in western North America, northern Europe, and eastern China, but decreased in tropical regions. This study concluded that the variation in GPPmax for various vegetation types on a global scale can be accurately estimated based on MODIS EVI and LST time series data, which provides a simple but effective way for large-scale estimation of GPPmax.

TI  - Modelling urban expansion of a south-east Asian city, India: comparison between SLEUTH and a hybrid CA model
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate identification of the dominant driving factors in the expansion of a city is essential for cellular automata (CA)-based urban expansion modelling. The current study aimed at analyzing the drivers of change for Vijayawada city, a tier-II developing city in south-east Asia, India and then applies them to model the future scenario of the city in a CA-based environment. Furthermore, the study also aims at comparing the efficiency of the renowned CA-based urban growth model, SLEUTH (Slope, Land use, Exclusion, Urban extent, Transportation, Hill shade), and a self-designed CA-based hybrid model developed in combination with genetic algorithm (GA) for developing future scenario of the city. The models were built, calibrated, and validated for the city using land use maps derived from temporal Landsat satellite images. Analysis of the statistical significance of the driving factors shows that the terrain and population density are the two dominant factors influencing expansion of the city. Both the models output on predicting the urban growth indicate that the available open spaces within the existing city extent gets further converted to built-up indicating infill development, and more growth occurs along the fringes of the existing city. Also, emergence of new urban centers merged with the existing city areas for predictions till 2050 and extended into the dense vegetation on the north resulting in further reduction of green cover around the city. Validation of both the models showed overall accuracy higher than 85%. The inclusion of the demographic variable and utilization of the GA ensured that the hybrid model performs better than the SLEUTH model. Analysis on the built-up densification of the cityscape showed a shift in the pattern of built-up dynamics over time. The built urban expansion scenario for Vijayawada informs urban modelers and policymakers the possible evolution of the city.

TI  - Understanding the dynamics of integrated rice-crawfish farming in Qianjiang county, China using Landsat time series images
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: The emerging integrated rice-crawfish (IRC) farming system, combining paddy rice cultivation with crawfish production, has recently expanded rapidly in central China because of its high efficiency and profits. To date, research on the IRC system has mainly focused on its ecological environmental effects using either statistics or field-point data without spatial and temporal attributes.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to address how IRC can be accurately mapped considering its phenological features, and what spatiotemporal dynamics of IRC occurred in Qianjiang in 2013-2018.METHODS: Based on the phenology of IRC, we used an object-based water difference method (OWDM) to map its spatial distribution in Qianjiang in 2013-2018, and then analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of IRC in terms of its distribution, field sizes, and under different farming systems.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results show that the OWDM performs well with overall accuracy greater than 92%. The IRC area continuously increased from 1500 ha in 2013 to 27,600 ha in 2018. Spatially, IRC was initially concentrated in southwestern Qianjiang, but later expanded to the northwestern region. The field size has become larger as IRC has extended to all regions, ranging from 0.5 ha to over 10 ha. The state-owned farming system has played an important role in leading the IRC development, growing rapidly in 2013-2015 and then gradually stabilizing. By comparison, IRC in smallholder farming regions accelerated in the later period, increasing steeply by 18,700 ha in 2018, which is double that of the state-owned farming system.SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides an efficient mapping approach and basic information of IRC spatial dynamics, which help understand its developmental processes, optimize resource allocation, facilitate management, and further explore the effects of IRC.

TI  - Sentinel-3 active fire detection and FRP product performance-Impact of scan angle and SLSTR middle infrared channel selection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-3 satellites each carry the dual-Earth view Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR). SLSTR data from the `near nadir' scan are used to produce a set of global, daily active fire (AF) products similar to those produced from MODIS data. The Sentinel-3 AF products are generated in both Near Real Time (NRT) and Non Time Critical (NTC) mode and are expected ultimately to replace those from MODIS Terra when that mission starts to reach its end of life. Middle infrared (MIR) observations are critical for the AF application, and SLSTR has two MIR channels (S7 and F1) based on different detector designs and located at different positions in the instrument focal plane, delivering different dynamic ranges with the same spectral response function. The SLSTR AF detection and FRP retrieval algorithm uses both S7 and F1 channel data, but there are options on how these are combined to generate the final AF products. Past work has shown that MODIS' AF product characteristics are strongly view zenith angle (VZA) dependent, and since the SLSTR `near nadir' scan actually extends out to a maximum VZA of 55. (similar to the maximum MODIS VZA), any such view angle dependency may also impact the choice of how the S7 and F1 channel data are combined to generate the SLSTR AF products. Here we use a combination of simulation modelling and analysis of more than 15,000 early SLSTR AF products to study how VZA affects the Sentinel-3 AF product characteristics, and how this varies when the S7 and F1 channel data are combined in different ways. Maximum use of S7 channel data provides an AF product whose statistical characteristics vary markedly with VZA around the near nadir scan. For example, the median FRP extracted from the more than 15,000 products studied varies by around an order of magnitude between the centre and edge of scan positions, a level of VZA-dependency similar to that seen with the MODIS AF products. By contrast, maximum use of data from the F1 channel provides a median FRP that varies only by a factor of similar to 3 over the same VZA range. Our simulation modelling demonstrates that this difference is a result of the area of the F1 channel ground pixel footprint remaining far more consistent around the near nadir scan compared to that of S7, which also leads to minimised F1 pixel oversampling even at high VZA observations. The result is that FRP retrievals for a fire derived using the F1 channel observations are far less sensitive to where in the scan the fire is observed. When generated in this way, the Sentinel-3 FRP product characteristics appear similar to those of the VIIRS AF products, since VIIRS also has a method of minimising pixel area growth away from nadir. We conclude that maximum use of the SLSTR F1 channel observations provides significant benefits to the Sentinel-3 AF product, and that unless there are other reasons not to do so any operational processing to generate the NRT and NTC product versions should consider this option as the default. Our findings also show the value of the novel detector design of the SLSTR F1 channel, whose advantageous pixel footprint characteristics mean that similar designs should be considered for future sensors aiming to support active fire applications.

TI  - Spatio-temporal evolution of urban thermal environment and its driving factors: Case study of Nanjing, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, with rapid urbanization, the underlying urban surface has changed dramatically. Various urban eco-environmental problems have emerged globally, among which the urban heat island effect has become one of the most obvious urban eco-environmental problems. In this study, Nanjing, China, was chosen as the study area. Based on Landsat 8 remote sensing image data collected in Nanjing from 2014 to 2018, land surface temperatures were retrieved, the spatiotemporal variation track and characteristics of the thermal environment pattern were systematically depicted, and the driving factors of these variations were revealed. The results show that over the past five years, the spatial pattern of the heat field in Nanjing changed from a scattered distribution in the periphery of the city to a centralized distribution in the centre of the city, and the heat island intensity increased annually. Changes in administrative divisions, changes in the layout of the transportation trunk lines, transfer of industrial centres, and ecological construction projects are important driving factors for the evolution of the land surface thermal environment patterns of these regions. These research results will provide scientific and technological support for similar cities with typical heat island effects elsewhere in the world to formulate urban development plan, and to improve the urban ecological environment.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Fear of Cancer Recurrence Among Indigenous and Minority Peoples
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - While cancer survivors commonly experience fear and anxiety, a substantial minority experience an enduring and debilitating fear that their cancer will return; a condition commonly referred to as fear of cancer recurrence (FCR). Despite recent advances in this area, little is known about FCR among people from Indigenous or other ethnic and racial minority populations. Given the high prevalence and poor outcomes of cancer among people from these populations, a robust understanding of FCR among people from these groups is critical. The current review identified and aggregated existing literature on FCR amongst adult cancer survivors from Indigenous and minority populations. The protocol of this review was registered with PROSPERO in July 2020 (Registration number: CRD42020161655). A systematic search of bibliographic databases was conducted for relevant articles published from 1997 to November 2019. Data from eligible articles were extracted and appraised for quality by two independent reviewers. Nineteen articles from four countries (United States of America, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom) met the inclusion criteria, including 14 quantitative, 4 qualitative and 1 mixed-methods study. Only one article reported on an Indigenous population. Few studies reported on FCR prevalence (n = 3) or severity (n = 9). While the variation in tools used to measure FCR hindered a robust estimate of severity, results suggested some differences in FCR severity between minority and dominant populations, although these may have been due to study metholodological differences. Few factors were reported as being associated with FCR in minorities across multiple studies. The qualitative synthesis found five themes associated with the lived experience of FCR: (i) variations in the lived experience of FCR; (ii) spirituality and worldview impacting on FCR; (iii) the importance of staying positive; (iv) complexities around support; and (v) increasing cancer knowledge. The findings of this review highlight differences in FCR across cultures and contexts, which reinforces the need for culturally-specific approaches to this condition. The dearth of research in this area is of concern given the significant burden of cancer in these populations. A deeper understanding of this condition among Indigenous and minority populations is critical to developing and delivering appropriate and effective psychosocial care for cancer survivors from these groups.

TI  - Factual approach for tropical forest parameters measurement and monitoring: future option with a focus on synergetic use of airborne and terrestrial LiDAR technologies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biomass and carbon are critical for ecological monitoring, and yet poorly modelled in complex ecosystems such as the tropical rainforests. To overcome this challenge incurred due to the complex biophysical properties of tropical forests, Airborne and Terrestrial LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technologies have been used combinedly. Airborne LiDAR data 'from above' are largely restricted to analyses of lower canopy layer trees. Its combination with Terrestrial LiDAR allows the assessment of tree crowns under the upper canopy layer, thus opening up new possibilities for a more complete assessment of all the trees in a multi-layer stand. In this study, Airborne LiDAR was used for upper canopy tree measurements while Terrestrial LiDAR was complimented for lower canopy layer trees. The result showed that LiDAR-based tree measurements of DBH and height were highly accurate. We highly improved the accuracy of estimated above-ground biomass (AGB)/carbon from 87% of Terrestrial and 90% of Airborne LiDAR-based estimates to 97% through combining the use of the two technologies. This approach contributes to the development of efficient techniques for forest monitoring systems and bears the potential to extend the modelling options from remote sensing data to understory layer trees.

The AW3D30, ASTER GDEM, SRTM and NASADEM DSMs cover nearly the entire globe and can be downloaded at no cost, while the LiDAR and CEM DSMs are distributed by Mexico's Institute of Geography and Statistics (INEGI). The accuracy of these DSMs is assessed by considering: 1) benchmarks as reference data at the national level, and 2) LiDAR DSM as reference data on six different zones with variability in slope, vegetation cover and elevation. Using geodetic benchmarks as reference elevation on those areas covered by LiDAR (A(LiDAR)=370,200 km(2), n(bench)=24,175), it was found that LiDAR has the best vertical accuracy of all DSMs considered (MAE(LiDAR) = 1.96), which is why it was used as reference elevation to develop seven DEMs of Difference (DoDs) with the remainder DSMs. Using n(cells) = 350 x 10(6) for the aforementioned comparisons, it was found that the vertical accuracy of AW3D30 V2 and V3 is similar (MAE=2.5 m), followed by NASADEM, SRTM, CEM, ASTER GDEM3 and ASTER GDEM 2, with MAE values of 3.1, 3.8, 4.6, 6.0 and 7.2 m respectively. The previously mentioned values vary according to slope and slope orientation (i.e. aspect): for flat areas (slope <= 5 degrees), the NASADEM exhibits the lowest MAE (with MAE values of 1.6 for slope <= 1 degrees and MAE = 2.0 m when 1 degrees<slope <= 5 degrees), whereas MAE(AW3D30V3)=1.9 and 2.2 m for the previously mentioned slopes. With the use of radial boxplots developed on slope groups of 5 degrees, it was found that both MAE and bias are increasingly affected by aspect as slope increases on all the DSMs. In the case of both AW3D30 DSMs, on flat terrain a difference of only 0.1 m in bias (i.e. median of differences with respect to LiDAR) is found between SE and NW slopes; however, this difference increases according to slope: 0.6 m for 5 degrees<slope <= 10 degrees, 1.2 m for 10 degrees<slope <= 15 degrees, and 1.9 m for 15 degrees<slope <= 20 degrees. Through the analyses undertaken, it is shown that slope-and not vegetation cover-is the factor that has the largest impact on the error of DSMs, and that the effect of aspect on error increases as terrain steepens. This work shows that all DSMs present errors and that an adequate accuracy assessment of DSMs needs to consider the spatial distribution of GCPs, Difference of DSMs (DoDs) and derivatives of DSMs (i.e., slope and aspect) as the use of DoDs provide information on DSM errors (i.e. interpolation artefacts) that can not be assessed through the use of geodetic benchmarks and because DSM errors depend on both slope and aspect.

TI  - Comparing Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 top of atmosphere and surface reflectance in high latitude regions: case study in Alaska
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images is an effective approach to obtain high spatiotemporal resolution data for Earth observation and remote sensing modeling. The differences between Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 products, such as the reflectance at the top of atmosphere (TOA) and land surface, should be compared and evaluated to make sure they are spectrally consistent. Their consistency has been evaluated and the differences have been empirically corrected at mid-low latitudes, but in high latitude areas with a higher solar zenith angle (SZA), the similar work has not been explored. In this study, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 TOA and surface reflectance in Alaska as well as some surface parameters, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference snow index (NDSI), were compared using the massive data distributed on Google earth engine (GEE) online platform, and their consistency was evaluated and the uncertainty was analyzed. Some empirical models were suggested to convert Sentinel-2 products to be consistent with Landsat-8 products at all bands. The results show that TOA reflectance is more consistent than surface reflectance in Alaska. This study suggests that the consistency between Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 at high latitudes should be paid more attention because their consistency is lower than that at mid-low latitudes.

TI  - Towards nationwide mapping of bamboo resources in the Philippines: testing the pixel-based and fractional cover approaches
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical and subtropical countries, the awareness on the importance of bamboos to the environment and economy is increasing and so is the demand for spatial bamboo information. However, mapping bamboos especially those naturally grown has been challenging, as these grasses are often mixed with other land-use and land-cover (LULC). In this study, we used Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 remote sensing (RS) images, and their vegetation indices to accurately map the bamboos of Iloilo province in the Philippines using: (1) pixel-based method that mapped bamboos and other LULC at 10 m resolution, and (2) fractional cover method that mapped bamboo cover at 100 m resolution (% ha(-1)). A random forest model was trained for each method and then validated per hectare basis using a 50:50 training-validation ratio of a stratified random sample. The fractional cover method showed 0.34 higher Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and 5.10% lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) than the pixel-based method. Further validation within upland and lowland sites also favoured the fractional cover method, but the results of the two methods were closer in the upland site (bamboo plantation). Errors at 10 m resolution especially in the lowlands were mostly commission errors, likely because of the spectral similarity and proximity between bamboos and > 14 vegetations. Averaging the RS inputs into 100 m resulted in at most 12% separation of reflectance values among bamboos, forests, and other vegetations. Using the bamboo cover map, a total of 14,795 (+/- 1,283) ha bamboos and 7.45 (+/- 4.20) million harvestable culms (poles) were estimated for the whole province, where 54% come from the lowland. We suggest using the fractional cover method for nationwide baselining of bamboo resources.

TI  - A new satellite-derived dataset for marine aquaculture areas in China's coastal region
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - China has witnessed extensive development of the marine aquaculture industry over recent years. However, such rapid and disordered expansion posed risks to coastal environment, economic development, and biodiversity protection. This study aimed to produce an accurate national-scale marine aquaculture map at a spatial resolution of 16 m, using a proposed model based on deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) and applied it to satellite data from China's GF-1 sensor in an end-to-end way. The analyses used homogeneous CNNs to extract high-dimensional features from the input imagery and preserve information at full resolution. Then, a hierarchical cascade architecture was followed to capture multi-scale features and contextual information. This hierarchical cascade homogeneous neural network (HCHNet) was found to achieve better classification performance than current state-of-the-art models (FCN-32s, Deeplab V2, U-Net, and HCNet). The resulting marine aquaculture area map has an overall classification accuracy > 95%(95.2 %-96.4, 95% confidence interval). And marine aquaculture was found to cover a total area of similar to 1100 km(2) (1096.8-1110.6 km(2), 95% confidence interval) in China, of which more than 85% is marine plant culture areas, with 87% found in the Fujian, Shandong, Liaoning, and Jiangsu provinces. The results confirm the applicability and effectiveness of HCHNet when applied to GF-1 data, identifying notable spatial distributions of different marine aquaculture areas and supporting the sustainable management and ecological assessments of coastal resources at a national scale. The nationalscale marine aquaculture map at 16m spatial resolution is published in the Google Maps kmz file format with georeferencing information at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3881612 (Fu et al., 2020).

TI  - New spectral indicator Potato Productivity Index based on Sentinel-2 data to improve potato yield prediction: a machine learning approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is one of the most important food crops and is consumed by more than a billion people worldwide. Despite the fact that crop growth models are widely used to optimize crop management and agricultural decision-making, they fail to provide spatial information, whereas satellite-based methods do, and in a cost-effective manner. In order to improve satellite-based crop yield prediction models, we developed a methodology based on Sentinel-2 (S2) data using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. In addition, we included and compared the commonly used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to a newly developed spectral indicator, the Potato Productivity Index (PPI). Our results showed the capacity of our ML models to predict potato yield with great accuracy (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.77 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 15.42%), using S2 bands 2, 3, 4, 5, 8A, and 9, as well as the PPI index. This index aims to provide information concerning plant photosynthetic activity as well as its water stress. The Random Forest (RF) model using the S2 bands and the PPI index as predictors obtained better predictive results (R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 15.42%) for potato crops than using S2 bands and NDVI (R-2 = 0.66, RMSE = 16.88%). This study demonstrates the suitability of our models to predict potato yields in the region studied and improves on a previous approach presented by the same authors in terms of model interpretability and inter-annual variability.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of sea surface temperatures in the Red Sea and their implications on Saudi Arabia coral reefs
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Red Sea is a conspicuous water body that hosts important coral reef ecosystems. This semi-closed sea is exposed to warming either by climate change or by anthropogenic stressors. The desalination plants along the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia dispose tremendous effluents of hot water from cooling systems, which is expected to impact the neighboring coral reef patches. The main objectives of this study were to delineate the spatial variations and the temporal trends of sea surface temperatures (SST) in the Red Sea using geospatial analysis with focusing on water temperature anomalies adjacent to seawater desalination plants. Monthly sea surface temperatures data were acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua satellite for the period 2003-2019. Annual SST changes and decadal trends were obtained from interpolation analysis and robust statistical metrics, respectively. Results showed that the Red Sea has three distinguished temperature zones with the coldest at the north and the warmest at the south. In addition, global warming is remarkably apparent in the northern part of the Red Sea (0.8 degrees C/decade). About one third of the Saudi corals occur at the northern part, while the remaining coral patches settle in the middle and southern parts of relatively lower SST trends. However, some corals in the middle section of the Red Sea occur proximate to regions of abruptly high SST trends due to the discharge of hot waters from desalination plants, particularly south of Jeddah. The continuous human-induced heating by hot water disposal could be fatal to coral reef ecosystems nearby desalination plants.

TI  - Quantifying spatio-temporal variations of evapotranspiration over a heterogeneous terrain in the Arid regions of Northwestern China.
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a major component of water and energy budgets in terrestrial ecosystems and quantifying ET over a heterogeneous land surface is of extraordinary significance. However, previous studies on the spatial distribution of daily ET in the middle Hexi corridors were mostly temporal discontinuous, and thus hinder the applications in agriculture and meteorology. Based on Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (Landsat) 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model, surface ET in 2014 were estimated over a desert oasis with heterogeneous land cover in the middle Hexi corridors of the arid regions in northwestern China. Daily ET was derived from the reference crop ET which was based on the relationship between actual ET and potential ET. The main results indicated that (1) the estimated daily ET values agreed well with the Eddy Covariance (EC) measurements for cropland (The coefficient of determination (R (2)) = 0.96, p < 0.05, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 1.32 mm day(-1), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) = 1.11 mm day(-1)). Daily ET was more than 2.5 mm day(-1) from June to July in 2014. (2) Seasonal ET was the largest in the summer (190.55 mm), followed by spring (100.03 mm), autumn (62.27 mm), and winter (6.83 mm). (3) ET from the waterbody was the highest, followed by ET from cropland, shelterbelt, bare land, and shrubland, suggesting that ET was mainly controlled by the water availability of the underlying surface. Multiple land-cover types showed similar variations in a year, but the seasonal variations were different. This study provides a foundational understanding of the patterns of water and heat exchange over heterogeneous regions, which can be helpful to make local policy in rational water management and land resource utilization.

TI  - Detecting the oak lace bug infestation in oak forests using MODIS and meteorological data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The oak lace bug (Corythucha arcuata, Say 1832) is a new invasive sap-sucking species in the European oak forests that was first recorded in Central Europe in 2013. It invaded the region from Southeastern Europe, spreads rapidly, and shows no signs of receding after establishment. In this study, focusing on the oak forests in the transboundary area of Hungary and Croatia, we applied two novel methods for detecting and assessing the impact of the oak lace bug (OLB) during the period 2000-2019 based on MODIS NDVI measured at 250 m spatial and 8-day temporal resolution. The first detection method is based purely on NDVI and has the potential to be used in near real-time detection. The second one, based on the residual Z-score of the NDVI models using daily meteorological and soil water content data as independent variables, aims at improved OLB damage assessment by decoupling the effects of the OLB from those caused by the environmental drivers. The presented detection methods had 61.1% to 93.8% agreement with the in situ data, with a better agreement in forests with high oak share. The overall share of the false-positive OLB detections for the strictest method of model residuals was 1.8%. The results confirmed a strong and year-to-year persistent NDVI decrease (down to -14.5% in pure oak forests) during the late summer which can be attributed to the OLB. The origin of the infestation in the study area was identified to be near a resting station on the major highway from Southeastern to Western Europe, corroborating the assumptions that the OLB spread was primarily facilitated by the transport system. The detected speed of the OLB radial spread in the first 3 years of infestation was under 6 km y(-1), but since then it increased to above 50 km y(-1).

TI  - Paleoseismology of the 2016 <i>M</i><sub>W</sub> 6.1 Petermann earthquake source: Implications for intraplate earthquake behaviour and the geomorphic longevity of bedrock fault scarps in a low strain-rate cratonic region
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 20 May 2016 M-W 6.1 Petermann earthquake in central Australia generated a 21 km surface rupture with 0.1 to 1 m vertical displacements across a low-relief landscape. No paleo-scarps or potentially analogous topographic features are evident in pre-earthquake Worldview-1 and Worldview-2 satellite data. Two excavations across the surface rupture expose near-surface fault geometry and mixed aeolian-sheetwash sediment faulted only in the 2016 earthquake. A 10.6 +/- 0.4 ka optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) age of sheetwash sediment provides a minimum estimate for the period of quiescence prior to 2016 rupture. Seven cosmogenic beryllium-10 (Be-10) bedrock erosion rates are derived for samples < 5 km distance from the surface rupture on the hanging-wall and foot-wall, and three from samples 19 to 50 km from the surface rupture. No distinction is found between fault proximal rates (1.3 +/- 0.1 to 2.6 +/- 0.2 m Myr(-1)) and distal samples (1.4 +/- 0.1 to 2.3 +/- 0.2 m Myr(-1)). The thickness of rock fragments (2-5 cm) coseismically displaced in the Petermann earthquake perturbs the steady-state bedrock erosion rate by only 1 to 3%, less than the erosion rate uncertainty estimated for each sample (7-12%). Using Be-10 erosion rates and scarp height measurements we estimate approximately 0.5 to 1 Myr of differential erosion is required to return to pre-earthquake topography. By inference any pre-2016 fault-related topography likely required a similar time for removal. We conclude that the Petermann earthquake was the first on this fault in the last ca. 0.5-1 Myr. Extrapolating single nuclide erosion rates across this timescale introduces large uncertainties, and we cannot resolve whether 2016 represents the first ever surface rupture on this fault, or a > 1 Myr interseismic period. Either option reinforces the importance of including distributed earthquake sources in fault displacement and seismic hazard analyses.

TI  - Analysis of simultaneous aerosol and ocean glint retrieval using multi-angle observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since early 2000, NASA's Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument has been performing remote sensing retrievals of aerosol optical properties from the polar-orbiting Terra spacecraft. A noteworthy aspect of MISR observations over the ocean is that, for much of the Earth, some of the multi-angle views have contributions from solar reflection by the ocean surface (glint, or glitter), while others do not. Aerosol retrieval algorithms often discard these glint-influenced observations because they can overwhelm the signal and are difficult to predict without knowledge of the (wind-speed-driven) ocean surface roughness. However, theoretical studies have shown that multi-angle observations of a location at geometries with and without reflected sun glint can be a rich source of information, sufficient to support simultaneous retrieval of both the aerosol state and the wind speed at the ocean surface. We are in the early stages of creating such an algorithm. In this paper, we describe our assessment of the appropriate level of parameterization for simultaneous aerosol and ocean surface property retrievals using sun glint. For this purpose, we use generalized nonlinear retrieval analysis (GENRA), an information content assessment (ICA) technique employing Bayesian inference, and simulations from the Ahmad-Fraser iterative radiative transfer code.We find that four parameters are suitable: aerosol optical depth (tau), particle size distribution (expressed as the fine mode fraction f of small particles in a bimodal size distribution), surface wind speed (w), and relative humidity (r, to define the aerosol water content and complex refractive index). None of these parameters define ocean optical properties, as we found that the aerosol state could be retrieved with the nine MISR near-infrared views alone, where the ocean body is strongly absorbing in the open ocean. We also found that retrieval capability varies with observation geometry and that as tau increases so does the ability to determine aerosol intensive optical properties (r and f, while it decreases for w). Increases in w decrease the ability to determine the true value of that parameter but have minimal impact on retrieval of aerosol properties. We explored the benefit of excluding the two most extreme MISR view angles for which radiative transfer with the plane-parallel approximation is less certain, but we found no advantage in doing so. Finally, the impact of treating wind speed as a scalar parameter, rather than as a two-parameter directional wind, was tested. While the simpler scalar model does contribute to overall aerosol uncertainty, it is not sufficiently large to justify the addition of another dimension to parameter space.An algorithm designed upon these principles is in development. It will be used to perform an atmospheric correction with MISR for coincident ocean color (OC) observations by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument, also on the NASA Terra spacecraft. Unlike MISR, MODIS is a single-view-angle instrument, but it has a more complete set of spectral channels ideal for determination of optical ocean properties. The atmospheric correction of MODIS OC data can therefore benefit from MISR aerosol retrievals. Furthermore, higher-spatial-resolution data from coincident MISR observations may also improve glint screening.

M3  - Article
AB  - Vulvar cancer is an uncommon gynecologic tumor and one of several human papillomavirus-associated malignancies. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most prevalent histologic subtype of vulvar cancer, accounting for the majority of cases. Imaging plays an important role in managing vulvar cancer. At initial diagnosis, imaging is useful to assess the size and extent of primary tumor and to evaluate the status of inguinofemoral lymph nodes. If recurrent disease is suspected, imaging is essential to demonstrate local extent of tumor and to identify lymph node and distant metastases. In this publication, we summarize the recent literature and describe the panel's recommendations about the appropriate use of imaging for various phases of patient management including initial staging, surveillance, and restaging of vulvar cancer.The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

TI  - Fractional vegetation coverage downscaling inversion method based on Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (System, Landsat-8) and polarization decomposition of Radarsat-2
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to multi-source data information fusion, the precision of eco-hydrology models is improving rapidly. In particular, the fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) is of great significance in the remote sensing monitoring of surface parameters. In this study, downscaling inversion was performed using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI) data from Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (System, Landsat-8) and RVI-Freeman data from Radarsat-2 with polarization decomposition, incorporating the scattering entropy (H) and anisotropy (alpha). Further, modified vegetation indices (mVIs) and corresponding calculation methods were developed to describe the FVC precisely. Two deep learning (DL) methods were used for mVI optimization. The results showed that the inclusion of H and alpha greatly facilitated FVC estimation and that the mVIs and DL provided higher accuracies and smaller errors than the previous methods (NDVI or RVI). H alpha mRVI, one of the mVIs, had the highest accuracy in FVC simulation using a vegetation index, and the particle swarm optimization neural network (PSONN) achieved the best performance. The FVC was then predicted with 8 m resolution using the mVIs and PSONN, demonstrating that the proposed method effectively compensates for the fluctuations in high-FVC valley wetlands caused by high water content, avoids overestimation in grasslands, and provides great detail while retaining the original regional variations.

TI  - Satellite-derived long-term estimates of full-coverage PM<sub>1</sub> concentrations across China based on a stacking decision tree model
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 1 mu m (PM1) often exert a greater threaten on human health, and thus it is highly imperative to accurately characterize the spatiotemporal variation of PM1 concentrations and to assess the potential health risks. Our study attempted to predict the long-term full-coverage PM1 concentrations across China during 2004-2018 using a stacking decision tree model based on satellite data, meteorological variables, and other geographical covariates. The result suggested that the stacking model captured strong prediction capability with a higher cross-validation (CV) R-2 value (0.64), and the lower root-mean-square error (RMSE: 18.60 mu g/m(3)) and mean absolute error (MAE: 11.96 mu g/m(3)) compared with the individual model. The higher PM1 concentrations were mainly concentrated on North China Plain (NCP), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and Sichuan Basin due to intensive anthropogenic activities and poor meteorological conditions especially in winter. The annual mean PM1 concentration in China exhibited a remarkable increase during 2004-2007 by 1.34 mu g/m(3)/year (p < 0.05), followed by a gradual decrease during 2007-2018 by 1.61 mu g/m(3)/ year (p < 0.05). After 2013, the mean PM1 concentration at the national scale experienced a dramatic decrease by 2.96 mu g/m(3)/year (p < 0.05). The persistent increase of PM1 concentration across China during 2004-2007 was mainly caused by the rapid increases of energy consumption and inefficient emission control measures, while the dramatic decrease since 2013 was attributed to increasingly strict control measures, particularly the implementation of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (the Action Plan). The long-term PM1 estimates obtained here provide a key scientific basis and data support for epidemiological research and air pollution mitigation.

TI  - Dual attention deep fusion semantic segmentation networks of large-scale satellite remote-sensing images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since DCNNs (deep convolutional neural networks) have been successfully applied to various academic and industrial fields, semantic segmentation methods, based on DCNNs, are increasingly explored for remote-sensing image interpreting and information extracting. It is still highly challenging due to the presence of irregular target shapes, and similarities of inter - and intra-class objects in large-scale high-resolution satellite images. A majority of existing methods fuse the multi-scale features that always fail to provide satisfactory results. In this paper, a dual attention deep fusion semantic segmentation network of large-scale satellite remote-sensing images is proposed (DASSN_RSI). The framework consists of novel encoder-decoder architecture, and a weight-adaptive loss function based on focal loss. To refine high-level semantic and low-level spatial feature maps, the deep layer channel attention module (DLCAM) and shallow layer spatial attention module (SLSAM) are designed and appended with specific blocks. Then the DUpsampling is incorporated to fuse feature maps in a lossless way. Peculiarly, the weight-adaptive focal loss (W-AFL) is inferred and embedded successfully, alleviating the class-imbalanced issue as much as possible. The extensive experiments are conducted on Gaofen image dataset (GID) datasets (Gaofen-2 satellite images, coarse set with five categories and refined set with fifteen categories). And the results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other typical variants of encoder-decoder networks in the numerical evaluation and visual inspection. Besides, the necessary ablation studies are carried out for a comprehensive evaluation.

TI  - Using the 3D model RAPID to invert the shoot dieback ratio of vertically heterogeneous Yunnan pine forests to detect beetle damage
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As a significant forest disturbance factor, pine shoot beetles (PSB) have caused widespread tree mortality in Yunnan pine forests over southwestern China. Due to significant vertical heterogeneity of tree crowns, empirical remote sensing methods or one-dimensional (1D) radiative transfer (RT) models are not qualified enough to accurately retrieve the damage level of PSB damage. Therefore, three-dimensional (3D) RT models which have the ability to describe vertically complex heterogeneous canopies are more suitable for the damaged forests. In this study, shoot dieback ratio (SDR) was used to parameterize the Radiosity Applicable to Porous IndiviDual Objects (RAPID) model, in order to accurately estimate the PSB damage. Specifically, the vertically heterogeneous characteristics of the biophysical and optical properties within the canopy were carefully considered. First, we developed an approach to reconstruct damaged forest scenes through individual tree segmentation from UAVlidar data and in situ measurements. Second, the simulated reflectance of forest scenes was compared with the actual hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 (S2) reflectance data to evaluate the performance of the parameterized RAPID. Then, the parameterized RAPID model was used to create a look-up table (LUT) containing the leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), effective leaf area index (LAIe), SDR, and dead needles LAIe (LAIdead, LAIe x SDR) as well as the corresponding simulated canopy reflectance. Furthermore, tree allometric equations were used to regularize the LUT with the intention to improve the estimation accuracy. Good agreement (RMSE: 0.015-0.031, index of agreement: 0.97-0.99) was found between the simulated reflectance and the remote sensing observations. The retrieval accuracy of the biochemical and biophysical parameters using S2 data yielded R2 = 0.55 (normalized RMSE (NRMSE) = 19%) for Cab, R2 = 0.70 (NRMSE = 15%) for the LAIe, R2 = 0.66 (NRMSE = 25%) for SDR, and R2 = 0.82 (NRMSE = 18%) for LAIdead. Using hyperspectral data with higher spatial and spectral resolution yielded better retrieval performance. This study demonstrated that 3D models (such as RAPID) have great potential to accurately invert SDR and LAIdead to assess PSB damage for the forests.

TI  - Validity of ICD-10-CM diagnoses to identify hospitalizations for serious infections among patients treated with biologic therapies
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Identifying hospitalizations for serious infections among patients dispensed biologic therapies within healthcare databases is important for post-marketing surveillance of these drugs. We determined the positive predictive value (PPV) of an ICD-10-CM-based diagnostic coding algorithm to identify hospitalization for serious infection among patients dispensed biologic therapy within the FDA's Sentinel Distributed Database.Methods We identified health plan members who met the following algorithm criteria: (1) hospital ICD-10-CM discharge diagnosis of serious infection between July 1, 2016 and August 31, 2018; (2) either outpatient/emergency department infection diagnosis or outpatient antimicrobial treatment within 7 days prior to hospitalization; (3) inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, or rheumatological diagnosis within 1 year prior to hospitalization, and (4) were dispensed outpatient biologic therapy within 90 days prior to admission. Medical records were reviewed by infectious disease clinicians to adjudicate hospitalizations for serious infection. The PPV (95% confidence interval [CI]) for confirmed events was determined after further weighting by the prevalence of the type of serious infection in the database.Results Among 223 selected health plan members who met the algorithm, 209 (93.7% [95% CI, 90.1%-96.9%]) were confirmed to have a hospitalization for serious infection. After weighting by the prevalence of the type of serious infection, the PPV of the ICD-10-CM algorithm identifying a hospitalization for serious infection was 80.2% (95% CI, 75.3%-84.7%).Conclusions The ICD-10-CM-based algorithm for hospitalization for serious infection among patients dispensed biologic therapies within the Sentinel Distributed Database had 80% PPV for confirmed events and could be considered for use within pharmacoepidemiologic studies.

TI  - A comparative machine learning approach to identify landslide triggering factors in northern Chilean Patagonia
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide landslides correspond to one of the most dangerous geological events due to their destructive power and unpredictable nature. In the Chilean Patagonia, the SERNAGEOMIN (Chilean Geological Survey Service) has detected 2533 landslide events in the Northern Patagonia (42. 7(circle)S, 72. 4(circle)W) alone, a small area compared to the whole Chilean Patagonia. However, only 11 evens have known date. Consequently, it is not possible to associate temporal triggers and mechanisms that control such events, resulting in a lack of understanding of the factors that enable landslides. This work aims to detect landslides and identify the main environmental variables (climatic and geomorphological) that explain their occurrence using machine learning methods. We will address the following research questions: 1) How can a temporal landslide dataset be built using Landsat images and Google Earth Engine in Northern Patagonia? 2) Once the landslides and their timing have been detected, what are the main variables that condition the landslide processes? In our work, we developed a temporal dataset of landslides for the northern Patagonia of Chile. We used three machine learning approaches, where it was possible to identify the main environmental variables that allow us to predict their generation. Statistical models show that during the last 19 years, there has been complex interaction between different environmental variables that have influenced the activity of landslides. Climatic indices, indicators of extreme events, have a high incidence in the events' predictive capacity. However, the most important are those linked to Patagonia's tectonic context. In particular, the time elapsed after the eruptive event of the Chaiten volcano. Finally, the Liquine-Ofqui Fault System's presence extending throughout the entire north of Patagonia has generated discontinuities at a general level, causing significant geomorphological instability. The study area has a relief in evolution and reactive to climatic conditions. Therefore, we highlight the need to understand better the interaction between geological and climatic processes and the future impact of these natural hazards. We emphasize the importance of analyzing landslide controls, considering both geomorphological variables and sporadic geological events.

TI  - Urbanization and its effects on land and water resources in Ijebuland, southwestern Nigeria
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The many widely reported significant environmental changes in sub-Saharan communities caused by population change and expansion of built-up areas have seldom been documented in detail. Poor documentation of environmental changes and their effects may contribute to poor governance and planning in parts of the region. This study examined change in the form and attributes of areas under different land cover in a relatively homogenous Yoruba ethnic group community in Southwestern Nigeria. It used a mix-method approach of remote sensing and social surveys analysis. Landsat images covering the area for 1986, 2000 and 2016 were evaluated for land use/cover change, and the impact of the changes was assessed with social surveys (questionnaire administration and key informant interviews). Results showed a 212.2% increase in the built-up area and a corresponding decrease in forest and surface water area (streams) by 74.4% and 66.3%, respectively. Coping strategies were weak and overtly reactive, as there appeared to be no evidence of any previous plan for response to such degrading effects. The study concluded that urbanization exhibits degrading effects on land and water attributes in the area, and therefore recommends improved monitoring of the region through relevant policy and institutional investitures.

TI  - Satellite-based data fusion crop type classification and mapping in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Field-scale crop monitoring is essential for agricultural management and policy making for food security and sustainability. Automating crop classification process while elaborating a workflow is a key step for reliable and precise crop mapping. This study aims to develop an approach for crop classification in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, following the specific goals of i) evaluating spatial satellite-based features to guide crop data collection; ii) testing transfer learning model with subsequent growing season data; iii) examining accuracy in early-season prediction model; and lastly, iv) developing a crop classification model for estimating large scale crop area. As main data inputs, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation data were used to extract features to input in the Random Forest classifier. Spatial variability of satellite features was evaluated using Moran's I Index and cluster k-means. Crop area prediction data were obtained at municipality level to compare with census data (standard method). A crop summer map layer was generated for three major crops: soybeans (Glycine max L.), corn (Zea mays L.), and rice (Oryza sativa L.) in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The crop classification model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.95. Model performance was influenced by sample size and spatial variability of the samples. The random forest model was transferred to the next growing season with 0.89 and 0.91 overall accuracy for 250 and 750 samples, respectively. However, overall accuracy increased from 0.93 to 0.95 when 50 to 250 samples of same-year data was aggregated to the model. Similar accuracy was obtained for predictions done with data until March relative to when the entire season was considered, until May. When data for more growing seasons were aggregated, the model produced more accurate early season predictions (January and February). Soybean prediction area obtained the highest performance (R-2 = 0.94), relative to rice (R-2 = 0.90) and corn (R-2 = 0.37). The rice prediction area presented a high precision, but the crop area was overestimated due to errors with wetland target relative to other class. Lastly, this study presents the first crop map layer of the three major field crops for the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, serving as a foundation for the creation of crop type maps for other states in the country and around the globe.

TI  - Intrataxonomic trends in herbivore enamel δ<SUP>13</SUP>C are decoupled from ecosystem woody cover
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of enamel stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13(enamel)) of fossil herbivores is an important tool for making inferences about Plio-Pleistocene vegetation structure in Africa and the environmental context of hominin evolution. Many palaeoecological studies implicitly or explicitly assume that individual variation in C-3-C-4 plant consumption among fossil herbivores directly reflects the abundance of C-3 (trees, shrubs) or C-4 (low-altitude tropical grasses) vegetation. However, a strong link between delta C-13(enamel) of herbivores and ecosystem vegetation structure has not been rigorously established. Here we combine delta C-13(enamel) data from a large dataset (n = 1,643) with multidecadal Landsat estimates of C-3 woody cover across 30 African ecosystems to show that there is little relationship between intrataxonomic variation in delta C-13(enamel) and vegetation structure. This is especially true when removing forested ecosystems (>80% woody cover)-which numerous lines of evidence suggest are rare in the Plio-Pleistocene fossil record of eastern Africa-from our analyses. Our findings stand in contrast with the common assumption that variation in herbivore delta C-13(enamel) values reflects changes in the relative abundance of C-3-C-4 vegetation. We conclude that analyses using herbivore delta C-13(enamel) data to shed light on the environmental context of hominin evolution should look to explicitly community-level approaches for making vegetation inferences.Combining a published dataset of stable carbon isotopes from herbivore tooth enamel with multidecadal Landsat estimates of C-3 woody cover across 30 African ecosystems, the authors show that there is little relationship between intrataxonomic variation in delta C-13 enamel and vegetation structure, leading them to recommend a community-level approach for making vegetation inferences.

TI  - Advances in aerosol optical depth evaluation from broadband direct normal irradiance measurements
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols are part of the attenuation processes that impact solar radiation within the atmosphere. They influence the availability and spectrum of the solar resource for each location at the earth's surface. The present study presents advances in the development of a methodology intended to estimate the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at a given location from broadband direct normal irradiance (DNI) measurements and an appropriate radiative transfer model (RTM) operated backwards. For this purpose, databases provided by AERONET and BSRN at 16 stations throughout the world are jointly employed as inputs to the proposed methodology. The validation of two RTMs (SMARTS and SOLIS) is first undertaken to estimate DNI under clear-sky conditions at each station, assuming both AOD and additional atmospheric inputs are known from sunphotometric measurements. Results indicate that both models achieve good performance, characterized by a relative rRMSE of 3.2% for SMARTS and 3.8% for SOLIS. In the second, and most important stage, the AOD at 550 nm (AOD550) is derived using these models again, but in an iterative mode, now using the 1-minute DNI measurements as inputs. Periods of clear line of sight to the sun first need to be selected from the irradiance measurement record. This, along with other difficulties, make this operation prone to errors when only DNI measurements are available. In spite of this, the results show that AOD can be estimated with a 16-site average mean bias error of only between -0.024 and 0.015 AOD unit and an absolute RMSE between 0.025 and 0.050 AOD unit (compared to the AERONET ground truth), depending on model. Notable improvements are obtained if secondary atmospheric variables are extracted from the MERRA-2 reanalysis and are included as inputs for local computations. The present results suggest that the method is able to compare favorably with AOD estimates from MERRA-2 predictions or MODIS observations, for instance.

TI  - Kinetic and structural parameters governing Fic-mediated adenylylation/AMPylation of the Hsp70 chaperone, BiP/GRP78
T2  - CELL STRESS & CHAPERONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fic (filamentation induced by cAMP) proteins regulate diverse cell signaling events by post-translationally modifying their protein targets, predominantly by the addition of an AMP (adenosine monophosphate). This modification is called Fic-mediated adenylylation or AMPylation. We previously reported that the human Fic protein, HYPE/FicD, is a novel regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR) that maintains homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in response to stress from misfolded proteins. Specifically, HYPE regulates UPR by adenylylating the ER chaperone, BiP/GRP78, which serves as a sentinel for UPR activation. Maintaining ER homeostasis is critical for determining cell fate, thus highlighting the importance of the HYPE-BiP interaction. Here, we study the kinetic and structural parameters that determine the HYPE-BiP interaction. By measuring the binding and kinetic efficiencies of HYPE in its activated (Adenylylation-competent) and wild type (de-AMPylation-competent) forms for BiP in its wild type and ATP-bound conformations, we determine that HYPE displays a nearly identical preference for the wild type and ATP-bound forms of BiP in vitro and preferentially de-AMPylates the wild type form of adenylylated BiP. We also show that AMPylation at BiP's Thr366 versus Thr518 sites differentially affect its ATPase activity, and that HYPE does not adenylylate UPR accessory proteins like J-protein ERdJ6. Using molecular docking models, we explain how HYPE is able to adenylylate Thr366 and Thr518 sites in vitro. While a physiological role for AMPylation at both the Thr366 and Thr518 sites has been reported, our molecular docking model supports Thr518 as the structurally preferred modification site. This is the first such analysis of the HYPE-BiP interaction and offers critical insights into substrate specificity and target recognition.

TI  - Assessment of linear relationships between TanDEM-X coherence and canopy height as well as aboveground biomass in tropical forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about the forest structure attributes like canopy height and aboveground biomass (AGB) are crucial for forest monitoring systems and in the assessment of the global carbon cycle. The globally available TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement (TanDEM-X) data are a potential data source for estimating canopy height and AGB. Several empirical and semi-empirical investigations have indicated a linear relationship between X-band coherence and canopy height as well as AGB. The generality of this relationship is to date underexplored. In this study, the volume coherence of bistatic TanDEM-X acquisitions was retrieved and linearly related to canopy height and AGB in different tropical study areas to assess the generality of their relationship. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data were also used to complement the estimation of canopy height and AGB with the X-band volume coherence. The results indicated that the linear function provides a statistically significant fit to the observed relationship between coherence and canopy height as well as AGB. The estimation of canopy height with this linear relationship resulted in a coefficient of determination R (2) of 0.72 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.4 m (15.7%), where the AGB estimation had a decreased accuracy with an R (2) of 0.59 and RMSE of 88.2 t ha(-1) (21%). The estimation where the LiDAR (light detection and ranging)-based AGB relationship and coherence was combined revealed generally similar accuracies compared to the coherence alone. This confirms that the TanDEM-X coherence can support the consistent estimation of canopy height and AGB, where it provides as a minimum a source for a stratification to assess the spatial distribution of qualitative AGB classes.

TI  - CLASSIC v1.0: the open-source community successor to the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) and the Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (CTEM) - Part 2: Global benchmarking
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Canadian Land Surface Scheme Including Biogeochemical Cycles (CLASSIC) is an open-source community model designed to address research questions that explore the role of the land surface in the global climate system. Here, we evaluate how well CLASSIC reproduces the energy, water, and carbon cycle when forced with quasi-observed meteorological data. Model skill scores summarize how well model output agrees with observation-based reference data across multiple statistical metrics. A lack of agreement may be due to deficiencies in the model, its forcing data, and/or reference data. To address uncertainties in the forcing, we evaluate an ensemble of CLASSIC runs that is based on three meteorological data sets. To account for observational uncertainty, we compute benchmark skill scores that quantify the level of agreement among independent reference data sets. The benchmark scores demonstrate what score values a model may realistically achieve given the uncertainties in the observations. Our results show that uncertainties associated with the forcing and observations are considerably large. For instance, for 10 out of 19 variables assessed in this study, the sign of the bias changes depending on what forcing and reference data are used. Benchmark scores are much lower than expected, implying large observational uncertainties. Model and benchmark score values are mostly similar, indicating that CLASSIC performs well when considering observational uncertainty. Future model development should address (i) a positive albedo bias and resulting shortwave radiation bias in parts of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropics and Tibetan Plateau, (ii) an out-of-phase seasonal gross primary productivity cycle in the humid tropics of South America and Africa, (iii) a lacking spatial correlation of annual mean net ecosystem exchange with site-level measurements, (iv) an underestimation of fractional area burned and corresponding emissions in the boreal forests, (v) a negative soil organic carbon bias in high latitudes, and (vi) a time lag in seasonal leaf area index maxima in parts of the NH extratropics. Our results will serve as a baseline for guiding and monitoring future CLASSIC development.

TI  - Evaluating the benefits of chlorophyll fluorescence for in-season crop productivity forecasting
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) shows promise for monitoring the productivity of global agricultural systems. SIF-based primary productivity metrics have demonstrated higher fidelity to largescale patterns of crop productivity than reflectance-based vegetation indices when averaged across the growing season. In-season crop yield forecasting typically relies upon reflectance-based vegetation indices, raising the question of whether in-season monitoring could be improved by utilizing SIF. Here, we analyze patterns of US agricultural productivity from USDA surveys and their in-season relationships with coarse-resolution GOME-2 SIF, high-resolution downscaled SIF, SIF-based primary productivity metrics, MODIS NDVI, and MODIS GPP. We find that coarse-resolution SIF-based metrics and NDVI exhibit similar out-of-sample in-season (April-July and April-August) predictive ability, even when spatially filtering higher-resolution NDVI data to cropland areas. The downscaled SIF product performed more poorly than the coarse-resolution SIF, and MODIS GPP performed more poorly than MODIS NDVI. All forecasts are improved by incorporating county fixed effects to control for crosssectional differences between counties. NDVI-based metrics allow for significantly better yield predictions during drought conditions than SIF-based metrics, suggesting limited added value of SIF for early warning of drought impacts. The benefits of SIF for crop monitoring should be continually evaluated as the frequency and quality of SIF measurements continue to improve.

TI  - U-High resolution network (U-HRNet): cloud detection with high-resolution representations for geostationary satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is one of the important tasks for remote sensing image preprocessing. In this work, multiple infrared observation channels with high time resolution are utilized to extract cloud from geostationary satellite imagery. Compared with detected cloud mask from polar satellite data with the high spatial resolution, the detection from geostationary satellite data has high timeliness and practicability, but it is challenging for the detailed segmentation ability of the network. Due to the fact that some small clouds only occupy a few pixels in geostationary satellite images with low spatial resolution, the existing network has poor segmentation ability for these small targets. To tackle this problem, a new neural network named U-High Resolution Network (U-HRNet) is proposed for cloud detection. Combing both multi-scale feature extraction using a High Resolution Network (HRNet) architecture and merging shallow information and deep information via the skip connection (SC) of a U-Net structure, the proposed U-HRNet produces strong high-resolution representations for accurate detection of details on cloud segmentation. The accuracy of the method is evaluated by manually labelled ground truth against different methods using objective evaluation indices. The results proved the proposed U-HRNet performs well on FengYun-4A (FY-4A) images and can effectively detect incorrect areas of the cloud mask products of the National Satellite Meteorological Centre (NSMC), depicting outperformance over existing methods.

TI  - Intra-seasonal variations in urban land surface temperature in two cities in Sierra Leone: the challenge of using a single-date image to represent a whole season
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of a single date remotely sensed image to represent seasonal land surface temperature (LST) is a common practice whose reliability has not been tested, even though that might be unrepresentative of the season. Through remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, this paper examined the effects of using a single date image to represent the whole season by quantifying the intra-seasonal (intra- and inter-month) LST variations in Freetown (coastal city) and Bo (inland city), Sierra Leone. Multi-date Landsat images within three months (two images per month) in the dry season were used to retrieve the LST using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) threshold method. The results showed that the spatial structures of LST were not uniform on different dates during the same season in both cities. LST differed by as much as 2 degrees C for scenes within the same month and as much as 4 degrees C between scenes of different months. The results also showed that the highest intra- and inter-month LST variations were recorded in Freetown than in Bo. This is attributed to the combined influences of the proximity to the ocean, the mountain ranges and surface characteristics in Freetown. Thus, within a season, urban surface temperature varies not just in space based on the surface characteristics but also the variations between two urban areas could be significantly high. This renders surface temperature analysis based on a single date image unrepresentative due to the inability to incorporate such variability. The use of multi-date images could be more representative and can improve studies on urban LST.

TI  - Land subsidence induced by underground coal mining at Quang Ninh, Vietnam: persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar observation using Sentinel-1 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence occurs in Ha Long and Cam Pha cities due to human activities in which the underground coal mining exploitation plays a crucial responsibility. For mapping the spatial distribution of this phenomenon and monitoring its evolution over the time, the Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) approach was applied to 56 Sentinel-1A images, captured from June 2015 to June 2019. This approach allows monitoring ground displacement by continuously measuring the position of objects that persistently scatter radar beams. This interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique extracts deformation signals and it can be applied to areas where the discontinuous land subsidence is occurring. The mean land subsidence velocity map shows that two principal areas in Ha Long city including Ha Lam, Ha Trung, Ha Khanh, and Ha Tu wards, and Cam Pha city, specifically Mong Duong ward have been subsided in recent years with the maximum velocity of 14.5 mm year(-1) and a cumulative displacement ranging from 30 to 50 mm in the Line Of Sight (LOS) direction over 4 years. Field investigation recognized the direct impact of this phenomenon on houses, infrastructures, and natural features located above the underground coal mining utilities. This hazard has a close relationship with the exploiting process of coal seams, which alternately lay inside the sedimentary layers of the Hon Gai formation.

TI  - Update of seagrass cover and species diversity in Southern Viet Nam using remote sensing data and molecular analyses
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Along with coral reefs and mangroves, seagrass meadows are being threatened globally Southeast Asia is considered within the area of seagrasses' cradle of diversity. However, information on the current status of seagrass beds from Southern Viet Nam is limited due to lack of reliable data about seagrass species occurring in the Southeast Asian region. One factor is the difficulty of unambiguous species identification. For example, the leaf morphological characteristics of Halophila ovalis and closely related species are overlapping which leads to misidentifications. In this study, the latest satellite Landsat 8 OLI and SENTINEL-2B image analyses were applied to determine the distribution of seagrass beds in Southern Viet Nam. Detailed morphological and genetic marker analyses were used to determine and update the species composition. The present study together with literature reviews indicate that the total area of seagrass beds from Southern Viet Nam are 10,832.1 ha. 2562 ha (or 19.1%) of seagrass coverage has been lost. The seagrass beds at Phu Quoc Island are the largest with 7579 ha. The occurrence of Halophila major is updated for almost all off-shore islands and open-water areas. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Impact of thermal condition on vegetation feedback under greening trend of China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In China, an unambiguous greening trend was observed over the last three decades. The feedback induced by vegetation growth can affect regional climate. Here, we investigated how vegetation feeds back to land surface temperature (LST) in temperature zones and land-use types in China using 18-years (2001-2018) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. We first showed that vegetation feedback was significantly negative (p < 0.1, t-test) in most parts of China. Specifically, we discovered a downtrend of vegetation feedback from the coldest temperature zone to the hottest temperature zone. Moreover, vegetation feedback and thermal condition showed an inverse relationship among temperature zones. The inverse relationship clarified that vegetation growth can cool most parts of China during climate change. In the end, we showed the pattern of vegetation feedback among land-use types. Due to the expansion of grassland, vegetation feedback may temporarily positive. Suitable vegetation coverage in urban land, banning deforestation, and cultivating land reasonably can decrease the local temperature by inducing negative vegetation feedback.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Normal Faulting Movement During the 2020 Mw 6.4 Yutian Earthquake: A Shallow Rupture in NW Tibet Revealed by Geodetic Measurements
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ENE striking Longmu Co fault and the North Altyn Tagh left-lateral slip fault have led to the complex regional structure in the northwestern Tibetan Plateau, resulting in a series of normal faulting and strike slip faulting earthquakes. Using both the ascending and descending Sentinel-1A/B radar images, we depict the coseismic deformation caused by the 2020 Yutian Mw 6.4 earthquake with a peak subsidence of similar to 20 cm. We determine the seismogenic fault geometry by applying the Bayesian approach with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling method, which can better characterize the posterior probability density functions of the source model parameters. The estimation results reveal that the earthquake is a normal faulting event with a moderate strike slip component. Based on the optimal fault geometry model, we extend the fault plane and invert for the distributed coseismic slip model. The optimal slip model shows that the coseismic slip is mainly concentrated at shallow depths of 3-10 km with a maximum slip of similar to 1.0 m. Our preferred geodetic coseismic model exhibits no surface rupture, which may likely be due to the shallow slip deficit in the uppermost crust. We calculate the combined loading effect of the Coulomb failure stress changes induced by the coseismic dislocations and postseismic viscoelastic relaxation of the 2008 Mw 7.1, 2012 Mw 6.4 and 2014 Mw 6.9 Yutian events. Our study demonstrates that the three preceding major Yutian shocks were insufficient to trigger the 2020 Yutian earthquake, which we consider perhaps reflects the natural release of elastic strain accumulated mainly through localized tectonic movement. We attribute the 2020 Yutian event to the release of extensional stress in a stepover zone controlled by the Longmu Co and the North Altyn Tagh sinistral strike slip fault systems. The seismic risk in the southwest end of the North Altyn Tagh fault has been elevated by the Yutian earthquake sequences, which require future attention.

TI  - A cloud classification method based on random forest for FY-4A
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud is complicated due to its various types and distribution on different layers. Various classification principles and overlapping of clouds on multiple layers make it difficult to classify clouds correctly. A cloud classification method based on random forest (RF) for FengYun-4A (FY-4A) is presented in this paper, aiming at obtaining cloud classification products with high temporal resolution and extensive coverage. The method classifies clouds into multi-layer clouds and 8 categories of single-layer clouds (Deep convective cloud, Nimbostratus, Cumulus, Stratocumulus, Stratus, Altocumulus, Altostratus and Cirrus). Additionally, multi-layer clouds are further classified into 12 categories of two-layer clouds (combinations of 8 single-layer clouds). CloudSat cloud classification products are used as the target class and to evaluate the method. In order to classify clouds correctly, it is necessary to capture cloud properties comprehensively. Thus we perform comparative pre-experiments to analyse the effects of FY-4A cloud products on cloud classification. It is demonstrated that clouds products can improve cloud classification. Therefore, cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud effective radius (CER) and cloud top height (CTH) are used as dataset together with multispectral data in cloud classification. Cloud classification models based on different algorithms and different channels combinations are compared. The results show that RF models perform better than K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) models and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) models in cloud classification, and models using all channels' data perform better than models using data of selected channels combination. The method can provide cloud types and distribution for a FY-4A scan full disk in low time cost. Especially, it gives more specific types for multi-layer clouds, which can provide reference for subsequent research on cloud classification and FY-4A satellite.

TI  - Analysis of Surface Deformation in East Dongting Lake Based on 2016-2019 Sentinel-1A Dataset
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, 84 scenes Sentinel-1A satellite datasets from October 2016 to September 2019 were used to analyze surface deformation in East Dongting Lake, China, by employing the small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) method. The data are divided into two seasons, i.e., the flood and dry seasons. It was suggested that the surface deformation is related to the distribution of the river network and water flow activities. During the dry season, the water flow is active along the internal river, scouring the surrounding soil. During the flood season, the water flow basically occurs around the external drainage network. By qualitatively comparing surface deformation and precipitation changes as well as changes in soil erosion, it is found that the deformation was highly related to soil erosion and seasonal precipitation. The precipitation in the flood period is heavy than that in the dry season. Therefore, the runoff with amount silt will scour the soil in the passing area, resulting obvious surface deformation. During the dry period, surface deformation is smaller due to the less precipitation.

TI  - Tracking small-scale tropical forest disturbances: Fusing the Landsat and Sentinel-2 data record
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on forest disturbance is crucial for tropical forest management and global carbon cycle analysis. The long-term collection of data from the Landsat missions provides some of the most valuable information for understanding the processes of global tropical forest disturbance. However, there are substantial uncertainties in the estimation of non-mechanized, small-scale (i.e., small area) clearings in tropical forests with Landsat series images. Because the appearance of small-scale openings in a tropical tree canopy are often ephemeral due to fastgrowing vegetation, and because clouds are frequent in tropical regions, it is challenging for Landsat images to capture the logging signal. Moreover, the spatial resolution of Landsat images is typically too coarse to represent spatial details about small-scale clearings. In this paper, by fusing all available Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, we proposed a method to improve the tracking of small-scale tropical forest disturbance history with both fine spatial and temporal resolutions. First, yearly composited Landsat and Sentinel-2 self-referenced normalized burn ratio (rNBR) vegetation index images were calculated from all available Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2 scenes during 2016-2019. Second, a deep-learning based downscaling method was used to predict fine resolution (10 m) rNBR images from the annual coarse resolution (30 m) Landsat rNBR images. Third, given the baseline Landsat forest map in 2015, the generated fine-resolution Landsat rNBR images and original Sentinel-2 rNBR images were fused to produce the 10 m forest disturbance map for the period 2016-2019. From data comparison and evaluation, it was demonstrated that the deep-learning based downscaling method can produce fineresolution Landsat rNBR images and forest disturbance maps that contain substantial spatial detail. In addition, by fusing downscaled fine-resolution Landsat rNBR images and original Sentinel-2 rNBR images, it was possible to produce state-of-the-art forest disturbance maps with OA values more than 87% and 96% for the small and large study areas, and detected 11% to 21% more disturbed areas than either the Sentinel-2 or Landsat-7/8 time-series alone. We found that 1.42% of the disturbed areas indentified during 2016-2019 experienced multiple forest disturbances. The method has great potential to enhance work undertaken in relation to major policies such as the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) programmes.

TI  - Hospital-treated deliberate self-poisoning patients: Drug-induced delirium and clinical outcomes
T2  - AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective:Drug-induced delirium has been attributed to opioid, benzodiazepine, antipsychotic, antihistaminic and anticholinergic drug groups at therapeutic doses. Delirium also occurs in hospital-treated self-poisoning (at supra-therapeutic doses), although the causative drug classes are not well established and co-ingestion is common. We tested the magnitude and direction of association of five major drug groups with incident cases of delirium.Methods:A retrospective longitudinal cohort (n = 5131) study was undertaken of deliberate and recreational/chronic misuse poisoning cases from a regional sentinel toxicology unit. We described ingestion and co-ingestion patterns and estimated the unadjusted and adjusted odds for developing a drug-induced delirium. We also estimated the odds of drug-induced delirium being associated with three outcomes: intensive care unit admission, general hospital length of stay and discharge to home.Results:Drug-induced delirium occurred in 3.9% of cases (n = 200). The unadjusted odds ratios for development of delirium were increased for anticholinergics 10.79 (5.43-21.48), antihistamines 6.10 (4.20-8.84) and antipsychotics 2.99 (2.20-4.06); non-significant for opioids 1.31 (95% confidence interval = [0.81, 2.13]); and reduced for benzodiazepines 0.37 (0.24-0.58); with little change after adjustment for age, gender and co-ingestion. Delirium was associated with intensive care unit admission, longer length of stay and discharge destination.Conclusion:Drug-induced delirium was uncommon in this population. Co-ingestion was common but did not alter the risk. In contrast to drug-induced delirium at therapeutic doses in older populations, opioids were not associated with delirium and benzodiazepines were protective. Drug-induced delirium required increased clinical services. Clinical services should be funded and prepared to provide additional supportive care for these deliriogenic drug group ingestions.

TI  - Statistical estimation of next-day nighttime surface urban heat islands
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating future temporal patterns of Surface Urban Heat Islands (SUHIs) on multiple time scales is an ongoing research endeavor. Among these time scales, estimation of next-day SUHIs is of special significance to urban residents, yet we currently lack a simple but efficient approach for making such estimations. In the present study, we propose a statistical strategy for estimating next-day nighttime SUHIs, based on incorporating various SUHI controls into a support vector machine regression (SVR) model. The majority of both the surface controls (including factors related to land cover and solar radiation) and meteorological controls (including temperature fluctuations, relative humidity, accumulated precipitation, wind speed, aerosol optical depth, and soil moisture) that have previously been found to account for daily SUHI variations were used as estimators, and we provide estimations for both the overall SUHI intensity (SUHII) and pixel-by-pixel Gaussian-based LSTs over 59 Chinese megacities. For the overall SUHII, the mean absolute error (MAE) is 0.67 K on average, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is no more than 25% for more than 90% of the cities. For the pixel-by-pixel LSTs, the associated MAE is less than 2.0 K in most scenarios. In addition, the contribution from each selected estimator to SUHII estimation is assessed comprehensively. Among all the estimators, the contribution from relative humidity is the greatest, followed by rural surface temperature and surface air temperature. Moreover, for nearly 78% of the cities, the estimators related to day-to-day SUHI variations make a larger contribution than those related to intra-annual SUHI variations. We conclude that our simple yet effective statistical approach for estimating next-day SUHIs can potentially help urban residents to better adapt to urban heat stress.

TI  - Efficient multi-objective calibration and uncertainty analysis of distributed snow simulations in rugged alpine terrain
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In mountainous terrain, reliable snow simulations are crucial for many applications. However, except in highly instrumented research catchments, meteorological data are usually limited, and so the interpolated spatial fields used to force snow models are uncertain. Moreover, certain potentially important processes cannot presently be simulated at catchment scales using entirely physical algorithms. It is therefore often appropriate to introduce empirical parameters into otherwise physically-based snow models. Many opportunities to incorporate snow observations into the parameter estimation process now exist, but they remain to be fully exploited. In this context, a novel approach to the calibration of an energy balance-based snow model that additionally accounts for gravitational redistribution is presented. Several important parameters were estimated using an efficient, gradient-based method with respect to two complementary observation types - Landsat 8-derived snow extent maps, and reconstructed snow water equivalent (SWE) time-series. When assessed on a per-pixel basis, observed patterns were ultimately reproduced with a mean accuracy of 85%. Spatial performance metrics compared favourably with those previously reported, whilst the temporal evolution of SWE at the stations was also satisfactorily captured. Subsequent uncertainty and data worth analyses revealed that: i) the propensity for model predictions to be erroneous was substantially reduced by calibration, ii) pre-calibration uncertainty was largely associated with two parameters which modify the longwave component of the energy balance, but this uncertainty was greatly diminished by calibration, and iii) a lower elevation SWE series was particularly valuable, despite containing comparatively few observations. Overall, our work demonstrates that contemporary snow models, observation technologies, and inverse approaches can be combined to both constrain and quantify the uncertainty associated with simulations of alpine snow dynamics.

TI  - Performance of Ocean Colour Chlorophyll a algorithms for Sentinel-3 OLCI, MODIS-Aqua and Suomi-VIIRS in open-ocean waters of the Atlantic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The proxy for phytoplankton biomass, Chlorophyll a (Chl a), is an important variable to assess the health and state of the oceans which are under increasing anthropogenic pressures. Prior to the operational use of satellite ocean-colour Chl a to monitor the oceans, rigorous assessments of algorithm performance are necessary to select the most suitable products. Due to their inaccessibility, the oligotrophic open-ocean gyres are under-sampled and therefore under-represented in global in situ data sets. The Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) campaigns fill the sampling gap in Atlantic oligotrophic waters. In-water underway spectrophotometric data were collected on three AMT field campaigns in 2016, 2017 and 2018 to assess the performance of Sentinel-3A (S3-A) and Sentinel3B (S3-B) Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) products. Three Chl a algorithms for OLCI were compared: Processing baseline (pb) 2, which uses the ocean colour 4 band ratio algorithm (OC4Me); pb 3 (OL_L2M.003.00) which uses OC4Me and a colour index (CI); and POLYMER v4.8 which models atmosphere and water reflectance and retrieves Chl a as a part of its spectral matching inversion. The POLYMER Chl a for S-3A OLCI performed best. The S-3A OLCI pb 2 tended to under-estimate Chl a especially at low concentrations, while the updated OL_L2M.003.00 provided significant improvements at low concentrations. OLCI data were also compared to MODIS-Aqua (R2018 processing) and Suomi-NPP VIIRS standard products. MODIS-Aqua exhibited good performance similar to OLCI POLYMER whereas Suomi-NPP VIIRS exhibited a slight under-estimate at higher Chl a values. The reasons for the differences were that S-3A OLCI pb 2 Rrs were over-estimated at blue bands which caused the under-estimate in Chl a. There were also some artefacts in the Rrs spectral shape of VIIRS which caused Chl a to be under-estimated at values >0.1 mg m-3. In addition, using in situ Rrs to compute Chl a with OC4Me we found a bias of 25% for these waters, related to the implementation of the OC4ME algorithm for S-3A OLCI. By comparison, the updated OLCI processor OL_L2M.003.00 significantly improved the Chl a retrievals at lower concentrations corresponding to the AMT measurements. S-3A and S-3B OLCI Chl a products were also compared during the Sentinel-3 mission tandem phase (the period when S-3A and S-3B were flying 30 sec apart along the same orbit). Both S-3A and S-3B OLCI pb 2 under-estimated Chl a especially at low values and the trend was greater for S-3A compared to S-3B. The performance of OLCI was improved by using either OL_L2M.003.00 or POLYMER Chl a. Analysis of coincident satellite images for S-3A OLCI, MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS as composites and over large areas illustrated that OLCI POLYMER gave the highest Chl a concentrations and percentage (%) coverage over the north and south Atlantic gyres, and OLCI pb 2 produced the lowest Chl a and % coverage.

TI  - Shear-Related Gold Ores in the Wadi Hodein Shear Belt, South Eastern Desert of Egypt: Analysis of Remote Sensing, Field and Structural Data
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-borne multispectral and radar data were used to comprehensively map geological contacts, lithologies and structural elements controlling gold-bearing quartz veins in the Wadi Hodein area in Egypt. In this study, enhancement algorithms, band combinations, band math (BM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), decorrelation stretch and mineralogical indices were applied to Landsat-8 OLI, ASTER and ALOS PALSAR following a pre-designed flow chart. Together with the field observations, the results of the image processing techniques were exported to the GIS environment and subsequently fused to generate a potentiality map. The Wadi Hodein shear belt is a ductile shear corridor developed in response to non-coaxial convergence and northward escape tectonics that accompanied the final stages of terrane accretion and cratonization (similar to 680-600 Ma) in the northern part of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. The evolution of this shear belt encompassed a protracted similar to E-W shortening and recurrent sinistral transpression as manifested by east-dipping thrusts and high-angle reverse shear zones. Gold-mineralized shear zones cut heterogeneously deformed ophiolites and metavolcaniclastic rocks and attenuate in and around granodioritic intrusions. The gold mineralization event was evidently epigenetic in the metamorphic rocks and was likely attributed to rejuvenated tectonism and circulation of hot fluids during transpressional deformation. The superposition of the NW-SE folds by NNW-trending, kilometer scale tight and reclined folds shaped the overall framework of the Wadi Hodein belt. Shallow NNW- or SSE-plunging mineral and stretching lineations on steeply dipping shear planes depict a considerable simple shear component. The results of image processing complying with field observations and structural analysis suggest that the coincidence of shear zones, hydrothermal alteration and crosscutting dikes in the study area could be considered as a model criterion in exploration for new gold targets.

TI  - Usage of antecedent soil moisture for improving the performance of rainfall thresholds for landslide early warning
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides triggered by heavy rains are increasing in number and creating severe losses in hilly regions across the world. Rainfall thresholds on regional and local-scales are being used for forecasting such events, for efficient early warning. Empirical and probabilistic approaches for defining rainfall thresholds are traditional tools which are being used as part of the forecasting system for rainfall induced landslides. Such methods are easy-to-use and are based on statistical analyses. They can be derived without looking into the complex hydro-geological processes involved in slope failures, but are often associated with the disadvantage of higher false alarms, limiting their applications in a regional landslide early warning system (LEWS). This study is an attempt to improve the performance of conventional meteorological thresholds by considering the effect of soil moisture, using a probabilistic approach. Idukki district in southern part of India is highly susceptible to landslides and has witnessed major socio-economical setbacks in the recent disasters happened in 2018 and 2019. This tourist hub is now in need of a landslide forecasting system, which can help in landslide risk reduction. This study attempts to understand the effect of averaged soil moisture estimates derived from passive microwave remote sensing data, for improving the performance of conventional empirical and probabilistic thresholds. For defining empirical thresholds, an algorithm-based approach such as Calculation of Thresholds for Rainfall-induced Landslides Tool (CTRL-T) has been used. Probabilistic thresholds were defined using a Bayesian approach, finding the posterior probability of occurrence using the marginal and conditional probabilities of the control parameters along with the prior probability of occurrence of landslide. The derived rainfall thresholds were quantitatively compared with the Bayesian probabilistic threshold derived using rainfall severity and soil wetness using an area under the curve (AUC) based on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve method. The results show that when the antecedent moisture content in soil is less, only severe rainfall events can trigger landslides in the study area; while less severe rainfall events can also trigger landslides when the soil is wet. The role of soil wetness in the initiation is used to improve the performance of the conventional methods, and a ROC approach was used for the statistical comparison of different models. Further, the results indicated that the probabilistic threshold using rainfall severity and soil wetness outperformed the conventional approaches with AUC of 0.96, being the most sensitive and specific among the models considered. This result opens new promising perspectives for the development of an operational LEWS in the Idukki district based on a combination of rainfall and soil moisture data. Moreover, this work contributes to strengthen the advancing trend of hydro-meteorological thresholds based on soil moisture, which is gaining a growing attention in landslide studies and that, to date, was lacking evidences in monsoon regions.

TI  - Comparison of Satellite Driven Surface Energy Balance Models in Estimating Crop Evapotranspiration in Semi-Arid to Arid Inter-Mountain Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The regional-scale estimation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) over a heterogeneous surface is an important tool for the decision-makers in managing and allocating water resources. This is especially critical in the arid to semi-arid regions that require supplemental water due to insufficient precipitation, soil moisture, or groundwater. Over the years, various remote sensing-based surface energy balance (SEB) models have been developed to accurately estimate ETc over a regional scale. However, it is important to carry out the SEB model assessment for a particular geographical setting to ensure the suitability of a model. Thus, in this study, four commonly used and contrasting remote sensing models viz. METRIC (mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration), SEBAL (surface energy balance algorithm for land), S-SEBI (simplified surface energy balance index), and SEBS (surface energy balance system) were compared and used to quantify and map the spatio-temporal variation of ETc in the semi-arid to arid inter-mountain region of Big Horn Basin, Wyoming (Landsat Path/Row: 37/29). Model estimates from 19 cloud-free Landsat 7 and 8 images were compared with the Bowen ratio energy balance system (BREBS) flux stationed in a center pivot irrigated field during 2017 (sugar beet), 2018 (dry bean), and 2019 (barley) growing seasons. The results indicated that all SEB models are effective in capturing the variation of ETc with R-2 ranging in between 0.06 to 0.95 and RMSD between 0.07 to 0.15 mm h(-1). Pooled data over three vegetative surfaces for three years under irrigated conditions revealed that METRIC (NSE = 0.9) performed better across all land cover types, followed by SEBS (NSE = 0.76), S-SEBI (NSE = 0.73), and SEBAL (NSE = 0.65). In general, all SEB models substantially overestimated ETc and underestimated sensible heat (H) fluxes under dry conditions when only crop residue was available at the surface. A mid-season density plot and absolute difference maps at image scale between the models showed that models involving METRIC, SEBAL, and S-SEBI are close in their estimates of daily crop evapotranspiration (ET24) with pixel-wise RMSD ranged from 0.54 to 0.76 mm d(-1) and an average absolute difference across the study area ranged from 0.47 to 0.56 mm d(-1). Likewise, all the SEB models underestimated the seasonal ETc, except SEBS.

TI  - Analysis of Built-Up Areas of Small Polish Cities with the Use of Deep Learning and Geographically Weighted Regression
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Small cities are an important part of the settlement system, a link between rural areas and large cities. Although they perform important functions, research focuses on large cities and metropolises while marginalizing small cities, the study of which is of great importance to progress in social sciences, geography, and urban planning. The main goal of this paper was to verify the impact of selected socio-economic factors on the share of built-up areas in 665 small Polish cities in 2019. Data from the Database of Topographic Objects (BDOT), Sentinel-2 satellite imagery from 2015 and 2019, and Local Data Bank by Statistics Poland form 2019 were used in the research. A machine learning segmentation procedure was used to obtain the data on the occurrence of built-up areas. Hot Spot (Getis-Ord Gi*) analysis and geographically weighted regression (GWR) was applied to explain spatially varying impact of factors related to population, spatial and economic development, and living standards on the share of built-up areas in the area of small cities. Significant association was found between the population density and the share of built-up areas in the area of the cities studied. The influence of the other socio-economic factors examined, related to the spatial and economic development of the cities and the quality of life of the inhabitants, showed great regional variation. The results also indicated that the share of built-up areas in the area of the cities under study is a result of the conditions under which they were established and developed throughout their existence, and not only of the socio-economic factors affecting them at present.

TI  - Fault-Based Geological Lineaments Extraction Using Remote Sensing and GIS-A Review
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Geological lineaments are the earth's linear features indicating significant tectonic units in the crust associated with the formation of minerals, active faults, groundwater controls, earthquakes, and geomorphology. This study aims to provide a systematic review of the state-of-the-art remote sensing techniques and data sets employed for geological lineament analysis. The critical challenges of this approach and the diverse data verification and validation techniques will be presented. Thus, this review spanned academic articles published since 1975, including expert reports and theses. Landsat series, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Sentinel 2 are the prevalent optical remote sensing data widely used for lineament detection. Moreover, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) derived Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR), Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), and Sentinel 1 are the typical radar remotely sensed data which are widely used for the detection of geological lineaments. The geological lineaments acquired via GIS techniques are not consistent even though a variety of manual, semi-automated, and automated techniques are applied. Therefore, a single method may not provide an accurate lineament distribution and may include artifacts requiring integration of multiple algorithms, e.g., manual and automated algorithms.

TI  - Large-scale crop type and crop area mapping across Brazil using synthetic aperture radar and optical imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Improved data on crop type and crop area from satellite imagery are invaluable for agronomy managers and are crucial for balancing agricultural expansion and forest degradation. However, large-scale maps of crop type and crop area using satellite imagery are not easily available in some regions, especially Brazil. Reasons for this include limited ground truth data, inadequate spatial and temporal satellite data availability, computational challenges, lack of cropland data and field boundaries. In this paper, we attempted to overcome some of these obstacles by using an ensemble of approaches to generate crop classification maps for Brazil. In order to compensate for the lack of abundant ground truth data in Brazil, we combined extensive field data and satellite input features from the United States with available field data and satellite input features from Brazil to train crop classification model for Brazil. Before applying the crop classification model for Brazil, we classified cropland areas using harmonic functions and delineated field boundaries using a supervised deep learning approach. Cropland masking and field boundary delineation allowed field-level mapping of crop type and crop area. Applying the crop classification model for Brazil in the states of Mato Grosso and Goias gave a true positive accuracy of 88% in the 2017/2018 summer growing season for soybean classification, 95% in the 2018 safrinha growing season for corn classification, and 86% in the 2018/2019 summer growing season for soybean classification. Our crop area estimates also showed a good agreement (correlation of 0.95 and mean absolute error of 0.64) with state-scale statistical data provided by the Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento (CONAB) in both summer and safrinha growing seasons adding further confidence to the results. These results suggest that extensive data from one geography can be used to train machine learning models in conjunction with limited field data from another geography. Accuracy assessments support the portability of crop classification model for Brazil with reasonable accuracy spatially, as tested in the state of Parana, and temporally, to the following year. The approaches and datasets presented in this paper provide building blocks for large-scale crop monitoring benefitting both public and private sectors.

TI  - Modeling Water Quality Parameters Using Landsat Multispectral Images: A Case Study of Erlong Lake, Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Erlong Lake is considered one of the largest lakes in midwest Jilin, China, and one of the drinking water resources in neighboring cities. The present study aims to explore the usage of Landsat TM5, ETM7, and OLI8 images to assess water quality (V-phenol, dissolved oxygen (DO), NH4-N, NO3-N) in Erlong Lake, Jilin province, northeast China. Thirteen multispectral images were used in this study for May, July, August, and September in 2000, 2001, 2002, and October 2020. Radiometric and atmospheric corrections were applied to all images. All in situ water quality parameters were strongly correlated to each other, except DO. The in situ measurements (V-phenol, dissolved oxygen, NH4-N, NO3-N) were statistically correlated with various spectral band combinations (blue, green, red, and NIR) derived from Landsat imagery. Regression analysis reported that there are strong relationships between the estimated and retrieved water quality from the Landsat images. Moreover, in calibrations, the highest value of the coefficient of determination (R-2) was >= 0.85 with (RMSE) = 0.038; the lowest value of R-2 was >0.30 with RMSE= 0.752. All generated models were validated in different statistical indices; R-2 was up to 0.95 for most cases, with RMSE ranging from 1.390 to 0.050. Finally, the empirical algorithms were successfully assessed (V-phenol, dissolved oxygen, NH4-N, NO3-N) in Erlong Lake, using Landsat images with very good accuracy. Both in situ and model retrieved results showed the same trends with non-significant differences. September of 2000, 2001, and 2002 and October of 2020 were selected to assess the spatial distributions of V-phenol, DO, NH4-N, and NO3-N in the lake. V-phenol, NH4-N, and NO3-N were reported low in shallow water but high in deep water, while DO was high in shallow water but low in deep water of the lake. Domestic sewage, agricultural, and urban industrial pollution are the most common sources of pollution in the Erlong Lake.

TI  - Dynamics of forest loss in the southeast of the Peruvian Amazon: a case study in Madre de Dios
T2  - ECOSISTEMAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The western Amazon, specifically the region of Madre de Dios, is known as the biodiversity capital of Peru and is globally recognized as one of the most biodiverse places on Earth. However, it has been threatening by a serious problem of forest loss. The main environmental threats are due to mismanagement of the territory that causes the concentration of land, agricultural expansion, livestock, gold mining, and uncontrolled economic exploitation. This study analyzes the dynamics of forest loss and changes in land use and cover between 1999-2018. Remote sensing techniques were used to quantify forest loss. Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and 8 Operational Land Imagery (OLI). The images were processed using a supervised classification called Neural Net. The methodology includes validation procedures using field verification points and medium and high-resolution remote sensing images of different sensors (SPOT-5, PlanetScope, WorldView, and Drone). The results showed a forest loss of 1698.63 km(2) during 1999-2018, with an annual deforestation rate of -0.21%, and an average forest loss of 59.28 km(2)/year. For changes from forests to other land use, we found the conversion of 841.41 km(2) during 2014-2018. Our results indicate that agriculture is the most responsible for advancing deforestation (72.90%), while gold mining has a greater incidence in targeted sectors

TI  - Confrontations in the historical part of Shahnameh with the approach of Louis Strauss
T2  - PROPOSITOS Y REPRESENTACIONES
M3  - Article
AB  - The opposition of the opposites is also reflected in the myth of the nations and one of the main fields of the myth is the struggle of different forces. Myth is the mother of epic, and any nation that does not have a myth is also useless of epic, and the main background of the epic of any nation is its myth. So this fundamental concept has also found its way into the epic; But in the process of materialization of phenomena from myth to epic, mythical concepts are formed differently in the epic, and during this process, the confrontation of human beings or heroes with evil forces, the confrontation of two tribes and clans, The two heroes become one with each other. In general, it can be said that epic is the fruit of man's struggle with anything that is against his dreams and aspirations and in opposition to his will and action. Meanwhile, the contrast between the phenomena of nature such as night and day, darkness and light, drought and wet season, greenery and autumn and the like, had caused the human way of thinking and worldview based on the same contrast. And as a result, human mythology is full of these contradictions. Moreover, even in later periods, such a way of thinking has prevailed in the human mind and historical data have been analyzed and explained based on this approach. Another important factor in the existence of confrontation and contradiction in mythology is the existence of secondary ideas in these works; Because the important principle in the dual thought of the myths of ancient Iran is the conflict between the demonic forces and the Ahura forces, which considers the whole world as the place of these two opposing forces; Influenced by this idea, we always encounter confrontation and war between groups in Shahnameh. One of the important sources and a collection of myths and legends and even valuable historical contents of this region is Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, which is divided into three parts: mythology (from the time of Kiomars to the kingdom of Fereydoun), heroism (from the rise of the blacksmith to The assassination of Rostam and the reign of Bahman, son of Esfandiar) and historical (from the reign of Bahman and the birth of Alexander to the opening of Iran to the Arabs) has been divided.

TI  - Covariation of Passive-Active Microwave Measurements over Vegetated Surfaces: Case Studies at L-Band Passive and L-, C- and X-Band Active
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of soil and land cover scattering properties and their connection with the parameters of microwave scattering is a longstanding research topic. Recently, the advent of modern space-borne microwave radiometers like SMAP in addition to the trend towards open data for scientific use fostered the development of enhanced models based on data fusion from different platforms permitting more accurate assessments. SMAP was designed to operate on an integrated combination of a radiometer and a radar, both operating in L-band. Unexpected failure of the radar component encouraged scientists to experiment various combination of data from the surviving radiometer with other sources of radar data, notably C-band Sentinel-1 data. In this work, we present a case study on a possible combination of SMAP radiometer data with X-band radar data from TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed, comparing results with those provided by NASA from their standard production procedures. The study was performed on two test sites, one at an agricultural site in Germany and one in the Brazilian Amazon, to explore very different vegetation conditions. This work is a part of a broader research effort addressing the combination of multiple sources of passive and active microwave sensing data. The research question defining this research effort is whether the use of data from multiple active sources affords either obtaining more accurate estimates of active-passive co-variation parameters for a given observation period, or shortening the minimum observation period by increasing the temporal density of active samples. In this framework, this paper addresses a preliminary comparison of fresh and past results obtained from C-, X-, and L-band active sensing data. The observed relations offer interesting clues on the impact of band selection on soil vegetation analysis.

TI  - Nearshore Bathymetry From Fusion of Sentinel-2 and ICESat-2 Observations
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nearshore estimates of bathymetry are crucial for understanding coastal processes. However, current passive remote sensing methods for estimating bathymetry require in situ depth measurements to train inversion models, which can be difficult or impossible to obtain in many areas. To address this issue, we investigated the fusion of range measurements from the advanced topographic laser altimeter system (ATLAS) aboard the NASA ICESat-2 satellite, and multispectral satellite imagery from European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 using two common bathymetric inversion algorithms. The active ranging capability of the ATLAS green (532-nm) laser has been shown to generate returns of up to 38-m depth in optically clear waters, providing depth measurements to constrain passive bathymetric inversion results. Data acquired in November 2018 over the nearshore in Destin, FL, USA, offer a proof of concept for this approach. The results of the bathymetric inversion were quantitatively assessed by comparison with airborne bathymetric LiDAR collected using the U.S. Army Corps Coastal Zone Mapping and Imaging LiDAR (CZMIL) system in October-November 2018. Overall, the results of the bathymetric inversion compared with the CZMIL data have a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.35 m in waters with similar turbidity and bottom reflectivity, and demonstrate that a combination of ICESat-2 depth observations with Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery can estimate seamless nearshore bathymetry for optically clear coastal waters.

TI  - Analysis of urban heat island and flood-prone areas for green space planning
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-URBAN DESIGN AND PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Heat islands and floods have an impact on human life and the environment. In this research study, remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) were used to identify the effects of urban heat islands and potential flood zones. The results were used to create a priority attention map for Mexicali, Baja California, as a planning tool for implementing green space projects. The land surface temperature was estimated from Landsat-8 imagery. For flood-prone area estimation and a topographic wetness index, a digital elevation model was processed with a spatial resolution of 5 x 5 m. The results showed the need to incorporate green spaces within the urban area since the inhabitant-green space ratio was 2.43 m(2). Furthermore, it was observed that more than 60% of green areas do not significantly affect the reduction of heat islands; therefore, the effective ratio of green spaces with a cooling effect per inhabitant was 1.27 m(2). The implementation of spatial techniques in GIS considering heat islands and potential flood zones has not been traditionally considered in urban planning and cities dynamics in developing countries in arid zones. However, the determination of long-distance conditions in comprehensive planning instruments could be implemented to increase urban areas resilience.

T2  - ESTUDIOS DEL DESARROLLO SOCIAL-CUBA Y AMERICA LATINA
M3  - Article
AB  - The narrative is the primary basis that facilitates sharing, experiencing, and transmitting indigenous peoples' ancient knowledge and worldview. However, the ignorance of the forms of transmission of knowledge has meant that importance is not given to these peoples' narratives manifested through their languages. This phenomenon has occurred many times due to modernity that promotes literacy in Spanish as the main means of transmission of knowledge. The present study aims to identify relevant aspects of the Andean cosmovision through narratives of Kichwa representative members in the Agato community in Imbabura, Ecuador. Their identity and cultural pride are strengthened by three fundamental aspects: nutraceutical gastronomy in indigenous communities, local symbiotic biodiversity, and the animation of inanimate beings.

TI  - Testing the Contribution of Multi-Source Remote Sensing Features for Random Forest Classification of the Greater Amanzule Tropical Peatland
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands such as Ghana's Greater Amanzule peatland are highly valuable ecosystems and under great pressure from anthropogenic land use activities. Accurate measurement of their occurrence and extent is required to facilitate sustainable management. A key challenge, however, is the high cloud cover in the tropics that limits optical remote sensing data acquisition. In this work we combine optical imagery with radar and elevation data to optimise land cover classification for the Greater Amanzule tropical peatland. Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) imagery were acquired and integrated to drive a machine learning land cover classification using a random forest classifier. Recursive feature elimination was used to optimize high-dimensional and correlated feature space and determine the optimal features for the classification. Six datasets were compared, comprising different combinations of optical, radar and elevation features. Results showed that the best overall accuracy (OA) was found for the integrated Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 and SRTM dataset (S2+S1+DEM), significantly outperforming all the other classifications with an OA of 94%. Assessment of the sensitivity of land cover classes to image features indicated that elevation and the original Sentinel-1 bands contributed the most to separating tropical peatlands from other land cover types. The integration of more features and the removal of redundant features systematically increased classification accuracy. We estimate Ghana's Greater Amanzule peatland covers 60,187 ha. Our proposed methodological framework contributes a robust workflow for accurate and detailed landscape-scale monitoring of tropical peatlands, while our findings provide timely information critical for the sustainable management of the Greater Amanzule peatland.

TI  - Radical Islamism in Schools of France and Germany
T2  - CONTEMPORARY EUROPE-SOVREMENNAYA EVROPA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article compares the tendencies of Islamism in school education in France and Germany. Despite the different approaches to the role of religion in schools in these countries with large Muslim communities, there is a growing process of the penetration of Islamism into schools. The external manifestations of this phenomenon coincide. the segregation of schoolchildren in relation to religion. At the same time, the social factor clearly fades away. The author explores the cultural causes of Islamism, which are based on the gap between the secular culture of France and Germany and the worldview of Muslim youth. At the turn of the 1980s in France and Germany the assimilation policy of integration exhausted its possibilities, primarily due to the massive influx of migrants from Muslim countries who created their own territorial enclaves ("parallel societies"), in which the power of the state was minimized. There was a paradigm shift at the turn of the 1980s.1990s, when Western countries began to implement a policy of multiculturalism, which also suffered a failure. The article examines how the value of a person's religious affiliation as opposed to civic value, the priority of group rights in relation to the rights of an individual became the reason for the strengthening of Islamism in schools in France and Germany. That was a direct consequence of both the mass migration of the 1980s and 1990s, which took the form of superficial naturalization, with the goal of obtaining social benefits without becoming introduced to the culture of Western countries, and the failed policy of multiculturalism. If these problems are not tackled, the success in curbing the Islamist wave in European schools is unlikely.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification method with combined nonparametric and parametric classifications which depends on the normality of Probability Density Function of training samples is proposed. The proposed classification method is also based on spatial information for high spatial resolution of satellite based optical sensor images is proposed. Also, a classification method which takes into account not only spectral but also spatial features for LANDSAT-4 and 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data is proposed. Treatment of the spatial-spectral variability existing within a region is more important for such high spatial resolution of satellite imagery data. Standard deviations in small cells, such as 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 pixels, were used as measures to represent the spatial-spectral variabilities. This information can be used together with conventional spectral features in a unified way, for the traditional classifier such as the pixelwise Maximum Likelihood Decision Rule (MLHDR). The classification performance of new clear cuts and alpine meadows which are very close in spectral space characteristics and difficult to distinguish them by conventional methods are focused. Through experiments, it is found that there is a substantial improvement in overall classification accuracy for TM forestry data. The Probability of Correct Classification (PCC) for the new clear cuts and the alpine meadows classes rose by 7% to 97% correct. The confusion between alpine meadows and new clear cuts was reduced from 9% to 3%.

TI  - Integration of Sentinel-2 Derived Spectral Indices and <i>In</i>-<i>situ</i> Forest Inventory to Predict Forest Biomass
T2  - Pakistan Journal of Scientific and Industrial Research Series A-Physical Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biomass estimation is the central part of sustainable forest management to assess carbon stocks and carbon emissions from forest ecosystem. Sentinel-2 is state-of-art sensor with refined spatial and recurrent temporal resolution data. The present study explored the potential of Sentinel-2 derived vegetation indices for above ground biomass prediction using four regression models (linear, exponential, power and logarithmic). Sentinel-2 indices includes Global environmental monitoring index, transformed normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, normalized difference infrared index and red-edge normalized difference vegetation index. The performances of Sentinel-2 indices were assessed by simple single variable (index) based regression for GEMI, TNDVI, NDII, NDWI and RENDVI versus AGB values. Further, stepwise linear regression was also developed in which used all indices entered into stepwise selection and the best index was selected in the final model. Results showed that linear model of all indices performance best compared to the rest three models and R-2 values 0.12, 0.39, 0.46, 0.44 and 0.37 for Global environmental monitoring index, transformed normalized. Vegetation index, normalized difference water index, infrared index and red-edge vegetation index, respectively. Normalized difference water index was considered the best index among five computed indices in simple linear as well as in stepwise linear regression, whereas rest of the indices were removed because they were not significant under the stepwise criteria. Further, the accuracy of normalized difference water index model was determined by root mean square error and final prediction model has 28.27 t/ha error for both simple linear and stepwise linear regression. Therefore, normalized difference water index was selected for biomass mapping and resultant biomass showed up to 339 t/ha in the study area. The resultant biomass map also showed consistency with global datasets which include global forest canopy height and global forest tree cover change maps. The study suggest that Sentinel-2 product has great potential to estimate above ground biomass with accuracy and can be used for large scale mapping in combination with national forest inventory for carbon emission accounting.

ESs want to exchange their data via a satellite. Data of transmitting ES is transmitted by using a beamforming vector. At the receiving ES, the data of unwanted ESs is canceled by utilizing null space based approach. Then a combining vector is used at the receiving ES in order to retrieve the data. It is observed that sufficiently large number of antennas at the ESs are needed by the proposed scheme. By following the standard moment generating function based approach, analytical results of symbol error rate of the proposed system are formulated.

TI  - Seasonal Abundance and Diversity of Egg Parasitoids of <i>Halyomorpha halys</i> in Kiwifruit Orchards in China
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummarySurveys of egg parasitoids of the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, were conducted in 2018 and 2019 in green-fleshed 'Hayward' kiwifruit orchards in Mei County, Shaanxi Province, China, to assess the abundance and diversity of parasitoid communities under two different management systems. Parasitism occurred from June to August and from May to August across the two survey seasons, respectively. Five parasitoid species were recovered from successfully parasitized H. halys egg masses, where Trissolcus japonicus and Trissolcus cultratus were the predominant species. The abundance of T. japonicus varied throughout the season in both orchards in both survey seasons. Monthly T. japonicus abundance showed a unimodal distribution in 2018, peaking in July. There were two peaks (May-June and August) in the 2019 season. This study provides valuable information on the season-long abundance and diversity of egg parasitoids of H. halys in kiwifruit, and most importantly on the abundance and effectiveness, relative to other parasitoids, of T. japonicus in kiwifruit orchards.To develop effective and targeted biocontrol tactics for the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, in crop habitats, a good understanding is essential of the abundance and diversity of its parasitoids in different crop habitats in its native range. To obtain information on the egg parasitoid communities of H. halys in kiwifruit, surveys using sentinel egg masses were conducted in 2018 and 2019. These assessed the species composition of egg parasitoids of H. halys in green-fleshed 'Hayward' kiwifruit orchards, and quantified their season-long abundances in orchards under two different management systems. Parasitism was observed from June to August 2018 (mean parasitism: 48%) and from May to August 2019 (mean parasitism: 29%) across the experimental orchards. In total, five different parasitoid species were found across the two surveys seasons in the kiwifruit orchards, Trissolcus japonicus, T. cultratus, T. plautiae, Anastatus japonicus, and Acroclisoides sp., where T. japonicus and T. cultratus were the predominant species. Monthly T. japonicus abundance data had a unimodal distribution in 2018, peaking in July. There were two peaks (May-June and August) in the 2019 season. Overall, T. japonicus was significantly more abundant in the organic orchard than the conventionally managed orchard only in 2018, and its monthly abundance differed significantly in the two orchards in the two survey seasons. Results and their implications for future classical biological control for H. halys in kiwifruit are discussed.

TI  - Self-Organizing Deep Learning (SO-UNet)-A Novel Framework to Classify Urban and Peri-Urban Forests
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest-type classification is a very complex and difficult subject. The complexity increases with urban and peri-urban forests because of the variety of features that exist in remote sensing images. The success of forest management that includes forest preservation depends strongly on the accuracy of forest-type classification. Several classification methods are used to map urban and peri-urban forests and to identify healthy and non-healthy ones. Some of these methods have shown success in the classification of forests where others failed. The successful methods used specific remote sensing data technology, such as hyper-spectral and very high spatial resolution (VHR) images. However, both VHR and hyper-spectral sensors are very expensive, and hyper-spectral sensors are not widely available on satellite platforms, unlike multi-spectral sensors. Moreover, aerial images are limited in use, very expensive, and hard to arrange and manage. To solve the aforementioned problems, an advanced method, self-organizing-deep learning (SO-UNet), was created to classify forests in the urban and peri-urban environment using multi-spectral, multi-temporal, and medium spatial resolution Sentinel-2 images. SO-UNet is a combination of two different machine learning technologies: artificial neural network unsupervised self-organizing maps and deep learning UNet. Many experiments have been conducted, and the results showed that SO-UNet overwhelms UNet significantly. The experiments encompassed different settings for the parameters that control the algorithms.

TI  - Analysing the Impact of Climate Change on Hydrological Ecosystem Services in Laguna del Sauce (Uruguay) Using the SWAT Model and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing how climate change will affect hydrological ecosystem services (HES) provision is necessary for long-term planning and requires local comprehensive climate information. In this study, we used SWAT to evaluate the impacts on four HES, natural hazard protection, erosion control regulation and water supply and flow regulation for the Laguna del Sauce catchment in Uruguay. We used downscaled CMIP-5 global climate models for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 projections. We calibrated and validated our SWAT model for the periods 2005-2009 and 2010-2013 based on remote sensed ET data. Monthly NSE and R2 values for calibration and validation were 0.74, 0.64 and 0.79, 0.84, respectively. Our results suggest that climate change will likely negatively affect the water resources of the Laguna del Sauce catchment, especially in the RCP 8.5 scenario. In all RCP scenarios, the catchment is likely to experience a wetting trend, higher temperatures, seasonality shifts and an increase in extreme precipitation events, particularly in frequency and magnitude. This will likely affect water quality provision through runoff and sediment yield inputs, reducing the erosion control HES and likely aggravating eutrophication. Although the amount of water will increase, changes to the hydrological cycle might jeopardize the stability of freshwater supplies and HES on which many people in the south-eastern region of Uruguay depend. Despite streamflow monitoring capacities need to be enhanced to reduce the uncertainty of model results, our findings provide valuable insights for water resources planning in the study area. Hence, water management and monitoring capacities need to be enhanced to reduce the potential negative climate change impacts on HES. The methodological approach presented here, based on satellite ET data can be replicated and adapted to any other place in the world since we employed open-access software and remote sensing data for all the phases of hydrological modelling and HES provision assessment.

TI  - Hyperspectral Data Simulation (Sentinel-2 to AVIRIS-NG) for Improved Wildfire Fuel Mapping, Boreal Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Alaska has witnessed a significant increase in wildfire events in recent decades that have been linked to drier and warmer summers. Forest fuel maps play a vital role in wildfire management and risk assessment. Freely available multispectral datasets are widely used for land use and land cover mapping, but they have limited utility for fuel mapping due to their coarse spectral resolution. Hyperspectral datasets have a high spectral resolution, ideal for detailed fuel mapping, but they are limited and expensive to acquire. This study simulates hyperspectral data from Sentinel-2 multispectral data using the spectral response function of the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) sensor, and normalized ground spectra of gravel, birch, and spruce. We used the Uniform Pattern Decomposition Method (UPDM) for spectral unmixing, which is a sensor-independent method, where each pixel is expressed as the linear sum of standard reference spectra. The simulated hyperspectral data have spectral characteristics of AVIRIS-NG and the reflectance properties of Sentinel-2 data. We validated the simulated spectra by visually and statistically comparing it with real AVIRIS-NG data. We observed a high correlation between the spectra of tree classes collected from AVIRIS-NG and simulated hyperspectral data. Upon performing species level classification, we achieved a classification accuracy of 89% for the simulated hyperspectral data, which is better than the accuracy of Sentinel-2 data (77.8%). We generated a fuel map from the simulated hyperspectral image using the Random Forest classifier. Our study demonstrated that low-cost and high-quality hyperspectral data can be generated from Sentinel-2 data using UPDM for improved land cover and vegetation mapping in the boreal forest.

TI  - Comparison of Target Detectors to Identify Icebergs in Quad-Polarimetric L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Icebergs represent hazards to ships and maritime activities and therefore their detection is essential. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites are very useful for this, due to their capability to acquire data under cloud cover and during day and night passes. In this work, we compared six state-of-the-art polarimetric target detectors to test their performance and ability to detect small-sized icebergs <120 m in four locations in Greenland. We used four single-look complex (SLC) ALOS-2 quad-polarimetric images from JAXA for quad-polarimetric detection and we compared with dual-polarimetric detectors using only the channels HH and HV. We also compared these detectors with single-polarimetric intensity channels and we tested using two scenarios: open ocean and sea ice. Our results show that the multi-look polarimetric whitening filter (MPWF) and the optimal polarimetric detector (OPD) provide the most optimal performance in quad- and dual-polarimetric mode detection. The analysis shows that, overall, quad-polarimetric detectors provide the best detection performance. When the false alarm rate (P-F) is fixed to 10(-5), the probabilities of detection (P-D) are 0.99 in open ocean and 0.90 in sea ice. Dual-polarimetric or single-polarimetric detectors show an overall reduction in performance (the ROC curves show a decrease), but this degradation is not very large (<0.1) when the value of false alarms is relatively high (i.e., we are interested in bigger icebergs with a brighter backscattering >120 m, as they are easier to detect). However, the differences between quad- and dual- or single-polarimetric detectors became much more evident when the P-F value was fixed to low detection probabilities 10(-6) (i.e., smaller icebergs). In the single-polarimetric mode, the HV channel showed P-D values of 0.62 for open ocean and 0.26 for sea ice, compared to values of 0.81 (open ocean) and 0.77 (sea ice) obtained with quad-polarimetric detectors.

TI  - Assessment of Maize Growth and Development with High- and Medium-Resolution Remote Sensing Products
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of a great amount of remote sensing data for precision agriculture purposes has set the question of which resolution and indices, derived from satellites or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer the most accurate results to characterize vegetation. This study focused on assessing, comparing, and discussing the performances and limitations of satellite and UAV-based imagery in terms of canopy development, i.e., the leaf area index (LAI), and yield, i.e., the dry aboveground biomass (DAGB), for maize. Three commercial maize fields were studied over four seasons to obtain the LAI and DAGB. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI) from satellite platforms (Landsat 5TM, 7 ETM+, 8OLI, and Sentinel 2A MSI) and the VARI and green canopy cover (GCC) from UAV imagery were compared. The remote sensing predictors in addition to the growing degree days (GDD) were assessed to estimate the LAI and DAGB using multilinear regression models (MRMs). For LAI estimation, better adjustments were obtained when predictors from the UAV platform were considered. The DAGB estimation revealed similar adjustments for both platforms, although the Landsat imagery offered slightly better adjustments. The results obtained in this study demonstrate the advantage of remote sensing platforms as a useful tool to estimate essential agronomic features.

TI  - The Sentinel-3 SLSTR Atmospheric Motion Vectors Product at EUMETSAT
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) are an important input to many Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. EUMETSAT derives AMVs from several of its orbiting satellites, including the geostationary satellites (Meteosat), and its Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. The algorithm extracting the AMVs uses pairs or triplets of images, and tracks the motion of clouds or water vapour features from one image to another. Currently, EUMETSAT LEO satellite AMVs are retrieved from georeferenced images from the Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board the Metop satellites. EUMETSAT is currently preparing the operational release of an AMV product from the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) on board the Sentinel-3 satellites. The main innovation in the processing, compared with AVHRR AMVs, lies in the co-registration of pairs of images: the images are first projected on an equal-area grid, before applying the AMV extraction algorithm. This approach has multiple advantages. First, individual pixels represent areas of equal sizes, which is crucial to ensure that the tracking is consistent throughout the processed image, and from one image to another. Second, this allows features that would otherwise leave the frame of the reference image to be tracked, thereby allowing more AMVs to be derived. Third, the same framework could be used for every LEO satellite, allowing an overall consistency of EUMETSAT AMV products. In this work, we present the results of this method for SLSTR by comparing the AMVs to the forecast model. We validate our results against AMVs currently derived from AVHRR and the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI). The release of the operational SLSTR AMV product is expected in 2022.

TI  - Change Over Time in Public Support for Social Distancing, Mask Wearing, and Contact Tracing to Combat the COVID-19 Pandemic Among US Adults, April to November 2020
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. To examine how sociodemographic, political, religious, and civic characteristics; trust in science; and fixed versus fluid worldview were associated with evolving public support for social distancing, indoor mask wearing, and contact tracing to control the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods. Surveys were conducted with a nationally representative cohort of US adults in April, July, and November 2020.Results. Support for social distancing among US adults dropped from 89% in April to 79% in July, but then remained stable in November 2020 at 78%. In July and November, more than three quarters of respondents supported mask wearing and nearly asmany supported contact tracing. In regression-adjustedmodels, support differences for social distancing, maskwearing, and contact tracing were most pronounced by age, partisanship, and trust in science. Having a more fluid worldview independently predicted higher support for contact tracing.Conclusions. Ongoing resistance to nonpharmaceutical public health responses among key subgroups challenge transmission control.Public Health Implications. Developing persuasive communication efforts targeting young adults, political conservatives, and those distrusting science should be a critical priority.

TI  - A remote sensing based analysis of climate change in Sikkim supported by evidence from the field
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalayas hailed as the 'water towers of the world' feed many perennial rivers which form the lifeline of the Indian sub-continent. Climate change induced rising global temperatures and changing rainfall patterns are currently threatening the glaciers that feed the rivers. The combination of these factors is causing water stresses to a part of the world which is usually considered water abundant. Though there are some large-scale studies done in the Himalayas, regional analysis of changing rainfall patterns and their impacts on vegetation and agriculture is lacking. Here we focus on the Indian state of Sikkim located in the Eastern Himalayas to evaluate these issues using mixed methods. We use satellite data from PERSIANN and MODIS to characterise the regional rainfall, vegetation, and surface temperature trends between 2001 and 2019. While the analysis shows overall declining rainfall trends across most land cover classes, the trends in temperature are mostly positive for the period of study, with winter Land Surface Temperature (LST) values showing the largest area with marginally significant (p<0.1) positive trends. In contrast, such patterns are not observed for agriculture. However, the interviews corroborate that even agriculture is impacted, implying that the trends continue at finer spatial scales too. The lack of government support for adaptation and mitigation is also lamented placing the communities at a precarious position to continuing climate change.

TI  - Research on Wildfires and Remote Sensing in the Last Three Decades: A Bibliometric Analysis
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating the impact of wildland fires on landscapes, a pursuit increasingly supported by remote sensing techniques, requires an understanding of wildfire dynamics. This research highlights the main insights from the literature related to "wildfires" and "remote sensing" published between 1991 and 2020. The Scopus database was used as a source of information regarding scientific production on these topics, after which bibliometric tools were employed as a means through which to reveal patterns in this network of journals, terms, countries, and authors. The results suggest that these subject areas have undergone significant developments in the last three decades, having been the focus of growing interest among the scientific community. The most relevant contributions to the literature available have been made by researchers working in the areas of earth and environmental sciences (54% of the publications), primarily in the United States, China, Spain, and Canada. Research trends in this field have undergone a significant evolution in recent decades, explained by the strong relationship between the technological evolution of detection methods and remote sensing data acquisition.

TI  - Safe Space, Dangerous Territory: Young People's Views on Preventing Radicalization through Education-Perspectives for Pre-Service Teacher Education
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Initiatives for preventing radicalization and violent extremism through education (PVE-E) have become a feature of global educational policy and educational institutions across all phases, from early childhood to universities, also in Finland. If schools may be regarded as safe spaces here for identity and worldview construction and experiences of belonging, the specific subject matter of PVE-E is also dangerous territory. Not least because of PVE-E's focus on radicalization, but above all because of perceptions of schools being used as an adjunct of governmental counter-terrorism policy. We argue that understanding young people's views on issues related to radicalization and violent extremism is critical in order to develop ethical, sustainable, contextualized, and pedagogical approaches to prevent hostilities and foster peaceful co-existence. After providing some critical framing of the Finnish educational context in a broader international setting, we thus examine young people's views (n = 3617) in relation to the safe spaces through online survey data gathered as a part of our larger 4-year research project Growing up radical? The role of educational institutions in guiding young people's worldview construction. Specifically focused on Finland but with potentially wider international implications, more understanding about the topic of PVE-E is needed to inform teacher education and training, to which our empirical data makes some innovative contribution.

TI  - Mapping and Quantification of the Dwarf Eelgrass <i>Zostera noltei</i> Using a Random Forest Algorithm on a SPOT 7 Satellite Image
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The dwarf eelgrass Zostera noltei Hornemann (Z. noltei) is the most dominant seagrass in semi-enclosed coastal systems of the Atlantic coast of Morocco. The species is experiencing a worldwide decline and monitoring the extent of its meadows would be a useful approach to estimate the impacts of natural and anthropogenic stressors. Here, we aimed to map the Z. noltei meadows in the Merja Zerga coastal lagoon (Atlantic coast of Morocco) using remote sensing. We used a random forest algorithm combined with field data to classify a SPOT 7 satellite image. Despite the difficulties related to the non-synchronization of the satellite images with the high tide coefficient, our results revealed, with an accuracy of 95%, that dwarf eelgrass beds can be discriminated successfully from other habitats in the lagoon. The estimated area was 160.76 ha when considering mixed beds (Z. noltei-associated macroalgae). The use of SPOT 7 satellite images seems to be satisfactory for long-term monitoring of Z. noltei meadows in the Merja Zerga lagoon and for biomass estimation using an NDVI-biomass quantitative relationship. Nevertheless, using this method of biomass estimation for dwarf eelgrass meadows could be unsuccessful when it comes to areas where the NDVI is saturated due to the stacking of many layers.

TI  - Modelling climate change impacts on regional net primary productivity in Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study projects and models the terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP) considering the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) scenarios of Turkey using remote-sensing-based biogeochemical modelling techniques. Changes in annual NPP between 2000-2010 and 2070-2080 were projected with the biogeochemical ecosystem model NASA-Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA). A multi-temporal data set, including 16-day MODIS composites with a spatial resolution of 250 m, was used within the CASA model. The 5th Assessment Report (AR5) of the IPCC presented several scenarios for RCPs named RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5 that laid the foundation for the future climate projections. The futuristic NPP modelling was based on the assumptions of maintaining CO2 level in the range of 421 to 936 ppm and a rise in temperature from 1.1 to 2.6 degrees C. The NPP in Turkey averaged 1232 g C m(2) year(-1) as per the model results. Considering 2000-2010 as the baseline period, the NPP was modelled within the range of 9.6 and 316 g C m(2) year(-1). Modelled average NPP was 1332.4 g C m(2) year(-1) per year between 2061 and 2080. The forest productivity was also estimated to be increased up to 113 g C m(-2) year(-1) under the climate change scenarios. However, there were minor differences in the projected average NPP under the baseline period covering years from 2000 to 2080 from those under RCPs. It appeared that variation in temperature and precipitation as a result of climate change affected the terrestrial NPP. The regional environmental and socio-economic consequences of climate change on diverse landscapes such as Turkey were properly modelled and analysed to understand the spatial variation of climate change impacts on vegetation. Changes in NPP imply that forests in Turkey could be carbon sinks in the future as their current potential that would profile Turkey's climate mitigation. This is one of the pioneering studies to estimate the future changes of regional NPP in Turkey by integrating various spatial inputs and a biogeochemical model.

TI  - Coastal morphology from space: A showcase of monitoring the topography-bathymetry continuum
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With a large part of the world's population residing in coastal areas, and largely depending on the coastal environment, monitoring natural and human-induced coastal changes are paramount to understand the dynamic and vulnerability of these coastal systems/communities. To understand changes in coastal areas, e.g. environmental and social resilience to environmental change, local measurements are inadequate. Such large-scale issues can only be addressed with perhaps less accurate but large scale measurements from space. Considering vulnerability or exposure to coastal flooding, both the bathymetry (underwater) and topography (above water) are vital boundary conditions to understand and accurately estimate impacts on short (storms) and long (interseasonal) time-scales. In this work, we estimate the coastal bathymetry and topography with the optical VEN mu S satellite for every single overpass at the Field Research Facility of the US Army Corps of Engineers at Duck, NC. The experimental VEN mu S satellite enables estimation of the topography and bathymetry by two repetitive identical images with a small time-lag. This capability proofs to result in topographies with a few meters accuracy and the bathymetry estimation is at best a few decimetres accurate. As a base for future Earth Observation missions such as Landsat or Sentinel 2, VEN mu S shows that higher resolution imagery (5 m), repetitive bands and a revisit time of only 2 days, enables unprecedented land/sea monitoring.

TI  - Conformity of the NASADEM_HGT and ALOS AW3D30 DEM with the Altitude from the Brazilian Geodetic Reference Stations: A Case Study from Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado (tropical savanna) is the second largest biome in South America and the main region in the country for agricultural production. Altitude is crucial information for decision-makers and planners since it is directly related to temperature that conditions, for example, the climatic risk of rainfed crop plantations. This study analyzes the conformity of two freely available digital elevation models (DEMs), the NASADEM Merged Digital Elevation Model Global 1 arc second (NASADEM_HGT) version 1 and the Advanced Land Observing Satellite Global Digital Surface Model (ALOS AW3D30), version 3.1, with the altitudes provided by 1695 reference stations of the Brazilian Geodetic System. Both models were evaluated based on the parameters recommended in the Brazilian Cartographic Accuracy Standard for Digital Cartographic Products (PEC-PCD), which defines error tolerances according to eight different scales (from 1:1000 to 1:250,000) and classes A (most strict tolerance, for example, 0.17 m for 1:1000 scale), B, C, and D (least strict tolerance, for example, 50 m for 1:250,000 scale). Considering the class A, the NASADEM_HGT meets 1:250,000 and lower scales, while AW3D30 meets 1:100,000 and lower scales; for class B, NASADEM_HGT meets 1:100,000 scale and AW3D30 meets 1:50,000. AW3D30 presented lower values of root mean square error, standard deviation, and bias, indicating that it presents higher accuracy in relation to the NASADEM_HGT. Within eight of Cerrado's municipalities with the highest grain production, the differences between average altitudes, measured by the Cohen's effect size, were statistically insignificant. The results obtained by the PEC-PCD for the Cerrado biome indicate that both models can be employed in different DEM-dependent applications over this biome.

TI  - Current State of Breast Cancer Diagnosis, Treatment, and Theranostics
T2  - PHARMACEUTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality in women worldwide. Early diagnosis and effective treatment of all types of cancers are crucial for a positive prognosis. Patients with small tumor sizes at the time of their diagnosis have a significantly higher survival rate and a significantly reduced probability of the cancer being fatal. Therefore, many novel technologies are being developed for early detection of primary tumors, as well as distant metastases and recurrent disease, for effective breast cancer management. Theranostics has emerged as a new paradigm for the simultaneous diagnosis, imaging, and treatment of cancers. It has the potential to provide timely and improved patient care via personalized therapy. In nanotheranostics, cell-specific targeting moieties, imaging agents, and therapeutic agents can be embedded within a single formulation for effective treatment. In this review, we will highlight the different diagnosis techniques and treatment strategies for breast cancer management and explore recent advances in breast cancer theranostics. Our main focus will be to summarize recent trends and technologies in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment as reported in recent research papers and patents and discuss future perspectives for effective breast cancer therapy.

TI  - Spatial Patterns of Macrozoobenthos Assemblages in a Sentinel Coastal Lagoon: Biodiversity and Environmental Drivers
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an assessment of the diversity and spatial distribution of benthic macrofauna communities along the Moulay Bousselham lagoon and discusses the environmental factors contributing to observed patterns. In the autumn of 2018, 68 stations were sampled with three replicates per station in subtidal and intertidal areas. Environmental conditions showed that the range of water temperature was from 25.0 degrees C to 12.3 degrees C, the salinity varied between 38.7 and 3.7, while the average of pH values fluctuated between 7.3 and 8.0. In vegetated habitats, biomass values of the seagrass Zostera noltei Hornemann ranged between 31.7 gDW/m(2) and 170.2 gDW/m(2) while the biomass of the seagrass Ruppia cirrhosa (Petagna) Grande between 54.2 gDW/m(2) and 84.7 gDW/m(2). Sediment analyses showed that the lagoon is mainly composed of sandy and silty sediments. We recorded 37,165 individuals of macrofauna distributed in 63 taxa belonging to 50 families, with a mean abundance value of 4582.8 ind/m(2) and biomass average of 22.2 g/m(2). Distance-based linear modeling analysis (DISTLM) identified sediment characteristics, water parameters and habitat type (biomass of Z. noltei) as the major environmental drivers influencing macrozoobenthos patterns. Our results clearly revealed that the hydrographic regime (marine and terrestrial freshwater), sediment distribution and characteristics and the type of habitat (vegetated vs. unvegetated substrate) are the key factors determining the species composition and patterns of macrozoobenthos assemblages.

TI  - Using Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles for Identifying the Extent of Invasive <i>Phragmites australis</i> in Treatment Areas Enrolled in an Adaptive Management Program
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Higher spatial and temporal resolutions of remote sensing data are likely to be useful for ecological monitoring efforts. There are many different treatment approaches for the introduced European genotype of Phragmites australis, and adaptive management principles are being integrated in at least some long-term monitoring efforts. In this paper, we investigated how natural color and a smaller set of near-infrared (NIR) images collected with low-cost uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) could help quantify the aboveground effects of management efforts at 20 sites enrolled in the Phragmites Adaptive Management Framework (PAMF) spanning the coastal Laurentian Great Lakes region. We used object-based image analysis and field ground truth data to classify the Phragmites and other cover types present at each of the sites and calculate the percent cover of Phragmites, including whether it was alive or dead, in the UAV images. The mean overall accuracy for our analysis with natural color data was 91.7% using four standardized classes (Live Phragmites, Dead Phragmites, Other Vegetation, Other Non-vegetation). The Live Phragmites class had a mean user's accuracy of 90.3% and a mean producer's accuracy of 90.1%, and the Dead Phragmites class had a mean user's accuracy of 76.5% and a mean producer's accuracy of 85.2% (not all classes existed at all sites). These results show that UAV-based imaging and object-based classification can be a useful tool to measure the extent of dead and live Phragmites at a series of sites undergoing management. Overall, these results indicate that UAV sensing appears to be a useful tool for identifying the extent of Phragmites at management sites.

TI  - Gravitational field modelling near irregularly shaped bodies using spherical harmonics: a case study for the asteroid (101955) Bennu
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - We apply three spherical-harmonic-based techniques to deliver external gravitational field models of the asteroid (101955) Bennu within its circumscribing sphere. This region is known to be peculiar for external spherical harmonic expansions, because it may lead to a divergent series. The studied approaches are (i) spectral gravity forward modelling via external spherical harmonics, (ii) the least-squares estimation from surface gravitational data using external spherical harmonics and (iii) the combination of internal and external series expansions. While the first method diverges beyond any reasonable doubts, we show that the other two methods may ensure relative accuracy from similar to 10(-6) to 10(-8) in the vicinity of Bennu. This is possible even with the second method, despite the fact that it relies on a single series of external spherical harmonics. Our main motivation was to study conceptual differences between spherical harmonic coefficients from satellite data (analogy to the first method) and from surface gravitational data (the second method). Such coefficients are available through the popular spherical-harmonic-based models of the Earth's gravitational field and often are combined together. We show that the coefficients from terrestrial data may lead to a divergence effect of partial sums, though excellent accuracy can be achieved when such model is used in full. Under (presently) extreme but realistic conditions, the divergence effect of partial sums may affect many near-surface geoscientific applications, such as the geoid/quasigeoid computation or residual terrain modelling. Computer codes (Fortran, MATLAB) and data produced within the study are made freely available at http://edisk.cvt.stuba.sk/similar to xbuchab/.

TI  - Health Monitoring of Laboratory Rodent Colonies-Talking about (R)evolution
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple SummaryWhen working with laboratory animals, scientists need to ensure that animals are not suffering from natural infections. Therefore, hygienic standards have been developed over the last 100+ years. The key element of hygienic standardization is the monitoring of infectious agents that can compromise the animal's health, are dangerous for the personnel or interfere with the research. However, scientists became aware that by eliminating such unwanted infectious agents the overall diversity of all microbes in research animals, the so-called microbiome, has also been reduced. Moreover, it became clear that the microbiome composition has an enormous impact on how research models react, e.g., to treatments. This might hinder the translation of findings in preclinical research to the clinical situation. Therefore, new concepts in hygienic standardization need to be developed that take animal welfare as well as scientific value into account. In this review, we will give an overview of how classical monitoring has been evolved and demonstrate concepts regarding how to handle the microbiome as a yet unknown variable in animal-based research in order to enhance the validity of research findings.The health monitoring of laboratory rodents is essential for ensuring animal health and standardization in biomedical research. Progress in housing, gnotobiotic derivation, and hygienic monitoring programs led to enormous improvement of the microbiological quality of laboratory animals. While traditional health monitoring and pathogen detection methods still serve as powerful tools for the diagnostics of common animal diseases, molecular methods develop rapidly and not only improve test sensitivities but also allow high throughput analyses of various sample types. Concurrently, to the progress in pathogen detection and elimination, the research community becomes increasingly aware of the striking influence of microbiome compositions in laboratory animals, affecting disease phenotypes and the scientific value of research data. As repeated re-derivation cycles and strict barrier husbandry of laboratory rodents resulted in a limited diversity of the animals' gut microbiome, future monitoring approaches will have to reform-aiming at enhancing the validity of animal experiments. This review will recapitulate common health monitoring concepts and, moreover, outline strategies and measures on coping with microbiome variation in order to increase reproducibility, replicability and generalizability.

TI  - Addressing the Selectivity of Enzyme Biosensors: Solutions and Perspectives
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Enzymatic biosensors enjoy commercial success and are the subject of continued research efforts to widen their range of practical application. For these biosensors to reach their full potential, their selectivity challenges need to be addressed by comprehensive, solid approaches. This review discusses the status of enzymatic biosensors in achieving accurate and selective measurements via direct biocatalytic and inhibition-based detection, with a focus on electrochemical enzyme biosensors. Examples of practical solutions for tackling the activity and selectivity problems and preventing interferences from co-existing electroactive compounds in the samples are provided such as the use of permselective membranes, sentinel sensors and coupled multi-enzyme systems. The effect of activators, inhibitors or enzymatic substrates are also addressed by coupled enzymatic reactions and multi-sensor arrays combined with data interpretation via chemometrics. In addition to these more traditional approaches, the review discusses some ingenious recent approaches, detailing also on possible solutions involving the use of nanomaterials to ensuring the biosensors' selectivity. Overall, the examples presented illustrate the various tools available when developing enzyme biosensors for new applications and stress the necessity to more comprehensively investigate their selectivity and validate the biosensors versus standard analytical methods.

TI  - Feedback From Vegetation to Interannual Variations of Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Interannual variations of Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) are modulated by external forcings such as El Nino Southern Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole, and the Atlantic Nino. Vegetation over land responds to variations in ISMR, but the feedback from vegetation to ISMR variability has not been fully explored yet. To address this gap, we perform two simulations with the regional Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled to the Community Land Surface Model (WRF-CLM) for the period of 2004-2018. We use the same boundary forcing from ERA-interim reanalysis for the two experiments, but with two different vegetation prescriptions, (1) observed, interannually varying Leaf Area Index (LAI), obtained from satellite images/data (VAR-LAI); and (2) climatological Leaf Area Index from the same product, to suppress interannual LAI variations (CLIM-LAI). We find that the correlation coefficient of simulated total seasonal rainfall with the observed data is higher for VAR-LAI simulation as compared to CLIM-LAI. To elicit causality among eco-hydro-climatological variables, we develop a network based on information theory, i.e., a process network. We find that LAI plays a major role in influencing precipitation in the network through evapotranspiration. The number of links originating from LAI and evapotranspiration increases during drought years, making the eco-hydro-climatological network denser. Our findings indicate that the ISMR predictions and projections need to represent the time-varying LAI to fully capture the varying feedbacks from evolving vegetation to the atmosphere especially during drought years.Plain Language Summary Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) has strong interannual variations impacting land processes, including vegetation. Here, we address an unanswered science question: Can these interannual variations of vegetation impact the variability of ISMR in turn through feedbacks? To test this hypothesis, we perform numerical experiments using a coupled regional landatmosphere model and find that representing varying vegetation improves the simulations of ISMR. We further use the information theory-based process network and find a higher number of information links originating from land to atmospheric variables, during the drought years. The interannual variations of ISMR are conventionally predicted based on large-scale dynamics neglecting region-specific local land processes. Here, we show the importance of regional land-atmosphere feedbacks to the interannual variations of ISMR.

TI  - From Land Cover Map to Land Use Map: A Combined Pixel-Based and Object-Based Approach Using Multi-Temporal Landsat Data, a Random Forest Classifier, and Decision Rules
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is essential to produce land cover maps and land use maps separately for different purposes. This study was conducted to generate such maps in Binh Duong province, Vietnam, using a novel combination of pixel-based and object-based classification techniques and geographic information system (GIS) analysis on multi-temporal Landsat images. Firstly, the connection between land cover and land use was identified; thereafter, the land cover map and land use function regions were extracted with a random forest classifier. Finally, a land use map was generated by combining the land cover map and the land use function regions in a set of decision rules. The results showed that land cover and land use were linked by spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics, and this helped effectively convert the land cover map into a land use map. The final land cover map attained an overall accuracy (OA) = 93.86%, with producer's accuracy (PA) and user's accuracy (UA) of its classes ranging from 73.91% to 100%. Meanwhile, the final land use map achieved OA = 93.45%, and the UA and PA ranged from 84% to 100%. The study demonstrated that it is possible to create high-accuracy maps based entirely on free multi-temporal satellite imagery that promote the reproducibility and proactivity of the research as well as cost-efficiency and time savings.

TI  - Ultrastaging methods of sentinel lymph nodes in endometrial cancer - a systematic review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - ObjectiveSentinel lymph node mapping has emerged as an alternative to lymphadenectomy in evaluating the lymph node status in endometrial cancer. Several pathological methods to examine the sentinel lymph node are applied internationally. The aim of this study was to determine the value of ultrastaging and to assess the ultrastaging method with the highest detection rate of metastases.MethodsA systematic review was conducted. Inclusion criteria were: pathologically-confirmed endometrial cancer with sentinel lymph node mapping, report of the histological outcomes, metastases found by hematoxylin and eosin staining and metastases found by ultrastaging were separately mentioned, and description of the ultrastaging method. The primary outcome was the detection of metastases found by ultrastaging that were not detected by routine hematoxylin and eosin staining. The secondary outcome was the difference in detection rate of metastases between several ultrastaging methods. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted.ResultsFifteen studies were selected, including 2259 patients. Sentinel lymph nodes were examined by routine hematoxylin and eosin staining. Subsequently, multiple ultrastaging methods were used, with differences in macroscopic slicing (bread-loaf/longitudinal), number of microscopic slides, and distance between slides, but all used immunohistochemistry. A positive sentinel lymph node was found in 14% of patients. In 37% of these, this was detected only by ultrastaging. Using more ultrastaging slides did not result in a higher detection rate. Bread-loaf slicing led to a higher detection rate compared with longitudinal slicing (mean detection rates 53% and 33%, respectively).ConclusionPathological ultrastaging after routine hematoxylin and eosin staining in endometrial cancer patients has led to an increased detection rate of sentinel lymph node metastases. Different ultrastaging methods are used, with a preference for bread-loaf slicing. However, due to the large heterogeneity of the studies, assessing which ultrastaging method has the highest detection rate of sentinel lymph node metastases was not possible.

TI  - Industrial Plume Properties Retrieved by Optimal Estimation Using Combined Hyperspectral and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stack emissions from the industrial sector are a subject of concern for air quality. However, the characterization of the stack emission plume properties from in situ observations remains a challenging task. This paper focuses on the characterization of the aerosol properties of a steel plant stack plume through the use of hyperspectral (HS) airborne remote sensing imagery. We propose a new method, based on the combination of HS airborne acquisition and surface reflectance imagery derived from the Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI). The proposed method detects the plume footprint and estimates the surface reflectance under the plume, the aerosol optical thickness (AOT), and the modal radius of the plume. Hyperspectral surface reflectances are estimated using the coupled non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) method combining HS and MSI data. The CNMF reduces the error associated with estimating the surface reflectance below the plume, particularly for heterogeneous classes. The AOT and modal radius are retrieved using an optimal estimation method (OEM), based on the forward model and allowing for uncertainties in the observations and in the model parameters. The a priori state vector is provided by a sequential method using the root mean square error (RMSE) metric, which outperforms the previously used cluster tuned matched filter (CTMF). The OEM degrees of freedom are then analysed, in order to refine the mask plume and to enhance the quality of the retrieval. The retrieved mean radii of aerosol particles in the plume is 0.125 mu m, with an uncertainty of 0.05 mu m. These results are close to the ultra-fine mode (modal radius around 0.1 mu m) observed from in situ measurements within metallurgical plant plumes from previous studies. The retrieved AOT values vary between 0.07 (near the source point) and 0.01, with uncertainties of 0.005 for the darkest surfaces and above 0.010 for the brightest surfaces.

TI  - Advanced InSAR Tropospheric Corrections From Global Atmospheric Models that Incorporate Spatial Stochastic Properties of the Troposphere
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropospheric delays are still the main error source of satellite-based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) mapping of Earth's surface movements. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of global atmospheric models (GAMs) in reducing InSAR tropospheric delays. However, the importance of appropriate interpolation and weighting strategies in GAM corrections has largely been overlooked. Here we present a new GAM-based tropospheric correction method that incorporates spatial stochastic models of the troposphere into the weighting strategy of the correction. The method determines the correlation between a pixel of interest and neighboring GAM grid locations (3D) according to the spatial variability of the tropospheric random field, instead of subjectively using an inverse distance method, a local spline function, or other standard interpolation scheme. Also, our new method considers horizontal heterogeneities of the tropospheric field by estimating the integral of the tropospheric delays along the satellite line-of-sight (LOS) direction, instead of calculating projected zenith-delays. The method can be used with any GAM, but we here implement it with the latest ECMWF (European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) ERA5 reanalysis products. We validate the new method with hundreds of Sentinel-1 images from 2015 to 2020 over the island of Hawaii, a location with variable topography, surface conditions, local climate, and deformation, and explore the tropospheric corrections for both interferograms and time-series analysis products (deformation velocities and time-series solutions). Compared with other GAM corrections (PyAPS, d-LOS, and GACOS), our new method yields a larger reduction of the average standard deviation of the corrected interferograms, i.e., from 2.55 to 1.91 cm, instead of 2.47 cm (PyAPS), 2.44 cm (d-LOS), and 2.10 cm (GACOS). Also, a larger fraction of 87% of the interferograms (243 out of 280) is improved, compared with 52%, 53%, and 66% for the other GAM corrections, respectively. These results demonstrate the importance of considering (1) tropospheric stochastic models in GAM corrections, (2) horizontal heterogeneities when estimating the LOS delays, and (3) tropospheric delays when mapping long-wavelength or small-magnitude deformations using InSAR.

TI  - Long-term impact of a ten-year intervention program on human and canine <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> infection in the Argentine Chaco
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Interruption of domestic vector-borne transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi is still an unmet goal in several American countries. In 2007 we launched a long-term intervention program aimed to suppress house infestation with the main domestic vector in southern South America (Triatoma infestans) and domestic transmission in Pampa del Indio, a resource-constrained, hyperendemic municipality with 1446 rural houses inhabited by Creole and indigenous people, in the Argentine Chaco ecoregion. Here, we assessed whether the 10-year insecticide-based program combined with community mobilization blocked vector-borne domestic transmission of T. cruzi to humans and dogs.Methods We carried out two municipality-wide, cross-sectional serosurveys of humans and dogs (considered sentinel animals) during 2016-2017 to compare with baseline data. We used a risk-stratified random sampling design to select 273 study houses; 410 people from 180 households and 492 dogs from 151 houses were examined for antibodies to T. cruzi using at least two serological methods.Results The seroprevalence of T. cruzi in children aged <16 years was 2.5% in 2017 (i.e., 4- to 11-fold lower than before interventions). The mean annual force of child infection (<lambda>) sharply decreased from 2.18 to 0.34 per 100 person-years in 2017. One of 102 children born after interventions was seropositive for T. cruzi; he had lifetime residence in an apparently uninfested house, no outside travel history, and his mother was T. cruzi-seropositive. No incident case was detected among 114 seronegative people of all ages re-examined serologically. Dog seroprevalence was 3.05%. Among native dogs, lambda in 2016 (1.21 per 100 dog-years) was 5 times lower than at program onset. Six native adult dogs born after interventions and with stable lifetime residence were T. cruzi-seropositive: three had exposure to T. infestans at their houses and one was an incident case.Conclusions These results support the interruption of vector-borne transmission of T. cruzi to humans in rural Pampa del Indio. Congenital transmission was the most likely source of the only seropositive child born after interventions. Residual transmission to dogs was likely related to transient infestations and other transmission routes. Sustained vector control supplemented with human chemotherapy can lead to a substantial reduction of Chagas disease transmission in the Argentine Chaco.Author summary Interruption of vector-borne T. cruzi transmission is still an unmet goal through the Americas. We launched a long-term intervention program with this goal in rural Pampa del Indio, a resource-limited hyperendemic municipality inhabited by Creole and indigenous (Qom) families in the Argentine Chaco region. The program included blanket insecticide spraying at the outset, sustained vector surveillance including focal insecticide spraying, and community mobilization. Ten years after program onset, we assessed the impacts of interventions on domestic transmission to humans and dogs, taken as sentinel animals. We found that the frequency of human or canine cases decreased dramatically relative to baseline values. No human incident case was recorded. The only infected child born after program onset was attributed to congenital (i.e., vertical) transmission. The few canine cases detected were most likely related to transient domestic infestations and other transmission routes. These results, combined with the quasi-elimination of T. infestans, support that vector-borne transmission of T. cruzi to humans had been stopped and this status sustained after interventions.

TI  - Variability of Net Primary Productivity and Associated Biophysical Drivers in Bahia de La Paz (Mexico)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of information of net primary productivity (NPP) from remote ocean color sensors is increasingly common in marine sciences. The resulting information has been used to explain variations in productivity at different spatio-temporal scales and in the presence of climate phenomena, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation, and global warming. Satellite remote sensing data were analyzed in Bahia de La Paz (BLP), Mexico, to determine the spatio-temporal variation in NPP. In addition, in situ hydrographic data were obtained to characterize the water properties in the bay. The satellite data agree with in situ measurements, validating the satellite observations over this region. The NPP generally presented seasonal variation with maximum values in winter-spring and minimum values in summer-autumn. The variance explained by NPP from the measured variables was ranked as Chl-a < DEN < SST < PAR < WSC. The highest NPP values generally occurred when subtropical subsurface (SsStW) water was relatively shallow. Due to divergence and mixing processes, this water provided nutrients to the euphotic zone, and consequently an increase in NPP and changes in plankton biomass were observed. The annual trends of the variation in hydrographic data with respect to that of remote sensing data were similar; however, it is necessary to increase the number of data validation studies. The remote sensing and in situ measurements allowed for the main biophysical variables that modulate NPP in different time scales to be identified. The satellite-derived NPP data classifies the BLP as a high productivity zone with 432 g C m(-2) year(-1). The use of satellite NPP data is satisfactory and should be incorporated into marine primary productivity studies.

TI  - Strong Local Evaporative Cooling Over Land Due to Atmospheric Aerosols
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols can enhance terrestrial productivity through increased absorption of solar radiation by the shaded portion of the plant canopy-the diffuse radiation fertilization effect. Although this process can, in principle, alter surface evaporation due to the coupling between plant water loss and carbon uptake, with the potential to change the surface temperature, aerosol-climate interactions have been traditionally viewed in light of the radiative effects within the atmosphere. Here, we develop a modeling framework that combines global atmosphere and land model simulations with a conceptual diagnostic tool to investigate these interactions from a surface energy budget perspective. Aerosols increase the terrestrial evaporative fraction, or the portion of net incoming energy consumed by evaporation, by over 4% globally and as much as similar to 40% regionally. The main mechanism for this is the increase in energy allocation from sensible to latent heat due to global dimming (reduction in global shortwave radiation) and slightly augmented by diffuse radiation fertilization. In regions with moderately dense vegetation (leaf area index >2), the local surface cooling response to aerosols is dominated by this evaporative pathway, not the reduction in incident radiation. Diffuse radiation fertilization alone has a stronger impact on gross primary productivity (+2.18 Pg C y(-1) or +1.8%) than on land evaporation (+0.18 W m(-2) or +0.48%) and surface temperature (-0.01 K). Our results suggest that it is important for land surface models to distinguish between quantity (change in total magnitude) and quality (change in diffuse fraction) of radiative forcing for properly simulating surface climate.

TI  - Quantifying and Remediating the New Graduate Nurse Resident Academic-Practice Gap Using Online Patient Simulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTINUING EDUCATION IN NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: There is an ever-widening academic-practice gap. Less than one third of new graduates demonstrate entry-level competencies required for practice. Hospitals expend many resources to create nurse residency programs to remediate this gap. Online interactive case simulation is effective to increase competencies and decrease the length of orientation and rate of turnover. The aims of this pilot research study were to quantify the academic-practice gap and to strengthen areas of development for competent and safe clinical practice through use of an online patient simulation program. Method: A pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study using an online patient simulation program was implemented in a convenience sample of nurse residents over 16 months. Results: Twenty-nine residents completed more than 3,400 patient simulations. Improvement in pretest and posttest metrics included 100% of nurse residents committing a sentinel error event decreased to 20.7%, 766 medication errors decreased to 160, and failed-to-rescue an average of 81% of the time decreased to 23%. Conclusion: Interactive online patient simulation programs provide a powerful learning methodology in which learners improve patient safety and reduce failures to rescue.

TI  - Normalization Method and Application for MODIS TEB Assessments Using Earth Scene Measurements
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Selected Earth targets are commonly used for satellite sensor calibration assessments (e.g., sensor stability and inter-comparisons). Moreover, typical scenes used for the calibration assessment of the thermal emissive bands (TEBs) include Dome Concordia (Dome-C), ocean, desert, and deep convective clouds (DCC). Reference data used for these calibration assessments can come from another band, another instrument, or ground measurements. The Dome-C site, covered with uniformly distributed permanent snow, is normally used for the assessment of the TEBs at cold temperatures. Furthermore, ocean and desert measurements prove useful for scenes with higher temperatures. The DCC, one of the most consistent and coldest targets, can be used for the TEBs calibration and product stability assessments. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) band 31 (similar to 11 mu m) can be used as a reference for these scenes. However, measurements over these scenes have seasonal variations, and the DCC brightness temperatures (BTs) have asymmetrical distributions. These features can introduce additional uncertainty to the stability assessments. A normalization method is applied by using an empirical model to derive reference-dependent BTs. Using the developed empirical model, measurements can be normalized to a reference BT in order to enhance the calibration assessment's accuracy. This method is evaluated using all four scene types (i.e., ocean, desert, snow (Dome-C), and DCC) and applied to all the Terra and Aqua MODIS TEBs. Stability assessments over the instruments' entire data records are presented and discussed. The technique can be applied in future efforts to support MODIS TEBs calibration assessments.

TI  - Detection of Biogenic Oil Films near Aquaculture Sites Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biogenic films are very thin surface oils, frequently observed near aquaculture farms, that affect the roughness and the optical properties of the sea surface, making them visible in SAR and multispectral images. The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential of satellite SAR and multispectral sensors in the detection of biogenic oil films near aquaculture farms. Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral data were exploited to detect the films around three aquaculture sites. The study is divided in three stages: (a) preprocessing, (b) main process and (c) accuracy assessment. The preprocessing stage includes subset, filtering, land masking and image corrections. The main process was similar for both datasets, using an adaptive thresholding method to identify dark formations, extract and classify them. Finally, the performance of the algorithm was evaluated based on the estimation of standard classification error statistics. The evaluation of the results was based on empirical photointerpretation and in situ photos. The results are successful and promising, with overall accuracy over 70%, while both sensors are proved to be effective in the detection, with Sentinel-1 SAR presenting slightly better accuracy (81%) than Sentinel-2 MSI (70%). There is no evidence of these films causing stress to the aquaculture farms or the surrounding environment; however, our knowledge on their presence, amount and dissolution is limited and further knowledge could contribute to efficient feeding management and fish welfare.

TI  - Monitoring the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Aeolian Desertification Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern China has been long threatened by aeolian desertification. In recent years, all levels of the Chinese government have performed a series of ecological protection and sand control projects. To grasp the implementation effects of these projects and adjust policies in time, it is necessary to understand the process of aeolian desertification quickly and accurately. Remote sensing technologies play an irreplaceable role in aeolian desertification monitoring. In this study, the Zhenglan Banner, which is in the hinterland of the Hunshandake Sandy Land, was considered as the research area. Based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, ground survey data, and Landsat images called in Google Earth Engine (GEE), the aeolian desertified land (ADL) in 2000, 2004, 2010, 2015, and 2019 was extracted using spectral mixture analysis. A desertification index (DI) was constructed to evaluate the spatial and temporal dynamics of the ADL in the Zhenglan Banner. Finally, a residual analysis explored the driving forces of aeolian desertification. The results showed that (1) the ADL area in the Zhenglan Banner has been trending downwards over the past 20 years but rebounded from 2004 to 2010; (2) over the past 20 years, the area of slightly, moderately, and severely desertified land has decreased at annual rates of 0.4%, 2.7%, and 3.4%, respectively; (3) human activities had significantly positive and negative impacts on the aeolian desertification trend for 20.0% and 21.0% of the study area, respectively, but not for the rest. This paper explored new techniques for rapid aeolian desertification monitoring and is of great significance for controlling and managing aeolian desertification in this region.

TI  - Combination of Sentinel-2 and PALSAR-2 for Local Climate Zone Classification: A Case Study of Nanchang, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Local climate zone (LCZ) maps have been used widely to study urban structures and urban heat islands. Because remote sensing data enable automated LCZ mapping on a large scale, there is a need to evaluate how well remote sensing resources can produce fine LCZ maps to assess urban thermal environments. In this study, we combined Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery and dual-polarized (HH + HV) PALSAR-2 data to generate LCZ maps of Nanchang, China using a random forest classifier and a grid-cell-based method. We then used the classifier to evaluate the importance scores of different input features (Sentinel-2 bands, PALSAR-2 channels, and textural features) for the classification model and their contribution to each LCZ class. Finally, we investigated the relationship between LCZs and land surface temperatures (LSTs) derived from summer nighttime ASTER thermal imagery by spatial statistical analysis. The highest classification accuracy was 89.96% when all features were used, which highlighted the potential of Sentinel-2 and dual-polarized PALSAR-2 data. The most important input feature was the short-wave infrared-2 band of Sentinel-2. The spectral reflectance was more important than polarimetric and textural features in LCZ classification. PALSAR-2 data were beneficial for several land cover LCZ types when Sentinel-2 and PALSAR-2 were combined. Summer nighttime LSTs in most LCZs differed significantly from each other. Results also demonstrated that grid-cell processing provided more homogeneous LCZ maps than the usual resampling methods. This study provided a promising reference to further improve LCZ classification and quantitative analysis of local climate.

TI  - Preliminary Validation of Surface Reflections from Fengyun-3C Radio Occultation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) is a Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) Radio Occultation (RO) mission founded which was by China on 23 September 2013. In this study, under a specific temporal and spatial domain, we systematically compare FY-3C refractivity profiles with Constellation Observing System for Meteorology Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) refractivity profiles for the year 2015. The COSMIC profiles used in this study contain reflections, as identified in the Radio Occultation Meteorology Satellite Application Facility (ROM SAF) flag database. From 0 to 25 km altitude, the mean biases and relative standard deviations of the comparisons between FY-3C and COSMIC are less than 1% and 2% when COSMIC profiles present reflected signals. Radio holographic analysis is used to visualize and identify the spectra of FY-3C-reflected signals in the time-frequency domain. It is confirmed that the reflected signals in the lower troposphere and near the surface can be tracked by an FY-3C receiver. Further, most of the FY-3C events that matched with COSMIC reflected events show reflection patterns at a lower height, especially above the ocean's surface. Under Bouguer's rule and spherical symmetry assumptions, we reconstructed the reflected bending angle models by Abel transformation, which are valuable for reducing N-bias in the ducting layer. Three examples of FY-3C events show that the reflected bending branch is near the surface. Overall, the reflected signal of FY-3C could be used as a supplementary data portion for FY-3C atmospheric products.

TI  - Satellite-Based Mapping of High-Resolution Ground-Level PM<sub>2.5</sub> with VIIRS IP AOD in China through Spatially Neural Network Weighted Regression
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) data are extensively integrated with ground-level measurements to achieve spatially continuous fine particulate matters (PM2.5). Current satellite-based methods however face challenges in obtaining highly accurate and reasonable PM2.5 distributions due to the inability to handle both spatial non-stationarity and complex non-linearity in the PM2.5-AOD relationship. High-resolution (<1 km) PM2.5 products over the whole of China for fine exposure assessment and health research are also lacking. This study aimed to predict 750 m resolution ground-level PM2.5 in China with the high-resolution Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) intermediate product (IP) AOD data using a newly developed geographically neural network weighted regression (GNNWR) model. The performance evaluations demonstrated that GNNWR achieved higher prediction accuracy than the widely used methods with cross-validation and predictive R-2 of 0.86 and 0.85. Satellite-derived monthly 750 m resolution PM2.5 data in China were generated with robust prediction accuracy and almost complete coverage. The PM2.5 pollution was found to be greatly improved in 2018 in China with annual mean concentration of 31.07 +/- 17.52 mu g/m(3). Nonetheless, fine-scale PM2.5 exposures at multiple administrative levels suggested that PM2.5 pollution in most urban areas needed further control, especially in southern Hebei Province. This work is the first to evaluate the potential of VIIRS IP AOD in modeling high-resolution PM2.5 over large-scale. The newly satellite-derived PM2.5 data with high spatial resolution and high prediction accuracy at the national scale are valuable to advance environmental and health researches in China.

TI  - Evaluation of Fengyun-4A Lightning Mapping Imager (LMI) Performance during Multiple Convective Episodes over Beijing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the characteristics of space-borne Lightning Mapping Imager (LMI) lightning products and their relationships with cloud properties using ground-based total lightning observations from the Beijing Broadband Lightning Network (BLNET) and cloud information from S-band Doppler radar data. LMI showed generally consistent lightning spatial distributions with those of BLNET, and yielded a considerable lightning detection capability over regions with complex terrain. The ratios between the LMI events, groups and flashes were approximately 9:3:1, and the number of LMI-detected flashes was roughly one order of magnitude smaller than the number of BLNET-detected flashes. However, in different convective episodes, the LMI detection capability was likely to be affected by cloud properties, especially in strongly electrified convective episodes associated with frequent lightning discharging and thick cloud depth. As a result, LMI tended to detect lightning flashes located in weaker and shallower cloud portions associated with fewer cloud shielding effects. With reference to the BLNET total lightning data as the ground truth of observation (both intra-cloud lightning and cloud-to-ground lightning flashes), the LMI event-based detection efficiency (DE) was estimated to reach 28% under rational spatiotemporal matching criteria (1.5 s and 65 km) over Beijing. In terms of LMI flash-based DE, it was much reduced compared with event-based DE. The LMI flash-based ranged between 1.5% and 3.5% with 1.5 s and 35-65 km matching scales. For 330 ms and 35 km, the spatiotemporal matching criteria used to evaluate Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM), the LMI flash-based DE was smaller (<1%).

TI  - Watch Out for the Tailings Pond, a Sharp Edge Hanging over Our Heads: Lessons Learned and Perceptions from the Brumadinho Tailings Dam Failure Disaster
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A catastrophic tailings dam failure disaster occurred in Brumadinho, Brazil on 25 January 2019, which resulted in over 270 casualties, 24,000 residents evacuated, and a huge economic loss. Environmental concerns were raised for the potential pollution of water due to tailings waste entering the Paraopeba River. In this paper, a detailed analysis has been carried out to investigate the disaster conditions of the Brumadinho dam failure using satellite images with different spatial resolutions. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the hazard chain caused by this failure contained three stages, namely dam failure, mudflow, and the hyperconcentrated flow in the Paraopeba River. The variation characteristics of turbidity of the Rio Paraopeba River after the disaster have also been investigated using high-resolution remote sensing images, followed by a qualitative analysis of the impacts on the downstream reservoir of the Retiro Baixo Plant that was over 300 km away from the dam failure origin. It is believed that, on the one hand, the lack of dam stability management at the maintenance stage was the main cause of this disaster. On the other hand, the abundant antecedent precipitation caused by extreme weather events should be a critical triggering factor. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal pattern mining of global tailings dam failures revealed that the Brumadinho dam disaster belonged to a Consecutive Hot Spot area, suggesting that the regular drainage inspection, risk assessment, monitoring, and early warning of tailings dam in Consecutive Hot Spot areas still need to be strengthened for disaster mitigation.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Modeling of Coniferous Forests Dynamics along the Southern Edge of Their Range in the Central Russian Plain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests with predominance of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) within the hemiboreal zone are considered as secondary communities formed under long-term human activity (logging, plowing, fires and silviculture). This study raises the question-how stable is current state of coniferous forests on the southern border of their natural distribution in the center of Eastern Europe using the example of the Moscow region (MR)? The object of the study are spruce and pine forests in different periods of Soviet and post-Soviet history within the Moscow Region (MR). The current proportion of spruce forests is 21.7%, and the proportion of pine forests is 18.5% from total forest area according to our estimates. The direction and rate of forest succession were analyzed based on current composition of populations of the main forest-forming species (spruce, pine, birch, aspen, oak, linden, and ash) based on ground-based research materials collected in 2006-2019. This allowed to develop the dynamic model (DM) of forest communities with the participation of Norway spruce and Scots pine for several decades. Assessment of the spatial distribution of coniferous communities is based on field data and spatial modeling using remote sensing data-Landsat 8 mosaic for 2020. In parallel, a retrospective model (RM) of the spatial-temporal organization of spruce and pine forests for a 30-year period was developed using two Landsat 5 mosaics. For this, nine different algorithms were tested and the best one for this task was found-random forest. Geobotanical releves were used as a training sample combined with the 2006-2012 mosaic; the obtained spectral signatures were used for modeling based on the 1984-1990 mosaic. Thus, two multi-temporal spatial models of coniferous formations have been developed. Detailed analysis of the structure of spruce and pine forests based on field data made it possible to track trends of successional dynamics for the first time, considering the origin of communities and the ecological conditions of habitats. As a result, ideas about the viability of spruce and pine cenopopulations in different types of communities were formulated, which made possible to develop a dynamic model (DM) of changes in forest communities for future. Comparison of the areas and nature of changes in the spatial structure of coniferous formations made possible to develop the RM. Comparison of two different-time models of succession dynamics (DM and RM) makes possible to correct the main trends in the transformation of coniferous forests of natural and artificial origin under the existing regime of forestry. A set of features was identified that indicates risk factors for coniferous forests in the region. A further decrease of the spruce and pine plantations and increase of the spruce-small-leaved and deciduous formations are expected in the study area. The proportion of pine-spruce forests does not exceed 3% of the area and can be considered as the most vulnerable type of forest.

TI  - Geometric Calibration Updates to Landsat 7 ETM+ Instrument for Landsat Collection 2 Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat 7 (L7) spacecraft and its instrument, the enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+), have been consistently characterized and calibrated since its launch in April of 1999. These performance metrics and calibration updates are determined through the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat image assessment system (IAS), which has been performing this function since launch. Starting in 2016, the USGS adopted a tiered collection management structure for its Landsat data products that ensures a consistent method of processing for the Landsat archive within a given collection while allowing a set of calibration updates to be performed between any two given collections. The time frame between 2016 and the end of 2020 was part of the Landsat data Collection 1, in the middle of 2020 was the start of the Landsat Collection 2 data products. The start of a given collection initiates the reprocessing of the Landsat archive, which may involve one or more of a set of updated calibration parameters, improvements in the support data needed for product generation, and improved algorithms used in both the processing flow of products along with the characterization and calibration of the Landsat instruments and spacecraft. This paper discusses only the ETM+ geometric spacecraft and instrument calibration improvements for Collection 2. Three ETM+ calibration updates were made for the ETM+; updates to the thermal band odd-to-even detector alignment, sensor to attitude control system (ACS) alignment, and a cold-to-warm focal plane alignment adjustment. The sensor alignment updates impact only the accuracy of the systematic terrain products (L1GT), which are the products generated before applying any corrections based on the ground control used in registration. The band alignment changes impacted only bands 5, 6, and 7 within the focal plane. Other geometric calibration updates, such as scan mirror alignment, are done on a routine basis and are not part of the Collection 2 updates due to their more dynamic characteristics.

TI  - Quantification of One-Year Gypsy Moth Defoliation Extent in Wonju, Korea, Using Landsat Satellite Images
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We quantified the extent and severity of Asian gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) defoliation in Wonju, Korea, from May to early June in 2020. Landsat images were collected covering Wonju and the surrounding area in June from 2017 to 2020. Forest damage was evaluated based on differences between the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) from images acquired in 8 June 2020 and the prior mean NDMI estimated from images in June from 2017 to 2019. The values of NDMI ranged from -1 to 1, where values closer to 1 meant higher canopy cover. The NDMI values for 7825 ha of forests were reduced by more than 0.05 compared to the mean NDMI values for the prior 3 years (2017 to 2019). The NDMI values of 1350 ha of forests were reduced by >0.125 to 0.2, and the NDMI values for another 656 ha were reduced by more than 0.2. A field survey showed that these forests were defoliated by gypsy moth and that forests with NDMI reductions of more than 0.2 were heavily defoliated by gypsy moth. A 311 ha area of Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi) was severely damaged by gypsy moth and the proportion of larch damaged was higher than that of other tree species. This intense damage to larch suggests that gypsy moths preferentially attack Japanese larch in Wonju. Our study shows that the use of NDMI values to detect areas defoliated by gypsy moth from satellite images is effective and can be used to measure other characteristics of gypsy moth defoliation events, such as host preferences under field conditions.

TI  - Long-Term Variation in the Tropospheric Nitrogen Dioxide Vertical Column Density over Korea and Japan from the MAX-DOAS Network, 2007-2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated long-term observations of the tropospheric nitrogen dioxide vertical column density (NO2 TropVCD) from the Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) network in Russia and ASia (MADRAS) from 2007 to 2017 at urban (Yokosuka and Gwangju) and remote (Fukue and Cape Hedo) sites in East Asia. The monthly mean in the NO2 TropVCD from MAX-DOAS measured at similar to 13:30 local time, which is the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) overpass time, shows good agreement with OMI data during summer, but differences between the two datasets increase in winter. The Theil-Sen slope of the long-term trend indicate a relatively rapid and gradual reduction in NO2 at Yokosuka and two remote sites (Fukue and Cape Hedo), respectively, regardless of the season except for fall at Fukue, but significant changes in NO2 are not observed at Gwangju, Korea. In contrast, OMI satellite data reveal an increase in the NO2 TropVCD at all sites except for Yokosuka, where a decreasing trend common to MAX-DOAS is found, suggesting that the results from satellites need to be cautiously used for investigating long-term trends in less polluted or remote areas. Using backward trajectories, potential source regions are identified for the two urban sites. The spatial distribution from OMI data shows good agreement with the potential source regions at Yokosuka. The potential source regions in Gwangju are identified as the National Industrial Complex in Yeosu and Gwangyang, while the transport route is not clearly visible with OMI data because of their low sensitivity in less polluted areas. The proposed approach is suitable for identifying potential source areas that might not be recognized by satellite observations.

TI  - Rice growth vegetation index 2 for improving estimation of rice plant phenology in costal ecosystems
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop growth is one of the most important parameters of a crop and its knowledge before harvest is essential to help farmers, scientists, governments and agribusiness. This paper provides a novel demonstration of the use of freely available Sentinel-2 data to estimate rice crop growth in a single year. Sentinel 2 data provides frequent and consistent information to facilitate coastal monitoring from field scales. The aims of this study were to modify the rice growth vegetation index to improve rice growth phenology in the coastal areas. The rice growth vegetation index 2 is the best vegetation index, compared with 11 vegetation indices, plant height and biomass. The results demonstrate that the coefficient of rice growth vegetation index 2 was 0.83, has the highest correlation with plant height. Rice growth vegetation index 2 is more appropriate for enhancing and obtaining rice phenology information. This study analyses the best spectral vegetation indices for estimating rice growth.

TI  - Enhancing communication between foundation doctors and radiologists: a quality improvement project
T2  - POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Facilitating radiological imaging for patients is an essential task for foundation year (FY) doctors. Achieving competence in this task can significantly enhance patient management. We evaluated the confidence and skills of FY doctors in facilitating radiological imaging before and after introduction of formal training. Twenty surgical FYs working at a large teaching hospital were surveyed to evaluate their baseline level of competence in booking and discussing imaging with radiology colleagues. Parameters were measured on a Likert scale, including confidence in discussing requests and satisfaction of their own performance following discussions with radiologists. Eight radiology consultants were surveyed to evaluate their opinions on FYs' communication and established areas for improvement. A teaching session was then delivered to improve communication skills. Furthermore, Previous investigation results, Answer you need from the scan, Clinical status and story, Crucial: how urgent is the scan, Safety (PACCSS) poster was introduced to remind the FYs of the salient information required when discussing imaging. One month after the intervention, the initial participants were resurveyed. Based on a 10-point Likert scale, the FYs demonstrated a mean improvement in self-reported confidence (2.1 +/- 1.1, p<0.01), and in satisfaction of own performance after a discussion (1.7 +/- 1.1, p<0.01). We identified deficiencies in surgical FY doctors' confidence and skills in facilitating radiological imaging. There was a demonstrable benefit with focused training in improving these skills. This could potentially provide significant benefits in patient care and management. Interspecialty communication should be introduced into undergraduate and postgraduate educational curriculum.

TI  - Lower-Limb Lymphedema after Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Cervical Cancer Patients
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryLower-limb lymphedema (LLL) is a well-recognized adverse outcome of the surgical management of cervical cancer. Recently, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has emerged as an alternative procedure to systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLND) aiming to decrease the risk of complications, especially LLL development. Our study represents the first prospective analysis of LLL incidence in cervical cancer patients after a uterine procedure with SLN biopsy, without systematic PLND. In an international multicenter trial SENTIX, the group of 150 patients was prospectively evaluated using both objective and subjective LLL assessments in 6 months intervals for 2 years. Contrary to the expectations, our results showed that SLN biopsy does not eliminate the risk of LLL development which occurred in a mild or moderate stage in about 26% of patients with a median interval to the onset of 9 months.Background: To prospectively assess LLL incidence among cervical cancer patients treated by uterine surgery complemented by SLN biopsy, without PLND. Methods: A prospective study in 150 patients with stage IA1-IB2 cervical cancer treated by uterine surgery with bilateral SLN biopsy. Objective LLL assessments, based on limb volume increase (LVI) between pre- and postoperative measurements, and subjective patient-perceived swelling were conducted in six-month periods over 24-months post-surgery. Results: The cumulative incidence of LLL at 24 months was 17.3% for mild LLL (LVI 10-19%), 9.2% for moderate LLL (LVI 20-39%), while only one patient (0.7%) developed severe LLL (LVI > 40%). The median interval to LLL onset was nine months. Transient edema resolving without intervention within six months was reported in an additional 22% of patients. Subjective LLL was reported by 10.7% of patients, though only a weak and partial correlation between subjective-report and objective-LVI was found. No risk factor directly related to LLL development was identified. Conclusions: The replacement of standard PLND by bilateral SLN biopsy in the surgical treatment of cervical cancer does not eliminate the risk of mild to moderate LLL, which develops irrespective of the number of SLN removed.

TI  - Seasonal Net Shortwave Radiation of Bare Arable Land in Poland and Israel According to Roughness and Atmospheric Irradiance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tillage of arable fields, using for instance a smoothing harrow, may increase the magnitude of albedo of such soil surfaces depending on the location, the sun's illumination and atmospheric components. As these soil surfaces absorb less shortwave radiation compared to plowed soils, the result is an atmospheric cooling and a positive effect on the Earth's climate. This paper is the follow-on of a previous study aimed at quantifying the seasonal dynamics of net shortwave radiation reflected by bare air-dried arable land areas located in contrasting environments, i.e. Poland and Israel. Soil tillage includes a plow, a disk harrow, and a smoothing harrow. Previous work concentrated on the estimate of net shortwave radiation under clear-sky theoretical scenarios, whereas the present study deals with a realistic atmosphere throughout the year 2014. This latter is characterized by the observations of the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) instrument on board the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG). The variations of the net shortwave radiation for the selected bare arable land areas were assessed in combining observations from Landsat 8 images and digital maps of land use and soil, plus model equations that calculate the diurnal variations of the broadband blue-sky albedo with roughness inclusive. The daily amount of net shortwave radiation for air-dried bare arable land in Poland and Israel for the time their spatial coverage is the largest was found to be about 40-50% and 10% lower, respectively, in cloudy-sky conditions compared to clear-sky conditions.

TI  - Mapping National Mangrove Cover for Belize Using Google Earth Engine and Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present the highest-resolution-available (10 m) national map of the mangrove ecosystems of Belize. These important ecosystems are increasingly threatened by human activities and climate change, support both marine and terrestrial biodiversity, and provide critical ecosystem services to coastal communities in Belize and throughout the Mesoamerican Reef ecoregion. Previous national- and international-level inventories document Belizean mangrove forests at spatial resolutions of 30 m or coarser, but many mangrove patches and loss events may be too small to be accurately mapped at these resolutions. Our 10 m map addresses this need for a finer-scale national mangrove inventory. We mapped mangrove ecosystems in Belize as of 2020 by performing a random forest classification of Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument imagery in Google Earth Engine. We mapped a total mangrove area of 578.54 km(2) in 2020, with 372.04 km(2) located on the mainland and 206.50 km(2) distributed throughout the country's islands and cayes. Our findings are substantially different from previous, coarser-resolution national mangrove inventories of Belize, which emphasizes the importance of high-resolution mapping efforts for ongoing conservation efforts.

TI  - Practical Estimation of Landslide Kinematics Using PSI Data
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Kinematics is a key component of a landslide hazard because landslides moving at similar rates can affect structures or collapse differently depending on their mechanisms. While a complete definition of landslide kinematics requires integrating surface and subsurface site investigation data, its practical estimate is usually based on 2D profiles of surface slope displacements. These can be now measured accurately using Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PSI), which exploits open access satellite imagery. Although 2D profiles of kinematic quantities are easy to retrieve, the efficacy of possible descriptors and extraction strategies has not been systematically compared, especially for complex landslides. Large, slow rock slope deformations, characterized by low displacement rates (<50 mm/year) and spatial and temporal heterogeneities, are an excellent testing ground to explore the best approaches to exploit PSI data from Sentinel-1 for kinematic characterization. For three case studies, we extract profiles of different kinematic quantities using different strategies and evaluate them against field data and simplified numerical modelling. We suggest that C-band PSI data allow for an effective appraisal of complex landslide kinematics, provided that the interpretation is (a) based on decomposed velocity vector descriptors, (b) extracted along critical profiles using interpolation techniques respectful of landslide heterogeneity, and (c) constrained by suitable model-based templates and field data.

TI  - Machine Learning Techniques for Fine Dead Fuel Load Estimation Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine dead fuel load is one of the most significant components of wildfires without which ignition would fail. Several studies have previously investigated 1-h fuel load using standard fuel parameters or site-specific fuel parameters estimated ad hoc for the landscape. On the one hand, these methods have a large margin of error, while on the other their production times and costs are high. In response to this gap, a set of models was developed combining multi-source remote sensing data, field data and machine learning techniques to quantitatively estimate fine dead fuel load and understand its determining factors. Therefore, the objectives of the study were to: (1) estimate 1-h fuel loads using remote sensing predictors and machine learning techniques; (2) evaluate the performance of each machine learning technique compared to traditional linear regression models; (3) assess the importance of each remote sensing predictor; and (4) map the 1-h fuel load in a pilot area of the Apulia region (southern Italy). In pursuit of the above, fine dead fuel load estimation was performed by the integration of field inventory data (251 plots), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR, Sentinel-1), optical (Sentinel-2), and Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data applying three different algorithms: Multiple Linear regression (MLR), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Model performances were evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), the coefficient of determination (R-2) and Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). The results showed that RF (RMSE: 0.09; MSE: 0.01; r: 0.71; R-2: 0.50) had more predictive power compared to the other models, while SVM (RMSE: 0.10; MSE: 0.01; r: 0.63; R-2: 0.39) and MLR (RMSE: 0.11; MSE: 0.01; r: 0.63; R-2: 0.40) showed similar performances. LIDAR variables (Canopy Height Model and Canopy cover) were more important in fuel estimation than optical and radar variables. In fact, the results highlighted a positive relationship between 1-h fuel load and the presence of the tree component. Conversely, the geomorphological variables appeared to have lower predictive power. Overall, the 1-h fuel load map developed by the RF model can be a valuable tool to support decision making and can be used in regional wildfire risk management.

TI  - High Spatial Resolution Soil Moisture Mapping Using a Lobe Differencing Correlation Radiometer on a Small Unmanned Aerial System
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A persistent challenge in the measurement of soil moisture from satellites stems from the inherently low spatial resolution using active or passive system. The lobe differencing correlation radiometer (LDCR) on a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) is shown to provide a capability to measure soil moisture at high spatial resolution for a range of scientific and operational purposes. Flight tests of LDCR on a fixed wing sUAS were performed at the Canton, Oklahoma Soilscape site in September 2015, and Irrigation Research Foundation (IRF) in Yuma, Colorado, in June 2016. The LDCR design and performance are discussed, and the calibration using both preflight lab test data and in-flight data over a calm pond was performed to calibrate the radiometer. Radio frequency interference (RFI) from the sUAS platform was observed and mitigated. The LDCR sampling processes are detailed and an implementation of the tau - omega vegetation correction model along with a semiempirical surface roughness correction model incorporating a full-domain soil moisture mapping algorithm is presented. The algorithm uses a weakly nonlinear observation operator suitable for irregular sUAS flight trajectories that maps volumetric soil moisture (VSM) on a user-defined product grid from the sUAS sampling grid. Using LDCR radiometric and thermal measurements, along with Landsat-based vegetation water content (VWC) and soil texture information, soil moisture was mapped at decameter spatial resolution. The retrieved VSM data are favorably compared with in situ VSM measurements and irrigation records. A method for determining LDCR VSM estimation errors is developed to quantify the mapping algorithm accuracy and assess the impact of error sources.

TI  - Assessing the Accuracy of ALOS/PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1 Radar Images in Estimating the Land Subsidence of Coastal Areas: A Case Study in Alexandria City, Egypt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) technique is widely used for quantifying the land surface deformation, which is very important to assess the potential impact on social and economic activities. Radar satellites operate in different wavelengths and each provides different levels of vertical displacement accuracy. In this study, the accuracies of Sentinel-1 (C-band) and ALOS/PALSAR-2 (L-band) were investigated in terms of estimating the land subsidence rate along the study area of Alexandria City, Egypt. A total of nine Sentinel-1 and 11 ALOS/PALSAR-2 scenes were used for such assessment. The small baseline subset (SBAS) processing scheme, which detects the land deformation with a high spatial and temporal coverage, was performed. The results show that the threshold coherence values of the generated interferograms from ALOS-2 data are highly concentrated between 0.2 and 0.3, while a higher threshold value of 0.4 shows no coherent pixels for about 80% of Alexandria's urban area. However, the coherence values of Sentinel-1 interferograms ranged between 0.3 and 1, with most of the urban area in Alexandria showing coherent pixels at a 0.4 value. In addition, both data types produced different residual topography values of almost 0 m with a standard deviation of 13.5 m for Sentinel-1 and -20.5 m with a standard deviation of 33.24 m for ALOS-2 using the same digital elevation model (DEM) and wavelet number. Consequently, the final deformation was estimated using high coherent pixels with a threshold of 0.4 for Sentinel-1, which is comparable to a threshold of about 0.8 when using ALOS-2 data. The cumulative vertical displacement along the study area from 2017 to 2020 reached -60 mm with an average of -12.5 mm and mean displacement rate of -1.73 mm/year. Accordingly, the Alexandrian coastal plain and city center are found to be relatively stable, with land subsidence rates ranging from 0 to -5 mm/year. The maximum subsidence rate reached -20 mm/year and was found along the boundary of Mariout Lakes and former Abu Qir Lagoon. Finally, the affected buildings recorded during the field survey were plotted on the final land subsidence maps and show high consistency with the DInSAR results. For future developmental urban plans in Alexandria City, it is recommended to expand towards the western desert fringes instead of the south where the present-day ground lies on top of the former wetland areas.

TI  - Earth Observations Based Assessment of Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Surface Water Quality of Buddha Nala, Punjab, India
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) halted almost all the industrial scale anthropogenic activities across the globe, resulting in improvements in water and air quality of megacities. Here, using Sentinel-2A data, we quantified impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the water quality parameters in one of the largest perennial creeks i.e., the Buddha Nala located in District Ludhiana in India. This creek has long been considered as a dumping ground for industrial wastes and has resulted in surface and ground water pollution in the entire lower Indus Basin. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index (NDCI), Nitrogen Content Index (NI), Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (NDTI), and Total Suspended Matter (TSM) were compared prior (2019) and during (2020) lockdown in the creek. There was a significant enhancement in NDVI, NDWI, NDCI, and NI values, and reduction in NDTI and TSM values during the lockdown period. When compared with prior year (2019), the values of indices suggested an improvement in water quality and an indicative change in aquatic ecology in the creek. The impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the improvement in water quality of Buddha Nala was more evident in the upstream and downstream sections than the middle section. This is intriguing since the middle section of the creek was continually impacted by domestic household effluents. The earth observation inspired methodology employed and findings are testament to the discriminatory power to employ remote sensing data and to develop protocols to monitor water quality in regions where routine surveillance of water remains cost prohibitive.

TI  - Assessing Shoreline Change using Historical Aerial and RapidEye Satellite Imagery (Cape Jaffa, South Australia)
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal zone is a dynamic area which can experience substantial natural change in short time periods, but changes are also associated with human modifications to the coastline. This case study is focused around assessing shoreline change associated with the Cape Jaffa Marina and canal estate in South Australia. The research comprises a GIS based analysis of shoreline change utilising aerial imagery from 1975 to 2005, which provides information of the morphological coastal trends prior to construction in 2008 of the marina/canal estate. In addition, imagery collected by the RapidEye satellite constellation was used to assess shoreline changes in the decade since construction, 2009 to 2019. The shoreline change statistics over the past few decades were calculated using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System extension of ESRI's ArcGIS. The image analysis workflow is based on the objective extraction of shoreline proxies from individual image statistics in a semi-automated process and is used to identify the waterline and edge of vegetation shoreline proxies in a time series analysis. The results provide a case study of a historically progradational sandy coastline experiencing substantial amounts of alongshore sediment transport, the corresponding obstruction from coastal infrastructure, and the resulting morphological changes to the Cape Jaffa shoreline. Shoreline change trends were altered from a predominantly accretional shoreline before the construction of the marina to one oscillating between extremes of erosion and accretion. The results showed significant accretion occurring updrift (Net Shore Movement (NSM) of 106 m) and significant erosion downdrift (NSM of -80 m) of the marina's training walls and entrance. The information derived from Earth observation satellites, such as RapidEye, can provide valuable insights into trend analysis due to their relatively high spatial (5 metre) and temporal resolution (5.5-day revisit).

TI  - Peri-operative imaging techniques of the sentinel lymph node in veterinary oncology
T2  - VLAAMS DIERGENEESKUNDIG TIJDSCHRIFT
M3  - Review
AB  - When cancer cells spread through lymphatic vessels, the first lymph node they reach is the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Hence, if the SLN is free from metastatic cells, it can be assumed that further lymph nodes will be free of metastatic tumor cells too. If metastatic tumor cells are identified in the SLN, the patient is at risk of developing distant metastatic disease. In that case, further diagnostic and therapeutic steps are needed and the patient's prognosis gets worse. The SLN can be located at an anatomically unpredictable location. This is likely due to lymphangiogenesis, which alters the normal lymphatic pathway and drains the metastatic cells to another lymph node than the expected anatomically closest one. Therefore, identifying the SLN by an accurate mapping technique is necessary. In this article, the existing techniques for SLN mapping are reviewed, and their use in human and veterinary medicine is compared.

TI  - Mapping mangrove dynamics and colonization patterns at the Suriname coast using historic satellite data and the LandTrendr algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves play an important role in protecting coasts against wave energy and storms. Mangrove ecosystems provide important habitats for fauna and flora and are an important carbon sink. Loss of mangroves forest may lead to enhanced coastal erosion. Mangroves are complex ecosystems and processes of settling and development are not fully understood. Characterizing the rates and patterns of mangrove gains and losses is needed to better understand the functioning of mangrove ecosystems, how mangrove dynamics are linked to coastal morphological behaviour and how human interference with the coastal system impacts mangroves. Here we present a study of the mangrove ecosystems at the Suriname coast, which are relatively pristine and characterized by strong dynamics due to migrating mudbanks along the coast. Satellite images between 2000 and 2018, available in the historic satellite image archives, were analysed using the LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery) algorithm to identify locations of mangrove erosion, mangrove colonization, surface areas of change and patterns of settlement, as indicated by (sudden) changes in NDVI. The algorithm requires careful setting of various parameters for successful detection of (abrupt) temporal changes in mangrove coverage. The algorithm was evaluated on its robustness using various parameter settings. Results show the value of the timeseries of Landsat imagery to detect locations of coastal erosion of up to 50 m/yr and accretion where loss or settlement of mangroves is prevailing between 2000 and 2018. Locally differences are very large. An overall westward mangrove progression along the coast is apparent from the images and probably linked to mud bank migration. Various patterns of mangrove colonization and development such as arc-, zonaland patcharrangements were identified, although at some locations the Landsat resolution of 30 m is somewhat coarse to allow detailed analysis. The success and robustness of the LandTrendr algorithm are controlled by NDVI threshold values, number of allowed breakpoints in the timeseries and fitting parameters. The presented method requires further testing and evaluation but is a promising tool for semi-automatic detection of coastal mangrove erosion and colonization that can be applied to other mangrove ecosystems in the world. The satellite timeseries analyses generate valuable information on coastal dynamics, which is helpful to identify coastal areas prone to erosion and mangrove retreat and provide as such a valuable tool for coastal management and protection.

TI  - Legacy Effects Following Fire on Surface Energy, Water and Carbon Fluxes in Mature Amazonian Forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The ongoing deforestation process in Amazonia has led to intensified forest fires in the region, particularly in Brazil, after more than a decade of effective forest conservation policy. This study aims to investigate the recovery of two mature sub-montane ombrophile Amazonian forests affected by fire in terms of energy, water and carbon fluxes utilizing remote sensing (MODIS) and climate reanalysis data (GLDAS). These two forest plots, mainly composed of Manilkara spp. (Macaranduba), Protium spp. (Breu) (similar to 30 m), Bertholletia excelsa (Castanheira) and Dinizia excelsa Ducke (Angelim-Pedra) (similar to 50 m), occupy areas of 100.5 and 122.1 km(2) and were subject to fire on the same day, on September 12, 2010. The fire significantly increased land surface temperature (0.8 degrees C) and air temperature (1.2 degrees C) in the forests over a 3 years interval. However, the forests showed an ability to recover their original states in terms of coupling between the carbon and water cycles comparing the 3-year periods before and after the fires. Results from a wavelet analysis showed an intensification in annual and seasonal fluctuations, and in some cases (e.g., daily net radiation and evapotrasnspiration) sub-annual fluctuation. We interpreted these changes to be consistent with overall intensification of the coupling of energy balance components and drivers imposed by climate and solar cycle seasonality, as well as faster time scale changes, consistent with a shift toward greater forest openness and consequent reduction in the interception of incoming solar radiation by the canopy.

TI  - From Remote Sensing to Species Distribution Modelling: An Integrated Workflow to Monitor Spreading Species in Key Grassland Habitats
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) has been widely adopted as a tool to investigate several biotic and abiotic factors, directly and indirectly, related to biodiversity conservation. European grasslands are one of the most biodiverse habitats in Europe. Most of these habitats are subject to priority conservation measure, and several human-induced processes threaten them. The broad expansions of few dominant species are usually reported as drivers of biodiversity loss. In this context, using Sentinel-2 (S2) images, we investigate the distribution of one of the most spreading species in the Central Apennine: Brachypodium genuense. We performed a binary Random Forest (RF) classification of B. genuense using RS images and field-sampled presence/absence data. Then, we integrate the occurrences obtained from RS classification into species distribution models to identify the topographic drivers of B. genuense distribution in the study area. Lastly, the impact of B. genuense distribution in the Natura 2000 (N2k) habitats (Annex I of the European Habitat Directive) was assessed by overlay analysis. The RF classification process detected cover of B. genuense with an overall accuracy of 94.79%. The topographic species distribution model shows that the most relevant topographic variables that influence the distribution of B. genuense are slope, elevation, solar radiation, and topographic wet index (TWI) in order of importance. The overlay analysis shows that 74.04% of the B. genuense identified in the study area falls on the semi-natural dry grasslands. The study highlights the RS classification and the topographic species distribution model's importance as an integrated workflow for mapping a broad-expansion species such as B. genuense. The coupled techniques presented in this work should apply to other plant communities with remotely recognizable characteristics for more effective management of N2k habitats.

TI  - An Evaluation of Pixel- and Object-Based Tree Species Classification in Mixed Deciduous Forests Using Pansharpened Very High Spatial Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quality tree species information gathering is the basis for making proper decisions in forest management. By applying new technologies and remote sensing methods, very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery can give sufficient spatial detail to achieve accurate species-level classification. In this study, the influence of pansharpening of the WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite imagery on classification results of three main tree species (Quercus robur L., Carpinus betulus L., and Alnus glutinosa (L.) Geartn.) has been evaluated. In order to increase tree species classification accuracy, three different pansharpening algorithms (Bayes, RCS, and LMVM) have been conducted. The LMVM algorithm proved the most effective pansharpening technique. The pixel- and object-based classification were applied to three pansharpened imageries using a random forest (RF) algorithm. The results showed a very high overall accuracy (OA) for LMVM pansharpened imagery: 92% and 96% for tree species classification based on pixel- and object-based approach, respectively. As expected, the object-based exceeded the pixel-based approach (OA increased by 4%). The influence of fusion on classification results was analyzed as well. Overall classification accuracy was improved by the spatial resolution of pansharpened images (OA increased by 7% for pixel-based approach). Also, regardless of pixel- or object-based classification approaches, the influence of the use of pansharpening is highly beneficial to classifying complex, natural, and mixed deciduous forest areas.

TI  - Target Characterization and Scattering Power Decomposition for Full and Compact Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In radar polarimetry, incoherent target decomposition techniques help extract scattering information from polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. This is achieved either by fitting appropriate scattering models or by optimizing the received wave intensity through the diagonalization of the coherency (or covariance) matrix. As such, the received wave information depends on the received antenna configuration. Additionally, a polarimetric descriptor that is independent of the received antenna configuration might provide additional information which is missed by the individual elements of the coherency matrix. This implies that existing target characterization techniques might neglect this information. In this regard, we suitably utilize the 2-D and 3-D Barakat degree of polarization which is independent of the received antenna configuration to obtain distinct polarimetric information for target characterization. In this study, we introduce new roll-invariant scattering-type parameters for both full-polarimetric (FP) and compact-polarimetric (CP) SAR data. These new parameters jointly use the information of the 2-D and 3-D Barakat degree of polarization and the elements of the coherency (or covariance) matrix. We use these new scattering-type parameters, which provide equivalent information as the Cloude chi for FP SAR data and the ellipticity parameter chi for CP SAR data, to characterize various targets adequately. Additionally, we appropriately utilize these new scattering-type parameters to obtain unique nonmodel-based three-component scattering power decomposition techniques. We obtain the even-bounce, and the odd-bounce scattering powers by modulating the total polarized power by a proper geometrical factor derived using the new scattering-type parameters for FP and CP SAR data. The diffused scattering power is obtained as the depolarized fraction of the total power. Moreover, due to the nature of its formulation, the decomposition scattering powers are non-negative and roll-invariant while the total power is conserved. The proposed method is both qualitatively and quantitatively assessed utilizing the L-band ALOS-2 and C-band Radarsat-2 FP and the associated simulated CP SAR data.

TI  - Add Germany to the List-Adventive Population of <i>Trissolcus japonicus</i> (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) Emerges in Germany
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryThe brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, is an invasive pest species of global economic importance. It has a very broad host range and causes severe damages in agricultural, horticultural, and fruit crops. Control measures, including available chemical and mechanical options, have often proved insufficient. Surveys of natural enemies in the newly invaded areas have also shown that natural biological control is generally too low to control H. halys populations in the long run. In its native Asian range, egg parasitoids in the genus Trissolcus play an important role in controlling H. halys. Since the mid-2010s, adventive populations of Trissolcus japonicus, a dominant egg parasitoid of H. halys in Asia with a narrow host range, have been reported from several countries with prior establishment of H. halys. Here, we report the first discovery of T. japonicus in Germany. This finding corroborates a northbound expansion of the range of T. japonicus in Europe, along with H. halys.The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, is a polyphagous pest species of worldwide economic importance. Since the mid-1990s, it has invaded and become established in various countries outside its native Asian range. In the newly invaded areas, biological control by native natural enemies has been shown to be insufficient in the long-term control of this severe pest. Adventive populations of Trissolcus japonicus, an important biological control agent of H. halys in Asia, have been reported from North America and some European countries since the mid-2010s. This egg parasitoid species seems to follow in the wake of the establishment of H. halys populations outside their native Asian range. Here, we report the first discovery of an adventive population of T. japonicus in Germany. In 2020, adult T. japonicus were recovered from parasitized H. halys egg masses (naturally laid and sentinel egg masses) and collected in ruderal areas using an insect suction sampler. The arrival of T. japonicus in Germany, unintentional through pathways yet unknown, corroborates a northbound expansion of its range within Europe. Further field surveys will show the extent of its dispersal and establishment capacities within this new distribution area.

TI  - Tracking the risk factors associated with high-risk cSCC: A 10-year, Two-Institution, Greek study
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUON
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: We sought to identify independent risk factors for positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), local recurrence (LR), metastasis (M) and death caused by cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) (DCS) in high-risk cSCC patients. Moreover, we compared the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) system with the previous used in Greece (based on tumor size) and proposed a new classification system.Methods: 1,524 cSCC patients were enrolled between January 2004 and December 2014, from two medical institutions. Potential risk factors for SLNB (local recurrence/LR, metastasis/M, death caused by SCC/DCS) were analyzed by univariate and multivariate Cox logistic regression models.Results: Of the included patients with a median follow-up of 60 months 107 developed local recurrence (7%) while 84 developed metastases (5.5%). Among 36 patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), 25% showed a positive SLNB with a false-negative result (11%). On multivariate analysis, key prognostic factors for LR were tumor diameter >2 cm, poor differentiation, incomplete excision and perineural invasion and for M were high-risk tumor site, tumor diameter >2 cm, poor differentiation, invasion beyond subcutaneous tis- sue, incomplete excision, perineural invasion and recurrence. DCS seems to be affected by tumor diameter > 2 cm, poor differentiation, invasion beyond subcutaneous tissue, incomplete excision, perineural invasion and recurrence independently.Conclusions: These suggest the determined role of tumor diameter of cSCCs. Harnessing knowledge and collecting the up-to-date data along the clinical journey of high-risk cSCC, the future looks bright (development of new clinical trials, adjuvant therapies and tumor staging with SLNB).

TI  - Near-Ultraviolet to Near-Infrared Band Thresholds Cloud Detection Algorithm for TANSAT-CAPI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud and aerosol polarization imaging detector (CAPI) is one of the important payloads on the China Carbon Dioxide Observation Satellite (TANSAT), which can realize multispectral polarization detection and accurate on-orbit calibration. The main function of the instrument is to identify the interference of clouds and aerosols in the atmospheric detection path and to improve the retrieval accuracy of greenhouse gases. Therefore, it is of great significance to accurately identify the clouds in remote sensing images. However, in order to meet the requirement of lightweight design, CAPI is only equipped with channels in the near-ultraviolet to near-infrared bands. It is difficult to achieve effective cloud recognition using traditional visible light to thermal infrared band spectral threshold cloud detection algorithms. In order to solve the above problem, this paper innovatively proposes a cloud detection method based on different threshold tests from near ultraviolet to near infrared (NNDT). This algorithm first introduces the 0.38 mu m band and the ratio of 0.38 mu m band to 1.64 mu m band, to realize the separation of cloud pixels and clear sky pixels, which can take advantage of the obvious difference in radiation characteristics between clouds and ground objects in the near-ultraviolet band and the advantages of the band ratio in identifying clouds on the snow surface. The experimental results show that the cloud recognition hit rate (PODcloud) reaches 0.94 (ocean), 0.98 (vegetation), 0.99 (desert), and 0.86 (polar), which therefore achieve the application standard of CAPI data cloud detection The research shows that the NNDT algorithm replaces the demand for thermal infrared bands for cloud detection, gets rid of the dependence on the minimum surface reflectance database that is embodied in traditional cloud recognition algorithms, and lays the foundation for aerosol and CO2 parameter inversion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the utilization, morbidity, and cost of sentinel lymph node mapping in women undergoing hysterectomy for complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia.METHODS: Women with complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia who underwent hysterectomy from 2012 to 2018 in the Perspective database were examined. Perioperative morbidity, mortality, and cost were examined based on performance of sentinel lymph node mapping, lymph node dissection or no nodal evaluation.RESULTS: Among 10,266 women, sentinel lymph node mapping was performed in 620 (6.0%), lymph node dissection in 538 (5.2%), and no lymphatic evaluation in 9,108 (88.7%). Use of sentinel lymph node mapping increased from 0.8% in 2012 to 14.0% in 2018, and the rate of lymph node dissection rose from 5.7% to 6.4% (P<.001). In an adjusted model, residence in the western United States, treatment by high-volume hospitals and use of robotic-assisted hysterectomy were associated with sentinel lymph node mapping (P<.05 for all). The complication rates were similar between the three groups. The median cost for sentinel lymph node mapping ($9,673) and lymph node dissection ($9,754) were higher than in those who did not undergo nodal assessment ($8,435) (P<.001).CONCLUSION: Performance of sentinel lymph node mapping is increasing rapidly for women with complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia but is not associated with increased perioperative morbidity or mortality.

TI  - Potential of Sentinel-2 Satellite Images for Monitoring Green Waste Compost and Manure Amendments in Temperate Cropland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing attention has been placed on the agroecological impact of applying exogenous organic matter (EOM) amendments, such as green waste compost (GWC) and livestock manure, to agricultural landscapes. However, monitoring the frequency and locality of this practice poses a major challenge, as these events are typically unreported. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of Sentinel-2 imagery for the detection of EOM amendments. Specifically, we investigated the spectral shift resulting from GWC and manure application at two spatial scales, satellite and proximal. At the satellite scale, multispectral Sentinel-2 image pairs were analyzed before and after EOM application to six cultivated fields in the Versailles Plain, France. At the proximal scale, multi-temporal spectral field measurements were taken of experimental plots consisting of 14 total treatments: EOM variety, amendment quantity (15, 30 and 60 t.ha(-1)) and tillage. The Sentinel-2 images showed significant spectral differences before and after EOM application. Exogenous Organic Matter Indices (EOMI) were developed and analyzed for separative performance. The best performing index was EOMI2, using the B4 and B12 Sentinel-2 spectral bands. At the proximal scale, simulated Sentinel-2 reflectance spectra, which were created using field measurements, successfully monitored all EOM treatments for three days, except for the buried green waste compost at a rate of 15 t.ha(-1).

TI  - Characterization of vegetation structural changes using multi-temporal LiDAR and its relationship with severity in Calcena wildfire
T2  - ECOSISTEMAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of canopy changes and gap presence after fire provides relevant information to better understand the ecological effect of fire in Mediterranean forests. The study characterizes those changes in Pinus and Quercus forested areas, and their relationship with fire severity in Calcena wildfire. The wildfire burned 4,573 ha in 2012 partially affecting the protected "Parque Natural de la Dehesa del Moncayo" located in Aragon region (Spain). Multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data from two coverages (2011 and 2016) captured within the National Plan from Aerial Ortophotography (PNOA) were used. Landsat 7 images were used to estimate fire severity using the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR). Structural changes were characterized using pre-fire and post-fire LiDAR metrics. Gap frequency distribution, size and number of gaps were also analysed. The relationship between severity and the structural changes was analysed through the correlation coefficient. Most of the surface was burned with low (43.32%) or moderate low severity (30.38%) levels reducing forest height, canopy density, and structural diversity. In general, gap size increased after fire. The number of small gaps decreased while medium size gaps (0.2 ha) increased. LiDAR metrics related to the height, variability of height in vertical profile, and density of the forest canopy showed the strongest correlations with fire severity, showing the strongest changes. Results show the interest to use LiDAR data for characterizing structural changes and supporting forest management.

TI  - An Optical and SAR Based Fusion Approach for Mapping Surface Water Dynamics over Mainland China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) data is a critical information source for mapping and monitoring water resources over large inaccessible regions where hydrological in-situ networks are sparse. In this paper, we present a simple yet robust method for fusing optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for mapping surface water dynamics over mainland China. This method uses a multivariate logistic regression model to estimate monthly surface water extent over a four-year period (2017 to 2020) from the combined usages of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery. Multi-seasonal high-resolution images from the Chinese Gaofen satellites are used as a reference for an independent validation showing a high degree of agreement (overall accuracy 94%) across a diversity of climatic and physiographic regions demonstrating potential scalability beyond China. Through inter-comparison with similar global scale products, this paper further shows how this new mapping technique provides improved spatio-temporal characterization of inland water bodies, and for better capturing smaller water bodies (< 0.81 ha in size). The relevance of the results is discussed, and we find this new enhanced monitoring approach has the potential to advance the use of Earth observation for water resource management, planning and reporting.

TI  - Variability of Deep Water in Jordan Basin of the Gulf of Maine: Influence of Gulf Stream Warm Core Rings and the Nova Scotia Current
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the nutrient-rich subsurface slope water intruding into the deep basin of the Gulf of Maine (GoM) supports the high biological productivity in the semi-enclosed gulf, it is important to understand the process and time scale of such slope water intrusion. This study focuses on variations of the GoM deep water on seasonal to interannual time scales and the influences of open ocean processes on the temporal variation of the deep water properties. Based on long-term monitoring data, it is found that the deep water at Jordan Basin (one of three major basins in the GoM) is persistently warmer in winter than in summer, which is distinctly different from the seasonality of surface water in the basin and the deep water on neighboring shelf seas. The unique seasonality in the deep GoM reflects a time-lagged response to shoreward intrusion of the subsurface slope water off the GoM. Both observation-based lag-correlation analyses and numerical simulations confirm a timescale of approximately 3 months for the intruding subsurface slope water to flow from Northeast Channel to Jordan Basin. Properties of the intruding slope water at the Northeast Channel were significantly correlated with the Gulf Stream position and dramatically impacted by episodic warm-core rings shed from Gulf Stream. Inside the deep GoM, the intruding slope water was also indirectly affected by the fresher water input from Nova Scotia Current. Spreading of the fresher water inside the gulf strengthens near-surface stratification, suppresses deep convection, and preserves heat and salt in the deep GoM during the wintertime.Plain Language Summary Nutrient-rich slope water intruding into the deep basin of the Gulf of Maine provides 30% of the nutrients needed to support the high biological productivity and high yield fisheries in the gulf. Our analysis of long-term mooring data shows that the deep water in the Gulf of Maine changes in a unique fashion: being warmer in winter and colder in summer. This unique seasonality differs dramatically from the deep water on the neighboring continental shelves. It represents a delayed response of the deep water in the gulf to seasonal changes of the major currents in the adjacent open ocean. We explained the timescale of this delayed response from multiple angles using mooring data, numerical simulations, and remote sensing data. We found that signal of open ocean change at shelf edge (e.g., induced by Gulf Stream meandering and associated eddies) propagates into the deep gulf basin in about 3 months. Meanwhile, the surface buoyant and low-salinity inflow from the upstream Scotian Shelf into the Gulf of Maine tends to suppress vertical mixing in the gulf and helps maintain the heat and salt stored in the deep gulf even in the wintertime when the surface ocean loses heat to the cold atmosphere.

TI  - C-Band SAR Winds for Tropical Cyclone Monitoring and Forecast in the South-West Indian Ocean
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclone (TC) monitoring and forecast in the South West Indian Ocean (SWIO) basin remain challenging, notably because of the lack of direct observations. During the 2018-2019 cyclone season, S-1 Sentinel SAR images were acquired, as part of the ReNovRisk-Cyclone research program, giving access to unprecedented detailed TC wind structure description without wind speed limitation. This paper assesses the quality of these data and the impact of their assimilation for TC forecasts. SAR observations are compared with analyses from a convection-permitting, limited area model AROME OI 3D-Var and with wind products used for operational TC monitoring. Their bias depends on the angle of incidence of the radar and the observation error is larger for extreme wind speed. The impact of SAR assimilation in AROME OI 3D-Var is assessed through two case studies. In the TC GELENA case, it leads to a better TC positioning and an improved representation of inner and outer vortex structures. The TC intensity reduction in the analysis propagates through subsequent analyses and it has an impact on forecasts for around 12 h. In the TC IDAI case, the 3D-Var does not manage to reproduce TC intensity captured by SAR. In both cases, the modification of the initial conditions has little influence on the intensification rate of the model forecasts. Sensitivity tests show that these results are robust to different observation errors and thinning.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Exposed Soil Composite for Soil Organic Carbon Prediction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pilot studies have demonstrated the potential of remote sensing for soil organic carbon (SOC) mapping in exposed croplands. However, the use of remote sensing for SOC prediction is often hindered by disturbing factors at the soil surface, such as photosynthetic active and non-photosynthetic active vegetation, variation in soil moisture or surface roughness. With the increasing amount of freely available satellite data, recent studies have focused on stabilizing the soil reflectance by building image composites. These composites tend to minimize the disturbing effects by applying sets of criteria. Here, we aim to develop a robust method that allows selecting Sentinel-2 (S-2) pixels with minimal influence of the following disturbing factors: crop residues, surface roughness and soil moisture. We selected all S-2 cloud-free images covering the Belgian Loam Belt from January 2019 to December 2020 (in total 36 images). We then built nine exposed soil composites based on four sets of criteria: (1) lowest Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR2), (2) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) < 0.25, (3-5) NDVI < 0.25 and NBR2 < threshold, (6) the 'greening-up' period of a crop and (7-9) the 'greening-up' period of a crop and NBR2 < threshold. The 'greening-up' period was selected based on the NDVI timeline, where 'greening-up' is considered as the last date of acquisition where the soil is exposed (NDVI < 0.25) before the crop develops (NDVI > 0.25). We then built a partial least square regression (PLSR) model with 10-fold cross-validation to estimate the SOC content based on 137 georeferenced calibration samples on the nine composites. We obtained non-satisfactory results (R-2 < 0.30, RMSE > 2.50 g C kg(-1), and RPD < 1.4, n > 68) for all composites except for the composite in the 'greening-up' stage with a NBR2 < 0.07 (R-2 = 0.54 +/- 0.12, RPD = 1.68 +/- 0.45 and RMSE = 2.09 +/- 0.39 g C kg(-1), n = 49). Hence, the 'greening-up' method combined with a strict NBR2 threshold allows selecting the purest exposed soil pixels suitable for SOC prediction. The limit of this method might be its coverage of the total cropland area, which in a two-year period reached 62%, compared to 95% coverage if only the NDVI threshold is applied.

TI  - Providers' Ability to Identify Sentinel Injuries Concerning for Physical Abuse in Infants
T2  - PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesThe objectives of this study were to assess the ability of pediatric health care providers and social workers to recognize sentinel injuries in infants under 6 months of age and to determine what factors influence their decision to evaluate for physical abuse. MethodsA statewide collaborative focused on sentinel injuries administered a survey to pediatric health care providers and social workers in the emergency department, urgent care, and primary care. The survey contained 8 case scenarios of infants under 6 months of age with an injury, and respondents were asked if they would consider the injury to be a sentinel injury requiring a physical abuse evaluation. Respondents were then presented with several factors and asked how much each influences the decision to perform a physical abuse evaluation. ResultsA total of 565 providers completed the survey. Providers had moderate interrater reliability on their classification of the cases as sentinel injuries or not (kappa = 0.57). Nearly all respondents (97%) recognized genital bruising as a sentinel injury, whereas 77% of respondents recognized intraoral injuries. Agreement was highest among social workers (kappa = 0.76) and physicians with categorical pediatrics training and pediatric emergency medicine fellowship (kappa = 0.63) and lowest among nurse practitioners (kappa = 0.48) and residents (kappa = 0.51). Concern over missing the diagnosis of abuse had the greatest influence on the decision to perform a physical abuse evaluation. ConclusionsSentinel injuries are not uniformly recognized as potential signs of child abuse requiring further evaluation by pediatric health care providers. Additional evidence and education are needed regarding sentinel injuries.

TI  - How Nitrogen and Phosphorus Availability Change Water Use Efficiency in a Mediterranean Savanna Ecosystem
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nutrient availability, especially of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), is of major importance for every organism and at a larger scale for ecosystem functioning and productivity. Changes in nutrient availability and potential stoichiometric imbalance due to anthropogenic nitrogen deposition might lead to nutrient deficiency or alter ecosystem functioning in various ways. In this study, we present 6 years (2014-2020) of flux-, plant-, and remote sensing data from a large-scale nutrient manipulation experiment conducted in a Mediterranean savanna-type ecosystem with an emphasis on the effects of N and P treatments on ecosystem-scale water-use efficiency (WUE) and related mechanisms. Two plots were fertilized with N (NT, 16.9 Ha) and N + P (NPT, 21.5 Ha), and a third unfertilized plot served as a control (CT). Fertilization had a strong impact on leaf nutrient stoichiometry only within the herbaceous layer with increased leaf N in both fertilized treatments and increased leaf P in NPT. Following fertilization, WUE in NT and NPT increased during the peak of growing season. While gross primary productivity similarly increased in NT and NPT, transpiration and surface conductance increased more in NT than in NPT. The results show that the NPT plot with higher nutrient availability, but more balanced N:P leaf stoichiometry had the highest WUE. On average, higher N availability resulted in a 40% increased leaf area index (LAI) in both fertilized treatments in the spring. Increased LAI reduced aerodynamic conductance and thus evaporation at both fertilized plots in the spring. Despite reduced evaporation, annual evapotranspiration increased by 10% (48.6 +/- 28.3 kg H2O m(-2)), in the NT plot, while NPT remained similar to CT (-1%, -6.7 +/- 12.2 kgH(2)O m(-2)). Potential causes for increased transpiration at NT could be increased root biomass and thus higher water uptake or rhizosphere priming to increase P-mobilization through microbes. The annual net ecosystem exchange shifted from a carbon source in CT (75.0 +/- 20.6 gC m(-2)) to carbon-neutral in both fertilized treatments [-7.0 +/- 18.5 gC m(-2) (NT) 0.4 +/- 22.6 gC m(-2) (NPT)]. Our results show, that the N:P stoichiometric imbalance, resulting from N addition (without P), increases the WUE less than the addition of N + P, due to the strong increase in transpiration at NT, which indicates the importance of a balanced N and P content for WUE.

TI  - Real-Time Detection of Daytime and Night-Time Fire Hotspots from Geostationary Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces an enhanced version of the Biogeographical Region and Individual Geostationary HHMMSS Threshold (BRIGHT) algorithm. The algorithm runs in real-time and operates over 24 h to include both daytime and night-time detections. The algorithm was executed and tested on 12 months of Himawari-8 data from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020, for every valid 10-min observation. The resulting hotspots were compared to those from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The modified BRIGHT hotspots matched with fire detections in VIIRS 96% and MODIS 95% of the time. The number of VIIRS and MODIS hotspots with matches in the coincident modified BRIGHT dataset was lower (at 33% and 46%, respectively). This paper demonstrates a clear link between the number of VIIRS and MODIS hotspots with matches and the minimum fire radiative power considered.

TI  - SPIRITUAL DIRECTION IN AN AFRICAN CONTEXT: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
T2  - PERSPECTIVA TEOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - An upset spiritual director just ended a retreat with a group of African priests because they could not observe strict silence. Similar situations elsewhere on the continent led a young African student to raise the question of the suitability of sixteenth-century Spiritual Exercises to modern Africans. This essay acknowledges the challenges facing spiritual directors to "accurately" apply the method of the Spiritual Exercises in a diverse and ever-evolving, noisy and busy world. From the concrete experience of this group of priests, it argues for the suitability of the Exercises to the African context based on the adaptability and flexibility inherent in Ignatius' Spiritual Exercise and subsequent directories. The particular crisis between this director and his retreatants, however, also presents a unique opportunity for retreat directors to find creative ways to accommodate retreatants with specific needs, and to communicate the message of the Exercises in a way that is both accessible to and respectful of the African worldview.

TI  - The influence of local worldview presuppositions on learners' conceptions of Selected Mechanics topics
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The study is situated within a worldview theory as espoused by socio-cultural constructivists. Science classrooms in secondary schools in Swaziland are culturally largely homogeneous where learners and their teachers have a strong grounding in traditional Swazi culture. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the conceptions held by Grade 11 learners of selected mechanics topics were influenced by the worldview presuppositions prevalent in their socio-cultural environment. The learners were exposed to a socio-culturally-based teaching/learning strategy that integrated selected indigenous knowledge presuppositions into school science. The learners were given a pre-and post-physics achievement test (PAT). At the end of the intervention, a focus group interview was conducted with some of the learners. Data on selected PAT questions were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. The learners' responses to the focus group interview and the PAT's open-ended questions were analysed at a later stage using the Ogunniyi's Contiguity Argumentation Theory (CAT). The findings of the study show that the learners' post-conceptions on selected mechanics topics were influenced by their local worldview presuppositions and could be analysed according to the CAT worldview categories.

TI  - Prognostic Role of Plasma PD-1, PD-L1, pan-BTN3As and BTN3A1 in Patients Affected by Metastatic Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors: Can Immune Checkpoints Act as a Sentinel for Short-Term Survival?
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryRecently, it was shown that circulating PD-1 and PD-L1 are correlated with shorter survival in individuals with various types of solid tumors, including lung cancer and gastrointestinal solid tumors. Nevertheless, the correlation between shorter survival and elevated levels of sPD-1 and sPD-L1 has not yet been studied in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients. Our study aimed to understand if soluble forms of immune checkpoints, such as sPD-1, sPD-L1, sBTN3A1, and pan-sBTN3As, may be predictors of survival for metastatic GIST (mGIST) patients, in order to obtain useful information about the clinical evolution of disease. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the optimal concentration thresholds for each biomarker were identified to discriminate mGIST patients with short (<= 36 months) versus long (>36 months) progression-free survival (PFS). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with plasma concentrations under thresholds exhibited a median PFS about 20 months longer compared to subjects with levels above cut-offs. Additionally, the impact of different baseline covariates was evaluated through a multivariate analysis, showing that plasma levels of sPD-L1 and pan-sBTN3As below respective concentration thresholds and the absence of KIT exon 11 deletions or delins at codons 557 and/or 558 were important prognostic biomarkers for a longer PFS in mGIST patients.Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) represent 1% of all primary gastrointestinal tumors. Immune surveillance is often overcome by cancer cells due to the activation of immunoregulatory molecules such as programmed death protein (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1, and butyrophilin sub-family 3A/CD277 receptors (BTN3A). Because several studies demonstrated that tumor PD-1 and PD-L1 expression may have a prominent prognostic function, this investigation aimed to discover if soluble forms of these molecules may be useful in predicting survival of metastatic GIST (mGIST) patients. Through specific ad hoc developed ELISA assays not yet available on the market, the circulating PD-1, PD-L1, BTN3A1, and pan-BTN3As levels were examined in 30 c-KIT exon 11-mutated mGIST patients, prior to imatinib therapy. Using specific thresholds derived by ROC analysis, we found that high baseline levels of sPD-1 (>8.1 ng/mL), sPD-L1 (>0.7 ng/mL), sBTN3A1 (>7.0 ng/mL), and pan-BTN3As (>5.0 ng/mL) were correlated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and poor prognosis. Contrariwise, subjects with lower plasma concentrations exhibited a median PFS about 20 months longer than to the earlier. Finally, an additional multivariate analysis revealed that circulating levels of sPD-L1 <= 0.7 ng/mL and pan-sBTN3As <= 5.0 ng/mL, and the absence of KIT exon 11 deletions or delins at codons 557 and/or 558 were associated with a longer PFS in mGIST patients. Our investigation, for the first time, revealed that evaluating the plasma concentration of some immune checkpoints may help prognosticate survival in mGIST patients, suggesting their potential use as prognostic biomarkers beyond the presence of KIT exon 11 Del or Delins at codons 557/558.

TI  - Simulated Pathways of the Northwestern Pacific Water in the Okhotsk Sea
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water exchange between the Pacific Ocean and the Okhotsk Sea through the Kuril Straits and transport of Pacific waters into and from the Okhotsk Sea are studied. These studies are based on retrospective simulation for the period from 1991 to 2000 by eddy-permitting OGCM RIAMOM and Lagrangian analysis. The volume transport occurs mainly through the seven straits, Bussol, Kruzenshtern, Friz, Ekaterina, Fourth, Nadezhda and Urup straits (in decreasing order of significance). These straits were shown to be responsible for about 95% of total water exchange. We found that the contribution of the Bussol and Kruzenshtern straits in the ocean-sea exchange was considerably overestimated previously. In the active upper 200 m layer, the contribution of the Fourth, Friz and Ekaterina straits is comparable with that of the Kruzenshtern and Bussol straits. Estimations of the depth-integrated transport and transport in the representative model layers in different seasons show that the Northwestern Pacific Water enters the Okhotsk Sea mainly through the northern Kuril Straits, namely, the Kruzenshtern and Fourth straits. The Okhotsk Sea Mode Water flows from the Sea in the upper 200 m layer mainly through the Friz, Ekaterina, Bussol and Urup straits (in decreasing order of significance). Lagrangian simulation reveals the main transport pathways of ocean water into and from the Okhotsk Sea. In the surface and near surface layers, this water is transported to the northwestern shelf of the Sea by the West Kamchatka Current (especially in winter and spring) and by the over slope branch of the North Okhotsk Current. Then it is transferred by the coastal branch of the North Okhotsk Current and flows into the East Sakhalin Current. At depth below 200 m, the ocean water does not reach the northern shelf anyway. At depths of 500 m and deeper, the water exchange between the ocean and the Okhotsk Sea is insignificant because of weak currents at such depths. The simulation results are found to be in a reasonable agreement with instrumental measurements and satellite data.

TI  - Global Soil Water Estimates as Landslide Predictor: The Effectiveness of SMOS, SMAP, and GRACE Observations, Land Surface Simulations, and Data Assimilation
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This global feasibility study assesses the potential of coarse-scale, gridded soil water estimates for the probabilistic modeling of hydrologically triggered landslides, using Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) remote sensing data; Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) simulations; and six data products based on the assimilation of SMOS, SMAP, and/or GRACE observations into CLSM. SMOS or SMAP observations (similar to 40-km resolution) are only available for less than 20% of the globally reported landslide events, because they are intermittent and uncertain in regions with complex terrain. GRACE terrestrial water storage estimates include 75% of the reported landslides but have coarse spatial and temporal resolutions (monthly, similar to 300 km). CLSM soil water simulations have the added advantage of complete spatial and temporal coverage, and are found to be able to distinguish between "stable slope" (no landslide) conditions and landslide-inducing conditions in a probabilistic way. Assimilating SMOS and/or GRACE data increases the landslide probability estimates based on soil water percentiles for the reported landslides, relative to model-only estimates at 36-km resolution for the period 2011-16, unless the CLSM model-only soil water content is already high (>= 50th percentile). The SMAP Level 4 data assimilation product (at 9-km resolution, period 2015-19) more generally updates the soil water conditions toward higher landslide probabilities for the reported landslides, but is similar to model-only estimates for the majority of landslides where SMAP data cannot easily be converted to soil moisture owing to complex terrain.

TI  - Estimation of Long-Term Surface Downward Longwave Radiation over the Global Land from 2000 to 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great importance for climate change studies to construct a worldwide, long-term surface downward longwave radiation (L-d, 4-100 mu m) dataset. Although a number of global L-d datasets are available, their low accuracies and coarse spatial resolutions limit their applications. This study generated a daily L-d dataset with a 5-km spatial resolution over the global land surface from 2000 to 2018 using atmospheric parameters, which include 2-m air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH) at 1000 hPa, total column water vapor (TCWV), surface downward shortwave radiation (S-d), and elevation, based on the gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) method. The generated L-d dataset was evaluated using ground measurements collected from AmeriFlux, AsiaFlux, baseline surface radiation network (BSRN), surface radiation budget network (SURFRAD), and FLUXNET networks. The validation results showed that the root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), and correlation coefficient (R) values of the generated daily L-d dataset were 17.78 W m(-2), 0.99 W m(-2), and 0.96 (p < 0.01). Comparisons with other global land surface radiation products indicated that the generated L-d dataset performed better than the clouds and earth's radiant energy system synoptic (CERES-SYN) edition 4.1 dataset and ERA5 reanalysis product at the selected sites. In addition, the analysis of the spatiotemporal characteristics for the generated L-d dataset showed an increasing trend of 1.8 W m(-2) per decade (p < 0.01) from 2003 to 2018, which was closely related to Ta and water vapor pressure. In general, the generated L-d dataset has a higher spatial resolution and accuracy, which can contribute to perfect the existing radiation products.

TI  - Transformations to Iberian medieval justice in the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries
T2  - PASSAGENS-INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL HISTORY AND LEGAL CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of justice came to be transformed in the medieval era in the Latin West, particularly between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, due to ongoing shifts in the political and institutional fields. Monarchies became institutionalized due to the influence of debates proposed by the University of Bologna generating the construction of a legal culture systematizing the concepts and criteria for the exercise of justice without abandoning the relationship between these theories and the social context to which it was destined. Municipal representatives came to play an increasingly important role in events such as the rise of the Joanine Dynasty in Portugal (1383-5) and their aspirations and worldview would be sought out as one of the currencies of exchange for the granting of support, reflected in the legislation and in the legal collections developed by descendants of John I of Avis, such as the Alfonsine Ordinations. This constituted a space in which private rights overlapped with the Common Law emanating from the royal court and which crystallized a tendency towards Portuguese legal singularity promoting the hierarchization of the sources of law available in Latin. This work is developed from historical criticism applied to documentary content, Las Siete Partidas del muy noble Rey Don Alfonso el Sabio, Livro das Leis e Posturas, and the Ordenagoes Afonsinas.

TI  - Possible Non-Mare Lithologies in the Regolith at the Chang'E-5 Landing Site: Evidence From Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chang'E-5 (CE-5) mission returned a total of 1,731 g of lunar regolith from the northern Oceanus Procellarum (NOP). Despite that the CE-5 landing site is covered by Eratosthenian-aged mare basalts, non-mare lithologies might also have been collected owing to the lateral mixing introduced by nearby craters. Here we employed FeO and thorium abundance data obtained by the Lunar Prospector Gamma Ray Spectrometer to investigate the chemical composition of the NOP region. Four major compositional groups (feldspathic highland materials, Imbrium basin ejecta, Aristarchus ejecta, and mare basalts) and several subgroups have been identified. Their corresponding geographical locations were constrained using an interactive scatter-plot tool in ENVI (R) software. We also determined the first-order mixing trends occurring within the NOP region as well as the CE-5 landing site. Aristarchus crater may have contributed highly evolved materials to the CE-5 site. Rock fragments derived from Aristarchus ejecta are important for the interpretation of magmatic differentiation and non-mare volcanism on the Moon. We proposed that thorium enrichments of CE-5 landing site are due to the geochemical nature of local mare basalts rather than impact mixing. Highland ejecta, along with mare basalts, would expand Apollo and Luna sample collection diversity.Plain Language Summary The Chang'E-5 (CE-5) probe, the third phase of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program launched in November 24, 2020. This mission collected 1,731 g of lunar regolith samples. The landing site of this mission is located within the northern Oceanus Procellarum (NOP) region. This region is dominated by basaltic lava flows and mare basalts should be the main components of the returned regolith samples. However, lunar impacts could transport materials laterally to large distances and modify the local compositions. In the present study, we employed FeO and thorium abundance data obtained by the Lunar Prospector Gamma Ray Spectrometer to investigate the chemical composition of the NOP. It was found that the mare plains in the CE-5 landing site are contaminated with highland ejecta from nearby craters. Highland ejecta would expand Apollo and Luna sample collection diversity.

AB  - In this study, Sentinel 2A and Landsat series remote sensing images were used to determine the weights of vegetation coverage, humidity, dryness and heat by using the principal component analysis method. The remote sensing ecological index evaluation model was used to evaluate the ecology of the Fuxian Lake area from 2013 to 2018. Environmental quality in the study area is monitored and analyzed. By developing a unified organization and management module of spatio-temporal data in the collaborative production of multi-source heterogeneous data, the mapping relationship between data and parameters is established. The 3D-web data integration decision platform is constructed. Based on the Cesium engine real-time rendering and interactive visualization network 3D platform, real-time calculation and visualization of the ecological evaluation of the Fuxian Lake area between 2013 and 2018 is realized. The ecological environment of the study area continued to deteriorate from 2013 to 2015, improved slightly in 2016, and improved significantly in 2017-2018. The platform has the functions of searching, selecting the base map, measuring on the map, and positioning the coordinates, which can achieve the real-time ecological analysis function and show the change process of the ecological environment and natural resources.

TI  - Serological biomarker for assessing human exposure to <i>Aedes</i> mosquito bites during a randomized vector control intervention trial in northeastern Thailand
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAedes mosquitoes are vectors for several major arboviruses of public health concern including dengue viruses. The relationships between Aedes infestation and disease transmission are complex wherein the epidemiological dynamics can be difficult to discern because of a lack of robust and sensitive indicators for predicting transmission risk. This study investigates the use of anti-Aedes saliva antibodies as a serological biomarker for Aedes mosquito bites to assess small scale variations in adult Aedes density and dengue virus (DENV) transmission risk in northeastern Thailand. Individual characteristics, behaviors/occupation and socio-demographics, climatic and epidemiological risk factors associated with human-mosquito exposure are also addressed.Methods The study was conducted within a randomized clustered control trial in Roi Et and Khon Kaen provinces over a consecutive 19 months period. Thirty-six (36) clusters were selected, each of ten houses. Serological and entomological surveys were conducted in all houses every four months and monthly in three sentinel households per cluster between September 2017 and April 2019 for blood spot collections and recording concurrent immature and adult Aedes indices. Additionally, the human exposure to Aedes mosquito bites (i.e., Mosquito Exposure Index or MEI) was estimated by ELISA measuring levels of human antibody response to the specific Nterm-34 kDa salivary antigen. The relationships between the MEI, vector infestation indices (adult and immature stages) and vector DENV infection were evaluated using a two-level (house and individual levels) mixed model analysis with one-month lag autoregressive correlation.Results There was a strong positive relationship between the MEI and adult Aedes (indoor and outdoor) density. Individuals from households with a medium mosquito density (mean difference: 0.091, p<0.001) and households with a high mosquito density (mean difference: 0.131, p<0.001) had higher MEI's compared to individuals from households without Aedes. On a similar trend, individuals from households with a low, medium or high indoor Aedes densities (mean difference: 0.021, p<0.007, 0.053, p<0.0001 and 0.037, p<0.0001 for low, medium and high levels of infestation, respectively) had higher MEI than individuals from houses without indoor Aedes., The MEI was driven by individual characteristics, such as gender, age and occupation/behaviors, and varied according to climatic, seasonal factors and vector control intervention (p<0.05). Nevertheless, the study did not demonstrate a clear correlation between MEI and the presence of DENV-infected Aedes.Conclusion This study represents an important step toward the validation of the specific IgG response to the Aedes salivary peptide Nterm-34kDa as a proxy measure for Aedes infestation levels and human-mosquito exposure risk in a dengue endemic setting. The use of the IgG response to the Nterm-34 kDa peptide as a viable diagnostic tool for estimating dengue transmission requires further investigations and validation in other geographical and transmission settings.Author summaryAedes mosquitoes and the viruses they transmit are major public health concerns for over half of the global human population. However, the quantitative relationships between virus transmission and vector mosquito infestation remain unclear despite numerous indicators used to estimate transmission risk and predict dengue outbreaks. The aim of this study is to investigate the use of a salivary biomarker to assess the small-scale variation in human exposure to Aedes bites and the risk of dengue infection in the context of a vector control intervention in northeastern Thailand. A cohort of 539 persons visited every four months, including 161 individuals visited monthly, were recruited for routine serological and concurrent household entomological surveys during 19 consecutive months follow-up. Antibody response to Aedes bites was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to assess the mosquito exposure index (MEI) and association with the Aedes adult and immature abundance as well as the presence of dengue virus (DENV) in adult mosquitoes (transmission risk). Additionally, the individual (cohort), climatic, and vector control intervention risk factors associated with MEI are explored. This study demonstrates that the MEI was strongly related to household adult Aedes density, particularly indoors resting mosquitoes. Additionally, the MEI was influenced by individual characteristics (i.e., person age, gender, staying indoors), and varied according to seasons and intervention. Nonetheless, no clear relationship between MEI and dengue transmission risk (i.e., vector infection) was detected. This study demonstrated the potential usefulness of the MEI to assess heterogeneity in adult Aedes infestation indices that could assist public health authorities to rapidly identify mosquito "hot spots" and the timeliness of effective vector control interventions.

TI  - An Improved Quadtree Sampling Method for InSAR Seismic Deformation Inversion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), the seismic deformation observation density increases sharply. Data down-sampling can effectively reduce the observation density and the computational cost for subsequent researches. Considering the saliency of the deformation field, we introduce a saliency-based quadtree algorithm for down-sampling (SQS). Three simulation experiments show that SQS can effectively distinguish the near-field and far-field deformation, as well as reduce the amount of observation, while keeping the detailed information of the main deformation near the fault. SQS can avoid the interference of far-field local deformation better than the traditional quadtree sampling algorithm (QS), thus obtaining better inversion results. We took the Dingri earthquake on 20 March 2020 as a case study to verify the advantages of SQS in dealing with real earthquake deformation. We obtained the co-seismic deformation from the ascending and descending Sentinel-1 for the Dingri earthquake, using QS and SQS for sampling and inversion separately. The results show the advantages of SQS in data volume reduction, observation distribution, anti-interference of local deformation, and inversion accuracy. Our preferred solution based on SQS shows that the Dingri earthquake was caused by a normal fault slip. The main slip area is 2-5.5 km deep with a maximum slip of 0.68 m. The estimated geodetic moment is 3.14 x 10(17) Nm, corresponding to a magnitude of Mw5.63.

TI  - Filtering Algorithm for Nonlightning Events Using the FY-4 Lightning Mapping Imager
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - By analyzing the on-board lightning data of the FY-4 lightning mapping imager (LMI), there are three types of nonlightning events: ghost noise, high-energy-particle-trajectory noise, and shot noise. To improve the performance of lightning detection, based on an in-depth analysis of the characteristics of false events, the ghostimage-filtering method based on spatial energy correlation, the high-energy-particle-trajectory noise-filtering method based on Hough linear detection, and the shot-noise-filtering method based on spatiotemporal correlation clustering are proposed, and the lightning false-alarm-filtering-processing system method is performed. To test the performance of the false-alarm-filtering algorithm, the lightning-filter algorithm is applied to process two thunderstorms in Yunnan and Hainan provinces. We compare the lightning data obtained by the LMI with those obtained by ground-based network. The results show that the distribution characteristics of lightning events processed by the proposed algorithm are consistent with the ground-based detection results, which verifies the continuous tracking performance of the FY-4 lightning mapping imager for the lightning change process.

Based on European Space Agency Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide swath (IW) mode imagery, this paper evaluates the correlation between vertical transmitting-horizontal receiving (VH) polarization signals and extreme ocean surface wind speeds (>40 m/s) under strong TC conditions. A geophysical model function (GMF) Sentinel-1 IW mode wind retrieval model after noise removal (S1IW.NR) was proposed, according to the SAR images of nine TCs and collocated stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) and soil moisture active passive (SMAP) radiometer wind speed measurements. Through curve fitting and regression correction, the new GMF exploits the relationships between VH-polarization normalized radar cross section, incident angle, and wind speed in each sub-swath and covers wind speeds up to 74 m/s. Based on collocated SAR and SFMR measurements of four TCs, the new GMF was validated in the wind speed range from 2 to 53 m/s. Results show that the correlation coefficient, bias, and root mean squared error were 0.89, -0.89 m/s, and 4.13 m/s, respectively, indicating that extreme winds can be retrieved accurately by the new model. In addition, we investigated the relationship between the S1IW.NR wind retrieval bias and the SFMR-measured rain rate. The S1IW.NR model tended to overestimate wind speeds under high rain rates.

TI  - Mapping Floods in Lowland Forest Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data and an Object-Based Approach
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of floods on forests is immediate, so it is necessary to quickly define the boundaries of flooded areas. Determining the extent of flooding in situ has shortcomings due to the possible limited spatial and temporal resolutions of data and the cost of data collection. Therefore, this research focused on flood mapping using geospatial data and remote sensing. The research area is located in the central part of the Republic of Croatia, an environmentally diverse area of lowland forests of the Sava River and its tributaries. Flood mapping was performed by merging Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) mission data and applying object-based image analysis (OBIA). For this purpose, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data (GRD processing level) were primarily used during the flood period due to the possibility of all-day imaging in all weather conditions and flood detection under the density of canopy. The pre-flood S2 imagery, a summer acquisition, was used as a source of additional spectral data. Geographical information system (GIS) layers-a multisource forest inventory, habitat map, and flood hazard map-were used as additional sources of information in assessing the accuracy of and interpreting the obtained results. The spectral signature, geometric and textural features, and vegetation indices were applied in the OBIA process. The result of the work was a developed methodological framework with a high accuracy and speed of production. The overall accuracy of the classification is 94.94%. Based on the conducted research, the usefulness of the C band of the S1 in flood mapping in lowland forests in the leaf-off season was determined. The paper presents previous research and describes the SAR parameters and characteristics of floodplain forest with a significant impact on the accuracy of classification.

TI  - A cautionary note for rock avalanche field investigation: recent sequential and overlapping landslides in British Columbia
T2  - CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Large rock avalanches on glaciers are an annual occurrence in the mountains of western North America. Following an event, landslide investigators may strive to quickly arrive on site to assess the deposit. Satellite remote sensing imagery demonstrates that caution is warranted for on-site field assessments. We combine Landsat, Sentinel-1 (radar), Sentinel-2, and Planet imagery to reconstruct the events of four recent overlapping rock avalanche deposits in British Columbia. In our examples, substantial rock avalanches are closely followed (days-months) and buried by much larger landslides. We suggest that landslide investigators exercise caution when assessing fresh rock avalanche deposits in the field.

TI  - Identify Informative Bands for Hyperspectral Target Detection Using the Third-Order Statistic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Constrained energy minimization (CEM) has been proposed and widely researched in the field of hyperspectral target detection. Generally, it selects one of the target spectra as the representative and then keeps its output constant while minimizing the average filter output energy of the data. However, it has been proven that as the number of bands (L) increases, CEM will gradually lower the average filter output energy when keeping the representative's output constant. Unavoidably, due to the inherent spatial and temporal variation of the spectra, this will lead to an unreasonable phenomenon, i.e., if L is particularly large, when adding more bands, CEM will suppress more and more pixels, even including the target pixels. This means that the optimal solution of CEM may not correspond to the target detection result that we desire. To deal with this, in this paper, we introduce the third-order statistic (skewness) of the CEM model, served as an auxiliary index to determine whether a band is beneficial to target detection or not. Theoretically, we prove that the skewness index can always exclude the noisy bands with Gaussian distribution. In addition, experiments on several widely used remote sensing data indicate that the index can also efficiently identify informative bands for a better target detection performance.

TI  - Implementation of Robust Satellite Techniques for Volcanoes on ASTER Data under the Google Earth Engine Platform
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured ApplicationVolcano activity mapping and monitoring.The RST (Robust Satellite Techniques) approach is a multi-temporal scheme of satellite data analysis widely used to investigate and monitor thermal volcanic activity from space through high temporal resolution data from sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI). In this work, we present the results of the preliminary RST algorithm implementation to thermal infrared (TIR) data, at 90 m spatial resolution, from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). Results achieved under the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment, by analyzing 20 years of satellite observations over three active volcanoes (i.e., Etna, Shishaldin and Shinmoedake) located in different geographic areas, show that the RST-based system, hereafter named RASTer, detected a higher (around 25% more) number of thermal anomalies than the well-established ASTER Volcano Archive (AVA). Despite the availability of a less populated dataset than other sensors, the RST implementation on ASTER data guarantees an efficient identification and mapping of volcanic thermal features even of a low intensity level. To improve the temporal continuity of the active volcanoes monitoring, the possibility of exploiting RASTer is here addressed, in the perspective of an operational multi-satellite observing system. The latter could include mid-high spatial resolution satellite data (e.g., Sentinel-2/MSI, Landsat-8/OLI), as well as those at higher-temporal (lower-spatial) resolution (e.g., EOS/MODIS, Suomi-NPP/VIIRS, Sentinel-3/SLSTR), for which RASTer could provide useful algorithm's validation and training dataset.

TI  - Impacts of Fully Coupling Land Surface and Flood Models on the Simulation of Large Wetlands' Water Dynamics: The Case of the Inner Niger Delta
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is known that representing wetland dynamics in land surface modeling improves models' capacity to reproduce fluxes and land surface boundary conditions for atmospheric modeling in general circulation models. This study presents the development of the full coupling between the Noah-MP land surface model (LSM) and the Hydrological Modeling and Analysis Platform (HyMAP) flood model in the NASA Land Information System and its application over the Inner Niger Delta (IND), a well-known hot-spot of strong land surface-atmosphere interactions in West Africa. Here, we define two experiments at 0.02 degrees spatial resolution over 2002-2018 to quantify the impacts of the proposed developments on simulating IND dynamics. One represents the one-way approach for simulating land surface and flooding processes (1-WAY), that is, Noah-MP neglects surface water availability, and the proposed two-way coupling (2-WAY), where Noah-MP takes surface water availability into account in the vertical water and energy balance. Results show that accounting for two-way interactions between Noah-MP and HyMAP over IND improves simulations of all selected hydrological variables. Compared to 1-WAY, evapotranspiration derived from 2-WAY over flooding zones doubles, increased by 0.8 mm/day, resulting in an additional water loss rate of similar to 18,900 km(3)/year, similar to 40% drop of wetland extent during wet seasons, and major improvement in simulated water level variability at multiple locations. Significant soil moisture increase and surface temperature drop were also observed. Wetland outflows decreased by 35%, resulting in a substantial Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient improvement, from -0.73 to 0.79. It is anticipated that future developments in water monitoring and water-related disaster warning systems will considerably benefit from these findings.

TI  - Local- and Regional-Scale Forcing of Glacier Mass Balance Changes in the Swiss Alps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier mass variations are climate indicators. Therefore, it is essential to examine both winter and summer mass balance variability over a long period of time to address climate-related ice mass fluctuations. In this study, we analyze glacier mass balance components and hypsometric characteristics with respect to their interactions with local meteorological variables and remote large-scale atmospheric and oceanic patterns. The results show that all selected glaciers have lost their equilibrium condition in recent decades, with persistent negative annual mass balance trends and decreasing accumulation area ratios (AARs), accompanied by increasing air temperatures of >= +0.45 degrees C decade(-1). The controlling factor of annual mass balance is mainly attributed to summer mass losses, which are correlated with (warming) June to September air temperatures. In addition, the interannual variability of summer and winter mass balances is primarily associated to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), Greenland Blocking Index (GBI), and East Atlantic (EA) teleconnections. Although climate parameters are playing a significant role in determining the glacier mass balance in the region, the observed correlations and mass balance trends are in agreement with the hypsometric distribution and morphology of the glaciers. The analysis of decadal frontal retreat using Landsat images from 1984 to 2014 also supports the findings of this research, highlighting the impact of lake formation at terminus areas on rapid glacier retreat and mass loss in the Swiss Alps.

TI  - Monitoring of Urban Sprawl and Densification Processes in Western Germany in the Light of SDG Indicator 11.3.1 Based on an Automated Retrospective Classification Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - By 2050, two-third of the world's population will live in cities. In this study, we develop a framework for analyzing urban growth-related imperviousness in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) from the 1980s to date using Landsat data. For the baseline 2017-time step, official geodata was extracted to generate labelled data for ten classes, including three classes representing low, middle, and high level of imperviousness. We used the output of the 2017 classification and information based on radiometric bi-temporal change detection for retrospective classification. Besides spectral bands, we calculated several indices and various temporal composites, which were used as an input for Random Forest classification. The results provide information on three imperviousness classes with accuracies exceeding 75%. According to our results, the imperviousness areas grew continuously from 1985 to 2017, with a high imperviousness area growth of more than 167,000 ha, comprising around 30% increase. The information on the expansion of urban areas was integrated with population dynamics data to estimate the progress towards SDG 11. With the intensity analysis and the integration of population data, the spatial heterogeneity of urban expansion and population growth was analysed, showing that the urban expansion rates considerably excelled population growth rates in some regions in NRW. The study highlights the applicability of earth observation data for accurately quantifying spatio-temporal urban dynamics for sustainable urbanization and targeted planning.

TI  - On-Board Ship Detection for Medium Resolution Optical Sensors
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years there has been an increased interest in ocean surveillance. The activity includes control and monitoring of illegal fisheries, manmade ocean pollution and illegal sea traffic surveillance, etc. The key problem is how to identify ships and ship-like objects accurately and in a timely manner. In this context, currently, many solutions have been proposed based on high resolution optical and radar remote sensing systems. Most often, these systems suffer from two major limitations viz., limited swath, thereby requiring multiple satellites to cover the region of interest and huge volumes of data being transmitted to ground, even though effective per-pixel information content is minimal. Another limitation is that the existing systems are either simulated on ground or built using the non-space qualified/Commercial Of-The-Shelf (COTS) components. This paper proposes an efficient on-board ship detection system/package connected with medium resolution wide swath optical camera. The methodology adopted has three major components, viz., onboard data processing for improving the radiometric fidelity, followed by a ship detection using modified Constant False Alarm Rate algorithm (CFAR) and a false alarm suppression module to mask false identifications. Finally, the package outputs only the locations of the ships, which is transmitted to the ground. The proposed system reduces the effective volume of data to be transmitted and processed on ground and also significantly cuts down the turnaround time for achieving the end objective. The system is built on radiation hardened Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices to meet the various engineering constraints such as real-time performance, limited onboard power, radiation hardness, handling of multiple custom interfaces etc. The system is tested with one of the medium resolution Multispectral Visual and Near Infra-Red (MX-VNIR) sensor having a spatial resolution of around 50 m and swath of around 500 Kms, which would be flown with one of the upcoming satellites. The systems performance is also verified on ground with Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) Satellite's Resourcesat's Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) data and the results are found to be quite encouraging as well as meeting the mission objectives.

TI  - Suffrutex grasslands in south-central Angola: belowground biomass, root structure, soil characteristics and vegetation dynamics of the 'underground forests of Africa'
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite its importance for carbon stocks accounting, belowground biomass (BGB) has seldom been measured due to the methodological complexity involved. In this study, we assess woody BGB and related carbon stocks, soil properties and human impact on two common suffrutex grasslands (Brachystegia- and Parinari grasslands) on the Angolan Central Plateau. Data on BGB was measured by direct destructive sampling. Soil samples were analysed for select key parameters. To investigate vegetation dynamics and human impact, we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and fire data retrieved via Google Earth Engine. Mean belowground woody biomass of sandy Parinari grasslands was 17 t/ha and 44 t/ha in ferralitic Brachystegia grasslands of which 50% correspond to carbon stocks. As such, the BGB of Brachystegia grasslands almost equals the amount of aboveground biomass (AGB) of neighbouring miombo woodlands. Almost the entire woody BGB is located in the top 30 cm of the soil. Soils were extremely acid, showing a low nutrient availability. Both grassland types differed strongly in EVI and fire seasonality. The Parinari grasslands burnt almost twice as frequent as Brachystegia grasslands in a 10-year period. Our study emphasizes the high relevance of BGB in suffrutex grasslands for carbon stock accounting.

TI  - Towards Automatic Recognition of Wakes Generated by Dark Vessels in Sentinel-1 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recognition of wakes generated by dark vessels is a tremendous and interesting challenge in the field of maritime surveillance by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The paper aims at assessing the detection performance in different scenarios by processing Sentinel-1 SAR images along with ground truth data. Results confirm that the Radon-based approach is an effective technique for wake-based detection of dark vessels, and they lead to a deeper understanding of the effects of different sea and wind conditions. In general, the best applicative scenario is a marine image characterized by homogeneous sea clutter; the presence of natural surface film or strong transition from low wind speed areas to more windy zones worsen the detection performance. Nonetheless, the proposed approach features dark vessel detection capabilities by identifying their wakes, without any a priori knowledge of their positions.

TI  - Angle Effect on Typical Optical Remote Sensing Indices in Vegetation Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing indices play an important role in vegetation information extraction and have been widely serving ecology, agriculture and forestry, urban monitoring, and other communities. Remote sensing indices are constructed from individual bands depending on special characteristics to enhance the typical spectral features for the identification or distinction of surface land covers. With the development of quantitative remote sensing, there is a rapid increasing requirement for accurate data processing and modeling. It is well known that the geometry-induced variation observed in surface reflectance is not ignorable, but the situation of uncertainty thereby introduced into these indices still needs further detailed understanding. We adopted the ground multi-angle hyperspectrum, spectral response function (SRF) of Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+), Operational Land Imager (OLI), Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) optical sensors and simulated their sensor-like spectral reflectance; then, we investigated the potential angle effect uncertainty on optical indices that have been frequently involved in vegetation monitoring and examined the forward/backward effect over both the ground-based level and the actual Landsat TM/ETM+ overlapped region. Our results on the discussed indices and sensors show as following: (1) Identifiable angle effects exist with a more elevated influence than that introduced by band difference among sensors; (2) The absolute difference between forward and backward direction can reach up to -0.03 to 0.1 within bands of the TM/ETM+ overlapped region; (3) The investigation at ground level indicates that there are different variations of angle effect transmitted to each remote sensing index. Regarding cases of crop canopy at various growth phases, most of the discussed indices have more than a 20% relative difference to nadir value except Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) with the magnitude lower than 10%, and less than 16% of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). For the case of wax maturity stage, the relative difference to nadir value of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), Char Soil Index (CSI), NBR, Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), and SWIR2/NIR exceeded 50%, while the values for NBR and NDMI can reach up to 115.8% and 206.7%, respectively; (4) Various schemes of index construction imply different propagation of angle effect uncertainty. The "difference" indices can partially suppress the directional influence, while the "ratio" indices show high potential to amplify the angle effect. This study reveals that the angle-induced uncertainty of these indices is greater than that induced by the spectrum mismatch among sensors, especially under the case of senescence. In addition, based on this work, indices with a suppressed potential of angle effect are recommended for vegetation monitoring or information retrieval to avoid unexpected effects.

TI  - Quantitative Retrieval of Volcanic Sulphate Aerosols from IASI Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a new retrieval algorithm based on the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) observations, called AEROIASI-H2SO4, to measure the extinction and mass concentration of sulphate aerosols (binary solution droplets of sulphuric acid and water), with moderate random uncertainties (typically similar to 35% total uncertainty for column mass concentration estimations). The algorithm is based on a self-adapting Tikhonov-Phillips regularization method. It is here tested over a moderate-intensity eruption of Mount Etna volcano (18 March 2012), Italy, and is used to characterise this event in terms of the spatial distribution of the retrieved plume. Comparisons with simultaneous and independent aerosol optical depth observations from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), SO2 plume observations from IASI and simulations with the CHIMERE chemistry/transport model show that AEROIASI-H2SO4 correctly identifies the volcanic plume horizontal morphology, thus providing crucial new information towards the study of volcanic emissions, volcanic sulphur cycle in the atmosphere, plume evolution processes, and their impacts. Insights are given on the possible spectroscopic evidence of the presence in the plume of larger-sized particles than previously reported for secondary sulphate aerosols from volcanic eruptions.

TI  - Finding woodlands in drylands: Bases for the monitoring of xeric open forests in a cloud computing platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Conservation and sustainable management of woodlands in drylands is a priority at the global level considering the numerous benefits and ecosystem services they offer for local people. Sustainable use of forest resources requires the planning of forest conservation, restoration, and use on a global scale through National Forest Plans. It is imperative to generate information about their location and main characteristics to develop such plans. In this context, satellite imagery presents invaluable advantages related to the possibility of covering greater extensions in less time using fewer resources. However, there is limited knowledge about dryland woodlands spatial distribution due to the challenges associated with their identification. Particular features of these forests may conceal them from remote sensors. In Argentina's drylands, the detection of Monte biogeographical province's woodlands is hindered due to the spectral confusion that takes place between them and the surrounding shrubland. The objective of this study was to assess and compare different methodologies in a web-based image processing platform to develop a monitoring methodology easy to apply by public offices. We selected two study areas in the Monte region where we performed and assessed 16 types of supervised image classifications. In drier sites characterized by high contrast between woodlands and surrounding areas, forest detectability improved. In both study areas, we found better results using higher resolution images. The improvement associated with the inclusion of a vegetation index, as well as the classification algorithm and scheme implemented was case-dependent. In both study areas, classifications detected non-forest areas more accurately, indicating the possible application of the assessed procedures for the monitoring of forest loss. The cloud computing platform proved very useful and included multiple advantages. Bases for the detection of woodlands in drylands emerge from this study, considering improvements in accuracy and suitable alternatives: the use of Sentinel images, the addition to the mosaic of the SATVI index, the use of the CART algorithm, and a detailed classification scheme. These do not intend to be rigid instructions, but baseline recommendations to orient the design of monitoring approaches of these hidden forests.

TI  - Relationship between Water Surface Area of Qingtu Lake and Ecological Water Delivery: A Case Study in Northwest China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Qingtu Lake is located between Tengger Desert and Badain Jilin Desert, Gansu Province, Northwest China. It is the terminal lake of Shiyang River. In recent years, Qingtu lake has maintained a certain area of water surface and vegetation by artificial water conveyance. It is of great significance in preventing the convergence of the two deserts and restraining the trend of ecological deterioration of Shiyang River Basin. The relationship between the water surface area and the ecological water conveyance have not been thoroughly investigated. This study analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution of water surface area of Qingtu Lake and surrounding reeds by interpreting remote sensing data; the change of water surface area under the influence of meteorological factors and water conveyance by linear regression; the water conveyance to maintain current water surface area by water balance method, as well as the reasonable ecological water delivery in high flow year, normal flow year and low flow year by the means of analyzing the upstream inflow and water consumption in Minqin Basin. The results showed that there is a significant correlation between the water surface area of Qingtu Lake, evaporation and ecological water conveyance, and the minimum and maximum water surface areas generally appear before and after water delivery, indicating that the ecological water delivery and evaporation are the two main factors affecting the water surface area change of Qingtu Lake. The result calculated by linear regression indicated that the ecological water delivery volume to maintain current water surface area of Qingtu Lake is 3.146 x 10(7) m(3)/yr, while the value was 3.136 x 10(7) m(3)/yr calculated by water balance method. These two results are similar and can be verified with each other. Reasonable ecological water conveyance of Qingtu Lake in high flow year, normal flow year and low flow years were 4 x 10(7) m(3)/yr, 3.2 x 10(7) m(3)/yr and 2.3 x 10(7) m(3)/yr, respectively.

TI  - Monitoring deformations of Istanbul metro line stations through Sentinel-1 and levelling observations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Turkey, as a developing country, is designing and performing massive construction projects around Istanbul. Beginning from the 1960s, rapid urbanization has been taking place due to industrialization, which brings an increase in the population. Yet, construction projects have been accelerated especially during the last decade, and many new projects are scheduled to be completed in a short time. Ground-based observations are generally carried out to monitor the deformations within construction sites, especially through geometric levelling, and GNSS techniques. However, in most cases, these monitoring measurements are only scheduled within the period of the construction process, and ensuing deformations are usually not considered. In addition to these techniques, the space-based interferometric technique can also be used to define the line of sight surface displacements with high accuracy, using the phase difference between image result for synthetic aperture radar images. In particular, Persistent Scatter Interferometry is one of the interferometric methods that are capable of defining the two-dimensional (vertical and horizontal) deformation for the desired epoch with a high temporal resolution. Thus it can be used as a complementary method for monitoring ground deformations, where the measurement is made by ground-based observations. In this study, the deforming areas related to underground metro construction are investigated through significant displacements between 2015 and 2018 of Sentinel-1 space-borne SAR data using the PSI technique. These results are validated by comparison with available levelling data corresponding to the new metro line.

TI  - Back to the fields? Increased agricultural land greenness after a COVID-19 lockdown
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers worldwide adopted unprecedented measures to limit disease spread, with major repercussions on economic activities and the environment. Here we provide empirical evidence of the impact of a lockdown policy on satellite-measured agricultural land greenness in Badung, a highly populated regency of Bali, Indonesia. Using machine learning and satellite data, we estimate what the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) of cropland would have been without a lockdown. Based on on this counterfactual, we estimate a significant increase in the EVI over agricultural land after the beginning of the lockdown period. The finding is robust to a placebo test. Based on evidence from official reports and international press outlets, we suggest that the observed increase in EVI might be caused by labour reallocation to agriculture from the tourism sector, hardly hit by the lockdown measures. Our results show that machine learning and satellite data can be effectively combined to estimate the effects of exogenous events on land productivity.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations of vegetation coverage in the middle section of Yellow River Basin based on terrain gradient: Taking Yan'an City as an example
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation restoration is an important requirement for ecological protection and high. quality development in the Yellow River Basin. In-depth understanding the temporal and spatial differentiation of vegetation has important practical significance. With the four Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing images as the data source, the pixel binary model was used to estimate vegetation coverage. The transfer matrix, geological information map, and the center of gravity migration model were used to analyze the temporal and spatial variations of vegetation coverage in Yan'an City in the mid. dle of the Yellow River Basin from 1988 to 2018. The spatial variation of vegetation cover to elevation and slope was explored using terrain distribution index combined with terrain data. The results showed that vegetation coverage in Yan'an was low in the north region and high in the south region. The vegetation coverage increased significantly due to policy changes. From 1988 to 2018, the vegetation change pattern in Yan'an was dominated by continuous improvement and stability. Vegetation coverage increased in about 50% of the area. 83% of the study area with high vegetation coverage remained stable. At each elevation and slope level, the advantage of high vegetation cove-rage increased with time. At each slope level, vegetation cover increased with slope. The transition direction of vegetation cover of different levels in Yan'an was basically consistent with the overall spatial change trend of vegetation cover, with the overall shift being from north to west. The vegetation construction in Yan'an has achieved remarkable results, though the vegetation coverage in the north still needs to be improved. Optimizing vegetation types and structures is an important direction for future vegetation construction.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Distribution of the Freeze-Thaw Cycle of the Largest Lake (Qinghai Lake) in China Based on Machine Learning and MODIS from 2000 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The lake ice phenology variations are vital for the land-surface-water cycle. Qinghai Lake is experiencing amplified warming under climate change. Based on the MODIS imagery, the spatio-temporal dynamics of the ice phenology of Qinghai Lake were analyzed using machine learning during the 2000/2001 to 2019/2020 ice season, and cloud gap-filling procedures were applied to reconstruct the result. The results showed that the overall accuracy of the water-ice classification by random forest and cloud gap-filling procedures was 98.36% and 92.56%, respectively. The annual spatial distribution of the freeze-up and break-up dates ranged primarily from DOY 330 to 397 and from DOY 70 to 116. Meanwhile, the decrease rates of freeze-up duration (DFU), full ice cover duration (DFI), and ice cover duration (DI) were 0.37, 0.34, and 0.13 days/yr., respectively, and the duration was shortened by 7.4, 6.8, and 2.6 days over the past 20 years. The increased rate of break-up duration (DBU) was 0.58 days/yr. and the duration was lengthened by 11.6 days. Furthermore, the increase in temperature resulted in an increase in precipitation after two years; the increase in precipitation resulted in the increase in DBU and decrease in DFU in corresponding years, and decreased DI and DFI after one year.

TI  - Mast Cells and Skin and Breast Cancers: A Complicated and Microenvironment-Dependent Role
T2  - CELLS
M3  - Review
AB  - Mast cells are important sentinel cells in host defense against infection and major effector cells in allergic disease. The role of these cells in cancer settings has been widely debated. The diverse range of mast cell functions in both immunity and tissue remodeling events, such as angiogenesis, provides multiple opportunities for mast cells to modify the tumor microenvironment. In this review, we consider both skin and breast cancer settings to address the controversy surrounding the importance of mast cells in the host response to tumors. We specifically address the key mediators produced by mast cells which impact tumor development. The role of environmental challenges in modifying mast cell responses and opportunities to modify mast cell responses to enhance anti-tumor immunity are also considered. While the mast cell's role in many cancer contexts is complicated and poorly understood, the activities of these tissue resident and radioresistant cells can provide important opportunities to enhance anti-cancer responses and limit cancer development.

TI  - PCR Testing of Media Placed in Soiled Bedding as a Method for Mouse Colony Health Surveillance
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rodent colony health surveillance has traditionally been accomplished by testing sentinel animals that have been exposed to soiled bedding from colony animals. Collecting samples from exhaust plenums on ventilated caging systems, followed by PCR analysis, has emerged as another promising method for health surveillance. However, environmental testing at the rack level is not effective for all ventilated rack designs. In this study, we tested whether media placed in soiled bedding is effective in detecting 3 adventitious agents: mouse norovirus (MNV), Helicobacter spp., and fur mites. Soiled bedding was collected from pathogen-positive colony mice and distributed to traditional sentinel mouse cages and mouse-free experimental cages every 1 to 2 wk for static and ventilated cages, respectively. Experimental cages contained 10 flocked swabs (`passive swabs') and 1 piece of filter media. After 90 d, fresh feces, pelage swabs, and blood were collected from the sentinel cages, and the passive swabs and filter media were collected from the experimental cages. Concurrently, 10 additional flocked swabs (`active swabs') were stirred through the cumulated soiled bedding of each experimental cage. Sentinel mice were positive for MNV and Helicobacter spp., but negative for fur mites by pelage swab PCR. All samples from experimental cages were positive for Helicobacter spp. and fur mites in both caging types. For MNV, passive swabs were most effective at detection (100%), followed by active swabs (80% to 100%) and filter media (60% to 80%). These findings suggest that testing media in pooled soiled bedding samples is more effective than traditional sentinel methods for colony health surveillance and is a viable option when sampling at the rack level is ineffective.

TI  - Psychological Vulnerabilities and Extremism Among Norwegian Youth: A Structural Equation Model Using a Large-<i>n</i> Sample
T2  - PEACE AND CONFLICT-JOURNAL OF PEACE PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Are psychologically vulnerable youth more susceptible to extremism than their peers? Today's radicalized Westerners are young and their extreme opinions develop during adolescence, a period in which challenges to worldview and self-perception can be potent motivators for extremist engagement, as shown in work on significance quests (Kruglanski et al., Political Psychology, 2014, 35, 69-93) and general strain (Agnew, Theoretical Criminology, 2010, 14, 131-153). To better understand the developmental paths to extremism, more knowledge is needed about the interplay among vulnerability factors. Thus, this study investigates whether psychological vulnerabilities among Norwegian youth increases susceptibility to extremism. It specifically explores psychological vulnerabilities in relation to mental illness, traumatic experiences, early socialization, perceived discrimination, social capital, and delinquency. The study's data come from Young in Oslo 2015, a population-based, cross-sectional survey of over 24,000 adolescents conducted in upper secondary schools in the Norwegian capital (n = 10.932). Overall, Oslo youth are representative of Norwegian youth, demographically, psychosocially, and with regard to extremism. This study measured four expressions of extremism and conducted structural equation modeling (SEM). Results indicate that factors indicative of psychological vulnerabilities are relevant in explaining susceptibility to extremism among Norwegian youth, especially when viewed in relation to specific demographic variables. Quests for significance and opposition to collective strains appear to be relevant to the relationship between extremism and psychological vulnerabilities. More broadly, this study suggests that extremism develops as a result of complex interactions among numerous factors, that the ordering of these factors varies, and that there is no one trajectory to extremism.

TI  - Salt Marsh Light Use Efficiency is Driven by Environmental Gradients and Species-Specific Physiology and Morphology
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Light use efficiency (LUE) of salt marshes has not been well studied but is central to production efficiency models (PEMs) used for estimating gross primary production (GPP). Salt marshes are typically dominated by a species monoculture, resulting in large areas with distinct morphology and physiology. We measured eddy covariance atmospheric CO2 fluxes for two marshes dominated by a different species: Juncus roemerianus in Mississippi and Spartina alterniflora in Georgia. LUE for the Juncus marsh (mean = 0.160 +/- 0.004 g C mol(-1) photon), reported here for the first time, was on average similar to the Spartina marsh (mean = 0.164 +/- 0.003 g C mol(-1) photon). However, Juncus LUE had a greater range (0.073-0.49 g C mol(-1) photon) and higher variability (15.2%) than the Spartina marsh (range: 0.035-0.36 g C mol(-1) photon; variability: 12.7%). We compared the responses of LUE across six environmental gradients. Juncus LUE was predominantly driven by cloudiness, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), soil temperature, water table, and vapor pressure deficit. Spartina LUE was driven by water table, air temperature, and cloudiness. We also tested how the definition of LUE (incident PAR vs. absorbed PAR) affected the magnitude of LUE and its response. We found LUE estimations using incident PAR underestimated LUE and masked day-to-day variability. Our findings suggest that salt marsh LUE parametrization should be species-specific due to plant morphology and physiology and their geographic context. These findings can be used to improve PEMs for modeling blue carbon productivity.

TI  - Refining MODIS NIR Atmospheric Water Vapor Retrieval Algorithm Using GPS-Derived Water Vapor Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new algorithm of retrieving atmospheric water vapor from MODIS near-infrared (IR) (NIR) data by using a regression fitting method based on Global Positioning System (GPS)-derived water vapor is developed in this work. The algorithm has been used to retrieve total column water vapor from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellites both Terra and Aqua under cloud-free conditions from solar radiation in the NIR channels. Water vapor data estimated from GPS observations recorded from 2003 to 2017 by the SuomiNet GPS network over the western North America are used as ground truth references. The GPS stations were classified into six subsets based on the surface types adopted from MCD12Q1 IGBP legend. The differences in surface types are considered in the regression fitting procedure, thus different regression functions are trained for different surface types. Thus, the wet bias in the operational MODIS water vapor products has been significantly reduced. Water vapor retrieved from each of the three absorption channels and the weighted water vapor of combined three absorption channels are analyzed. Validation shows that the weighted water vapor performs better than the single-channel results. Compared to the MODIS/Terra water vapor products, the RMSE has been reduced by 50.78% to 2.229 mm using the two-channel ratio transmittance method and has been reduced by 53.06% to 2.126 mm using the three-channel ratio transmittance method. Compared to the MODIS/Aqua water vapor products, the RMSE has been reduced by 45.54% to 2.423 mm using the two-channel ratio transmittance method and has been reduced by 45.34% to 2.432 mm using the three-channel ratio transmittance method.

TI  - Assessment of Normalized Water-Leaving Radiance Derived from GOCI Using AERONET-OC Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI), as the world's first operational geostationary ocean color sensor, is aiming at monitoring short-term and small-scale changes of waters over the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Before assessing its capability of detecting subdiurnal changes of seawater properties, a fundamental understanding of the uncertainties of normalized water-leaving radiance (nLw) products introduced by atmospheric correction algorithms is necessarily required. This paper presents the uncertainties by accessing GOCI-derived nLw products generated by two commonly used operational atmospheric algorithms, the Korea Ocean Satellite Center (KOSC) standard atmospheric algorithm adopted in GOCI Data Processing System (GDPS) and the NASA standard atmospheric algorithm implemented in Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor Data Analysis System (SeaDAS/l2gen package), with Aerosol Robotic Network Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) provided nLw data. The nLw data acquired from the GOCI sensor based on two algorithms and four AERONET-OC sites of Ariake, Ieodo, Socheongcho, and Gageocho from October 2011 to March 2019 were obtained, matched, and analyzed. The GDPS-generated nLw data are slightly better than that with SeaDAS at visible bands; however, the mean percentage relative errors for both algorithms at blue bands are over 30%. The nLw data derived by GDPS is of better quality both in clear and turbid water, although underestimation is observed at near-infrared (NIR) band (865 nm) in turbid water. The nLw data derived by SeaDAS are underestimated in both clear and turbid water, and the underestimation worsens toward short visible bands. Moreover, both algorithms perform better at noon (02 and 03 Universal Time Coordinated (UTC)), and worse in the early morning and late afternoon. It is speculated that the uncertainties in nLw measurements arose from aerosol models, NIR water-leaving radiance correction method, and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) correction method in corresponding atmospheric correction procedure.

This approach relies on the connection between snow timing and peak SWE, yet few studies have directly examined this relationship. Here, we investigate the strength and spatiotemporal variation in this relationship across the western United States and Alaska. Within the SNOTEL network (n = 611 sites), we find that most variance in peak SWE is explained (median R-2 = 0.64, sigma = 0.18) by, in order of explanatory skill, the timing of snow disappearance, onset, and cover duration, with variation in skill primarily related to climate conditions-like winter storm size and storm frequency-rather than topographical setting. We expand this analysis with a diagnostic model of peak SWE driven by remotely sensed snow timing indices applied to five hydrologically important regions in the western United States and Alaska. Uncertainties arising between blending point and 500 m grid-scale observations were found to influence model SWE bias, but a robust correlation (median R = 0.88) with observations persisted across all tested thresholds. Overall, this supports the viability of snow timing information for quantifying spatial patterns of peak SWE (mean R-2 = 0.76, percent bias = 3.6%) over the past two decades. These findings carry important implications for the development of SWE reanalysis products and for the evaluation of climate and hydrologic models.

TI  - What's in a name? Sentinel injuries in abused infants
T2  - PEDIATRIC RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Infants are at greatest risk of severe and fatal physical abuse yet they sometimes present for medical care multiple times with abusive injuries prior to being diagnosed with abuse and having protective actions taken. Efforts to identify these infants in a timely manner are critical to prevent repeated, escalating abuse and subsequent harm. Increasing the identification and evaluation of sentinel injuries has been highlighted as a strategy for improving timely detection of abuse in infants. Sentinel injuries are visible, minor, poorly explained injuries in young infants that raise concern for abuse. These injuries include cutaneous injuries such as bruising, subconjunctival hemorrhages and intra-oral injuries. Sentinel injuries can signal concurrent clinically occult but more serious injuries or precede more significant trauma from abuse. As such, sentinel injuries offer an opportunity to intervene and protect infants from further harm. A thorough physical exam is critical for detecting sentinel injuries. Imaging with skeletal survey and, when appropriate, neuroimaging are key components of the medical evaluation of sentinel injuries in these high-risk infants.

TI  - Inferring Grassland Drought Stress with Unsupervised Learning from Airborne Hyperspectral VNIR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2018-2019 Central European drought had a grave impact on natural and managed ecosystems, affecting their health and productivity. We examined patterns in hyperspectral VNIR imagery using an unsupervised learning approach to improve ecosystem monitoring and the understanding of grassland drought responses. The main objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the application of simplex volume maximisation (SiVM), an unsupervised learning method, for the detection of grassland drought stress in high-dimensional remote sensing data at the ecosystem scale and (2) to analyse the contributions of different spectral plant and soil traits to the computed stress signal. The drought status of the research site was assessed with a non-parametric standardised precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and soil moisture measurements. We used airborne HySpex VNIR-1800 data from spring 2018 and 2019 to compare vegetation condition at the onset of the drought with the state after one year. SiVM, an interpretable matrix factorisation technique, was used to derive typical extreme spectra (archetypes) from the hyperspectral data. The classification of archetypes allowed for the inference of qualitative drought stress levels. The results were evaluated using a set of geophysical measurements and vegetation indices as proxy variables for drought-inhibited vegetation growth. The successful application of SiVM for grassland stress detection at the ecosystem canopy scale was verified in a correlation analysis. The predictor importance was assessed with boosted beta regression. In the resulting interannual stress model, carotenoid-related variables had among the highest coefficient values. The significance of the photochemical reflectance index that uses 512 nm as reference wavelength (PRI512) demonstrates the value of combining imaging spectrometry and unsupervised learning for the monitoring of vegetation stress. It also shows the potential of archetypical reflectance spectra to be used for the remote estimation of photosynthetic efficiency. More conclusive results could be achieved by using vegetation measurements instead of proxy variables for evaluation. It must also be investigated how the method can be generalised across ecosystems.

TI  - Meteosat Third Generation (MTG): Continuation and Innovation of Observations from Geostationary Orbit
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the next couple of years, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) will start the deployment of its next-generation geostationary meteorological satellites. The Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) is composed of four imaging (MTG-I) and two sounding (MTG-S) platforms. The satellites are three-axis stabilized, unlike the two previous generations of Meteosat that were spin stabilized, and carry two sets of remote sensing instruments each. Hence, in addition to providing continuity, the new system will provide an unprecedented capability from geostationary orbit. The payload on the MTG-I satellites are the 16-channel Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) and the Lightning Imager (LI). The payloads on the MTG-S satellites are the hyperspectral Infrared Sounder (IRS) and a high-resolution Ultraviolet-Visible-Near-Infrared (UVN) sounder Sentinel-4/UVN, provided by the European Commission. Today, hyperspectral sounding from geostationary orbit is provided by the Chinese Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) instrument, and lightning mappers are available on FY-4A and on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) GOES-16 and GOES-17 satellites. Consequently, the development of science and applications for these types of instruments have a solid foundation. However, the IRS, LI, and Sentinel-4/UVN are a challenging first for Europe in a geostationary orbit. The four MTG-I and two MTG-S satellites are designed to provide 20 and 15.5 years of operational service, respectively. The launch of the first MTG-I is expected at the end of 2022 and the first MTG-S roughly a year later. This article describes the four instruments, outlines products and services, and addresses the evolution of the further applications.

TI  - Temperature and Relative Humidity Profile Retrieval from Fengyun-3D/HIRAS in the Arctic Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The acquisition of real-time temperature and relative humidity (RH) profiles in the Arctic is of great significance for the study of the Arctic's climate and Arctic scientific research. However, the operational algorithm of Fengyun-3D only takes into account areas within 60 degrees N, the innovation of this work is that a new technique based on Neural Network (NN) algorithm was proposed, which can retrieve these parameters in real time from the Fengyun-3D Hyperspectral Infrared Radiation Atmospheric Sounding (HIRAS) observations in the Arctic region. Considering the difficulty of obtaining a large amount of actual observation (such as radiosonde) in the Arctic region, collocated ERA5 data from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and HIRAS observations were used to train the neural networks (NNs). Brightness temperature and training targets were classified using two variables: season (warm season and cold season) and surface type (ocean and land). NNs-based retrievals were compared with ERA5 data and radiosonde observations (RAOBs) independent of the NN training sets. Results showed that (1) the NNs retrievals accuracy is generally higher on warm season and ocean; (2) the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of retrieved profiles is generally slightly higher in the RAOB comparisons than in the ERA5 comparisons, but the variation trend of errors with height is consistent; (3) the retrieved profiles by the NN method are closer to ERA5, comparing with the AIRS products. All the results demonstrated the potential value in time and space of NN algorithm in retrieving temperature and relative humidity profiles of the Arctic region from HIRAS observations under clear-sky conditions. As such, the proposed NN algorithm provides a valuable pathway for retrieving reliably temperature and RH profiles from HIRAS observations in the Arctic region, providing information of practical value in a wide spectrum of practical applications and research investigations alike.All in all, our work has important implications in broadening Fengyun-3D's operational implementation range from within 60 degrees N to the Arctic region.

TI  - Constructing Adaptive Deformation Models for Estimating DEM Error in SBAS-InSAR Based on Hypothesis Testing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique has been widely used to obtain the ground surface deformation of geohazards (e.g., mining subsidence and landslides). As one of the inherent errors in the interferometric phase, the digital elevation model (DEM) error is usually estimated with the help of an a priori deformation model. However, it is difficult to determine an a priori deformation model that can fit the deformation time series well, leading to possible bias in the estimation of DEM error and the deformation time series. In this paper, we propose a method that can construct an adaptive deformation model, based on a set of predefined functions and the hypothesis testing theory in the framework of the small baseline subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) method. Since it is difficult to fit the deformation time series over a long time span by using only one function, the phase time series is first divided into several groups with overlapping regions. In each group, the hypothesis testing theory is employed to adaptively select the optimal deformation model from the predefined functions. The parameters of adaptive deformation models and the DEM error can be modeled with the phase time series and solved by a least square method. Simulations and real data experiments in the Pingchuan mining area, Gaunsu Province, China, demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art deformation modeling strategy (e.g., the linear deformation model and the function group deformation model), the proposed method can significantly improve the accuracy of DEM error estimation and can benefit the estimation of deformation time series.

TI  - Remote Estimation of Trophic State Index for Inland Waters Using Landsat-8 OLI Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote monitoring of trophic state for inland waters is a hotspot of water quality studies worldwide. However, the complex optical properties of inland waters limit the potential of algorithms. This research aims to develop an algorithm to estimate the trophic state in inland waters. First, the turbid water index was applied for the determination of optical water types on each pixel, and water bodies are divided into two categories: algae-dominated water (Type I) and turbid water (Type II). The algal biomass index (ABI) was then established based on water classification to derive the trophic state index (TSI) proposed by Carlson (1977). The results showed a considerable precision in Type I water (R-2 = 0.62, N = 282) and Type II water (R-2 = 0.57, N = 132). The ABI-derived TSI outperformed several band-ratio algorithms and a machine learning method (RMSE = 4.08, MRE = 5.46%, MAE = 3.14, NSE = 0.64). Such a model was employed to generate the trophic state index of 146 lakes (> 10 km(2)) in eastern China from 2013 to 2020 using Landsat-8 surface reflectance data. The number of hypertrophic and oligotrophic lakes decreased from 45.89% to 21.92% and 4.11% to 1.37%, respectively, while the number of mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes increased from 12.33% to 23.97% and 37.67% to 52.74%. The annual mean TSI for the lakes in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin was higher than that in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and Huai River basin. The retrieval algorithm illustrated the applicability to other sensors with an overall accuracy of 83.27% for moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and 82.92% for Sentinel-3 OLCI sensor, demonstrating the potential for high-frequency observation and large-scale simulation capability. Our study can provide an effective trophic state assessment and support inland water management.

TI  - On-the-Fly Fusion of Remotely-Sensed Big Data Using an Elastic Computing Paradigm with a Containerized Spark Engine on Kubernetes
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely-sensed satellite image fusion is indispensable for the generation of long-term gap-free Earth observation data. While cloud computing (CC) provides the big picture for RS big data (RSBD), the fundamental question of the efficient fusion of RSBD on CC platforms has not yet been settled. To this end, we propose a lightweight cloud-native framework for the elastic processing of RSBD in this study. With the scaling mechanisms provided by both the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Services (PaaS) of CC, the Spark-on-Kubernetes operator model running in the framework can enhance the efficiency of Spark-based algorithms without considering bottlenecks such as task latency caused by an unbalanced workload, and can ease the burden to tune the performance parameters for their parallel algorithms. Internally, we propose a task scheduling mechanism (TSM) to dynamically change the Spark executor pods' affinities to the computing hosts. The TSM learns the workload of a computing host. Learning from the ratio between the number of completed and failed tasks on a computing host, the TSM dispatches Spark executor pods to newer and less-overwhelmed computing hosts. In order to illustrate the advantage, we implement a parallel enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (PESTARFM) to enable the efficient fusion of big RS images with a Spark aggregation function. We construct an OpenStack cloud computing environment to test the usability of the framework. According to the experiments, TSM can improve the performance of the PESTARFM using only PaaS scaling to about 11.7%. When using both the IaaS and PaaS scaling, the maximum performance gain with the TSM can be even greater than 13.6%. The fusion of such big Sentinel and PlanetScope images requires less than 4 min in the experimental environment.

TI  - Tracking Smoke from a Prescribed Fire and Its Impacts on Local Air Quality Using Temporally Resolved <i>GOES</i>-<i>16</i> ABI Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved from the GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) was used to track a smoke plume from a prescribed fire in northeastern Virginia on 8 March 2020. Weather and atmospheric conditions created a favorable environment to transport the plume through the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland, metro areas in the afternoon and concentrate smoke near the surface, degrading air quality for several hours. ABI AOD with 5-min temporal resolution and 2-km spatial resolution definitively identified the timing and geographic extent of the plume during daylight hours. Comparison to AERONET AOD indicates that ABI AOD captured the relative change in AOD due to passage of the smoke, with a mean absolute error of 0.047. Ground-based measurements of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) confirm deteriorations in air quality coincident with the progression of the smoke. Ceilometer aerosol backscatter profiles verify plume transport timing and indicate that smoke aerosols were well mixed in a shallow boundary layer. This event illustrates the advantages of using multiple datasets to analyze the impacts of aerosols on ambient air quality. Given the quickly evolving nature of the event over several hours, ABI AOD provided information for the public and decision-makers that was not available from any other source, including polar-orbiting satellite sensors. This study suggests that PM2.5 concentrations estimated from ABI AOD can be used to fill in the gaps in nationwide regulatory PM2.5 monitor networks and may be a valuable addition to EPA's PM2.5 NowCast of current air quality conditions.

TI  - Offline-Online Change Detection for Sentinel-1 InSAR Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional applications of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data involved inverting an interferogram stack to determine the average displacement velocity. While this approach has useful applications in continuously deforming regions, much information is lost by simply fitting a line through the time series. Thanks to regular acquisitions across most of the the world by the ESA Sentinel-1 satellite constellation, we are now in a position to explore opportunities for near-real time deformation monitoring. In this paper we present a statistical approach for detecting offsets and gradient changes in InSAR time series. Our key assumption is that 5 years of Sentinel-1 data is sufficient to calculate the population standard deviation of the detection variables. Our offset detector identifies statistically significant peaks in the first, second and third difference series. The gradient change detector identifies statistically significant movements in the second derivative series. We exploit the high spatial resolution of Sentinel-1 data and the spatial continuity of geophysical deformation signals to filter out false positive detections that arise due to signal noise. When combined with near-real time processing of InSAR data these detectors, particularly the gradient change, could be used to detect incipient ground deformation associated with geophysical phenomena, for example from landslides or volcanic eruptions.

TI  - Geocorrection of Airborne Mid-Wave Infrared Imagery for Mapping Wildfires without GPS or IMU
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in annual wildfires in many areas of the world has triggered international efforts to deploy sensors on airborne and space platforms to map these events and understand their behaviour. During the summer of 2017, an airborne flight campaign acquired mid-wave infrared imagery over active wildfires in Northern Ontario, Canada. However, it suffered multiple position-based equipment issues, thus requiring a non-standard geocorrection methodology. This study presents the approach, which utilizes a two-step semi-automatic geocorrection process that outputs image mosaics from airborne infrared video input. The first step extracts individual video frames that are combined into orthoimages using an automatic image registration method. The second step involves the georeferencing of the imagery using pseudo-ground control points to a fixed coordinate systems. The output geocorrected datasets in units of radiance can then be used to derive fire products such as fire radiative power density (FRPD). Prior to the georeferencing process, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) associated with the imagery was greater than 200 m. After the georeferencing process was applied, an RMSE below 30 m was reported, and the computed FRPD estimations are within expected values across the literature. As such, this alternative geocorrection methodology successfully salvages an otherwise unusable dataset and can be adapted by other researchers that do not have access to accurate positional information for airborne infrared flight campaigns over wildfires.

TI  - Multithreading Based Parallel Processing for Image Geometric Coregistration in SAR Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the framework of multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometric processing, image coregistration is a fundamental operation that might be extremely time-consuming. This paper explores the possibility of addressing fast and accurate SAR image geometric coregistration, with sub-pixel accuracy and in the presence of a complex 3-D object scene, by exploiting the parallelism offered by shared-memory architectures. An efficient and scalable processor is proposed by designing a parallel algorithm incorporating thread-level parallelism for solving the inherent computationally intensive problem. The adopted functional scheme is first mathematically framed and then investigated in detail in terms of its computational structures. Subsequently, a parallel version of the algorithm is designed, according to a fork-join model, by suitably taking into account the granularity of the decomposition, load-balancing, and different scheduling strategies. The developed parallel algorithm implements parallelism at the thread-level by using OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) and it is specifically targeted at shared-memory multiprocessors. The parallel performance of the implemented multithreading-based SAR image coregistration prototype processor is experimentally investigated and quantitatively assessed by processing high-resolution X-band COSMO-SkyMed SAR data and using two different multicore architectures. The effectiveness of the developed multithreaded prototype solution in fully benefitting from the computing power offered by multicore processors has successfully been demonstrated via a suitable experimental performance analysis conducted in terms of parallel speedup and efficiency. The demonstrated scalable performance and portability of the developed parallel processor confirm its potential for operational use in the interferometric SAR data processing at large scales.

TI  - Determination of spatiotemporal changes in Erzurum plain wetland system using remote sensing techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study takes place in Erzurum city of Eastern Anatolia Region of Turkey Erzurum Plain Wetland, one of the wetlands of international importance that has biodiversity and countless benefits to its environment. Studies to offer opportunities to monitor long-term changes in the area by using advanced technology economically and effectively are expected to guide decision makers. In the present study, the changes in surface area of Erzurum Plain Wetland were investigated between 1998 and 2017 by using remote sensing techniques. As a result of the change analysis conducted using Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM, and Landsat 8 OLI satellite data, it has been determined there is an expansion in deep and shallow water areas of the wetland. According to the results of the study, deep water areas expanded by 118.64% in 28 years. During this period, the total of deep water and shallow water reed areas increased by 9.08%. In the period of 1989-2017, the total area of the Erzurum Plain Wetland consisting of deep water, shallow water/reeds, and wet meadow/soil parts grew by 26.88%. In the study, the effects of change and human activities on this surface area change were also examined and it was found as a result of the evaluation that more than climatic factors, change of hydrological structure caused by increase in underground water reserves may be effective on the expansion.

AB  - Floods are one of nature's most destructive disasters because of the immense damage to land, buildings, and human fatalities. It is difficult to forecast the areas that are vulnerable to flash flooding due to the dynamic and complex nature of the flash floods. Therefore, earlier identification of flash flood susceptible sites can be performed using advanced machine learning models for managing flood disasters. In this study, we applied and assessed two new hybrid ensemble models, namely Dagging and Random Subspace (RS) coupled with Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) which are the other three state of-the-art machine learning models for modelling flood susceptibility maps at the Teesta River basin, the northern region of Bangladesh. The application of thesemodels includes twelve flood influencing factorswith 413 current and former flooding points, which were transferred in a GIS environment. The information gain ratio, the multicollinearity diagnostics tests were employed to determine the association between the occurrences and flood influential factors. For the validation and the comparison of these models, for the ability to predict the statistical appraisal measures such as Freidman, Wilcoxon signed-rank, and t-paired tests and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) were employed. The value of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of ROC was above 0.80 for all models. For flood susceptibility modelling, the Dagging model performs superior, followed by RF, the ANN, the SVM, and the RS, then the several benchmark models. The approach and solution-oriented outcomes outlined in this paper will assist state and local authorities as well as policy makers in reducing flood-related threats and will also assist in the implementation of effective mitigation strategies to mitigate future damage.

TI  - An Automatic and Operational Method for Land Cover Change Detection Using Spatiotemporal Analysis of MODIS Data: A Northern Ontario (Canada) Case Study
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and understanding the differences in land cover and land use over time is an essential component of decision-making in sectors such as resource management, urban planning, and forest fire management, as well as in tracking of the impacts of climate change. Existing methods sometimes pose a barrier to the effective monitoring of changes in land cover and land use, since a threshold parameter is often needed and determined based on trial and error. This study aimed to develop an automatic and operational method for change detection on a large scale from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Super pixels were the basic unit of analysis instead of traditional individual pixels. T-2 tests based on the feature vectors of temporal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land surface temperature were used for change detection. The developed method was applied to data over a predominantly vegetated area in northern Ontario, Canada spanning 120,000 sq. km from 2001-2016. The accuracies ranged between 78% and 88% for the NDVI-based test, from 74% to 86% for the LST-based test, and from 70% to 86% for the joint method compared with manual interpretation. Our proposed method for detecting land cover change provides a functional and viable alternative to existing methods of land cover change detection as it is reliable, repeatable, and free from uncertainty in establishing a threshold for change.

TI  - Quantification of Changes in Rice Production for 2003-2019 with MODIS LAI Data in Pursat Province, Cambodia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is not merely a staple food but an important source of income in Cambodia. Rapid socioeconomic development in the country affects farmers' management practices, and rice production has increased almost three-fold over two decades. However, detailed information about the recent changes in rice production is quite limited and mainly obtained from interviews and statistical data. Here, we analyzed MODIS LAI data (MCD152H) from 2003 to 2019 to quantify rice production changes in Pursat Province, one of the great rice-producing areas in Cambodia. Although the LAI showed large variations, the data clearly indicate that a major shift occurred in approximately 2010 after applying smoothing methods (i.e., hierarchical clustering and the moving average). This finding is consistent with the results of the interviews with the farmers, which indicate that earlier-maturing cultivars had been adopted. Geographical variations in the LAI pattern were illustrated at points analyzed along a transverse line from the mountainside to the lakeside. Furthermore, areas of dry season cropping were detected by the difference in monthly averaged MODIS LAI data between January and April, which was defined as the dry season rice index (DSRI) in this study. Consequently, three different types of dry season cropping areas were recognized by nonhierarchical clustering of the annual LAI transition. One of the cropping types involved an irrigation-water-receiving area supported by canal construction. The analysis of the peak LAI in the wet and dry seasons suggested that the increase in rice production was different among cropping types and that the stagnation of the improvements and the limitation of water resources are anticipated. This study provides valuable information about differences and changes in rice cropping to construct sustainable and further-improved rice production strategies.

TI  - Mapping Mature Post-Agricultural Forests in the Polish Eastern Carpathians with Archival Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Post-WWII displacements in the Polish Carpathians resulted in widespread land abandonment. Most of the pre-war agricultural areas are now covered with secondary forests, which will soon reach the felling age. Mapping their exact cover is crucial to investigate succession-regeneration processes and to determine their role in the landscape, before making management decisions. Our goal was to map post-agricultural forests in the Polish Eastern Carpathians using archival remote sensing data, and to assess their connectivity with pre-displacement forests. We used German Flown Aerial Photography from 1944 to map agricultural lands and forests from before displacements, and Corona satellite images to map agricultural lands which converted into the forest as a result of this event. We classified archival images using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and compared the output with the current forest cover derived from Sentinel-2. Our results showed that mature (60-70 years old) post-agricultural forests comprise 27.6% of the total forest area, while younger post-agricultural forests comprise 9%. We also demonstrated that the secondary forests fill forest gaps more often than form isolated patches: 77.5% of patches are connected with the old-woods (forests that most likely have never been cleared for agriculture). Orthorectification and OBIA classification of German Flown Aerial Photographs and Corona satellite images made it possible to accurately determine the spatial extent of post-agricultural forest. This, in turn, paves the way for the implementation of site-specific forest management practices to support the regeneration of secondary forests and their biodiversity.

TI  - Surface Runoff Responses to Suburban Growth: An Integration of Remote Sensing, GIS, and Curve Number
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Suburban growth and its impacts on surface runoff were investigated using the soil conservation service curve number (SCS-CN) model, compared with the integrated advanced remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS)-based integrated approach, over South Kingston, Rhode Island, USA. This study analyzed and employed the supervised classification method on four Landsat images from 1994, 2004, 2014, and 2020 to detect land-use pattern changes through remote sensing applications. Results showed that 68.6% urban land expansion was reported from 1994 to 2020 in this suburban area. After land-use change detection, a GIS-based SCS-CN model was developed to examine suburban growth and surface runoff estimation. The developed model demonstrated the spatial distribution of runoff for each of the studied years. The results showed an increasing spatial pattern of 2% to 10% of runoff from 1994 to 2020. The correlation between runoff co-efficient and rainfall indicated the significant impact of suburban growth in surface runoff over the last 36 years in South Kingstown, RI, USA, showing a slight change of forest (8.2% area of the total area) and agricultural land (4.8% area of the total area). Suburban growth began after 2000, and within 16 years this land-use change started to show its substantial impact on surface runoff. We concluded that the proposed integrated approach could classify land-use and land cover information to understand suburban growth and its potential impact on the area.

TI  - Using Satellite-Based Vegetation Data for Short-Term Grazing Monitoring to Inform Adaptive Management
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying rangeland vegetation amounts with remotely sensed satellite data is a proliferating field of study. Yet the resulting datasets are rarely related to use-based monitoring indicators (i.e., utilization or residual biomass), which are critical for adaptive management and to inform the subsequent year's grazing plans. To better assess our ability to use remotely sensed data products for grazing monitoring and adaptive management, we tested the relationships between a variety of vegetation biomass metrics derived from remotely sensed data on a bunchgrass-dominated grassland in northeast Oregon and two common indicators: stocking rate at the pasture scale (40-250 ha; a management indicator) and field-based utilization estimates at the plot scale (25-50 m; a grazing indicator). At the pasture scale, we correlated stocking rate to biomass metrics and found two metrics that had consistent relationships to stocking rate: fall mean biomass (r values range: -0.52 to -0.56; P values < 0.001) and the 10th percentile of the relative difference between summer and fall biomass (r values range: -0.47 to -0.52; P values < 0.01). Scatterplots from these correlations were then evaluated alongside managers' knowledge to interpret why some pastures deviated from the overall pattern. At the plot scale, we correlated infield utilization estimates to biomass metrics and found consistent relationships with fall mean biomass (r values range: -0.32 to -0.47; P values < 0.001) and the relative difference between summer and fall biomass (r value: from -0.20 to -0.62; P values < 0.005). To further visualize the utilization correlations, we classified these two biomass maps into three categories guided by our utilization estimates. Significant changes in biomass due to management and interannual variation in biomass amounts stood out. The results and visualizations demonstrate how remotely sensed data relate to conventional grazing monitoring indicators and exemplify how remotely sensed data can be used to inform adaptive management.

TI  - Axillary Ultrasound as Preoperative Staging in Clinical Negative Axillary Lymph Node Breast Cancer Patient
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL & HEALTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of axillary US as a preoperative investigation by comparing it with the histology outcome of nodal status.Methods: This validation analysis was conducted in Mater Misericordia university hospital, Dublin Ireland form Feb 2007 to Feb 2015. All female patients with impalpable axillary lymph node and histology proven unifocal breast cancer between ages 18 to 75 years were included. Patients with the diagnosis of breast cancer were followed with Ultrasound imaging and results in Picture Archiving and communication system (PACS) and histology was confirmed using the patient center data base in both preoperative and postoperative course of breast cancer, including both sentinel lymph nodes and axillary lymph nodes.Results: A total of 625 patients had axillary ultrasound (US) to assess the preoperative axillary nodal status with mean age of 56 +/- 12 years. cN0 was diagnosed in 469 (75%) cases, cN1 in 136 (21.8%) cases and cN2 in 20 (3.2%) cases. After negative axillary ultrasound cN0 pathology shows positive pN2 and pN3 disease in 14 (2.9%) cases with the NPV of 97.01%. Axillary ultrasound had shown cN1 disease in 136 cases with the pathology outcome of pN2 and pN3 in 41 (30.14%) cases with the negative predictive value (NPV) of 69.85%. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the axillary US in detection of the positive node was 51.6% and 92.8% with PPV of 82.69% and NPV of 74.2%.Conclusion: Axillary US is a useful modality for screening of breast cancer patients. The negative US findings exclude the presence of advanced nodal disease. However, it cannot accurate distinguish between pN1 and pN2 or pN3 nodal disease.

TI  - Enhancement of Ship Type Classification from a Combination of CNN and KNN
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship type classification of synthetic aperture radar imagery with convolution neural network (CNN) has been faced with insufficient labeled datasets, unoptimized and noised polarization images that can deteriorate a classification performance. Meanwhile, numerous labeled text information for ships, such as length and breadth, can be easily obtained from various sources and can be utilized in a classification with k-nearest neighbor (KNN). This study proposes a method to improve the efficiency of ship type classification from Sentinel-1 dual-polarization data with 10 m pixel spacing using both CNN and KNN models. In the first stage, Sentinel-1 intensity images centered on ship positions were used in a rectangular shape to apply an image processing procedure such as head-up, padding and image augmentation. The process increased the accuracy by 33.0% and 31.7% for VH (vertical transmit and horizontal receive) and VV (vertical transmit and vertical receive) polarization compared to the CNN-based classification with original ship images, respectively. In the second step, a combined method of CNN and KNN was compared with a CNN-alone case. The f1-score of CNN alone was up to 85.0%, whereas the combination method showed up to 94.3%, which was a 9.3% increase. In the future, more details on an optimization method will be investigated through field experiments of ship classification.

TI  - Assessment of Tropospheric Concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub> from the TROPOMI/Sentinel-5 Precursor for the Estimation of Long-term Exposure to Surface NO<sub>2</sub> over South Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since April 2018, the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) has provided data on tropospheric NO2 column concentrations (C-TROPOMI) with unprecedented spatial resolution. This study aims to assess the capability of TROPOMI to acquire high spatial resolution data regarding surface NO2 mixing ratios. In general, the instrument effectively detected major and moderate sources of NO2 over South Korea with a clear weekday-weekend distinction. We compared the C-TROPOMI with surface NO2 mixing ratio measurements from an extensive ground-based network over South Korea operated by the Korean Ministry of Environment (S-KME; more than 570 sites), for 2019. Spatiotemporally collocated C-TROPOMI and S-KME showed a moderate correlation (correlation coefficient, r = 0.67), whereas their annual mean values at each site showed a higher correlation (r = 0.84). The C-TROPOMI and S-KME were well correlated around the Seoul metropolitan area, where significant amounts of NO2 prevailed throughout the year, whereas they showed lower correlation at rural sites. We converted the tropospheric NO2 from TROPOMI to the surface mixing ratio (S-TROPOMI) using the EAC4 (ECMWF Atmospheric Composition Reanalysis 4) profile shape, for quantitative comparison with the S-KME. The estimated S-TROPOMI generally underestimated the in-situ value obtained, S-KME (slope = 0.64), as reported in previous studies.

TI  - A New Algorithm for Monitoring Backflow from River to Lake (BRL) Using Satellite Images: A Case of Poyang Lake, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Backflow from river to lake (BRL) usually happens in inland lakes and affects water exchange, matter migration, and variations in the water quality and eco-environment. However, at present, discharge data derived from hydrological stations are the only way to monitor BRL, and the influence scope of BRL has not been monitored through hydrological stations. To address this problem, we propose a novel algorithm to monitor BRL using satellite images of Poyang Lake (the largest freshwater lake in China). The following results were obtained: (1) According to the difference in suspended sediment from rivers and lakes, an algorithm using the total suspended sediment (TSS), which was used as a tracer, was designed for monitoring BRL in Poyang Lake. (2) An innovative extraction method for the mutation line using the TSS was developed to analyze BRL via satellite images. A gradient variation method was developed to extract the mutation line accurately. (3) The satellites with daily acquisition or higher-frequency resolution images (e.g., Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) were satisfactory for monitoring the characteristics of BRL. The MODIS-derived band combination R-rs(645) - R-rs(859))/(R-rs(555) - R-rs(859) yielded a higher fitting accuracy (R-2 = 0.858, RMSE = 10.25 mg/L) derived from an exponential model, which was helpful to highlighting the mutation line. (4) The important parameters of BRL, such as the beginning time, the duration, the end time, and the influence scope, were quantitatively determined by judging the movement of the mutation line. This algorithm was applied to quickly and effectively extract the information of two instances of BRL in Poyang Lake in July 2000 and July to August 2007, and the results were accurate and reasonable. This algorithm can save a great deal on monitoring costs. A BRL monitoring algorithm using remote sensing is an efficient government measure supplement to address the limitations of hydrological stations. These results provide technological support for lake management and can serve as a valuable reference for water bodies similar to Poyang Lake worldwide.

TI  - High-Speed Lightweight Ship Detection Algorithm Based on YOLO-V4 for Three-Channels RGB SAR Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has become one of the important technical means of marine monitoring in the field of remote sensing due to its all-day, all-weather advantage. National territorial waters to achieve ship monitoring is conducive to national maritime law enforcement, implementation of maritime traffic control, and maintenance of national maritime security, so ship detection has been a hot spot and focus of research. After the development from traditional detection methods to deep learning combined methods, most of the research always based on the evolving Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) computing power to propose more complex and computationally intensive strategies, while in the process of transplanting optical image detection ignored the low signal-to-noise ratio, low resolution, single-channel and other characteristics brought by the SAR image imaging principle. Constantly pursuing detection accuracy while ignoring the detection speed and the ultimate application of the algorithm, almost all algorithms rely on powerful clustered desktop GPUs, which cannot be implemented on the frontline of marine monitoring to cope with the changing realities. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-channel fusion SAR image processing method that makes full use of image information and the network's ability to extract features; it is also based on the latest You Only Look Once version 4 (YOLO-V4) deep learning framework for modeling architecture and training models. The YOLO-V4-light network was tailored for real-time and implementation, significantly reducing the model size, detection time, number of computational parameters, and memory consumption, and refining the network for three-channel images to compensate for the loss of accuracy due to light-weighting. The test experiments were completed entirely on a portable computer and achieved an Average Precision (AP) of 90.37% on the SAR Ship Detection Dataset (SSDD), simplifying the model while ensuring a lead over most existing methods. The YOLO-V4-lightship detection algorithm proposed in this paper has great practical application in maritime safety monitoring and emergency rescue.

TI  - Improvements in Cloud and Water Vapor Simulations Over the Tropical Oceans in CMIP6 Compared to CMIP5
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds and water vapor are among the most difficult quantities for global climate models to simulate because they are affected by physical processes that operate over scales unresolved by current climate models. We use NASA satellite data to assess the representation of clouds and water vapor structures in 28 climate models that participate in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Each model is assigned numerical scores based on its performance in simulating spatial mean, variance and pattern correlation of multi-year mean clouds and water vapor structures in lower, middle, upper troposphere, and near the tropopause over tropical oceans. We find measurable improvements in CMIP6 models relative to CMIP5 models for both clouds and water vapor. The differences between models and satellite observations and the spread across the models are reduced. In addition, we find that the models' equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is correlated with overall performance scores for both CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, with a weaker correlation in CMIP6, suggesting that the models that capture better tropical clouds and water vapor distributions tend to have higher ECS. The physical processes responsible for the apparent correlation between ECS and model performance score warrant further study.

TI  - Natural and Political Determinants of Ecological Vulnerability in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau: A Case Study of Shannan, China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Changing land-use patterns in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) due to natural factors and human interference have led to higher ecological vulnerability and even more underlying issues related to time and space in this alpine area. Ecological vulnerability assessment provides not only a solution to surface-feature-related problems but also insight into sustainable eco-environmental planning and resource management as a response to potential climate changes if driving factors are known. In this study, the ecological vulnerability index (EVI) of Shannan City in the core area of the QTP was assessed using a selected set of ecological, social, and economic indicators and spatial principal component analysis (SPCA) to calculate their weights. The data included Landsat images and socio-economic data from 1990 to 2015, at five-year intervals. The results showed that the total EVI remains at a medium vulnerability level, with minor fluctuations over 25 years (peaks in 2000, when there was a sudden increase in slight vulnerability, which switched to extreme vulnerability), and gradually increases from east to west. In addition, spatial analysis showed a distinct positive correlation between the EVI and land-use degree, livestock husbandry output, desertification area, and grassland area. The artificial afforestation program (AAP) has a positive effect by preventing the environment from becoming more vulnerable. The results provide practical information and suggestions for planners to take measures to improve the land-use degree in urban and pastoral areas in the QTP based on spatial-temporal heterogeneity patterns of the EVI of Shannan City.

TI  - Augmenting the spatial resolution of climate-change temperature projections for city planners and local decision makers
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Before the 2010, studies in climate change (CC) projections embracing scales below 3 degrees were difficult to find. This has changed dramatically over the past ten years, with literature addressing high resolution grids for climate studies, allowing a better understanding and forecasting of CC at finer scales. However, downscaling methods remain poorly explored in urban planning. Research shows that the main difficulties relate to mismatches between data needs and data availability, terminology, constraints of information technology and maps that inform spatial planning decision-making processes. Based on dynamic downscaled maps for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 at 10 km resolution published by Ecuador's Ministry of Environment and Water (MAAE), we develop a method for augmenting the resolution scale at 30 m. We use digital elevation models and Landsat 4/5/7/8 satellite imagery for land surface temperature (LST) and present a series of steps and equations before applying Stefan Bolzman's law. We present the necessary equations between the filling-in of LST outliers, and their projection onto air temperature at 2 m height, taking surface emissivity estimates based on (Alves et al 2017 J. Hyperspectral Remote Sens. 7 91-100). We extrapolate the resulting air temperature in time with Fourier's series, and for the purpose of coherence among scales, we upscale air temperature maps at 30 m to those at 10 km resolution. The resulting CC projection maps are validated with the temporal series of air temperature (max, min, mean) from the meteorological station in the Ecuadorian city of Portoviejo (Student's t-test) for the period between 1981 and 2005, with Portoviejo city facing temperature increases of up to 2 degrees C under RCP 4.5 scenario in the period 2011-2040 vs 1981-2005. The final CC maps have an augmented resolution of 30 m, are compatible with those of MAAE, and offer a low-cost procedure for informing land-use and urban planners, as well as local development decision makers, of temperature anomalies due to climate change.

TI  - Temperature Response to Changes in Vegetation Fraction Cover in a Regional Climate Model
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation plays a key role in partitioning energy at the surface. Meteorological and Climate Models, both global and regional, implement vegetation using two parameters, the vegetation fraction and the leaf area index, obtained from satellite data. In most cases, models use average values for a given period. However, the vegetation is subject to strong inter-annual variability. In this work, the sensitivity of the near surface air temperature to changes in the vegetation is analyzed using a regional climate model (RCM) over the Iberian Peninsula. The experiments have been designed in a way that facilitates the physical interpretation of the results. Results show that the temperature sensitivity to vegetation depends on the time of year and the time of day. Minimum temperatures are always lower when vegetation is increased; this is due to the lower availability of heat in the ground due to the reduction of thermal conductivity. Regarding maximum temperatures, the role of increasing vegetation depends on the available moisture in the soil. In the case of hydric stress, the maximum temperatures increase, and otherwise decrease. In general, increasing vegetation will lead to a higher daily temperature range, since the decrease in minimum temperature is always greater than the decrease for maximum temperature. These results show the importance of having a good estimate of the vegetation parameters as well as the implications that vegetation changes due to natural or anthropogenic causes might have in regional climate for present and climate change projections.

TI  - Sequence Image Datasets Construction via Deep Convolution Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing time-series datasets are significant for global change research and a better understanding of the Earth. However, remote-sensing acquisitions often provide sparse time series due to sensor resolution limitations and environmental factors such as cloud noise for optical data. Image transformation is the method that is often used to deal with this issue. This paper considers the deep convolution networks to learn the complex mapping between sequence images, called adaptive filter generation network (AdaFG), convolution long short-term memory network (CLSTM), and cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CyGAN) for construction of sequence image datasets. AdaFG network uses a separable 1D convolution kernel instead of 2D kernels to capture the spatial characteristics of input sequence images and then is trained end-to-end using sequence images. CLSTM network can map between different images using the state information of multiple time-series images. CyGAN network can map an image from a source domain to a target domain without additional information. Our experiments, which were performed with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Landsat-8 datasets, show that the deep convolution networks are effective to produce high-quality time-series image datasets, and the data-driven deep convolution networks can better simulate complex and diverse nonlinear data information.

TI  - Plants versus streams: Their groundwater-mediated competition at "El Morro," a developing catchment in the dry plains of Argentina
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Our understanding of how groundwater mediates evapotranspiration/streamflow partitioning is still fragmented and catchment studies under changing vegetation conditions can provide a useful frame for integration. We explored this partition in a flat sedimentary dry catchment in central Argentina in which the replacement of native vegetation with rainfed crops was accompanied by the abrupt formation of groundwater-fed streams by subsurface erosion (i.e., sapping) episodes. Historical records indicated widespread water table rises (similar to 0.3 m y(-1) on average). Ground-water level and stream baseflow fluctuated seasonally with minima in the warm rainy season, indicating that evaporative discharge rather than rainfall shapes saturated flows. Diurnal groundwater level fluctuations showed that plant uptake was widespread where water tables are shallow (<3 m) but restricted to deep-rooted Prosopis forests where they are deep (7-10 m). MODIS and LANDSAT NDVI revealed a long-term greening for native vegetation, new wetlands included, but not for croplands, suggesting more limited evapotranspiration-groundwater level regulation under agriculture. Close to the deepest (20 m) and most active incisions, groundwater level and greenness declined and stream baseflow showed no seasonal fluctuations, hinting decoupling from evapotranspiration. Intense ecological and geomorphological transformations in this catchment exposed the interplay of five mechanisms governing evapotranspiration/streamflow partition including (a) unsaturated uptake and both (b) riparian and (c) distributed uptake from the saturated zone by plants, as well as (d) deepening incisions and (e) sediment deposits over riparian zones by streams. Acknowledging the complex interplay of these mechanisms with groundwater is crucial to predict and manage future hydrological changes in the dry plains of South America.

TI  - Global Soil Moisture Retrievals From the Chinese FY-3D Microwave Radiation Imager
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The FengYun-3 (FY-3) series satellite is the second generation of Chinese polar-orbiting meteorological satellite missions. The FY-3D satellite was launched on November 2017 and has been providing valuable data for meteorological applications, including brightness temperature (T-B) data from the MicroWave Radiation Imager (MWRI). In this study, we developed a global soil moisture retrieval algorithm, based on the radiative transfer equation (RTE) for using the FY-3D MWRI T-B to continue the soil moisture record from FY-3 satellites. We adopted a new empirical model to compute vegetation water content (VWC) based on the leaf area index (LAI) and canopy height (H) for vegetation effects correction. The Q(p) model, which addresses the soil surface roughness effects using dual-polarization information, is then used for soil moisture retrieval. Validation of the FY-3D soil moisture was conducted with the in-situ data and the validation results showed encouraging accuracy over a variety of landcovers, with bias and unbiased root-mean-squared difference (ubRMSE) at or below the level of 0.06 m(3) . m(-3). Monthly averaged soil moisture products generated from FY-3D could represent the seasonal changes in soil moisture and show reasonable spatial distribution of soil moisture at a global scale.

TI  - Spaceborne Estimation of Leaf Area Index in Cotton, Tomato, and Wheat Using Sentinel-2
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is a useful tool for estimating crop variables, particularly Leaf Area Index (LAI), which plays a pivotal role in monitoring crop development. The goal of this study was to identify the optimal Sentinel-2 bands for LAI estimation and to derive Vegetation Indices (VI) that are well correlated with LAI. Linear regression models between time series of Sentinel-2 imagery and field-measured LAI showed that Sentinel-2 Band-8A-Narrow Near InfraRed (NIR) is more accurate for LAI estimation than the traditionally used Band-8 (NIR). Band-5 (Red edge-1) showed the lowest performance out of all red edge bands in tomato and cotton. A novel finding was that Band 9 (Water vapor) showed a very high correlation with LAI. Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, and 12 were saturated at LAI approximate to 3 in cotton and tomato. Bands 6, 7, 8, 8A, and 9 were not saturated at high LAI values in cotton and tomato. The tomato, cotton, and wheat LAI estimation performance of ReNDVI (R-2 = 0.79, 0.98, 0.83, respectively) and two new VIs (WEVI (Water vapor red Edge Vegetation Index) (R-2 = 0.81, 0.96, 0.71, respectively) and WNEVI (Water vapor narrow NIR red Edge Vegetation index) (R-2 = 0.79, 0.98, 0.79, respectively)) were higher than the LAI estimation performance of the commonly used NDVI (R-2 = 0.66, 0.83, 0.05, respectively) and other common VIs tested in this study. Consequently, reNDVI, WEVI, and WNEVI can facilitate more accurate agricultural monitoring than traditional VIs.

TI  - Closed Torey Lakes: Is It Possible to Predict Changes in Hydrological Regime?
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A model of the water balance of Torey Lakes is proposed. The model is based on the integration of satellite data for 1989-2020 and ground-based observation data for the period of 1965-2018. The analysis of long-term changes in the water level in the lakes revealed its cyclicity. A possible change in the level of Torey Lakes is estimated taking into account the impact of the construction of a hydraulic structure on the transboundary Ul'dza River. Variants of the planned development of water use in the Mongolian part of the catchment area in the form of the water inflow reduction by 10 and 20% are considered. The water balance model is used to demonstrate a possible negative impact of inflow variations on the hydrological regime of the lakes.

TI  - A Robust Atmospheric Correction Procedure for Determination of Spectral Reflectance of Terrestrial Surfaces from Satellite Spectral Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we propose simple and robust technique for the retrieval of underlying surface spectral reflectance using spaceborne observations. It can be used to process both multispectral moderate resolution satellite data and also multi-zone high spatial resolution data. The technique can work automatically for different types of land surfaces without using huge databases accumulated in advance. The new cloud discrimination and retrieval of the water vapor content in atmosphere procedures are presented. The key point of the proposed atmospheric correction technique is the suggested single-wavelength method for determining the atmospheric aerosol optical thickness without reference to a specific type of underlying surface spectrum. The retrievals of spectral reflectance for various land surfaces with developed technique, performed using computer simulation and experimental data, have demonstrated a high retrieval accuracy.

TI  - Soil moisture change analysis under watershed management practice using in situ and remote sensing data in a paired watershed
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture, vegetation cover, and land surface temperature are vital variables in water-energy balance, eco-hydrological processes, and water resources management, which can be influenced by watershed management activities. This research focused on the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture, vegetation cover, land surface temperature, and Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) under a biological watershed management practice in the Taleghan paired watershed, namely, treated (TW) and control watersheds (CW), in Alborz province, Iran. In this research, along with the remote sensing techniques, the soil moisture and vegetation cover data were measured and statistically analyzed in the three aspects of both TW and CW during a growth period from May to October 2017. The results indicated that soil moisture, vegetation cover, and land surface temperature values in the paired watershed were significantly different at the 0.01 level during the study period. The increased vegetation cover in the TW had an inverse effect on the land surface temperature and TVDI, while directly impacted the soil moisture content. The average TVDI in the CW was 0.83, while this index was found to be 0.69 in the TW. Unlike the vegetation cover and soil moisture, the results revealed that the southern aspects had the highest TVDI and land surface temperature compared to the northern and eastern aspects of both watersheds. However, the increased vegetation cover as a biological watershed management activity in the steep terrain and mountainous areas of TW led to an increased soil moisture and a decreased land surface temperature and soil dryness. As a result, decreasing soil dryness in the TW can exert vital controls on the water resources and increasing water availability. In the arid and semiarid countries such as Iran, a proper watershed management activity can effectively increase soil moisture and water availability in the watersheds. In particular, the vegetation cover protection and biological practices can be considered as practical solutions in the rehabilitation of exhausted watersheds in arid and semiarid environments.

TI  - Sea Ice Classification of SAR Imagery Based on Convolution Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We explore new and existing convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for sea ice classification using Sentinel-1 (S1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data by investigating two key challenges: binary sea ice versus open-water classification, and a multi-class sea ice type classification. The analysis of sea ice in SAR images is challenging because of the thermal noise effects and ambiguities in the radar backscatter for certain conditions that include the reflection of complex information from sea ice surfaces. We use manually annotated SAR images containing various sea ice types to construct a dataset for our Deep Learning (DL) analysis. To avoid contamination between classes we use a combination of near-simultaneous SAR images from S1 and fine resolution cloud-free optical data from Sentinel-2 (S2). For the classification, we use data augmentation to adjust for the imbalance of sea ice type classes in the training data. The SAR images are divided into small patches which are processed one at a time. We demonstrate that the combination of data augmentation and training of a proposed modified Visual Geometric Group 16-layer (VGG-16) network, trained from scratch, significantly improves the classification performance, compared to the original VGG-16 model and an ad hoc CNN model. The experimental results show both qualitatively and quantitatively that our models produce accurate classification results.

TI  - Monitoring Subsidence in Urban Area by PSInSAR: A Case Study of Abbottabad City, Northern Pakistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, major cities are experiencing fast settlement growth, which threatens the equilibrium of socio-ecosystems. In Pakistan, Abbottabad city in particular is experiencing fast urban growth. The main source of daily water usage for the population in these types of cities is groundwater (tube-wells). Excessive pumping and the high need for ground water for the local community are affecting the subsurface sustainability. In this study, the persistent scatterer interferometry synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR) technique with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired from the Sentinel-1 were used to monitor ground subsidence in Abbottabad City, Northern Pakistan. To estimate the ground subsidence in Abbottabad City, SARPROZ software was employed to process a series of Sentinel-1 images, acquired from March 2017 to September 2019, along both descending and ascending orbit tracks. The subsidence observed in the results shows a significant increase from 2017 to 2019. The subsidence map shows that, during 2017, the subsidence was -30 mm/year and about -85 mm/year in 2018. While during 2019, the subsidence reached -150 mm/year. Thus, it has seen that, in the study area, the subsidence during these years increased with mean subsidence 60 mm/year. The overall trend of subsidence showed considerably high values in the center of the city, while areas away from the center of the city experienced low subsidence. Overall, the adopted methodology can be used successfully for detecting, mapping, and monitoring land surfaces vulnerable to subsidence. This will facilitate efficient planning, designing of surface infrastructure, and mitigation management of subsidence-induced hazards.

TI  - Phenological Changes of Mongolian Oak Depending on the Micro-Climate Changes Due to Urbanization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization and the resulting increase in development areas and populations cause micro-climate changes such as the urban heat island (UHI) effect. This micro-climate change can affect vegetation phenology. It can advance leaf unfolding and flowering and delay the timing of fallen leaves. This study was carried out to clarify the impact of urbanization on the leaf unfolding of Mongolian oak. The survey sites for this study were established in the urban center (Mts. Nam, Mido, and Umyeon in Seoul), suburbs (Mts. Cheonggye and Buram in Seoul), a rural area (Gwangneung, Mt. Sori in Gyeonggi-do), and a natural area (Mt. Jeombong in Gangwon-do). Green-up dates derived from the analyses of digital camera images and MODIS satellite images were the earliest in the urban center and delayed through the suburbs and rural area to the natural area. The difference in the observed green-up date compared to the expected one, which was determined by regarding the Mt. Jeombong site located in the natural area as the reference site, was the biggest in the urban center and decreased through the suburbs and rural area to the natural area. Green-up dates in the rural area, suburbs, and urban center were earlier by 11.0, 14.5, and 16.3 days than the expected ones. If these results are transformed into the air temperature based on previous research results, it could be deduced that the air temperature in the urban center, suburbs, and rural area rose by 3.8 to 4.6 degrees C, 3.3 to 4.1 degrees C, and 2.5 to 3.1 degrees C, respectively. Green-up dates derived based on the accumulated growing degree days (AGDD) showed the same trend as those derived from the image interpretation. Green-up dates derived from the change in sap flow as a physiological response of the plant showed a difference within one day from the green-up dates derived from digital camera and MODIS satellite image analyses. The change trajectory of the curvature K value derived from the sap flow also showed a very similar trend to that of the curvature K value derived from the vegetation phenology. From these results, we confirm the availability of AGDD and sap flow as tools predicting changes in ecosystems due to climate change including phenology. Meanwhile, the green-up dates in survey sites were advanced in proportion to the land use intensity of each survey site. Green-up dates derived based on AGDD were also negatively correlated with the land use intensity of the survey site. This result implies that differences in green-up dates among the survey sites and between the expected and observed green-up dates in the urban center, suburbs, and rural area were due to the increased temperature due to land use in the survey sites. Based on these results, we propose conservation and restoration of nature as measures to reduce the impact of climate change.

TI  - Comparison of Accuracy of Surface Temperature Images from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and Satellite for Precise Thermal Environment Monitoring of Urban Parks Using In Situ Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has led to several severe environmental problems, including so-called heat island effects, which can be mitigated by creating more urban green spaces. However, the temperature of various surfaces differs and precise measurement and analyses are required to determine the "coolest" of these. Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy of surface temperature data based on thermal infrared (TIR) cameras mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which have recently been utilized for the spatial analysis of surface temperatures. Accordingly, we investigated land surface temperatures (LSTs) in green spaces, specifically those of different land cover types in an urban park in Korea. We compared and analyzed LST data generated by a thermal infrared (TIR) camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and LST data from the Landsat 8 satellite for seven specific periods. For comparison and evaluation, we measured in situ LSTs using contact thermometers. The UAV TIR LST showed higher accuracy (R-2 0.912, root mean square error (RMSE) 3.502 degrees C) than Landsat TIR LST accuracy (R-2 value lower than 0.3 and RMSE of 7.246 degrees C) in all periods. The Landsat TIR LST did not show distinct LST characteristics by period and land cover type; however, grassland, the largest land cover type in the study area, showed the highest accuracy. With regard to the accuracy of the UAV TIR LST by season, the accuracy was higher in summer and spring (R2 0.868-0.915, RMSE 2.523-3.499 degrees C) than in autumn and winter (R-2 0.766-0.79, RMSE 3.834-5.398 degrees C). Some land cover types (concrete bike path, wooden deck) were overestimated, showing relatively high total RMSEs of 4.439 degrees C and 3.897 degrees C, respectively, whereas grassland, which has lower LST, was underestimated-showing a total RMSE of 3.316 degrees C. Our results showed that the UAV TIR LST could be measured with sufficient reliability for each season and land cover type in an urban park with complex land cover types. Accordingly, our results could contribute to decision-making for urban spaces and environmental planning in consideration of the thermal environment.

TI  - Recent Developments of ICG-Guided Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Oral Cancer
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has gained attention as a method of minimizing the extent of neck dissection with a similar survival rate as elective neck dissection in oral cancer. Indocyanine green (ICG) imaging is widely used in the field of surgical oncology. Real-time ICG-guided SLN imaging has been widely used in minimally invasive surgeries for various types of cancers. Here, we provide an overview of conventional SLN biopsy and ICG-guided SLN mapping techniques for oral cancer. Although ICG has many strengths, it still has limitations regarding its potential use as an ideal compound for SLN mapping. The development of novel fluorophores and imaging technology is needed for accurate identification of SLNs, which will allow precision surgery that would reduce morbidities and increase patient survival.

TI  - Genome-Wide Identification of Candidate Genes for Milk Production Traits in Korean Holstein Cattle
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryMilk production traits that are economically important in the dairy industry have been considered the main selection criteria for breeding. The present genome-wide association study was performed to identify chromosomal loci and candidate genes with potential effects on milk production phenotypes in a Korean Holstein population. A total of eight significant quantitative trait locus regions were identified for milk yield (Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 7 and 14), adjusted 305-d fat yield (BTA 3, 5, and 14), adjusted 305-d protein yield (BTA 8), and somatic cell score (BTA 8 and 23) of milk production traits. Furthermore, we discovered three main candidate genes (diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B), and anoctamin 2 (ANO2)) through bioinformatics analysis. These genes may help to understand better the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms for milk production phenotypes in the Korean Holstein population.We performed a genome-wide association study and fine mapping using two methods (single marker regression: frequentist approach and Bayesian C (BayesC): fitting selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a Bayesian framework) through three high-density SNP chip platforms to analyze milk production phenotypes in Korean Holstein cattle (n = 2780). We identified four significant SNPs for each phenotype in the single marker regression model: AX-311625843 and AX-115099068 on Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 14 for milk yield (MY) and adjusted 305-d fat yield (FY), respectively, AX-428357234 on BTA 18 for adjusted 305-d protein yield (PY), and AX-185120896 on BTA 5 for somatic cell score (SCS). Using the BayesC model, we discovered significant 1-Mb window regions that harbored over 0.5% of the additive genetic variance effects for four milk production phenotypes. The concordant significant SNPs and 1-Mb window regions were characterized into quantitative trait loci (QTL). Among the QTL regions, we focused on a well-known gene (diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1)) and newly identified genes (phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B), and anoctamin 2 (ANO2)) for MY and FY, and observed that DGAT1 is involved in glycerolipid metabolism, fat digestion and absorption, metabolic pathways, and retinol metabolism, and PDE4B is involved in cAMP signaling. Our findings suggest that the candidate genes in QTL are strongly related to physiological mechanisms related to the fat production and consequent total MY in Korean Holstein cattle.

TI  - Rain Area Detection in South-Western Kenya by Using Multispectral Satellite Data from Meteosat Second Generation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a rain area detection scheme that uses a gradient based adaptive technique for daytime and nighttime rain area detection and correction from reflectance and infrared (IR) brightness temperatures data of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite. First, multiple parametric rain detection models developed from MSG's reflectance and IR data were calibrated and validated with rainfall data from a dense network of rain gauge stations and investigated to determine the best model parameters. The models were based on a conceptual assumption that clouds characterised by the top properties, e.g., high optical thickness and effective radius, have high rain probabilities and intensities. Next, a gradient based adaptive correction technique that relies on rain area-specific parameters was developed to reduce the number and sizes of the detected rain areas. The daytime detection with optical (VIS0.6) and near IR (NIR1.6) reflectance data achieved the best detection skill. For nighttime, detection with thermal IR brightness temperature differences of IR3.9-IR10.8, IR3.9-WV73 and IR108-WV62 showed the best detection skill based on general categorical statistics. Compared to the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Integrated Mult-isatellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) and the gauge station data from the southwest of Kenya, the model showed good agreement in the spatial dynamics of the detected rain area and rain rate.

TI  - Weaning Away from Idolatry: Maimonides on the Purpose of Ritual Sacrifices
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay explores Maimonides' explanation of the Bible's rationale behind the ritual sacrifices, namely to help wean the Jews away from idolatrous rites. After clearly elucidating Maimonides' stance on the topic, this essay examines his view from different angles with various possible precedents in earlier rabbinic literature for such an understanding. The essay also shows why various other Jewish commentators objected to Maimonides' understanding and how Maimonides might respond to those critiques. Additionally, this essay also situates Maimonides' view on sacrifices within his broader worldview of the Bible's commandments in general as serving as a counterweight to idolatrous rituals.

TI  - The Coral Reef Sentinels Program: A Mars Shot for Blue Planetary Health
T2  - MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Up to 90% of global coral reefs are predicted to be severely degraded by 2050 under "business-as-usual" scenarios. To meet the scale and scope of this challenge, we propose designing and demonstrating a multi-modal system that can incorporate data from remote sensing (satellites, aircraft, and aerial drones), acoustics, genetics, sensor arrays, and low-cost imaging systems. The latter will be collected by low-cost smart sensing and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) guided by adaptive sampling modeling software and rapidly analyzed using automated machine learning systems. Development and deployment will be linked to extensive and diversity-enhancing training programs. The Coral Sentinel System will be globally deployed to enable rapid-response adaptive management and to build public engagement in conservation interventions to save coral reefs.Phase 1 (Year 1) will involve testing assumptions, coalition building, fundraising, and initial system development. Phase 2 (Years 2-4) will focus on engineering and development with a pilot deployment in the Caribbean. Phase 3 (Years 5-6) will involve system expansion and iteration along the Tropical Eastern Pacific corridor. Phase 4 (Years 7-10) will involve global deployment to over 50 reef sites. This will lead during the following decade (Phase 5) to provisioning of low-cost Sentinel systems to coastal communities globally.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Influence of Land Use/Land Cover Change Dynamics on Surface Urban Heat Island: A Case Study of Abuja Metropolis, Nigeria
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization in cities and urban centers has recently contributed to notable land use/land cover (LULC) changes, affecting both the climate and environment. Therefore, this study seeks to analyze changes in LULC and its spatiotemporal influence on the surface urban heat islands (UHI) in Abuja metropolis, Nigeria. To achieve this, we employed Multi-temporal Landsat data to monitor the study area's LULC pattern and land surface temperature (LST) over the last 29 years. The study then analyzed the relationship between LULC, LST, and other vital spectral indices comprising NDVI and NDBI using correlation analysis. The results revealed a significant urban expansion with the transformation of 358.3 sq. km of natural surface into built-up areas. It further showed a considerable increase in the mean LST of Abuja metropolis from 30.65 degrees C in 1990 to 32.69 degrees C in 2019, with a notable increase of 2.53 degrees C between 2009 and 2019. The results also indicated an inverse relationship between LST and NDVI and a positive connection between LST and NDBI. This implies that urban expansion and vegetation decrease influences the development of surface UHI through increased LST. Therefore, the study's findings will significantly help urban-planners and decision-makers implement sustainable land-use strategies and management for the city.

TI  - Monitoring of Vegetation Disturbance around Protected Areas in Central Tanzania Using Landsat Time-Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding vegetation disturbance around protected areas (PAs) is critical as it significantly affects the sustainable conservation of wildlife. However, there is a lack of analyses of consistent long-term data on vegetation disturbance. In this study, the LandTrendr algorithm and Google Earth Engine were used to access satellite data and explore the vegetation dynamics history across the Ruaha-Rungwa landscape, Tanzania. We characterized vegetation disturbance patterns and change attributes, including disturbance occurrence trends, rate, and severity, by using each pixel's normalized burn ratio index time series. Between 2000 and 2019, 36% of the vegetation was significantly disturbed by anthropogenic activities. The results of this study show that the disturbance trends, severity, and patterns are highly variable and strongly depend on the management approaches implemented in the heterogeneous landscape: Ruaha National Park (RNP), Rungwa-Kizigo-Muhesi Game Reserves (RKMGR), and the surrounding zones. The disturbance rates and severity were pronounced and increased toward the edges of the western RKMGR. However, the disturbance in the areas surrounding the RNP was lower. The characterization of the vegetation disturbance over time provides spatial information that is necessary for policy makers, managers, and conservationists to understand the ongoing long-term changes in large PAs.

TI  - Budyko-Based Long-Term Water and Energy Balance Closure in Global Watersheds From Earth Observations
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observations offer potential pathways for accurately closing the water and energy balance of watersheds, a fundamental challenge in hydrology. However, previous attempts based on purely satellite-based estimates have focused on closing the water and energy balances separately. They are hindered by the lack of estimates of key components, such as runoff. Here, we posit a novel approach based on Budyko's water and energy balance constraints. The approach is applied to quantify the degree of long-term closure at the watershed scale, as well as its associated uncertainties, using an ensemble of global satellite data sets. We find large spatial variability across aridity, elevation, and other environmental gradients. Specifically, we find a positive correlation between elevation and closure uncertainty, as derived from the Budyko approach. In mountainous watersheds the uncertainty in closure is 3.9 +/- 0.7 (dimensionless). Our results show that uncertainties in terrestrial evaporation contribute twice as much as precipitation uncertainties to errors in the closure of water and energy balance. Moreover, our results highlight the need for improving satellite-based precipitation and evaporation data in humid temperate forests, where the closure error in the Budyko space is as high as 1.1 +/- 0.3, compared to only 0.2 +/- 0.03 in tropical forests. Comparing the results with land surface model-based data sets driven by in situ precipitation, we find that Earth observation-based data sets perform better in regions where precipitation gauges are sparse. These findings have implications for improving the understanding of global hydrology and regional water management and can guide the development of satellite remote sensing-based data sets and Earth system models.

TI  - Analysis of the Degree of Threat to Railway Infrastructure by Falling Tree Vegetation
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents a method for determining and evaluating the threat to railway infrastructure from falling trees. The main objective was to identify the degree of threat according to three parameters: the height of tree stands, species composition, and vegetation health. Identification of the threat to individual railway sections would allow the creation of measures that could increase operational safety. Evaluation should be carried out at regular intervals to assess vegetation health during certain seasons. We, therefore, recommend the use of satellite images to provide a data source and regular data updates. The potential benefit is a reduction in railway infrastructure damage and an increase in traffic flow, especially during periods of exceptional weather conditions involving high wind, ice or heavy snow. The new method presented in the paper, based on data for railway infrastructure, law and other data sources in the Czech Republic, determines a Vegetation Threat Index for Railways (VTIR). We selected the Liberec Region as an example case study because of its large spread of wooded areas around railway lines and high incidence of railway traffic accidents.

TI  - Effect of Reduced Anthropogenic Activities on Water Quality in Lake Vembanad, India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal Life Below Water (SDG-14) aims to "conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development". Within SDG-14, targets 14.1 and 14.2 deal with marine pollution and the adverse impacts of human activities on aquatic systems. Here, we present a remote-sensing-based analysis of short-term changes in the Vembanad-Kol wetland system in the southwest of India. The region has experienced high levels of anthropogenic pressures, including from agriculture, industry, and tourism, leading to adverse ecological and socioeconomic impacts with consequences not only for achieving the targets set out in SDG-14, but also those related to water quality (SDG-6) and health (SDG-3). To move towards the sustainable management of coastal and aquatic ecosystems such as Lake Vembanad, it is important to understand how both natural and anthropogenic processes affect water quality. In 2020, a unique opportunity arose to study water quality in Lake Vembanad during a period when anthropogenic pressures were reduced due to a nationwide lockdown in response to the global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (25 March-31 May 2020). Using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 multi-spectral remote sensing and in situ observations to analyse changes in five different water quality indicators, we show that water quality improved in large areas of Lake Vembanad during the lockdown in 2020, especially in the more central and southern regions, as evidenced by a decrease in total suspended matter, turbidity, and the absorption by coloured dissolved organic matter, all leading to clearer waters as indicated by the Forel-Ule classification of water colour. Further analysis of longer term trends (2013-2020) showed that water quality has been improving over time in the more northern regions of Lake Vembanad independent of the lockdown. The improvement in water quality during the lockdown in April-May 2020 illustrates the importance of addressing anthropogenic activities for the sustainable management of coastal ecosystems and water resources.

TI  - Assessing the impacts of Amphan cyclone over West Bengal, India: a multi-sensor approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landfall of the Amphan (very severe cyclonic storm) occurred at 1730 hrs Indian Standard Time (IST) on May 20, 2020, near the West Bengal (W.B.) coast of India. High wind speed, storm surge, and torrential rainfall-induced flooding caused devastation in W.B. The present study aims to analyse the impacts of Amphan cyclone on land use/land cover (LULC) such as built-up area, cropland, brick-kiln industries and vegetation cover of nine districts of W.B. namely, Barddhaman, Nadia, North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, Purba Medinipur, Paschim Medinipur, Haora, and Kolkata. Flood extent has been mapped using Sentinel-1A and B interferometric wide swath (IW) ground range detected (GRD) VV polarisation images dated May 22, 2020. The total actual flooded area covers 488 km(2) of the study area. For the pre-cyclone period, LULC classification and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) have been done using Sentinel-2B multispectral instrument (MSI) images dated May 14, 2020. Post-cyclone NDVI has been computed using Sentinel-2B MSI images dated June 3, 2020. Flood-affected cropland covers a large chunk (88.2%) of the total actual flooded area. Mean NDVI values of non-flooded and flooded cropland and vegetation cover have been reduced between May 14, 2020, and June 3, 2020. District, block and pixel-wise changes in pre- and post-cyclone NDVI values have also been analysed. This study helps planners and policy makers to understand the district-wise flooding behavior, severity of damage to cropland and vegetation cover and to plan restriction on high-value land use in flooded low-lying areas.

TI  - Spatially resolved estimates of glacial retreat and lake changes from Gepang Gath Glacier, Chandra Basin, Western Himalaya, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lakes dynamics has a concomitant impact over glacial retreat, mass change and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) events. Recent warming led increase in glacial retreat at High-Mountain Asia (HMA) which has accelerated the formation of moraine-dammed glacial lakes; however, their relative potential for catastrophic events i.e., GLOF, are still a matter of detailed research. In the present study, the changes are assessed at the terminus position, glacier area and associated proglacial lake of Gepang Gath Glacier (GGGL), Chandra basin, western Himalaya, India, using multi-years satellite dataset of Landsat series (TM, ETM+ and OLI, 1989-2017). The results of glacial volume estimations using volume-area scaling method suggests similar to 0.28 km(3) of ice volume loss between 1989 and 2017. The glacier has retreated similar to 846 m with an average rate of 30 m a(-1) and lost similar to 0.73 +/- 0.05 km(2) frontal area from 1989 to 2017. However, the glacier has not shown uniform retreat rate. Between 1989 and 2000 glacier retreat about similar to 14 m a(-1) and the rate was increased gradually to similar to 38 m a(-1) (2000-2009) and similar to 50 m a(-1) (2015-2017). The calculated proglacial lake area has expanded similar to 44 % and estimated equilibrium line altitude (ELA) rise was 54 +/- 12 m, during the study period. The study explains that the continuous expansion of proglacial lake and ice loss can be dangerous to downstream region. It is concluded by underlining the importance of glacier- lake relationships to predict the glacial lake behavior and understand the probability of lake catastrophic events i.e., GLOF and associated hazards.

TI  - Change in sense of food safety associated with social connectedness and information sources-A 10-year longitudinal survey before and after the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: This study analyzes the change in the sense of food safety over time, from 2 years before to 8 years after the Fukushima accident in 2011, and its association with social connectedness using cohort data, taking into account regional differences in Fukushima Prefecture.Study design: Repeated cross-sectional data from Fukushima Prefectural Government from 2009 to 2018 were used.Methods: We randomly selected 1300 people every fiscal year (FY). The survey gathered data on age, gender, occupation, residential region, and the explanatory variables 'sense of social connectedness' and 'recovery-related information source' (information source). The prefecture was divided into three regions for the survey-Hamadori region, where the nuclear power plant is located, Nakadori region, where the air dose rate after the earthquake was high, and in Aizu, far from the nuclear power station but has suffered from harmful rumors.Results: Focusing on FY 2014, when the sense of safety first showed recovery, we performed a binominal logistic regression analysis with 'sense of safety' as the outcome and 'sense of social connectedness' and 'information source' as the explanatory variables. The sense of safety significantly decreased in all regions in 2011 relative to earlier years. The sense of food safety decreased markedly in Hamadori and Nakadori but started to improve 3 years after the earthquake and reached the pre-earthquake level in 2018. The effect sizes were larger in the Hamadori region and in Nakadori than in Aizu. In FY 2014, multivariate analysis found that a sense of food safety was significantly positively associated with a sense of social connectedness, whereas the use of information from newspapers and TV and word of mouth was negatively associated.Conclusion: Although the recovery of a sense of food safety may take some time, a focus on social connectedness during recovery and scrutiny of information sources may facilitate recovery. Health communication has an important role when the provider sends information intelligibly and the recipient can distinguish good news from bad and link it to self-determination. It is necessary to improve literacy. (C) 2021 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A comparative study on the predictive ability of archived and SBAS-InSAR inventories for landslide susceptibility using frequency ratio model in Western Area, Sierra Leone
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides have caused substantial economic loss, infrastructural damage, and threatened lives and human shelter in Western Area, Sierra Leone (Africa), requiring effective mitigations. Landslide susceptibility (LS) mapping is one effective and foremost step in reducing landslide disaster as it provides vital information to the local authority for land use planning and management in the future. A set of controlling factors and landslide inventory (LI) are typically used to generate LS. Thus, the LS accuracy can be affected by the LI availability and its source and timespan. Here, the impact of LI from two sources and timespans on the accuracy of LS is analyzed. The LIs are the archived inventory (archived-LI) and small baseline subset (SBAS) interferometry inventory (SBAS-LI). The former LI consisted of landslide events from 1945 to 2014. The latter was acquired by analyzing the ground deformation with multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR datasets and covered between 2015 and 2017. Eleven landslide controlling factors after multicollinearity diagnostics were selected. With the controlling factors in a GIS-based environment, the frequency ratio (FR) model is applied to both LIs and the factors, generating two LS maps. Each map accuracy was validated using recent landslides from 2017 to 2020. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.739 and 0.898 for the LS from the archived-LI and SBAS-LI, respectively. The degree-of-fit index of 61.7% for the LS from the archived-LI and 80.8% from the SBAS-LI was obtained. The SBAS-LI produced more reflective present LS and possibly for future susceptibility even though the number of events in the modeling was about one-third of that in the archived-LI. Thus, the current LI is preferred for LS analysis.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article, based on the material of M.A. Voloshin's work, examines the elements of Tolstoy's myth. The biographical myth of L.N. Tolstoy, which has been actively developing for a century and a half until today, but at the beginning of the 20th century, when Tolstoy's departure from his own home became popular, it became especially relevant. The structure of the Tolstoy's myth is analyzed, the mythologies associated with it (mythologized constant representations) created and reproduced by M.A. Voloshin in accordance with his own poetic worldview, personal attitude to the work and personality of L.N. Tolstoy. In the light of the problem posed, the author examines the poet's books "The Burning Bush" and "The Ways of Cain". Attention is focused on the originality of Tolstoy's text in the creative heritage of Voloshin, based on the proximity of worldviews, the sacralization of the image of the great writer. The poet interprets Tolstoy's mythologem about non-resistance to evil by violence in a completely new way. In the attempts of the great artist to protect himself and others from evil, Voloshin sees the reason for his tragic departure from Yasnaya Polyana. The question is raised about the features of the perception of this myth in the culture and literature of the first third of the XX century.

TI  - Potential of Hybrid CNN-RF Model for Early Crop Mapping with Limited Input Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When sufficient time-series images and training data are unavailable for crop classification, features extracted from convolutional neural network (CNN)-based representative learning may not provide useful information to discriminate crops with similar spectral characteristics, leading to poor classification accuracy. In particular, limited input data are the main obstacles to obtain reliable classification results for early crop mapping. This study investigates the potential of a hybrid classification approach, i.e., CNN-random forest (CNN-RF), in the context of early crop mapping, that combines the automatic feature extraction capability of CNN with the superior discrimination capability of an RF classifier. Two experiments on incremental crop classification with unmanned aerial vehicle images were conducted to compare the performance of CNN-RF with that of CNN and RF with respect to the length of the time-series and training data sizes. When sufficient time-series images and training data were used for the classification, the accuracy of CNN-RF was slightly higher or comparable with that of CNN. In contrast, when fewer images and the smallest training data were used at the early crop growth stage, CNN-RF was substantially beneficial and the overall accuracy increased by maximum 6.7%p and 4.6%p in the two study areas, respectively, compared to CNN. This is attributed to its ability to discriminate crops from features with insufficient information using a more sophisticated classifier. The experimental results demonstrate that CNN-RF is an effective classifier for early crop mapping when only limited input images and training samples are available.

TI  - Plate-Boundary Kinematics of the Afrera Linkage Zone (Afar) From InSAR and Seismicity
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the mechanisms of interaction between rift segments is key to understanding the kinematics of plate boundaries in continental rifts. However, the spatial and temporal evolution of deformation at rift linkage zones is rarely observed directly. Here, we combine InSAR data spanning 2005-2010 and 2014-2019 from ENVISAT and Sentinel-1 satellites, respectively, with local seismicity from the Afar rift to investigate the plate-boundary kinematics of the Afrera linkage zone, the junction between the Erta Ale and Tat Ali magmatic segments in Northern Afar (Ethiopia). We obtain time-series of cumulative InSAR Line-Of-Sight (LOS) displacements that show deformation is accommodated by a series of active en-echelon faults striking similar to NS and characterized by normal slip associated with a left-lateral strike-slip component. Additionally, we observe spatial variation in fault behavior with stick-slip and creep. The faults in the center of the linkage zone behave primarily in a stick-slip mode (with abrupt fault displacements up to similar to 40 mm) and fault motions are associated with earthquakes of M-L > 5. Conversely, faults at the edge of the linkage zone, near the magmatic segments, show creep and some stick-slip behavior (with cumulative LOS displacement up to similar to 30-40 mm over a similar to 5-year period) accompanied by low-level seismicity. Some of the creeping faults are also spatially associated with hydrothermal springs. We interpret that the temporal behavior of the faults in the linkage zone is controlled by the interplay between tectonic extension, high heat flows, and fluid circulation near the magmatic segments where creeping of some faults is favored.Plain Language Summary The exterior of the Earth is torn apart along mid-ocean ridges where magma rises and new oceanic crust is created. Mid-ocean ridges have an unmissable zig-zag pattern because while some portions called ridge segments are being torn apart others called offsets, slide past each other. However, how the Earth deforms in these offsets is today poorly understood. The Afar region is the perfect place to address this open question as it is one of the few pales where a mid-ocean ridge is emerged and the segments and offsets can be observed on-land. In this study, we combine satellite and earthquakes measurements to film how the surface of the Earth moves in an offset. We show that the network of fractures at the surface of an offset can either move with sudden motions generating major earthquakes or slip continuously over years and produce many smaller earthquakes. Our results provide one of the few direct observations of the different type of motion of the Earth in an offset of the mid-ocean ridge system.

TI  - A Submonthly Surface Water Classification Framework via Gap-Fill Imputation and Random Forest Classifiers of Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global surface water classification layers, such as the European Joint Research Centre's (JRC) Monthly Water History dataset, provide a starting point for accurate and large scale analyses of trends in waterbody extents. On the local scale, there is an opportunity to increase the accuracy and temporal frequency of these surface water maps by using locally trained classifiers and gap-filling missing values via imputation in all available satellite images. We developed the Surface Water IMputation (SWIM) classification framework using R and the Google Earth Engine computing platform to improve water classification compared to the JRC study. The novel contributions of the SWIM classification framework include (1) a cluster-based algorithm to improve classification sensitivity to a variety of surface water conditions and produce approximately unbiased estimation of surface water area, (2) a method to gap-fill every available Landsat image for a region of interest to generate submonthly classifications at the highest possible temporal frequency, (3) an outlier detection method for identifying images that contain classification errors due to failures in cloud masking. Validation and several case studies demonstrate the SWIM classification framework outperforms the JRC dataset in spatiotemporal analyses of small waterbody dynamics with previously unattainable sensitivity and temporal frequency. Most importantly, this study shows that reliable surface water classifications can be obtained for all pixels in every available Landsat image, even those containing cloud cover, after performing gap-fill imputation. By using this technique, the SWIM framework supports monitoring water extent on a submonthly basis, which is especially applicable to assessing the impact of short-term flood and drought events. Additionally, our results contribute to addressing the challenges of training machine learning classifiers with biased ground truth data and identifying images that contain regions of anomalous classification errors.

TI  - Retrieval and Evaluation of Chlorophyll-a Concentration in Reservoirs with Main Water Supply Function in Beijing, China, Based on Landsat Satellite Images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing retrieval is an important technology for studying water eutrophication. In this study, Guanting Reservoir with the main water supply function of Beijing was selected as the research object. Based on the measured data in 2016, 2017, and 2019, and Landsat-8 remote sensing images, the concentration and distribution of chlorophyll-a in the Guanting Reservoir were inversed. We analyzed the changes in chlorophyll-a concentration of the reservoir in Beijing and the reasons and effects. Although the concentration of chlorophyll-a in the Guanting Reservoir decreased gradually, it may still increase. The amount and stability of water storage, chlorophyll-a concentration of the supply water, and nitrogen and phosphorus concentration change are important factors affecting the chlorophyll-a concentration of the reservoir. We also found a strong correlation between the pixel values of adjacent reservoirs in the same image, so the chlorophyll-a estimation model can be applied to each other.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate land cover mapping of the Earth's surface using Earth observation data is one of the most studied, but yet the most challenging tasks of remote sensing field, particularly when it comes to urban areas. The large spectral variability of man-made structures, as well as the mixed pixel phenomenon, imposes the use of computational demanding techniques, which are not always effective for real case applications. Support vector machines (SVMs) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms, which are mainly used for classification and regression analysis. Specifically, a support vector classifier (SVC) constructs a hyperplane or a set of hyperplanes in a high-dimensional space, which separates the training data into different classes. These are then used to classify a whole image, or series of images. The current standard SVM algorithm for classification used by the most popular mapping software (e.g., ENVI, EnMAP) is the C-SVC. The parameterization of a C-SVC strongly affects the final classification result. Yet, there is no rule of thumb to choose the optimal parameters when classifying satellite imagery. Optimal parameterization totally depends on the training data, and to determine it for a specific case, a time-consuming trial-and-error process is inevitable. In this work, advancements for the C-SVC algorithm are proposed to enhance its performance when used to classify remote sensing data, eliminating the need for a part of manual parametrization, while ensuring increasing its performance.

TI  - Towards Vine Water Status Monitoring on a Large Scale Using Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wine growing needs to adapt to confront climate change. In fact, the lack of water becomes more and more important in many regions. Whereas vineyards have been located in dry areas for decades, so they need special resilient varieties and/or a sufficient water supply at key development stages in case of severe drought. With climate change and the decrease of water availability, some vineyard regions face difficulties because of unsuitable variety, wrong vine management or due to the limited water access. Decision support tools are therefore required to optimize water use or to adapt agronomic practices. This study aimed at monitoring vine water status at a large scale with Sentinel-2 images. The goal was to provide a solution that would give spatialized and temporal information throughout the season on the water status of the vines. For this purpose, thirty six plots were monitored in total over three years (2018, 2019 and 2020). Vine water status was measured with stem water potential in field measurements from pea size to ripening stage. Simultaneously Sentinel-2 images were downloaded and processed to extract band reflectance values and compute vegetation indices. In our study, we tested five supervised regression machine learning algorithms to find possible relationships between stem water potential and data acquired from Sentinel-2 images (bands reflectance values and vegetation indices). Regression model using Red, NIR, Red-Edge and SWIR bands gave promising result to predict stem water potential (R-2=0.40, RMSE=0.26).

TI  - Monitoring the Greater Agulhas Current With AIS Data Information
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the core region of the Agulhas Current, new estimations of ocean surface velocities are reported using the increasing data set from the Automatic Identification System (AIS), initially designed to monitor vessel traffic. A two-step strategy is suggested. A first guess is evaluated from the collective behavior of vessels for a given space-time interval. Individual vessel trajectories are then re-analyzed and interpolated. Applied during year 2016, these ocean surface current estimates are demonstrated to well determine the intensity of surface currents. The improved spatial resolution helps the decomposition of the optimally interpolated surface current vector field between irrotational approximate to 80%-90% and divergence-free components approximate to 10%-20%, for example, Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition. Comparisons are performed between in situ drifting-buoys and represent up to 25% gain in respect of the altimetry gridded current (for the meridional component). Others comparisons with data collected during the Agulhas Current Time-series experiment, as well as with the mean Doppler-derived surface currents obtained from satellite synthetic aperture radar measurements also reveal a significant benefit of using the AIS derived estimates. Comparisons with the Sea Surface Temperature from MODIS sensors confirm the occurrence of meandering events for the current path. For the Agulhas Current region, the high density of vessel traffic can provide new means to study and monitor intense upper ocean currents with more detailed resolution and precision.Plain Language Summary Today, for security reasons, merchant ships transmit location, speed, heading and course-over-ground information through the Automatic Identification System (AIS). These messages are a new source of information to complement ocean surface current measurements. In this study, the intense traffic off the South African coast can result in a selection of more than 150 ships per day. Daily analyses and correlations are reported and illustrate links with observed changes in sea surface temperature. In view of the existing need to establish a more comprehensive monitoring system for the Agulhas Current, these results encourage the systematic usage of the increasingly available amount of AIS data as complementary to traditional in situ and altimeter measurements for routine quantitative monitoring of heat and mass transport in this region.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Assessment of Surface Moisture and Evapotranspiration Variability Using Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between the physic features of the Earth's surface and its temperature has been significantly investigated for further soil moisture assessment. In this study, the spatiotemporal impacts of surface properties on land surface temperature (LST) were examined by using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and meteorological data. The significant distinctions were observed during a crop growing season through the contrast in the correlation between different multi-spectral satellite indices and LST, in which the highest correlation of -0.65 was found when the Normalized Difference Latent heat Index (NDLI) was used. A new index, named as Temperature-soil Moisture Dryness Index (TMDI), is accordingly proposed to assess surface moisture and evapotranspiration (ET) variability. It is based on a triangle space where NDLI is set as a reference basis for examining surface water availability and the variation of LST is an indicator as a consequence of the cooling effect by ET. TMDI was evaluated against ET derived from the commonly-used model, namely Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), as well as compared to the performance of Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI). This study was conducted over five-time points for the 2014 winter crop growing season in southern Taiwan. Results indicated that TMDI exhibits significant sensitivity to surface moisture fluctuation by showing a strong correlation with SEBAL-derived ET with the highest correlation of -0.89 was found on 19 October. Moreover, TMDI revealed its superiority over TVDI in the response to a rapidly changing surface moisture due to water supply before the investigated time. It is suggested that TMDI is a proper and sensitive indicator to characterize the surface moisture and ET rate. Further exploitation of the usefulness of the TMDI in a variety of applications would be interesting.

TI  - Associations Between Environmental and Sociodemographic Data and Hepatitis-A Transmission in Para State (Brazil)
T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Hepatitis-A is a waterborne infectious disease transmitted by the eponymous hepatitis-A virus (HAV). Due to the disease's sociodemographic and environmental characteristics, this study applied public census and remote sensing data to assess risk factors for hepatitis-A transmission. Municipality-level data were obtained for the state of Para, Brazil. Generalized linear and nonlinear models were evaluated as alternative predictors for hepatitis-A transmission in Para. The Histogram Gradient Boost (HGB) regression model was deemed the best choice (RMSE= 2.36, and higher R-2 = 0.95) among the tested models. Partial dependence analysis and permutation feature importance analysis were used to investigate the partial dependence and the relative importance values of the independent variables in the disease transmission prediction model. Results indicated a complex relationship between the disease transmission and the sociodemographic and environmental characteristics of the study area. Population size, lack of sanitation, urban clustering, year of notification, insufficient public vaccination programs, household proximity to open-air dumpsites and storm-drains, and lack of access to healthcare facilities and hospitals were sociodemographic parameters related to HAV transmission. Turbidity and precipitation were the environmental parameters closest related to disease transmission. Based on HGB model, a hepatitis-A risk map was built for Para state. The obtained risk map can be thought of as an auxiliary tool for public health strategies. This study reinforces the need to incorporate remote sensing data in epidemiological modelling and surveillance plans for the development of early prevention strategies for hepatitis-A.Plain Language Summary Hepatitis-A is a waterborne infectious disease and accounts for similar to 70,000 deaths per year around the world. The disease's transmission is intimately dependent on sanitary, social, cultural and environmental conditions. Therefore, this study applied public census and environmental remote sensing data to assess risk factors related to hepatitis-A transmission. Municipalitylevel data were obtained for the state of Para, Brazil. We analyzed the models' results and verified that the disease transmission has a complex relationship with the sociodemographic and environmental characteristics of the study area. Population size, lack of sanitation, urban clustering, year of notification, insufficient public vaccination programs, household proximity to open-air dumpsites and storm-drains, and lack of access to healthcare facilities and hospitals are sociodemographic parameters related to HAV transmission. The overall turbidity of the municipalities' waterbodies and the monthly accumulated precipitation were the environmental parameters closest related to disease transmission. Our results also depicted higher transmission rates for hepatitis-A in the northern municipalities of the study area. Our results can be thought of as auxiliary tools for public health strategies and policy making. This study reinforces the need to incorporate environmental data in epidemiological modelling and surveillance plans for the development of early prevention strategies for waterborne diseases.

The occurrence climatology of Es and MSTIDs is derived using the Challenging Minisatellite Payload satellite data acquired in 2001-2008 and 2001-2009, respectively. Electron density irregularities and radio scintillations are used as the detection proxies of MSTIDs and Es, respectively. The occurrence rate of MSTIDs shows a semi-annual variation with the primary peak during June solstices and the secondary peak during December solstices in both hemispheres. However, the occurrence rate of Es shows a seasonal variation with a pronounced peak in summer in both hemispheres. The occurrence of MSTIDs during local summer and equinoxes is correlated with the occurrence of local Es, but the high occurrence rate of MSTIDs in local winter is not correlated with local winter hemisphere Es. MSTIDs in the winter hemisphere are correlated with magnetically conjugate MSTIDs in the summer hemisphere; these summer hemisphere MSTIDs are correlated with the occurrence of Es in the summer hemisphere. The occurrence rate of MSTIDs clearly shows an increase with decreasing solar activity, but the solar cycle dependence of Es is not obvious from the data. This observation suggests that the generation of MSTIDs is significantly affected by factors other than Es such as the growth rate of the Perkins instability, atmospheric gravity waves, and the F region conductance.

TI  - An Improved Method for Urban Built-Up Area Extraction Supported by Multi-Source Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban built-up areas, where urbanization process takes place, represent well-developed areas in a city. The accurate and timely extraction of urban built-up areas has a fundamental role in the comprehension and management of urbanization dynamics. Urban built-up areas are not only a reflection of urban expansion but also the main space carrier of social activities. Recent research has attempted to integrate the social factor to improve the extraction accuracy. However, the existing extraction methods based on nighttime light data only focus on the integration of a single factor, such as points of interest or road networks, which leads to weak constraint and low accuracy. To address this issue, a new index-based methodology for urban built-up area extraction that fuses nighttime light data with multisource big data is proposed in this paper. The proposed index, while being conceptually simple and computationally inexpensive, can extract the built-up areas efficiently. First, a new index-based methodology, which integrates nighttime light data with points-of-interest, road networks, and the enhanced vegetation index, was constructed. Then, based on the proposed new index and the reference urban built-up data area, urban built-up area extraction was performed based on the dynamic threshold dichotomy method. Finally, the proposed method was validated based on actual data in a city. The experimental results indicate that the proposed index has high accuracy (recall, precision and F1 score) and applicability for urban built-up area boundary extraction. Moreover, this paper discussed different existing urban area extraction methods, and provides an insight into the appropriate approaches selection for further urban built-up area extraction in cities with different conditions.

TI  - The Impact of Choice of Solar Spectral Irradiance Model on Atmospheric Correction of Landsat 8 OLI Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many atmospheric correction schemes of radiancebased optical satellite data require the selection of normalized solar spectral irradiance models at the top of atmosphere (TOA). However, there is no scientific consensus in literature as to which available model is most suitable. This article examines five commonly used models applied to Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) TOA radiance and reflectance products to assess the accuracy and stability between models used to derive surface reflectance products. It is assumed that the calibration of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat 8 OLI TOA reflectance and radiance products are accurate to currently claimed levels. The results show that the retrieved surface reflectance can exhibit significant variations when different solar irradiance models are used, especially in the OLI coastal blue band at 443 nm. From the five solar irradiance models, the Kurucz 2005 model showed the least bias compared with OLI TOA reflectance product and least variance in surface reflectance. Furthermore, improvement was obtained by adjusting the total solar irradiance (TSI) normalization, and additional validation was provided using observed in situ water leaving reflectance data. The results from this article are particularly relevant to aquatic applications and to satellite sensors that provide TOA radiance such as previous Landsat and other current and historical missions.

TI  - Assessing an Atmospheric Correction Algorithm for Time Series of Satellite-Based Water-Leaving Reflectance Using Match-Up Sites in Australian Coastal Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An atmospheric correction algorithm for medium-resolution satellite data over general water surfaces (open/coastal, estuarine and inland waters) has been assessed in Australian coastal waters. In situ measurements at four match-up sites were used with 21 Landsat 8 images acquired between 2014 and 2017. Three aerosol sources (AERONET, MODIS ocean aerosol and climatology) were used to test the impact of the selection of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and angstrom ngstrom coefficient on the retrieved accuracy. The initial results showed that the satellite-derived water-leaving reflectance can have good agreement with the in situ measurements, provided that the sun glint is handled effectively. Although the AERONET aerosol data performed best, the contemporary satellite-derived aerosol information from MODIS or an aerosol climatology could also be as effective, and should be assessed with further in situ measurements. Two sun glint correction strategies were assessed for their ability to remove the glint bias. The most successful one used the average of two shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands to represent sun glint and subtracted it from each band. Using this sun glint correction method, the mean all-band error of the retrieved water-leaving reflectance at the Lucinda Jetty Coastal Observatory (LJCO) in north east Australia was close to 4% and unbiased over 14 acquisitions. A persistent bias in the other strategy was likely due to the sky radiance being non-uniform for the selected images. In regard to future options for an operational sun glint correction, the simple method may be sufficient for clear skies until a physically based method has been established.

TI  - A New Linear Relation for Estimating Surface Broadband Emissivity in Arid Regions Based on FTIR and MODIS Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Broadband emissivity is a crucial parameter for calculating the radiation budget, still, it adopts a constant value in land surface models due to a lack of adequate observations. Arid regions have complex underlying surfaces and estimations of the broadband emissivity in such areas suffer from high spatial variation and uncertainty. Here, we propose a novel method for estimating broadband emissivity in the 8-14 mu m range based on Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) observations, moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) emissivity, the leaf area index (LAI) and reflectance products. The proposed method exploits FTIR observations, MODIS single-channel emissivity, reflectance and the LAI to fit a linear regression of the broadband emissivity, so the optimal equation includes emissivity, reflectance and the LAI, with an R-2 and root-mean-squared error of 0.942 and 0.08. Then we used the proposed method to generate a broadband emissivity map of Northwest of China, the broadband emissivity estimated by the method showed higher variations and finer distribution in arid areas and sparsely vegetated regions compared to data from the global land surface satellite and land model. An analysis of the relationship between the broadband emissivity, land-use type and soil moisture found an existing but not linear relationship, which indicated that the relationship was complicated under the inhomogeneous surface of wetness and vegetation. In conclusion, our results suggest that the proposed method can accurately estimate the broadband emissivity in arid regions. In future research, we will test the data in a land model.

TI  - STUDY ON REMOTE SENSING MONITORING MODEL OF AGRICULTURAL DROUGHT BASED ON RANDOM FOREST DEVIATION CORRECTION
T2  - INMATEH-AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using remote sensing data to monitor large area drought is one of the important methods of drought monitoring at present. However, the traditional remote sensing drought monitoring methods mainly focus on monitoring single drought response factors such as soil moisture or vegetation status, and the research on comprehensive multi-factor drought monitoring is limited. In order to improve the ability to resist drought events, this paper takes Henan Province of China as an example, takes multi-source remote sensing data as data sources, considers various disaster-causing factors, adopts random forest method to model, and explores the method of regional remote sensing comprehensive drought monitoring using various remote sensing data sources. Compared with neural network, classification regression tree and linear regression, the performance of random forest is more stable and tolerant to noise and outliers. In order to provide a new method for comprehensive assessment of regional drought, a comprehensive drought monitoring model was established based on multi-source remote sensing data, which comprehensively considered the drought factors such as soil water stress, vegetation growth status and meteorological precipitation profit and loss in the process of drought occurrence and development.

TI  - A New Method for Winter Wheat Mapping Based on Spectral Reconstruction Technology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate estimation of the winter wheat planting area and its spatial distribution is essential for the implementation of crop growth monitoring and yield estimation, and hence for the development of national agricultural production and food security. In remotely sensed winter wheat mapping based on spectral similarity, the reference curve is obtained by averaging multiple standard curves, which limits mapping accuracy. We propose a spectral reconstruction method based on singular value decomposition (SR-SVD) for winter wheat mapping based on the unique growth characteristics of crops. Using Sentinel-2 A/B satellite data, we tested the SR-SVD method in Puyang County, and Shenzhou City, China. Performance was increased, with the optimal overall accuracy and the Kappa of Puyang County and Shenzhou City were 99.52% and 0.99, and 98.26% and 0.97, respectively. We selected the spectral angle mapper (SAM) and Euclidean Distance (ED) as the similarity measures. Compared to spectral similarity methods, the SR-SVD method significantly improves mapping accuracy, as it avoids excessive extraction, can identify more detailed information, and is advantageous in distinguishing non-winter wheat pixels. Three commonly used supervised classification methods, support vector machine (SVM), maximum likelihood (ML), and minimum distance (MD) were used for comparison. Results indicate that SR-SVD has the highest mapping accuracy and greatly reduces the number of misidentified pixels. Therefore, the SR-SVD method can achieve high-precision crop mapping and provide technical support for monitoring regional crop planting structure information.

TI  - Machine learning method for quick identification of water quality index (WQI) based on Sentinel-2 MSI data: Ebinur Lake case study
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water quality is an important factor affecting the ecological environment and human living environment. The monitoring of surface water quality by remote sensing monitoring technology can provide important research significance for water resources protection and water quality evaluation. Finding the optimal spectral index sensitive to water quality for remote sensing monitoring of water quality is extremely important for surface water quality analysis and treatment in the Ebinur Lake Basin in arid areas. This study used Sentinel-2MSI data at 10 m resolution to quickly monitor the water quality of the watershed. Through laboratory experiments and measurement data from the Ebinur Lake Basin, 22 water quality parameters (WQPs) were obtained. Through Z-score and redundancy analysis, 9 WQPs with significant contributions were extracted. Based on the remote sensing spectral band, four water indexes (NDWI, NWI, EWI, AWEI-nsh) and 2D modeling spectral index (DI, RI, NDI), the correlation analysis between WQPs and two kinds of spectral band indexes is carried out, and it is concluded that the overall correlation between WQP and 2D spectral modeling is more relevant. This paper calculates the evaluation and models the 2D spectrum of the Water Quality Index (WQI). The WQI is predicted and modeled through four machine learning algorithms (RF, SVM, PLSR, PLSR-SVM). The results show that the inversion effect of the two-dimensional spectral modeling index on water quality parameters (WQPs) is superior to that of the water index, and the correlation coefficient of the DI (R12-R1) SWIR-2 and BLUE band interpolation index reaches 0.787. On this basis, three kinds of two-dimensional spectral modeling indexes are used to inversely synthesize the WQI, and the correlation coefficient of the ratio index of the RI (R11/R8) SWIR-1 and near-infrared (NIR) bands is preferably 0.69. In the WQI prediction, the partial least squares regression support vector machine (PLSR-SVM) model in machine learning algorithms has good modeling and prediction effects (R(2)c = 0.873, R(2)v = 0.87), which can provide a good basis. The research results provide references for remote monitoring of surface water in arid areas, and provide a basis for water quality prediction and safety evaluation.

TI  - The Strong Upwelling Event off the Southern Coast of Sri Lanka in 2013 and Its Relationship with Indian Ocean Dipole Events
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisource satellite remote sensing data have been used to analyze the strong upwelling event off the southern coast of Sri Lanka in 2013 and its relationship with Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) events. The upwelling area in 2013 is 5.7 times larger than that in a normal year and lasts from June to August, with the peaks of the cooling anomaly reaching -1.5 degrees C and the positive chlorophyll a concentration anomaly exceeding 3.1 mg m(-3). In 2013, the negative unseasonable IOD (IODJJA) event enhances the southwest monsoon, while the blocking of the monsoon wind by the island results in a stronger westerly/northwesterly wind stress off the southern coast of Sri Lanka and a weaker westerly/northwesterly wind stress over the eastern Sri Lanka waters. This causes stronger offshore transport and positive Ekman pumping off the southern coast, forming a strong upwelling event there. Further analysis indicates that the interannual variability of the upwelling, as represented by a newly constructed index based on satellite observations, is primarily caused by the variations of local wind associated with the IOD. The upwelling off the southern coast of Sri Lanka weakens (strengthens) in the positive (negative) IOD years. However, an analysis based on 21 IOD events during 1982-2019 demonstrates that the effects of the three types of IOD events, including IODJJA, prolonged IOD (IODLONG), and normal IOD (IODSON), on the upwelling are different. Compared to the IODSON events, the IODJJA and IODLONG events tend to have stronger influences due to their earlier developing phases.

TI  - Analysis of Ecological and Economic Benefits of Rural Land Integration in the Manas River Basin Oasis
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land consolidation is an effective means of promoting the regularization of fragmented arable land, optimizing the allocation of land resources and improving the environment in farming areas, as well as an important means of increasing the economic returns of farming households, and it is important to scientifically assess the ecological and economic benefits of agricultural land consolidation. In this study, participatory rural assessment (PRA) was used to investigate, in detail, the meaning, satisfaction and changes in farmland rehabilitation before and after implementation. The accuracy of the remote sensing data was verified through an experiment on the net cultivation coefficient. We used a sample of 447 farmers from nine villages in Manas County to study the differences in plot area, crop unit value, income and irrigation before and after the farmers' integration. We found that, after the integration of farmland, the cultivated area increased significantly, the crop unit yield increased by at least 42.66%, the average income of farmers increased by a value of RMB 4324/ha and the water savings were all higher than 7.18 m(3)/ha. At the same time, after the integration of farmland, the number of plots was significantly reduced, the arable land became more regular and the microclimate of the farmland improved significantly. The government and individuals should follow the concept and construction requirements of the "community of life in mountain, water, forest, lake, grass and sand", consider the economic and ecological benefits of land consolidation, ensure the quality of farmland ecosystems, actively explore new models of land consolidation and stimulate the economic vitality of rural areas.

TI  - Toward Large-Scale Mapping of Tree Crops with High-Resolution Satellite Imagery and Deep Learning Algorithms: A Case Study of Olive Orchards in Morocco
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate monitoring of tree crop extent and productivities are necessary for informing policy-making and investments. However, except for a very few tree species (e.g., oil palms) with obvious canopy and extensive planting, most small-crown tree crops are understudied in the remote sensing domain. To conduct large-scale small-crown tree mapping, several key questions remain to be answered, such as the choice of satellite imagery with different spatial and temporal resolution and model generalizability. In this study, we use olive trees in Morocco as an example to explore the two abovementioned questions in mapping small-crown orchard trees using 0.5 m DigitalGlobe (DG) and 3 m Planet imagery and deep learning (DL) techniques. Results show that compared to DG imagery whose mean overall accuracy (OA) can reach 0.94 and 0.92 in two climatic regions, Planet imagery has limited capacity to detect olive orchards even with multi-temporal information. The temporal information of Planet only helps when enough spatial features can be captured, e.g., when olives are with large crown sizes (e.g., >3 m) and small tree spacings (e.g., <3 m). Regarding model generalizability, experiments with DG imagery show a decrease in F1 score up to 5% and OA to 4% when transferring models to new regions with distribution shift in the feature space. Findings from this study can serve as a practical reference for many other similar mapping tasks (e.g., nuts and citrus) around the world.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Tropical Rainforest Biomass Changes in Hainan Island, China from 2003 to 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The largest area of tropical rainforests in China is on Hainan Island, and it is an important part of the world's tropical rainforests. The structure of the tropical rainforests in Hainan is complex, the biomass density is high, and conducting ground surveys is difficult, costly, and time-consuming. Remote sensing is a good monitoring method for biomass estimation. However, the saturation phenomenon of such data from different satellite sensors results in low forest biomass estimation accuracy in tropical rainforests with high biomass density. Based on environmental information, the biomass of permanent sample plots, and forest age, this study established a tropical rainforest database for Hainan. Forest age and 14 types of environmental information, combined with an enhanced vegetation index (EVI), were introduced to establish a tropical rainforest biomass estimation model for remote sensing that can overcome the saturation phenomenon present when using remote sensing data. The fitting determination coefficient R-2 of the model was 0.694. The remote sensing estimate of relative bias was 2.29%, and the relative root mean square error was 35.41%. The tropical rainforest biomass in Hainan Island is mainly distributed in the central mountainous and southern areas. The tropical rainforests in the northern and coastal areas have been severely damaged by tourism and real estate development. Particularly in low-altitude areas, large areas of tropical rainforest have been replaced by economic forests. Furthermore, the tropical rainforest areas in some cities and counties have decreased, affecting the increase in tropical rainforest biomass. On Hainan Island, there were few tropical rainforests in areas with high rainfall. Therefore, afforestation in these areas could maximize the ecological benefits of tropical rainforests. To further strengthen the protection, there is an urgent need to establish a feasible, reliable, and effective tropical rainforest loss assessment system using quantitative scientific methodologies.

TI  - Insights into Lateral Spread Displacement Patterns Using Remote Sensing Data from the 2011 Christchurch Earthquake
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution displacement observations of lateral spreading from optical image correlation are available for the 2011 Christchurch (M-w = 6.2), New Zealand, earthquake, and these data were used to provide insights into the detailed displacement patterns during the earthquake and to quantitatively evaluate the performance of existing empirical models for lateral spread displacements. The observed displacements revealed important characteristics influencing the displacement patterns, including topographic terraces enhancing displacements in large regions between the terrace and the river, the combined effects of a free face and sloping ground on displacements near the river, and the effect of multiple free faces. These site characteristics can enhance displacements and should be considered when evaluating lateral spread movements. For the displacement models, on average, the Youd model underpredicts the observed displacements by more than a factor of 2, likely due to the strong magnitude scaling incorporated in the model. On average, the Zhang model is unbiased relative to the observed displacements but systematically overpredicts displacements for slopes greater than 1%. These results indicate the limitations of the existing lateral spread models and point toward the need for improvements in our understanding of lateral spread displacements.

In biomedical research and clinical practice, NPs can serve as labels or labeled carriers for monitoring drug delivery or serve as imaging agents for enhanced imaging contrast, as well as providing improved signal sensitivity and specificity for in vivo imaging of molecular and cellular processes. These qualities offer exciting opportunities for NP-based imaging agents to address current limitations in oncologic imaging. Despite substantial advancements in NP design and development, very few NP-based imaging agents have translated into clinics within the past 5 years. This review highlights some promising NP-enabled imaging techniques and their potential to address current clinical cancer imaging limitations. Although most examples provided herein are from the preclinical space, discussed imaging solutions could offer unique in vivo tools to solve biologic questions, improve cancer treatment effectiveness, and inspire clinical translation innovation to improve patient care.

TI  - Effects of Cropland Expansion on Temperature Extremes in Western India from 1982 to 2015
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - India has experienced extensive land cover and land use change (LCLUC). However, there is still limited empirical research regarding the impact of LCLUC on climate extremes in India. Here, we applied statistical methods to assess how cropland expansion has influenced temperature extremes in India from 1982 to 2015 using a new land cover and land use dataset and ECMWF Reanalysis V5 (ERA5) climate data. Our results show that during the last 34 years, croplands in western India increased by similar to 33.7 percentage points. This cropland expansion shows a significantly negative impact on the maxima of daily maximum temperature (TXx), while its impacts on the maxima of daily minimum temperature and the minima of daily maximum and minimum temperature are limited. It is estimated that if cropland expansion had not taken place in western India over the 1982 to 2015 period, TXx would likely have increased by 0.74 (+/- 0.64) degrees C. The negative impact of croplands on reducing the TXx extreme is likely due to evaporative cooling from intensified evapotranspiration associated with croplands, resulting in increased latent heat flux and decreased sensible heat flux. This study underscores the important influences of cropland expansion on temperature extremes and can be applicable to other geographic regions experiencing LCLUC.

TI  - Trail camera networks provide insights into satellite-derived phenology for ecological studies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Repeat digital photography at or near ground-level is a proven and efficient approach for tracking plant phenology. Here, we explored the potential to monitor phenology using the Snapshot Wisconsin (SW) trail camera network, a citizen science program. Using three curve-fitting methods for characterizing phenological transition dates, we assessed the phenological offset between understory vegetation and the overstory canopy in the trailcam observations and compared variations in derived phenology over the different spatial scales represented by trailcams (similar to 20-50 m), Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS, 30 m), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, 500 m). Our results showed that the apparent phenological offset between understory and overstory vegetation differed among forest types: in broadleaf deciduous forests, understory vegetation had an earlier start-of-spring (SOS) and later end-of-autumn (EOA) than the overstory canopy; in mixed forests, the understory showed an earlier SOS than the overstory, but no significant difference in EOA; in evergreen conifer forests, neither SOS nor EOA differed significantly between the understory and overstory. We found moderate correlations (0.25 <= r <= 0.57) between trailcam- and satellite-derived phenological dates. Moreover, those derived dates varied significantly among the applied curve-fitting methods: total growing season length (from SOS to EOA) could be 19 days longer for a threshold-based method than for a logistic curve-fitting method (our reference model), but 17 days shorter than the logistic method when using a piecewise-continuous method based on fitted sine curves. Despite the spatial limitations of trailcams for characterizing phenology on landscape and regional scales, trailcam networks have considerable potential for informing local phenological studies and disentangling the many drivers of phenology that can remain undetected from the satellite perspective.

TI  - Influence of reservoir construction on surrounding vegetation cover
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is a significant factor in the energy and water cycles. Changes in vegetation are affected by the natural environment and human activities. In this study, the Dalong Reservoir on the Ningyuan River in Sanya, Hainan, was taken as an example to set one type of buffer zone with the reservoir dam site as the center, and two types of horizontal and vertical buffer zones outwards from both banks of the river, and Landsat 5 remote sensing image data and the vegetation data were applied. A coverage estimation model was used to study the temporal and spatial changes in surface vegetation in three types of buffer zones, and the characteristics of the surface vegetation changes in the preterm, midterm and late-term reservoir construction periods were analyzed. The results showed that, (1) During the years of 2000 and 2010, the vegetation coverage first decreased and then increased with time in the scope of the research. During preterm construction (2000-2004), the vegetation coverage in the upstream region decreased while that in the downstream region increased. During midterm construction (2004-2006), the declining rate of vegetation coverage downstream was greater than that upstream, but the influence of reservoir construction on vegetation coverage decreased over time in the late-term construction period (2007-2010); (2) Along the direction of the river length, the vegetation coverage showed a downtrend along with the river flow direction during the whole period (2000-2010), and the influence of reservoir construction on vegetation coverage gradually decreased as the distance from the reservoir increased; (3) Along the direction of the river width, the vegetation coverage in the preterm and midterm construction periods (2000-2006) increased with increasing distance from the riverbanks; (4) The vegetation coverage showed a significant increasing trend with increasing distance from the reservoir. The research results can provide a theoretical reference for reducing the risk of vegetation degradation, strengthening the governance of the ecological environment, and promoting the ecological construction of "landscapes, forests, fields, lakes and grass".

TI  - Effective Range and Driving Factors of the Urban Ventilation Corridor Effect on Urban Thermal Comfort at Unified Scale with Multisource Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban ventilation corridors serve as channels of fresh air flow between the city and suburbs, helping to improve the wind and thermal environments and thermal comfort. However, owing to the limited number of weather stations, it is impossible to quantitatively reveal the effective effect range of urban ventilation corridors on urban thermal comfort at the scale of 100 x 100 m, which is optimal for urban ventilation corridors. In this study, we integrated building data, the European Centre for Medium-Range weather forecast data (ECMWF), MOD13Q1, and other multisource data to analyse the effect of urban ventilation corridors on urban thermal comfort at a unified scale of 100 x 100 m. The results showed that ECMWF and Landsat8 data could be used as substitute factors to improve the universal thermal climate index (UTCI) urban spatial resolution. The effective range of urban ventilation corridor effects on the urban surface temperature and urban comfort was <= 1000 m, with building density and vegetation coverage as the main factors limiting this range. Therefore, attention should be paid to the effective range of urban ventilation corridors, the surrounding building density, vegetation coverage, and the rational use of urban ventilation corridors to reduce the energy consumption of air conditioning in summer.

TI  - Deriving VIIRS High-Spatial Resolution Water Property Data over Coastal and Inland Waters Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite has been a reliable source of ocean color data products, including five moderate (M) bands and one imagery (I) band normalized water-leaving radiance spectra nL(w)(lambda). The spatial resolutions of the M-band and I-band nL(w)(lambda) are 750 m and 375 m, respectively. With the technique of convolutional neural network (CNN), the M-band nL(w)(lambda) imagery can be super-resolved from 750 m to 375 m spatial resolution by leveraging the high spatial resolution features of I1-band nL(w)(lambda) data. However, it is also important to enhance the spatial resolution of VIIRS-derived chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration and the water diffuse attenuation coefficient at the wavelength of 490 nm (K-d(490)), as well as other biological and biogeochemical products. In this study, we describe our effort to derive high-resolution K-d(490) and Chl-a data based on super-resolved nL(w)(lambda) images at the VIIRS five M-bands. To improve the network performance over extremely turbid coastal oceans and inland waters, the networks are retrained with a training dataset including ocean color data from the Bohai Sea, Baltic Sea, and La Plata River Estuary, covering water types from clear open oceans to moderately turbid and highly turbid waters. The evaluation results show that the super-resolved K-d(490) image is much sharper than the original one, and has more detailed fine spatial structures. A similar enhancement of finer structures is also found in the super-resolved Chl-a images. Chl-a filaments are much sharper and thinner in the super-resolved image, and some of the very fine spatial features that are not shown in the original images appear in the super-resolved Chl-a imageries. The networks are also applied to four other coastal and inland water regions. The results show that super-resolution occurs mainly on pixels of Chl-a and K-d(490) features, especially on the feature edges and locations with a large spatial gradient. The biases between the original M-band images and super-resolved high-resolution images are small for both Chl-a and K-d(490) in moderately to extremely turbid coastal oceans and inland waters, indicating that the super-resolution process does not change the mean values of the original images.

TI  - Predicting Height to Crown Base of <i>Larix olgensis</i> in Northeast China Using UAV-LiDAR Data and Nonlinear Mixed Effects Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a core content of forest management, the height to crown base (HCB) model can provide a theoretical basis for the study of forest growth and yield. In this study, 8364 trees of Larix olgensis within 118 sample plots from 11 sites were measured to establish a two-level nonlinear mixed effect (NLME) HCB model. All predictors were derived from an unmanned aerial vehicle light detection and ranging (UAV-LiDAR) laser scanning system, which is reliable for extensive forest measurement. The effects of the different individual trees, stand factors, and their combinations on the HCB were analyzed, and the leave-one-site-out cross-validation was utilized for model validation. The results showed that the NLME model significantly improved the prediction accuracy compared to the base model, with a mean absolute error and relative mean absolute error of 0.89% and 9.71%, respectively. In addition, both site-level and plot-level sampling strategies were simulated for NLME model calibration. According to different prediction scale and accuracy requirements, selecting 15 trees randomly per site or selecting the three largest trees and three medium-size trees per plot was considered the most favorable option, especially when both investigations cost and the model's accuracy are primarily considered. The newly established HCB model will provide valuable tools to effectively utilize the UAV-LiDAR data for facilitating decision making in larch plantations management.

TI  - Mapping Mangrove Zonation Changes in Senegal with Landsat Imagery Using an OBIA Approach Combined with Linear Spectral Unmixing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The mangrove areas in Senegal have fluctuated considerably over the last few decades, and it is therefore important to monitor the evolution of forest cover in order to orient and optimise forestry policies. This study presents a method for mapping plant formations to monitor and study changes in zonation within the mangroves of Senegal. Using Landsat ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI images merged to a 15-m resolution with a pansharpening method, a processing chain that combines an OBIA approach and linear spectral unmixing was developed to detect changes in mangrove zonation through a diachronic analysis. The accuracy of the discriminations was evaluated with kappa indices, which were 0.8 for the Saloum delta and 0.83 for the Casamance estuary. Over the last 20 years, the mangroves of Senegal have increased in surface area. However, the dynamics of zonation differ between the two main mangrove hydrosystems of Senegal. In Casamance, a colonisation process is underway. In the Saloum, Rhizophora mangle is undergoing a process of densification in mangroves and appears to reproduce well in both regions. Furthermore, this study confirms, on a regional scale, observations in the literature noting the lack of Avicennia germinans reproduction on a local scale. In the long term, these regeneration gaps may prevent the mangrove from colonising the upper tidal zones in the Saloum. Therefore, it would be appropriate to redirect conservation policies towards reforestation efforts in the Saloum rather than in Casamance and to focus these actions on the perpetuation of Avicennia germinans rather than Rhizophora mangle, which has no difficulty in reproducing. From this perspective, it is necessary to gain a more in-depth understanding of the specific factors that promote the success of Avicennia germinans seeding.

TI  - Impact of an Antimicrobial Stewardship Program on the Incidence of Carbapenem Resistant Gram-Negative Bacilli: An Interrupted Time-Series Analysis
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (CR-GNB) are a critical public health threat, and carbapenem use contributes to their spread. Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) have proven successful in reducing antimicrobial use. However, evidence on the impact of carbapenem resistance remains unclear. We evaluated the impact of a multifaceted ASP on carbapenem use and incidence of CR-GNB in a high-endemic hospital. An interrupted time-series analysis was conducted one year before and two years after starting the ASP to assess carbapenem consumption, CR-GNB incidence, death rates of sentinel events, and other variables potentially related to CR-GNB incidence. An intense reduction in carbapenem consumption occurred after starting the intervention and was sustained two years later (relative effect -83.51%; 95% CI -87.23 to -79.79). The incidence density of CR-GNB decreased by -0.915 cases per 1000 occupied bed days (95% CI -1.743 to -0.087). This effect was especially marked in CR-Klebsiella pneumoniae and CR-Escherichia coli, reversing the pre-intervention upward trend and leading to a relative reduction of -91.15% (95% CI -105.53 to -76.76) and -89.93% (95% CI -107.03 to -72.83), respectively, two years after starting the program. Death rates did not change. This ASP contributed to decreasing CR-GNB incidence through a sustained reduction in antibiotic use without increasing mortality rates.

TI  - Combining Satellite InSAR, Slope Units and Finite Element Modeling for Stability Analysis in Mining Waste Disposal Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Slope failures pose a substantial threat to mining activity due to their destructive potential and high probability of occurrence on steep slopes close to limit equilibrium conditions, which are often found both in open pits and in waste and tailing disposal facilities. The development of slope monitoring and modeling programs usually entails the exploitation of in situ and remote sensing data, together with the application of numerical modeling, and it plays an important role in the definition of prevention and mitigation measures aimed at minimizing the impact of slope failures in mining areas. In this paper, a new methodology is presented; one that combines satellite radar interferometry and 2D finite element modeling for slope stability analysis at a regional scale, and applied within slope unit polygons. Although the literature includes many studies applying radar interferometry and modeling for slope stability analysis, the addition of slope units as input data for radar interferometry and modeling purposes has, to our knowledge, not previously been reported. A former mining area in southeast Spain was studied, and the method proved useful for detecting and characterizing a large number of unstable slopes. Out of the 1959 slope units used for the spatial analysis of the radar interferometry data, 43 were unstable, with varying values of safety factor and landslide size. Out of the 43 active slope units, 21 exhibited line of sight velocities greater than the maximum error obtained through validation analysis (2.5 cm/year). Finally, this work discusses the possibility of using the results of the proposed approach to devise a proxy for landslide hazard. The proposed methodology can help to provide non-expert final users with intelligible, clear, and easily comparable information to analyze slope instabilities in different settings, and not limited to mining areas.

TI  - High-resolution satellite-derived river network map reveals small Arctic river hydrography
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Small rivers (width <30 m) are crucial components of Arctic terrestrial river networks. Yet to date, spatial resolution limitations of commonly used satellite imagery have inhibited quantification of their hydrography. By merging newly available Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery with 2-m ArcticDEM digital elevation data, we created a continuous actively-flowing river network map of the Colville (Kuukpik) River Basin (similar to 36 000 km(2)) in Alaska, which includes small rivers as narrow as 10 m. We quantified the river hydrography (stream order and river width, length,surface area, velocity, slope, sinuosity, and catchment area) of the Colville river network in detail, revealing the dominant role of small rivers. Our results show that: (1) small rivers occupy >80% of total river length and surface area of the Colville river network and drain >90% of the catchment area; (2) including numerous small rivers increases the peak of hillslope-channel travel time distribution (TTD) by similar to 4 times and shortens the mean hillslope-channel travel time by at least an order of magnitude compared to coarser-resolution river hydrography products; and (3) 87% of the Colville River Basin's carbon dioxide is emitted from small rivers. In sum, we show that small Arctic rivers greatly influence streamflow TTD and carbon cycle. These findings expand our understanding of Arctic river hydrography to a 10-m spatial resolution and raise prospects for tracking dynamic surface water processes with high-resolution satellite observations.

TI  - Changes in the Greenness of Mountain Pine (<i>Pinus mugo</i> Turra) in the Subalpine Zone Related to the Winter Climate
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the current alteration of temperature and snow cover regimes, the impacts of winter climate have received considerably less attention than those of the vegetation period. In this study, we present the results demonstrating the influence of the winter climate conditions on the Mountain pine (Pinus mugo Turra) communities in High Tatra Mts (Western Carpathians). The changes in greenness in 2000-2020 were represented by the inter-annual differences of satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The winter climate conditions were characterized by climate indices calculated from the temperature and snow cover data measured at Skalnate Pleso Observatory (1778 m a.s.l.) over the period between 1941-2020. Areas with P. mugo were classified into two density classes and five altitudinal zones of occurrence. The partial correlation analyses, which controlled the influence of summer climate, indicated that winter warm spells (WWS) caused a significant decrease in the greenness of the P. mugo thickets growing in the dense class D2 (R = -0.47) and in the altitudinal zones A2 (1600-1700 m a.s.l.) and A3 (1700-1800 m a.s.l.) with R = -0.54 for each zone. The changes in greenness were related to the average snow depth (ASD) as well, particularly in the dense class D2 (R = 0.45) and in the altitudinal zone A2 (R = 0.50). Here, in the summers following winters with the incidence of WWS or low ASD, we found decreased greenness following the injury of P. mugo shrubs, but NDVI after winters with higher ASD indicated more greenness. At lower altitudes, injuries may result in the loss of competition capacity of P. mugo near the timberline, where taller mountain tree species can utilize the conditions of warmer climate for expansion. We also found a significant positive effect of warmer winter seasons in the sparse P. mugo thickets (D1) with R = 0.50 and at higher altitudes (R = 0.49 in A4-1800-1900 m a.s.l.; R = 0.53 in A5-1900-2000 m a.s.l.). The increased temperatures in December correlated significantly with the increase of the greenness in all P. mugo pixels (R = 0.47), with the most pronounced effect in the sparse class D1 (R = 0.57) and in altitudinal zones A4 (R = 0.63) and A5 (R = 0.44), creating advantageous conditions for the thermophilisation of the alpine zone by P. mugo.

TI  - Computed Tomography Imaging Predictors of Intracerebral Hemorrhage Expansion
T2  - CURRENT NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review Hematoma expansion (HE) is strongly associated with poor clinical outcome and is a compelling target for improving outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is widely used in clinical practice due to its faster acquisition at the presence of acute stroke. Recently, imaging markers on NCCT are increasingly used for predicting HE. We comprehensively review the current evidence on HE prediction using NCCT and provide a summary for assessment of these markers in future research studies. Recent Findings Predictors of HE on NCCT have been described in reports of several studies. The proposed markers, including swirl sign, blend sign, black hole sign, island sign, satellite sign, and subarachnoid extension, were all significantly associated with HE and poor outcome in their small sample studies after ICH. In summary, the optimal management of ICH remains a therapeutic dilemma. Therefore, using NCCT markers to select patients at high risk of HE is urgently needed. These markers may allow rapid identification and provide potential targets for anti-HE treatments in patients with acute ICH.

TI  - Improving the Image Quality of Moving Ships for GF-3NG Based on Simultaneous AIS Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important means of ship surveillance, but the motion of the ship leads to azimuth position offset, false targets, and azimuth defocusing for the spaceborne high-resolution and wide-swath (HRWS) SAR system, causing the degradation of imaging quality. The automatic identification system (AIS) can provide real-time information of the ships, which is an important auxiliary method for ship surveillance. Up to now, the traditional fusion of SAR and AIS mainly has focused on location matching and auxiliary recognition, and the next generation of GaoFen-3 (GF-3NG) satellite is equipped with both a SAR sensor and an AIS sensor to obtain the SAR images and simultaneous AIS information of ships. Consequently, this paper proposes a novel scheme to improve the imaging quality of moving ships for GF-3NG using AIS information. In this paper, through introducing the virtual stationary target, the slant range derivation (SRD) algorithm is proposed to estimate the radial velocity (RV) and the radial acceleration (RA) between the ship and the SAR platform relative to the stationary scene. According to the calculated RV, the azimuth position offset can be estimated and the ship can be repositioned on the image. After that, the traditional method is conducted to suppress the false targets. Finally, the method of using the RA to refocus ship slices is proposed. Additionally, the experiment results based on real data illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

TI  - Quality Assessment of Heterogeneous Training Data Sets for Classification of Urban Area with Landsat Imagery
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quality assessment of training samples collected from heterogeneous sources has received little attention in the existing literature. Inspired by Euclidean spectral distance metrics, this article derives three quality measures for modeling uncertainty in spectral information of open-source heterogeneous training samples for classification with Landsat imagery. We prepared eight test case data sets from volunteered geographic information and open government data sources to assess the proposed measures. The data sets have significant variations in quality, quantity, and data type. A correlation analysis verifies that the proposed measures can successfully rank the quality of heterogeneous training data sets prior to the image classification task. In this era of big data, pre-classification quality assessment measures empower research scientists to select suitable data sets for classification tasks from available open data sources. Research findings prove the versatility of the Euclidean spectral distance function to develop quality metrics for assessing open-source training data sets with varying characteristics for urban area classification.

TI  - Modeling of Diurnal Changing Patterns in Airborne Crop Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne remote sensing technologies have been widely applied in field crop phenotyping. However, the quality of current remote sensing data suffers from significant diurnal variances. The severity of the diurnal issue has been reported in various plant phenotyping studies over the last four decades, but there are limited studies on the modeling of the diurnal changing patterns that allow people to precisely predict the level of diurnal impacts. In order to comprehensively investigate the diurnal variability, it is necessary to collect time series field images with very high sampling frequencies, which has been difficult. In 2019, Purdue agricultural (Ag) engineers deployed their first field visible to near infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral gantry platform, which is capable of repetitively imaging the same field plots every 2.5 min. A total of 8631 hyperspectral images of the same field were collected for two genotypes of corn plants from the vegetative stage V4 to the reproductive stage R1 in the 2019 growing season. The analysis of these images showed that although the diurnal variability is very significant for almost all the image-derived phenotyping features, the diurnal changes follow stable patterns. This makes it possible to predict the imaging drifts by modeling the changing patterns. This paper reports detailed diurnal changing patterns for several selected plant phenotyping features such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Relative Water Content (RWC), and single spectrum bands. For example, NDVI showed a repeatable V-shaped diurnal pattern, which linearly drops by 0.012 per hour before the highest sun angle and increases thereafter by 0.010 per hour. The different diurnal changing patterns in different nitrogen stress treatments, genotypes and leaf stages were also compared and discussed. With the modeling results of this work, Ag remote sensing users will be able to more precisely estimate the deviation/change of crop feature predictions caused by the specific imaging time of the day. This will help people to more confidently decide on the acceptable imaging time window during a day. It can also be used to calibrate/compensate the remote sensing result against the time effect.

TI  - Ossified diagnosis: sarcoidosis masquerading as metastatic breast cancer
T2  - BMJ CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A 40-year-old woman was referred to the Breast Unit with a solid lump in her right breast. Investigations revealed an invasive lobular carcinoma. The patient underwent a right-sided mastectomy and sentinel lymph node (LN) biopsy, which confirmed axillary LN involvement. The postsurgery staging CT showed unusual enlargement of mediastinal and hilar LN bilaterally. This was consistent with positron emission tomography/CT and MRI, which further established the presence of several bone lesions. Determining the pathology within the LN and bones was pivotal in providing an accurate diagnosis and deciding subsequent management. However, histopathological analysis of the initial endobronchial ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of mediastinal LN failed to identify definitive metastatic breast cancer cells. The case was extensively discussed in several multidisciplinary team meetings. Collective evidence, including clinical presentation, comparative imaging analysis, and further biopsies confirmed sarcoidosis with bone involvement-mimicking metastatic disease.

TI  - Distance Transform-Based Spectral-Spatial Feature Vector for Hyperspectral Image Classification with Stacked Autoencoder
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pixel-wise classification of hyperspectral images (HSIs) from remote sensing data is a common approach for extracting information about scenes. In recent years, approaches based on deep learning techniques have gained wide applicability. An HSI dataset can be viewed either as a collection of images, each one captured at a different wavelength, or as a collection of spectra, each one associated with a specific point (pixel). Enhanced classification accuracy is enabled if the spectral and spatial information are combined in the input vector. This allows simultaneous classification according to spectral type but also according to geometric relationships. In this study, we proposed a novel spatial feature vector which improves accuracies in pixel-wise classification. Our proposed feature vector is based on the distance transform of the pixels with respect to the dominant edges in the input HSI. In other words, we allow the location of pixels within geometric subdivisions of the dataset to modify the contribution of each pixel to the spatial feature vector. Moreover, we used the extended multi attribute profile (EMAP) features to add more geometric features to the proposed spatial feature vector. We have performed experiments with three hyperspectral datasets. In addition to the Salinas and University of Pavia datasets, which are commonly used in HSI research, we include samples from our Surrey BC dataset. Our proposed method results compares favorably to traditional algorithms as well as to some recently published deep learning-based algorithms.

TI  - Evaluating the NDVI-Rainfall Relationship in Bisha Watershed, Saudi Arabia Using Non-Stationary Modeling Technique
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and rainfall data were used to model the spatial relationship between vegetation and rainfall. Their correlation in previous studies was typically based on a global regression model, which assumed that the correlation was constant across space. The NDVI-rainfall association, on the other hand, is spatially non-stationary, non-linear, scale-dependent, and influenced by local factors (e.g., soil background). In this study, two statistical methods are used in the modeling, i.e., traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and geographically weighted regression (GWR), to evaluate the NDVI-rainfall relationship. The GWR was implemented annually in the growing seasons of 2000 and 2016, using climate data (Normalized Vegetation Difference Index and rainfall). The NDVI-rainfall relationship in the studied Bisha watershed (an eco-sensitive zone with a complex landscape) was found to have a stable operating scale of around 12 km. The findings support the hypothesis that the OLS model's average impression could not accurately represent local conditions. By addressing spatial non-stationarity, the GWR approach greatly improves the model's accuracy and predictive ability. In analyzing the relationship between NDVI patterns and rainfall, our research has shown that GWR outperforms a global OLS model. This superiority stems primarily from the consideration of the relationship's spatial variance across the study area. Global regression techniques such as OLS can overlook local details, implying that a large portion of the variance in NDVI is unexplained. It appears that rainfall is the most significant factor in deciding the distribution of vegetation in these regions. Furthermore, rainfall had weak relationships with areas predominantly located around wetlands, suggesting the need for additional factors to describe NDVI variations. The GWR method performed better in terms of accuracy, predictive power, and reduced residual autocorrelation. Thus, GWR is recommended as an explanatory and exploratory technique when relations between variables are subject to spatial variability. Since the GWR is a local form of spatial analysis that aligned to local conditions, it has the potential for more accurate prediction; however, a larger amount of data is needed to allow a reliable local fitting.

TI  - Comparing PlanetScope to Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 for Sensing Water Quality in Reservoirs in Agricultural Watersheds
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural runoff transports sediments and nutrients that deteriorate water quality erratically, posing a challenge to ground-based monitoring. Satellites provide data at spatial-temporal scales that can be used for water quality monitoring. PlanetScope nanosatellites have spatial (3 m) and temporal (daily) resolutions that may help improve water quality monitoring compared to coarser-resolution satellites. This work compared PlanetScope to Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 in their ability to detect key water quality parameters. Spectral bands of each satellite were regressed against chlorophyll a, turbidity, and Secchi depth data from 13 reservoirs in Oklahoma over three years (2017-2020). We developed significant regression models for each satellite. Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 explained more variation in chlorophyll a than PlanetScope, likely because they have more spectral bands. PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 explained relatively similar amounts of variations in turbidity and Secchi Disk data, while Landsat-8 explained less variation in these parameters. Since PlanetScope is a commercial satellite, its application may be limited to cases where the application of coarser-resolution satellites is not feasible. We identified scenarios where PS may be more beneficial than Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. These include measuring water quality parameters that vary daily, in small ponds and narrow coves of reservoirs, and at reservoir edges.

TI  - Measuring Alpha and Beta Diversity by Field and Remote-Sensing Data: A Challenge for Coastal Dunes Biodiversity Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining field collected and remotely sensed (RS) data represents one of the most promising approaches for an extensive and up-to-date ecosystem assessment. We investigated the potential of the so called spectral variability hypothesis (SVH) in linking field-collected and remote-sensed data in Mediterranean coastal dunes and explored if spectral diversity provides reliable information to monitor floristic diversity, as well as the consistency of such information in altered ecosystems due to plant invasions. We analyzed alpha diversity and beta diversity, integrating floristic field and Remote-Sensing PlanetScope data in the Tyrrhenian coast (Central Italy). We explored the relationship among alpha field diversity (species richness, Shannon index, inverse Simpson index) and spectral variability (distance from the spectral centroid index) through linear regressions. For beta diversity, we implemented a distance decay model (DDM) relating field pairwise (Jaccard similarities index, Bray-Curtis similarities index) and spectral pairwise (Euclidean distance) measures. We observed a positive relationship between alpha diversity and spectral heterogeneity with richness reporting the higher R score. As for DDM, we found a significant relationship between Bray-Curtis floristic similarity and Euclidean spectral distance. We provided a first assessment of the relationship between floristic and spectral RS diversity in Mediterranean coastal dune habitats (i.e., natural or invaded). SVH provided evidence about the potential of RS for estimating diversity in complex and dynamic landscapes.

TI  - Assessing Landsat Images Availability and Its Effects on Phenological Metrics
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat imagery offers the most extended continuous land surface observation at 30 m spatial resolution and is widely used in land change studies. On the other hand, the recent developments on big data, such as cloud computing, give new opportunities for carrying out satellite-based continuous land cover monitoring including land use/cover change and more subtle changes as forest degradation, agriculture intensification and vegetation phenological patterns alterations. However, in the range 0-10 degrees south latitude, especially in the summer and autumn, there is a high rainfall and high clouds presence. We hypothesise that it will be challenging to characterise vegetation phenology in regions where the number of valid (cloud-free) remotely-sensed observation is low or when the observations are unevenly distributed over the year. This paper aims to evaluate whether there is sufficient availability of Landsat 7 and 8 images over Brazil to support the analysis of phenodynamics of vegetation. We used Google Earth Engine to assess Landsat data availability during the last decades over the Brazilian territory. The valid observations (excluding clouds and shadow areas) from Landsat 4/5/7/8 during the period 1984-2017 were determined at pixel level. The results show a lower intensity of Landsat observations in the northern and northeastern parts of Brazil compared to the southern region, mainly due to clouds' presence. Taking advantage of the overlapping areas between satellite paths where the number of observations is larger, we modelled the loss of information caused by a lower number of valid (cloud free) observations. We showed that, in the deciduous woody formations of the Caatinga dominium, the scarcity of valid observations has an adverse effect on indices' performance aimed at describing vegetation phenology. However, the combination of Landsat data with satellite constellation such as Sentinel will likely permit to overcome many of these limitations.

TI  - Mapping Smallholder Maize Farms Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 Data in Support of the Sustainable Development Goals
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing food insecurity in developing countries is one of the crucial targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Smallholder farmers play a crucial role in combating food insecurity. However, local planning agencies and governments do not have adequate spatial information on smallholder farmers, and this affects the monitoring of the SDGs. This study utilized Sentinel-1 multi-temporal data to develop a framework for mapping smallholder maize farms and to estimate maize production area as a parameter for supporting the SDGs. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to pixel fuse the multi-temporal data to only three components for each polarization (vertical transmit and vertical receive (VV), vertical transmit and horizontal receive (VH), and VV/VH), which explained more than 70% of the information. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (Xgboost) algorithms were used at model-level feature fusion to classify the data. The results show that the adopted strategy of two-stage image fusion was sufficient to map the distribution and estimate production areas for smallholder farms. An overall accuracy of more than 90% for both SVM and Xgboost algorithms was achieved. There was a 3% difference in production area estimation observed between the two algorithms. This framework can be used to generate spatial agricultural information in areas where agricultural survey data are limited and for areas that are affected by cloud coverage. We recommend the use of Sentinel-1 multi-temporal data in conjunction with machine learning algorithms to map smallholder maize farms to support the SDGs.

TI  - Delineating Smallholder Maize Farms from Sentinel-1 Coupled with Sentinel-2 Data Using Machine Learning
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rural communities rely on smallholder maize farms for subsistence agriculture, the main driver of local economic activity and food security. However, their planted area estimates are unknown in most developing countries. This study explores the use of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to map smallholder maize farms. The random forest (RF), support vector (SVM) machine learning algorithms and model stacking (ST) were applied. Results show that the classification of combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data improved the RF, SVM and ST algorithms by 24.2%, 8.7%, and 9.1%, respectively, compared to the classification of Sentinel-1 data individually. Similarities in the estimated areas (7001.35 +/- 1.2 ha for RF, 7926.03 +/- 0.7 ha for SVM and 7099.59 +/- 0.8 ha for ST) show that machine learning can estimate smallholder maize areas with high accuracies. The study concludes that the single-date Sentinel-1 data were insufficient to map smallholder maize farms. However, single-date Sentinel-1 combined with Sentinel-2 data were sufficient in mapping smallholder farms. These results can be used to support the generation and validation of national crop statistics, thus contributing to food security.

TI  - Vulnerability of the Permafrost Landscapes in the Eastern Chukotka Coastal Plains to Human Impact and Climate Change
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost landscapes are particularly susceptible to the observed climate change due to the presence of ice in the ground. This paper presents the results of the mapping and assessment of landscapes and their vulnerability to potential human impact and further climate change in the remote region of Eastern Chukotka. The combination of field studies and remote sensing data analysis allowed us to identify the distribution of landscapes within the study polygon, reveal the factors determining their stability, and classify them by vulnerability to the external impacts using a hazard index, H. In total, 33 landscapes characterized by unique combinations of vegetation cover, soil type, relief, and ground composition were detected within the 172 km(2) study polygon. The most stable landscapes of the study polygon occupy 31.7% of the polygon area; they are the slopes and tops of mountains covered with stony-lichen tundra, alpine meadows, and the leveled summit areas of the fourth glacial-marine terrace. The most unstable areas cover 19.2% of the study area and are represented by depressions, drainage hollows, waterlogged areas, and places of caterpillar vehicle passage within the terraces and water-glacial plain. The methods of assessment and mapping of the landscape vulnerability presented in this study are quite flexible and can be adapted to other permafrost regions.

AB  - Purpose: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an invasive surgical procedure and although it has fewer complications and is less severe than axillary lymph node dissection, it is not a risk-free procedure. Large prospective trials have documented SLNB that it is considered non-therapeutic in early stage breast cancer.Methods: Web-calculator CancerMath (CM) allows you to estimate the probability of having positive lymph nodes valued on the basis of tumour size, age, histologic type, grading, expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor. We collected 595 patients referred to our Institute resulting clinically negative T1 breast cancer characterized by sentinel lymph node status, prognostic factors defined by CM and also HER2 and Ki-67. We have compared classification performances obtained by online CM application with those obtained after training its algorithm on our database.Results: By training CM model on our dataset and using the same feature, adding HER2 or ki67 we reached a sensitivity median value of 71.4%, 73%, 70.4%, respectively, whereas the online one was equal to 61%, without losing specificity. The introduction of the prognostic factors Her2 and Ki67 could help improving performances on the classification of particularly type of patients.Conclusions: Although the training of the model on the sample of T1 patients has brought a significant improve- ment in performance, the general performance does not yet allow a clinical application of the algorithm. However, the experimental results encourage future developments aimed at introducing features of a different nature in the CM model.

TI  - Are Posterior Oropharyngeal Saliva Specimens an Acceptable Alternative to Nasopharyngeal Sampling for the Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in Primary-Care Settings?
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The present study was set up to evaluate the efficacy of virological surveillance using posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in general practice. Methods: Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples were collected without restriction on timing or alimentation by general practitioners from patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI) seen in consultation. Saliva samples were tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and 21 other respiratory pathogens. Results for SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples were compared to results obtained using a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) collected in a certified medical laboratory before or after the ARI consultation. Results: Overall, 143 ARI patients were enrolled between 6 June 2020, and 19 January 2021. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 37.0% (n = 53) of saliva samples and in 39.0% (n = 56) of NPS. Both saliva and NPS were positive in 51 patients. Positive and negative results were concordant between saliva samples and NPS in 51 (96.2%) and in 85 (94.4%) patients, respectively, with a Cohen's Kappa coefficient of 0.89 (95% CI 0.82-0.97, p < 0.001). Other respiratory viruses were detected in 28.0% (n = 40) of the 143 saliva samples. Conclusions: Findings suggest that saliva samples could represent an attractive alternative to NPS for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in patients consulting for an ARI in primary care.

TI  - Determination of Water Depth in Ports Using Satellite Data Based on Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the fundamental maintenance tasks of ports is the periodic dredging of them. This is necessary to guarantee a minimum draft that will enable ships to access ports safely. The determination of bathymetries is the instrument that determines the need for dredging and permits an analysis of the behavior of the port bottom over time, in order to achieve adequate water depth. Satellite data processing to predict environmental parameters is used increasingly. Based on satellite data and using different machine learning algorithm techniques, this study has sought to estimate the seabed in ports, taking into account the fact that the port areas are strongly anthropized areas. The algorithms that were used were Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and the Multi-Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). The study was carried out in the ports of Candas and Luarca in the Principality of Asturias. In order to validate the results obtained, data was acquired in situ by using a single beam provided. The results show that this type of methodology can be used to estimate coastal bathymetry. However, when deciding which system was best, priority was given to simplicity and robustness. The results of the SVM and RF algorithms outperform those of the MARS. RF performs better in Candas with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.27 cm, whereas SVM performs better in Luarca with a mean absolute error of 0.37 cm. It is suggested that this approach is suitable as a simpler and more cost-effective rough resolution alternative, for estimating the depth of turbid water in ports, than single-beam sonar, which is labor-intensive and polluting.

TI  - Assessment of Vegetation Dynamics and Ecosystem Resilience in the Context of Climate Change and Drought in the Horn of Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the response of vegetation and ecosystem resilience to climate variability and drought conditions is essential for ecosystem planning and management. In this study, we assessed the vegetation changes and ecosystem resilience in the Horn of Africa (HOA) since 2000 and detected their drivers based mainly on analysis of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. We found that the annual and seasonal trends of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) generally increased during the last two decades over the Horn of Africa particularly in western parts of Ethiopia and Kenya. The weakest annual and seasonal NDVI trends were observed over the grassland cover and tropical arid agroecological zones. The NDVI variation negatively correlated with Land Surface Temperature (LST) and positively correlated with precipitation at a significant level (p < 0.05) account for 683,197 km(2) and 533,385 km(2) area, respectively. The ecosystem Water Use Efficiency (eWUE) showed overall increasing trends with larger values for the grassland biome. The precipitation had the most significant effect on eWUE variation compared to LST and annual SPEI (Standardized Evapotranspiration Index). There were about 54.9% of HOA resilient to drought disturbance, whereas 32.6% was completely not-resilient. The ecosystems in the humid agroecological zones, the cropland, and wetland were slightly not-resilient to severe drought conditions in the region. This study provides useful information for policy makers regarding ecosystem and dryland management in the context of climate change at both national and regional levels.

TI  - Citizen Science Tools Reveal Changes in Estuarine Water Quality Following Demolition of Buildings
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbidity and water colour are two easily measurable properties used to monitor pollution. Here, we highlight the utility of a low-cost device-3D printed, hand-held Mini Secchi disk (3DMSD) with Forel-Ule (FU) colour scale sticker on its outer casing-in combination with a mobile phone application ('TurbAqua') that was provided to laymen for assessing the water quality of a shallow lake region after demolition of four high-rise buildings on the shores of the lake. The demolition of the buildings in January 2020 on the banks of a tropical estuary-Vembanad Lake (a Ramsar site) in southern India-for violation of Indian Coastal Regulation Zone norms created public uproar, owing to the consequences of subsequent air and water pollution. Measurements of Secchi depth and water colour using the 3DMSD along with measurements of other important water quality variables such as temperature, salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO) using portable instruments were taken for a duration of five weeks after the demolition to assess the changes in water quality. Paired t-test analyses of variations in water quality variables between the second week of demolition and consecutive weeks up to the fifth week showed that there were significant increases in pH, dissolved oxygen, and Secchi depth over time, i.e., the impact of demolition waste on the Vembanad Lake water quality was found to be relatively short-lived, with water clarity, colour, and DO returning to levels typical of that period of year within 4-5 weeks. With increasing duration after demolition, there was a general decrease in the FU colour index to 17 at most stations, but it did not drop to 15 or below, i.e., towards green or blue colour indicating clearer waters, during the sampling period. There was no significant change in salinity from the second week to the fifth week after demolition, suggesting little influence of other factors (e.g., precipitation or changes in tidal currents) on the inferred impact of demolition waste. Comparison with pre-demolition conditions in the previous year (2019) showed that the relative changes in DO, Secchi depth, and pH were very high in 2020, clearly depicting the impact of demolition waste on the water quality of the lake. Match-ups of the turbidity of the water column immediately before and after the demolition using Sentinel 2 data were in good agreement with the in situ data collected. Our study highlights the power of citizen science tools in monitoring lakes and managing water resources and articulates how these activities provide support to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets on Health (Goal 3), Water quality (Goal 6), and Life under the water (Goal 14).

TI  - Estimation of Bathymetry and Benthic Habitat Composition from Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data (BIODIVERSITY) Using a Semi-Analytical Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevant benefits of hyperspectral sensors for water column determination and seabed features mapping compared to multispectral data, especially in coastal areas, have been demonstrated in recent studies. In this study, we used hyperspectral satellite data in the accurate mapping of the bathymetry and the composition of water habitats for inland water. Particularly, the identification of the bottom diversity for a shallow lagoon (less than 2 m in depth) was examined. Hyperspectral satellite data were simulated based on aerial hyperspectral imagery acquired above a lagoon, namely the Vaccares lagoon (France), considering the spatial and spectral resolutions, and the signal-to-noise ratio of a satellite sensor, BIODIVERSITY, that is under study by the French space agency (CNES). Various sources of uncertainties such as inter-band calibration errors and atmospheric correction were considered to make the dataset realistic. The results were compared with a recently launched hyperspectral sensor, namely the DESIS sensor (DLR, Germany). The analysis of BIODIVERSITY-like sensor simulated data demonstrated the feasibility to satisfactorily estimate the bathymetry with a root-mean-square error of 0.28 m and a relative error of 14% between 0 and 2 m. In comparison to open coastal waters, the retrieval of bathymetry is a more challenging task for inland waters because the latter usually shows a high abundance of hydrosols (phytoplankton, SPM, and CDOM). The retrieval performance of seabed abundance was estimated through a comparison of the bottom composition with in situ data that were acquired by a recently developed imaging camera (SILIOS Technologies SA., France). Regression coefficients for the retrieval of the fractional species abundances from the theoretical inversion and measurements were obtained to be 0.77 (underwater imaging camera) and 0.80 (in situ macrophytes data), revealing the potential of the sensor characteristics. By contrast, the comparison of the in situ bathymetry and macrophyte data with the DESIS inverted data showed that depth was estimated with an RSME of 0.38 m and a relative error of 17%, and the fractional species abundance was estimated to have a regression coefficient of 0.68.

TI  - DEFORESTATION IN NATIVE VEGETATION DUE TO LAND-USE CHANGE IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF JATAI-GO, BRAZIL
T2  - GEOAMBIENTE ON-LINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of the agricultural frontier in the southwest of Goias state was a process of change of the technical base by modernization to the industrialization of agriculture and establishment of agro-industrial complexes. These changes made possible the rearrangement of the productive space with abrupt changes in land use, especially native vegetation that was degraded on a large scale. This study aimed to quantify the dynamics of deforestation of native forests and the growth of planted forests in Jatai-GO city over the 35 years. For the study, MapBiomas images were used followed by matrix editing into three classes (native, even-aged forest, and other uses). The reference images were LANDSAT 5 and 8 in the period from 1985 to 2020 at intervals of every five years. Kappa index and overall accuracy were used as classification quality parameters. A total deforested area of 76,772.7 ha was observed, with the intensification of deforestation between 1985 and 1995 and high landscape fragmentation. Even-aged forests were identified from 2000, with a total of 4,675.4 ha of Eucalyptus sp. planted until 2020. The study identified a high reduction and isolation of native vegetation areas. However, there is a broad need for research projects and development of strategies related to the conservation of natural landscapes, in addition to the creation of conservation units in the municipality of Jatai-GO to protect the mosaic of phytophysiognomies grassland vegetation, savanna, and forest vegetation present in the municipality.

TI  - Social Inequities in Urban Heat and Greenspace: Analyzing Climate Justice in Delhi, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and rapid urbanization currently pose major challenges for equitable development in megacities of the Global South, such as Delhi, India. This study considers how urban social inequities are distributed in terms of burdens and benefits by quantifying exposure through an urban heat risk index (UHRI), and proximity to greenspace through the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), at the ward level in Delhi. Landsat derived remote sensing imagery for May and September 2011 is used in a sensitivity analysis of varying seasonal exposure. Multivariable models based on generalized estimating equations (GEEs) reveal significant statistical associations (p < 0.05) between UHRI/NDVI and several indicators of social vulnerability. For example, the proportions of children (beta = 0.922, p = 0.024) and agricultural workers (beta = 0.394, p = 0.016) are positively associated with the May UHRI, while the proportions of households with assets (beta = -1.978, p = 0.017) and households with electricity (beta = -0.605, p = 0.010) are negatively associated with the May UHRI. In contrast, the proportions of children (beta = 0.001, p = 0.633) and agricultural workers (beta = 0.002, p = 0.356) are not significantly associated with the May NDVI, while the proportions of households with assets (beta = 0.013, p = 0.010) and those with electricity (beta = 0.008, p = 0.006) are positively associated with the May NDVI. Our findings emphasize the need for future research and policies to consider how socially vulnerable groups are inequitably exposed to the impact of climate change-related urban heat without the mitigating effects of greenspace.

TI  - Determining priority areas for an Endangered cold-adapted snake on warming mountaintops
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial prioritization in systematic conservation planning has traditionally been developed for several to many species and/or habitats, and single-species applications are rare. We developed a novel spatial prioritization model based on accurate estimates of remotely-sensed data and maps of threats potentially affecting long-term species persistence. We used this approach to identify priority areas for the conservation of the Endangered Greek meadow viper Vipera graeca, a cold-adapted species inhabiting mountaintops in the Pindos Mountains of Greece and Albania. We transformed the mapped threats into nine variables to estimate conservation value: habitat suitability (climate suitability, habitat size, occupancy, vegetation suitability), climate change (future persistence, potential for altitudinal range shift) and land-use impact (habitat alteration, degradation, disturbance). We applied the Zonation systematic conservation planning tool with these conservation value variables as biodiversity features to rank the areas currently occupied by the species and to identify priority areas where the chances for population persistence are highest. We found that 90% of current habitats will become unsuitable by the 2080s and that conservation actions need to be implemented to avoid extinction as this is already a threatened species with a narrow ecological niche. If threats are appropriately quantified and translated into variables of conservation value, spatial conservation planning tools can successfully identify priority areas for the conservation of single species. Our study demonstrates that spatial prioritization for single umbrella, flagship or keystone species is a promising approach for the conservation of species for which few data are available.

TI  - Metastatic Melanoma With Features of Desmoplastic Melanoma in a Patient With Primary Cutaneous Superficial Spreading Melanoma With Epithelioid Features
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The synchronous incidence of 2 different subtypes of melanoma is very rare. Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) can be a diagnostic challenge because of its frequent appearance as a dermal banal spindle cell proliferation. We present a case of a 30-year-old man who developed an irregular, purple, tender plaque measuring 2.5 cm on the right pretibial region. Wide excision of the right leg lesion showed superficial spreading melanoma with epithelioid cells and no spindle cell component. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy showed an atypical melanocytic proliferation involving one inguinal lymph node with subcapsular and intraparenchymal components. There were spindled tumor cells in lymph node capsule with hyperchromatic nuclei, which were nested within desmoplastic stroma, and were S100- and SOX10-positive and MART1- and HMB-45 negative; in addition to epithelioid tumor cells, which were S100-, SOX10-, and MART1-positive. Multiple discontinuous foci, subcapsular atypical melanocytes, and extracapsular extension helped in excluding capsular nevus. These findings were consistent with DM. Herein, we present an unusual case of primary cutaneous superficial spreading melanoma of the right leg with a predominantly epithelioid morphology that developed metastases to the SLN. The metastasis exhibited divergent differentiation, including both epithelioid morphology identical to the primary, but with additional features of DM that were nonoverlapping with the primary lesion.

TI  - Urban Heat Island Effects on Megacities in Desert Environments Using Spatial Network Analysis and Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study from Western Saudi Arabia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemporary cities continue to face significant geoenvironmental challenges due to constant rapid urbanization. Furthermore, the governments of cities worldwide are considering the green cities approach to convert their cities' weaknesses into opportunities. The 2030 Saudi vision supports smart growth concepts, with a vision of speeding up economic growth while ensuring that natural assets strengthen the country's foundations. The urban heat island (UHI) effect is a threatening phenomenon that increases the required cooling loads and negatively affects urban communities and the quality of life, especially in arid environments. This study integrates remote sensing and spatial network analysis to investigate the UHI using the distribution of land surface temperatures (LST) extracted from satellite data during both winter and summer seasons in Makkah city. We investigated and compared the UHIs in two districts, Al-Sharashef and AlEskan, representing the organic and deformed iron-grid with fragmented paralleled street networks, respectively. The spatial analysis of different LST maps, which were derived from Landsat-8 images revealed significant differences between the two case studies. The mean temperature for the AlEskan district was 1-1.5 degrees C higher than that of the Al-Sharshaf district. This difference can be attributed to the different urban fabrics between the two districts. Moreover, the zones that are currently under construction show relatively higher LST compared to residential zones. The research revealed that the organic/compact urban fabric is better than the deformed iron-grid urban fabric in mitigating the UHI. However, these results are specific to the test site; however, they emphasize the role of integration of remote sensing and spatial network analysis in urban planning. In light of these findings, we recommend integrating remote sensing-based LST analysis with spatial analysis of urban fabrics to better understand the causal effects of UHI, especially in cities located in desert environments. This can help mitigate the impact of projected global warming and contribute to improving the quality of urban life.

TI  - Assessment of the interpretability of data mining for the spatial modelling of water erosion using game theory
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study undertook a comprehensive application of 15 data mining (DM) models, most of which have, thus far, not been commonly used in environmental sciences, to predict land susceptibility to water erosion hazard in the Kahorestan catchment, southern Iran. The DM models were BGLM, BGAM, Cforest, CITree, GAMS, LRSS, NCPQR, PLS, PLSGLM, QR, RLM, SGB, SVM, BCART and BTR. We identified 18 factors usually considered as key controls for water erosion, comprising 10 factors extracted from a digital elevation model (DEM), three indices extracted from Landsat 8 images, a sediment connectivity index (SCI) and three other intrinsic factors. Three indicators consisting of MAE, MBE, RMSE, and a Taylor diagram were applied to assess model performance and accuracy. Game theory was applied to assess the interpretability of the DM models for predicting water erosion hazard. Among the 15 predictive models, BGAM and PLS respectively returned the best and worst performance in predicting water erosion hazard in the study area. The most accurate model, BGAM predicted that 22%, 8.2%, 9.4% and 60.4% of the total area should be classified as low, moderate, high and very high susceptibility to soil erosion by water, respectively. Based on BGAM and game theory, the factors extracted from the DEM (e.g., DEM, TWI, Slope, TST, TRI, and SPI) were considered the most important ones controlling the predicted severity of soil erosion by water. We conclude that overall, game theory is a valuable technique for assessing the interpretability of predictive models because this theory through SHAP (Shapley additive explanations) and PFIM (permutation feature importance measure) addresses the important concerns regarding the interpretability of more complex DM models.

TI  - Automatic flood detection using sentinel-1 images on the google earth engine
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood is considered to be one of the most destructive natural disasters. It is important to detect the flood-affected area in a reasonable time. In March 2019, a severe flood occurred in the north of Iran and lasted for 2 months. In the present paper, this flood event has been monitored by Sentinel-1 images. The Otsu thresholding algorithm has been applied to separate flooded areas from remaining land covers. The threshold value of -14.9 dB was derived and applied to each scene to delineate flooded areas. There was high variability of the inundated area; however, the presented threshold correctly represented the variation of the flood. The resultant maps were further verified by independent datasets. The overall accuracies were higher than 90%, confirming the applicability of the Otsu automatic thresholding method in flood mapping. The automatic approach is efficient in rapid fold mapping across complex landscapes.

TI  - Dynamics of currents and biological scattering layers around Senghor Seamount, a shallow seamount inside a tropical Northeast Atlantic eddy corridor.
T2  - Deep-Sea Research Part I Oceanographic Research Papers
M3  - Article
AB  - Biophysical interactions of the mesopelagic fauna and hydrodynamic features were investigated at a shallow, tall seamount in the tropical Northeast Atlantic based on data from three inter-disciplinary surveys collected between 2009 and 2015. Senghor Seamount is located close to the equator in a unique but underexplored oceanographic setting, where classical seamount effects are expected to be small. Shipboard Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and remote sensing data revealed flow phenomena strongly varying over different temporal and spatial scales. The quasi-steady, longer period flow at the seamount was largely unchanged by flow-topography interaction with the exception of a persistent and recurring shadow zone of weaker currents downstream of the summit. Senghor Seamount is exposed to energetic mesoscale eddy activity in surrounding waters with potentially large physical and biological implications. At higher frequencies, tidal currents interacting with the seamount generated large-amplitude internal waves propagating horizontally and vertically away from the summit. Analysis of acoustic backscatter data and micronekton biomass displayed prominent near-surface night time and deep (>400 m) day time scattering layers associated with the diurnal vertical migration of the mesopelagic fauna. An intense and previously unreported aggregation of acoustic scatterers was detected in the depth range 150-300 m inside a radius of 3 km along the upper slopes of the seamount summit. ADCP measurements over a full semi-diurnal tidal cycle suggest that biophysical interactions were present in near-seafloor waters around the upper seamount as evidenced by plankton distributions that were modified by topographic blocking during descent and aggregation in waters characterised by internal waves and enhanced tidally-driven energy dissipation.

TI  - Assessing Spatial Variation in Algal Productivity in a Tropical River Floodplain Using Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of tropical floodplains have shown that algae are the primary source material for higher consumers in freshwater aquatic habitats. Thus, methods that can predict the spatial variation of algal productivity provide an important input to better inform management and conservation of floodplains. In this study, a prediction of the spatial variability in algal productivity was made for the Mitchell River floodplain in northern Australia. The spatial variation of aquatic habitat types and turbidity were estimated using satellite remote sensing and then combined with statistical modelling to map the spatial variation in algal primary productivity. Open water and submerged plants habitats, covering 79% of the freshwater flooded floodplain extent, had higher rates of algal production compared to the 21% cover of emergent and floating aquatic plant habitats. Across the floodplain, the predicted average algal productivity was 150.9 +/- 95.47 SD mg C m(-2) d(-1) and the total daily algal production was estimated to be 85.02 +/- 0.07 SD ton C. This study provides a spatially explicit representation of habitat types, turbidity, and algal productivity on a tropical floodplain and presents an approach to map 'hotspots' of algal production and provide key insights into the functioning of complex floodplain-river ecosystems. As this approach uses satellite remotely sensed data, it can be applied in different floodplains worldwide to identify areas of high ecological value that may be sensitive to development and be used by decision makers and river managers to protect these important ecological assets.

TI  - Development of a surgical competency assessment tool for sentinel lymph node dissection by minimally invasive surgery for endometrial cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionSentinel lymph node dissection is widely used in the staging of endometrial cancer. Variation in surgical techniques potentially impacts diagnostic accuracy and oncologic outcomes, and poses barriers to the comparison of outcomes across institutions or clinical trial sites. Standardization of surgical technique and surgical quality assessment tools are critical to the conduct of clinical trials. By identifying mandatory and prohibited steps of sentinel lymph node (SLN) dissection in endometrial cancer, the purpose of this study was to develop and validate a competency assessment tool for use in surgical quality assurance.MethodsA Delphi methodology was applied, included 35 expert gynecological oncology surgeons from 16 countries. Interviews identified key steps and tasks which were rated mandatory, optional, or prohibited using questionnaires. Using the surgical steps for which consensus was achieved, a competency assessment tool was developed and subjected to assessments of validity and reliability.ResultsSeventy percent consensus agreement standardized the specific mandatory, optional, and prohibited steps of SLN dissection for endometrial cancer and informed the development of a competency assessment tool. Consensus agreement identified 21 mandatory and three prohibited steps to complete a SLN dissection. The competency assessment tool was used to rate surgical quality in three preselected videos, demonstrating clear separation in the rating of the skill level displayed with mean skills summary scores differing significantly between the three videos (F score=89.4; P<0.001). Internal consistency of the items was high (Cronbach alpha=0.88).ConclusionSpecific mandatory and prohibited steps of SLN dissection in endometrial cancer have been identified and validated based on consensus among a large number of international experts. A competency assessment tool is now available and can be used for surgeon selection in clinical trials and for ongoing, prospective quality assurance in routine clinical care.

TI  - Analysis of Activity in an Open-Pit Mine by Using InSAR Coherence-Based Normalized Difference Activity Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, time-series of Sentinel-1A/B Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) coherence images were used to monitor the mining activity of Musan open-pit mine, the largest iron mine in North Korea. First, the subtraction of SRTM DEM (2000) from TanDEM-X DEM (2010-2015) has identified two major accumulation areas, one in the east (+112.33 m) and the other in the west (+84.03 m), and a major excavation area (-42.54 m) at the center of the mine. A total of 89 high-quality coherence images with a 12-day baseline from 2015 to 2020 were converted to the normalized difference activity index (NDAI), a newly developed activity indicator robust to spatial and temporal decorrelation. An RGB composite of annually averaged NDAI maps (red for 2019, green for 2018, and blue for 2017) showed that overall activity has diminished since 2018. Dumping slopes were categorized into shrinking, expanding, or transitional, according to the color pattern. Migration and expansion of excavation sites were also found on the pit floor. Time series of 12-day NDAI graphs revealed the date of activities with monthly accuracy. It is believed that NDAI with continuous acquisition of Sentinel-1A/B data can provide detailed monitoring of various types of activities in open-pit mines especially with limited in situ data.

TI  - A systems-based approach to the environmental risk assessment of multiple stressors in honey bees
T2  - EFSA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Parliament requested EFSA to develop a holistic risk assessment of multiple stressors in honey bees. To this end, a systems-based approach that is composed of two core components: a monitoring system and a modelling system are put forward with honey bees taken as a showcase. Key developments in the current scientific opinion (including systematic data collection from sentinel beehives and an agent-based simulation) have the potential to substantially contribute to future development of environmental risk assessments of multiple stressors at larger spatial and temporal scales. For the monitoring, sentinel hives would be placed across representative climatic zones and landscapes in the EU and connected to a platform for data storage and analysis. Data on bee health status, chemical residues and the immediate or broader landscape around the hives would be collected in a harmonised and standardised manner, and would be used to inform stakeholders, and the modelling system, ApisRAM, which simulates as accurately as possible a honey bee colony. ApisRAM would be calibrated and continuously updated with incoming monitoring data and emerging scientific knowledge from research. It will be a supportive tool for beekeeping, farming, research, risk assessment and risk management, and it will benefit the wider society. A societal outlook on the proposed approach is included and this was conducted with targeted social science research with 64 beekeepers from eight EU Member States and with members of the EU Bee Partnership. Gaps and opportunities are identified to further implement the approach. Conclusions and recommendations are made on a way forward, both for the application of the approach and its use in a broader context. (C) 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

TI  - Enhanced Convolutional-Neural-Network Architecture for Crop Classification
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic crop identification and monitoring is a key element in enhancing food production processes as well as diminishing the related environmental impact. Although several efficient deep learning techniques have emerged in the field of multispectral imagery analysis, the crop classification problem still needs more accurate solutions. This work introduces a competitive methodology for crop classification from multispectral satellite imagery mainly using an enhanced 2D convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) designed at a smaller-scale architecture, as well as a novel post-processing step. The proposed methodology contains four steps: image stacking, patch extraction, classification model design (based on a 2D-CNN architecture), and post-processing. First, the images are stacked to increase the number of features. Second, the input images are split into patches and fed into the 2D-CNN model. Then, the 2D-CNN model is constructed within a small-scale framework, and properly trained to recognize 10 different types of crops. Finally, a post-processing step is performed in order to reduce the classification error caused by lower-spatial-resolution images. Experiments were carried over the so-named Campo Verde database, which consists of a set of satellite images captured by Landsat and Sentinel satellites from the municipality of Campo Verde, Brazil. In contrast to the maximum accuracy values reached by remarkable works reported in the literature (amounting to an overall accuracy of about 81%, a f(1) score of 75.89%, and average accuracy of 73.35%), the proposed methodology achieves a competitive overall accuracy of 81.20%, a f(1) score of 75.89%, and an average accuracy of 88.72% when classifying 10 different crops, while ensuring an adequate trade-off between the number of multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) and accuracy. Furthermore, given its ability to effectively classify patches from two image sequences, this methodology may result appealing for other real-world applications, such as the classification of urban materials.

TI  - Response of Different Band Combinations in Gaofen-6 WFV for Estimating of Regional Maize Straw Resources Based on Random Forest Classification
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize straw is a valuable renewable energy source. The rapid and accurate determination of its yield and spatial distribution can promote improved utilization. At present, traditional straw estimation methods primarily rely on statistical analysis that may be inaccurate. In this study, the Gaofen 6 (GF-6) satellite, which combines high resolution and wide field of view (WFV) imaging characteristics, was used as the information source, and the quantity of maize straw resources and spatial distribution characteristics in Qihe County were analyzed. According to the phenological characteristics of the study area, seven classification classes were determined, including maize, buildings, woodlands, wastelands, water, roads, and other crops, to explore the influence of sample separation and test the responsiveness to different land cover types with different waveband combinations. Two supervised classification methods, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), were used to classify the study area, and the influence of the newly added band of GF-6 WFV on the classification accuracy of the study area was analyzed. Furthermore, combined with field surveys and agricultural census data, a method for estimating the quantity of maize straw and analyzing the spatial distribution based on a single-temporal remote sensing image and random forests was proposed. Finally, the accuracy of the measurement results is evaluated at the county level. The results showed that the RF model made better use of the newly added bands of GF-6 WFV and improved the accuracy of classification, compared with the SVM model; the two red-edge bands improved the accuracy of crop classification and recognition; the purple and yellow bands identified non-vegetation more effectively than vegetation, thus minimizing the "salt-and-pepper noise" of classification results. However, the changes to total classification accuracy were not obvious; the theoretical quantity of maize straw in Qihe County in 2018 was 586.08 kt, which reflects an error of only 2.42% compared to the statistical result. Hence, the RF model based on single-temporal GF-6 WFV can effectively estimate regional maize straw yield and spatial distribution, which lays a theoretical foundation for straw recycling.

TI  - Mapping the Habitat Suitability of West Nile Virus Vectors in Southern Quebec and Eastern Ontario, Canada, with Species Distribution Modeling and Satellite Earth Observation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Transmission of vector-borne diseases (VBDs) relies on the presence of their vectors. Good knowledge of their habitat distribution could inform of their presence and then the potential transmission risk. In Canada, West Nile virus (WNV), a VBD transmitted by mosquitoes of the Culex genus to birds, humans, and other mammals, was first reported in 2002. Since then, human cases have been reported every year. To reduce the health burden of the disease and to guide the vector control efforts, this work aims to provide a map of habitat suitability of the main vectors of WNV, Culex pipiens-restuans, in southern Quebec and eastern Ontario at 30 m spatial resolution. Landsat 8-OTI/TIRS images were combined with existing geographical data to characterize vegetated and paved areas in urban and peri-urban areas and to create a land use land cover map related to environmental determinants of Culex pipiens-restuans. Landscape metrics were calculated to characterize the neighborhood environment. They were used with 1008 presence sites of the vectors to build species distribution models with Maxent, a model based on the maximum entropy principle, and to predict habitat suitability for Culex pipiens-restuans in the study area. The performance of the models was very good, with a mean area under the curve of 0.92 and a continuous Boyce index of 0.97. A habitat suitability map of the whole study area was created for Culex pipiens-restuans. The resulting map and environment analysis highlight the importance of the edge of vegetation and mixed or paved areas for the bio-ecology of Culex pipiens-restuans.

TI  - Investigation of Informal Settlement Indicators in a Densely Populated Area Using Very High Spatial Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Automation of informal settlements detection using satellite imagery remains a challenging task in urban remote sensing. This is due to the fact that informal settlements vary in shape, size and spatial arrangement from one region to the other in some cases within a city. This paper investigated the methodology to detect informal settlements in a densely populated township by assessing informal settlement indicators observed from very high spatial resolution satellite imagery. We assessed twelve informal settlement indicators to determine the most effective indicators to distinguish between informal and informal classes. These indicators included the spectral indices first and second-order statistical measurements. In addition to the commonly used informal settlement indicators, we assessed the effectiveness of built-up area and iron cover. The GLCM textural measures performed poorly in separating informal and formal settlements compared to first-order statistics measurement and spectral indices. The built-up area index, coastal blue index and the first-order statistics mean measurements produced higher separability distance of informal and formal settlements. The iron index performed better in separating the two settlement types than the commonly used GLCM measure and NDVI. The proposed ruleset that uses the three features with the highest separability distance achieved producer and user accuracies of informal settlements of 95% and 82%, respectively. The results of this study will contribute towards developing methodologies to automatically detect informal settlements.

TI  - THE THEOCENTRIC WORLDVIEW: SUSTAINABILITY EDUCATION FOR RELIGION AND SPIRITUAL
T2  - JURNAL ILMIAH PEURADEUN
M3  - Article
AB  - Several recent studies started to relate religious beliefs and sustainable behavior. For this reason, there is a high possibility that students' religious beliefs can be a strong impetus for practicing sustainability knowledge. The education for sustainable development (ESD) in universities should not be separated from the meaningful religious belief of university students. Therefore, we proposed the theocentric worldview which centered on a religion-spiritual relationship with God to be included as a part of ESD. This worldview is important in making ESD content meaningful for religious university students. In this paper, we used a religion-spiritual concept from Islamic teachings as an example of how a religious belief can be embedded within ESD for university students.

TI  - Can Famine Be Averted? A Spatiotemporal Assessment of The Impact of Climate Change on Food Security in The Luvuvhu River Catchment of South Africa
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has proved to be a threat to food security the world over. Using temperature and precipitation data, this paper examines the differential effects climate change has on different land uses in the Luvuvhu river catchment in South Africa. The paper uses the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), which were calculated from Landsat images, and the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) for a sample of years between 1980 and 2016 to assess how drought and flood frequency have affected the agricultural environment. The results indicate that the lowest SPI values were recorded in 1996/1997, 2001/2002 and 2014/2015, suggesting the occurrence of drought during these years, while the highest SPI values were recorded in 1997/1998, 2002/2003 and 2004/2005. The relationship between three-month SPI (SPI_3) and VCI was strongest in grassland, and subsistence farming areas with the correlation coefficients of 0.8166 (p = 0.0022) and -0.6172 (p = 0.0431), respectively, indicating that rainfall variability had a high negative impact on vegetation health in those land uses with shallow-rooted plants. The findings of this study are relevant to disaster management planning in South Africa, as well as development of farming response strategies for coping with climate hazards in the country.

The open data policy and global coverage of Sentinel-1 make it a valuable data source for a wide range of SAR-based applications. In this regard, the Google Earth Engine is a key platform for large area analysis with preprocessed Sentinel-1 backscatter images available within a few days after acquisition. To preserve the information content and user freedom, some preprocessing steps (e.g., speckle filtering) are not applied on the ingested Sentinel-1 imagery as they can vary by application. In this technical note, we present a framework for preparing Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter Analysis-Ready-Data in the Google Earth Engine that combines existing and new Google Earth Engine implementations for additional border noise correction, speckle filtering and radiometric terrain normalization. The proposed framework can be used to generate Sentinel-1 Analysis-Ready-Data suitable for a wide range of land and inland water applications. The Analysis Ready Data preparation framework is implemented in the Google Earth Engine JavaScript and Python APIs.

TI  - Effects of inbreeding on performance traits in Karan Fries crossbred cattle
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Present study includes the effect of inbreeding on expected genetic gain and estimation of regression with respect to first lactation production, reproduction and lifetime traits in Karan Fries crossbred cattle maintained at ICAR-NDRI, Karnal. Out of total, only 36.97% were found to be inbred with an average inbreeding coefficient 3.68%. Overall least squares mean for reproduction traits (days) AFC, SP, DP and CI were 1020.41 +/- 5.49, 141.42 +/- 3.86, 74.54 +/- 2.04 and 421.20 +/- 3.81 respectively. For production traits (kg) were 305MY, LL. LTMY, FY and SNFY were 3169.15 +/- 37.87, 353.25 +/- 4.18, 3686.10 +/- 55.10, 266.19 +/- 4.66 and 127.81 +/- 2.26 respectively and lifetime traits like LTMY and stayability were 14588.47 +/- 486.09 (kg) and 2444.69 +/- 41.26 (days) respectively. Among reproduction traits (days), AFC increased by +3.70, DP +3.66 and CI +68.44 however SP decreased by 0.85 d and production traits (kg), 305MY decreased by -10.2 Tmy -16.09, LL -1.23 d, 305FY -1.75, 305SNFY -0.26, LTMY 202.02 and stayability -17.37 days per unit increase in the inbreeding coefficient. Although there was no inbreeding depression in any of the traits except AFC. The expected genetic gain of AFC increased two folds in IBL2 (F-x >5%) as compared to IBL1 (F-x <5) group that is not desirable, so in future, to maintain the optimum genetic gain we should keep inbreeding at optimum level and so more precise pedigree recording and planned mating strategies should be adopted to avoid inbreeding depression in next generation.

TI  - An Alternative Approach for Constraining 3D-Displacements With InSAR, Applied to a Fault-Bounded Groundwater Entrainment Field in California
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We explore the use of elastic Green's functions in inversions of one-dimensional Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations to recover three-dimensional displacement fields. This approach enforces coupling of the horizontal displacements and limits the need for prior assumptions about the subsurface sources, driving the deformation or explicit damping of a given dimension of the full 3D deformation field. We apply these methods to data from the Coachella Valley, California, where artificial groundwater recharge in 2017 and the associated increases in pore pressure resulted in ground displacements of up to 12 cm. This area is covered by Sentinel-1a/b data for two overlapping paths from both ascending and descending orbits, as well as an east-west flight line from the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), providing five unique line-of-sight geometries. The regularization approaches applied to the Sentinel data alone agree in most respects, with the elastically coupled approach producing a slightly better fit to the independent UAVSAR observations. Our results suggest that the 2017 groundwater entrainment in the Coachella Valley is likely associated with significant horizontal displacements that led to contraction across the fault bounding the northern side of the basin, as well as increases in right-lateral sense of strain in some areas along the fault.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper undertakes to explore the perceptions of academics regarding information sharing on social network sites (SNS) and related privacy issues. Specifically, the paper was designed targeting academics using SNS to disseminate information and/or for other academic purposes. The paper is based on a mixed method research, the exploratory stage consequential for the confirmatory stage of the research. The findings of the research highly the complex relationships between personal information collection and usage (PICU) factors, personal information control (PIC) factors, and awareness of the effectiveness of privacy policy (AEPP) factors. This culminates in the formulation of a research model based on the theory of reasoned action. Given that the research took place within a context where gender is significant in shaping the worldview of the individual, groups, and society, the paper also seeks to contribute to the existing gender-based narrative on information sharing and privacy issues on SNS, mainly demystifying gender-based stereotypes.

TI  - Retrieval and Evaluation of Chlorophyll-A Spatiotemporal Variability Using GF-1 Imagery: Case Study of Qinzhou Bay, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is a measure of phytoplankton biomass, and has been used to identify 'red tide' events. However, nearshore waters are optically complex, making the accurate determination of the chlorophyll-a concentration challenging. Therefore, in this study, a typical area affected by the Phaeocystis 'red tide' bloom, Qinzhou Bay, was selected as the study area. Based on the Gaofen-1 remote sensing satellite image and water quality monitoring data, the sensitive bands and band combinations of the nearshore Chl-a concentration of Qinzhou Bay were screened, and a Qinzhou Bay Chl-a retrieval model was constructed through stepwise regression analysis. The main conclusions of this work are as follows: (1) The Chl-a concentration retrieval regression model based on 1/B4 (near-infrared band (NIR)) has the best accuracy (R-2 = 0.67, root-mean-square-error = 0.70 mu g/L, and mean absolute percentage error = 0.23) for the remote sensing of Chl-a concentration in Qinzhou Bay. (2) The spatiotemporal distribution of Chl-a in Qinzhou Bay is varied, with lower concentrations (0.50 mu g/L) observed near the shore and higher concentrations (6.70 mu g/L) observed offshore, with a gradual decreasing trend over time (-0.8).

TI  - Universal Fractal Scaling Laws for Surface Water Bodies and Their Zones of Influence
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is widely known that there are several interdependent phenomena. The zones of influence (ZoIs) of water bodies (WBs) can be considered as typical examples. Over 289000 ZoIs are computed for the corresponding WBs mapped from remotely sensed satellite data of Indian peninsular. The size of WBs ranges between the smallest size of 5.1594 m(2) to 628.1642 km(2), and the range of the ZoIs is in between 416.2497 m(2) to 8862.3362 km(2). The basic geometric measures were computed for all WBs and their ZoIs. These measures were employed to derive power laws that are found scale-invariant, supporting the fact that these interdependent phenomena belong to two different universality classes, and explaining the commonly shared physical mechanisms. It is also inferred that power laws derived for this very large set of WBs and their ZoIs are similar to the ones derived for a smaller data set, that is, they are indeed fractals. The study shows the importance of deriving power-law relationships for natural phenomena mapped from remotely sensed satellite data across very fine to coarse spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions.

TI  - Comparison of SPECT-CT with intraoperative mapping in cervical and uterine malignancies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe objective was to evaluate whether hybrid imaging combining single photon emission tomography with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) provides additional clinical value for dectection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) compared with intraoperative combined mapping in uterine and cervical malignancies.MethodsThis was a retrospective study of prospectively collected data from patients with stages IA-IB2 cervical cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2018) or stage I endometrial cancer, who underwent preoperative SPECT/CT for SLN detection. All included patients had dual injection of technetium-99m (Tc-99m) with patent blue or indocyanine green.ResultsA total of 171 patients were included with 468 SLNs detected during surgery: 146/171 patients (85.4%) had both radiotracer and blue injection whereas 25/171 patients (14.6%) had radiotracer and indocyanine green injected. The overall detection rate was 95.3%. The detection rate of SLN mapping was 74.9% for SPECT/CT, 90.6% for Tc-99m, 91.8% for blue dye, and 100% for indocyanine green. Bilateral drainage was found in 140 patients (81.9%), detected by Tc-99m in 105 patients (61.4%), by blue in 99 patients (67.3%), by indocyanine green in 23 patients (92%), and by SPECT/CT in 62 patients (36.4%). Atypical SLN locations were identified by SPECT/CT in 64 patients (37.4%), by 99mTc in 28 patients (16.4%), by blue in 17 patients (9.9%), and by indocyanine green in 8 patients (4.7%). Sensitivity and negative predictive value of SLN biopsy to detect lymph node metastasis using dual injection of different intraoperative combined techniques were 88.9% and 97.5%, respectively.ConclusionSPECT/CT enhanced topographic delineation of SLN and more accurately identified drainage to atypical locations. Fluorescent SLN mapping using indocyanine green offered the highest SLN detection rate. When indocyanine green was used, SPECT/CT did not increase SLN detection, and did not add further information to improve lymph node localization and removal.

TI  - Simulation of Fluvial Patterns With GANs Trained on a Data Set of Satellite Imagery
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Models that can generate realistic Earth surface patterns are important both for geomorphological applications and as prior models for underdetermined inverse problems. Generative machine learning methods such as GANs and the increasing availability of large remote sensing data sets represents an exciting combination for this purpose. Several studies show promising results for GANs trained on artificial data sets in geostatistics, but it is necessary to further quantify how well such models reproduce and generalize real data. The conditioning ability of GANs is often evaluated based on output which originates from a trained generator. In reality, geophysical data necessarily arises from elsewhere. Here, we use more realistic training data than in previous studies and evaluate performance using an extensive set of metrics and real images outside the training data set. The data set consists of multispectral satellite imagery of 38 large river deltas, a type of Earth surface pattern which is limited in number. The channel network is used to create training images with four sedimentary facies, which are subsequently used to train a Wasserstein GAN of deltaic 2D patterns. GANs successfully reproduce all training data characteristics and produce manifold the number of combinations with respect to the training data. However, there does not seem to be an infinite number of discrete combinations of facies, and the posterior landscapes are not well-shaped for efficient exploration in the presence of so-called hard data. Thus, GANs should have many exciting applications in geosciences, but it will depend on the type of measurement data.

M3  - Article
AB  - For many years, humorist Ephraim Kishon diligently brandished his satirical whip at Israel's socio-economic socialist structure, while vividly portraying the vicissitudes of the Israeli 'homo economicus' in the labyrinth of modern life. This line of writing brought him his fame, both in Israel and abroad. At the later stages of his career though, a significant portion of his work was dedicated to the relationship between Israel and its neighbors and between Israel and the world. In this area Kishon has articulated and cemented a stern nationalistic worldview. A systematic analysis of this worldview is a matter for several articles. In this article I will focus on Kishon's treatment of national entities that are not part of Israel's immediate circle of confrontation (i.e., its neighboring Arab states) but are rather scattered far and wide all over the world.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mayo-Kani Division, which is a part of the far north region of Cameroon, has exploitable mineral and water resources. Researchers are confronted with its subsurface complexity and structural diversity. They find it extremely difficult to represent it through maps and models. In this paper, the potential remote sensing data have been enhanced by the tilt derivative (TDR) and the horizontal tilt angle derivative (TDR_THDR) techniques. The TDR and TDR_THDR maps have been plotted and interpreted. They enable to determine the abnormal sources average depths between 400 and 8000 m. These maps also showed that directions N-S, E-W, NW-SE and NE-SW are the main trends affecting the study area. The subsurface configuration was exposed using geological 2D gravity and magnetic forward modeling through two selected profiles above the study area. 2D geological models have shown an average sedimentary thickness of around 3000 m, with gravity densities between 2.3 g/cm(3) and 2.6 g/cm(3) and magnetic susceptibilities between 0.02 and 0.05. This modeling allows delineating the structural subsurface framework, which is likely to contribute to the demarcation of the sectors offering promising prospects for the mineral resources exploration.

TI  - Mangrove Forest Landcover Changes in Coastal Vietnam: A Case Study from 1973 to 2020 in Thanh Hoa and Nghe An Provinces
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests can ameliorate the impacts of typhoons and storms, but their extent is threatened by coastal development. The northern coast of Vietnam is especially vulnerable as typhoons frequently hit it during the monsoon season. However, temporal change information in mangrove cover distribution in this region is incomplete. Therefore, this study was undertaken to detect change in the spatial distribution of mangroves in Thanh Hoa and Nghe An provinces and identify reasons for the cover change. Landsat satellite images from 1973 to 2020 were analyzed using the NDVI method combined with visual interpretation to detect mangrove area change. Six LULC classes were categorized: mangrove forest, other forests, aquaculture, other land use, mudflat, and water. The mangrove cover in Nghe An province was estimated to be 66.5 ha in 1973 and increased to 323.0 ha in 2020. Mangrove cover in Thanh Hoa province was 366.1 ha in 1973, decreased to 61.7 ha in 1995, and rose to 791.1 ha in 2020. Aquaculture was the main reason for the loss of mangroves in both provinces. Overall, the percentage of mangrove loss from aquaculture was 42.5% for Nghe An province and 60.1% for Thanh Hoa province. Mangrove restoration efforts have contributed significantly to mangrove cover, with more than 1300 ha being planted by 2020. This study reveals that improving mangrove restoration success remains a challenge for these provinces, and further refinement of engineering techniques is needed to improve restoration outcomes.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity Retrieval From Nighttime Middle-Infrared and Thermal-Infrared Sentinel-3 Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) onboard the two Sentinel-3 satellites provides daily global coverage observation at daytime and nighttime. The split-window (SW) algorithm is currently used to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) from SLSTR images; however, this algorithm has to utilize visible and near-infrared (VNIR) images and land cover to determine pixel emissivity. For nighttime observation, VNIR cannot be observed, and this limitation complicates the LST retrieval from nighttime images using the SW algorithm. This article proposed a three-channel temperature-emissivity separation (TES) algorithm that estimates the nighttime LST and emissivity from one middle-infrared (MIR) and two thermal-infrared (TIR) nighttime Sentinel-3 SLSTR images. The sensitive analysis showed that the algorithm could theoretically retrieve the LST and emissivity with errors less than 0.8 K and 0.015, respectively. Ground validation showed that the nighttime LST retrieval error was approximately 1.84 K and the bias was approximately -0.33 K. Finally, the TES algorithm was applied to obtain the LST and emissivity images over northern China as an example. The emissivity retrieved from the nighttime observation can be used in the daytime SW algorithm to improve its feasibility in the LST retrieval process.

AB  - The objective of the research is to study the attitudes towards Karate correlated with the world of values of the apprentices. A diagnostic survey is the main method of the study: a direct extended questionnaire from Cynarski (2006), as an auxiliary questionnaire A and a survey questionnaire "Perception of martial arts by young practitioners. Motives and effects of training, values of martial arts versus other values "with Rokeach's scale of values (Rokeach, 1973). The research material is based on statements of respondents obtained from the national team of the Polish Traditional Karate Association. N = 16 (18 to 20 years old). Respondents associate karate practice and observing the spirit of martial arts with their own philosophy of life. They also see the positive and multifaceted impact of karate on his personality. On the instrumental value scale, "forgiveness" is rated higher by those who do not recognize the habit of continuous goal pursuit as the most important value in their lives. In turn, "family security" is rated higher. The spirit of continuous self-improvement is internalized by trainees who transfer the values and principles of martial arts into their lives. In the case of the karate contestants studied, the impact of the training room rules on their axiology and worldview was found to be in accordance with the stated hierarchy of values.

TI  - Impact of Assimilating FY-3D MWTS-2 Upper Air Sounding Data on Forecasting Typhoon Lekima (2019)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) clear-sky microwave temperature sounder-2 (MWTS-2) radiances were directly assimilated in the regional mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model using the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) data assimilation system. The assimilation experiments were conducted to compare the track errors of typhoon Lekima from uses of the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) radiances (EXP_AD) with those from FY-3D MWTS-2 upper-air sounding data at channels 5-7 (EXP_AMD). The clear-sky mean bias-corrected observation-minus-background (O-B) values of FY-3D MWTS-2 channels 5, 6, and 7 are 0.27, 0.10 and 0.57 K, respectively, which are smaller than those without bias corrections. Compared with the control experiment, which was the forecast of the WRF model without use of satellite data, the assimilation of satellite radiances can improve the forecast performance and reduce the mean track error by 8.7% (similar to 18.4 km) and 30% (similar to 58.6 km) beyond 36 h through the EXP_AD and EXP_AMD, respectively. The direction of simulated steering flow changed from southwest in the EXP_AD to southeast in the EXP_AMD, which can be pivotal to forecasting the landfall of typhoon Lekima (2019) three days in advance. Assimilation of MWTS-2 upper-troposphere channels 5-7 has great potential to improve the track forecasts for typhoon Lekima.

TI  - Climate and Socioeconomic Factors Drive Irrigated Agriculture Dynamics in the Lower Colorado River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Colorado River Basin (CRB) includes seven states and provides municipal and industrial water to millions of people across all major southwestern cities both inside and outside the basin. Agriculture is the largest part of the CRB economy and crop production depends on irrigation, which accounts for about 74% of the total water demand cross the region. A better understanding of irrigation water demands is critically needed as temperatures continue to rise and drought intensifies, potentially leading to water shortages across the region. Yet, past research on irrigation dynamics has generally utilized relatively low spatiotemporal resolution datasets and has often overlooked the relationship between climate and management decisions such as land fallowing, i.e., the practice of leaving cultivated land idle for a growing season. Here, we produced annual estimates of fallow and active cropland extent at high spatial resolution (30 m) from 2001 to 2017 by applying the fallow-land algorithm based on neighborhood and temporal anomalies (FANTA). We specifically focused on diverse CRB agricultural regions: the lower Colorado River planning (LCRP) area and the Pinal and Phoenix active management areas (PPAMA). Utilizing ground observations collected in 2014 and 2017, we found an overall classification accuracy of 88.9% and 87.2% for LCRP and PPAMA, respectively. We then quantified how factors such as climate, district water rights, and market value influenced: (1) annual fallow and active cropland extent and (2) annual cropland productivity, approximated by integrated growing season NDVI (iNDVI). We found that for the LCRP, a region of winter cropping and senior (i.e., preferential) water rights, active cropland productivity was positively correlated with cool-season average vapor pressure deficit (R = 0.72; p < 0.01). By contrast, for the PPAMA, a region of summer cropping and junior water rights, annual fallow and active cropland extent was positively correlated with cool-season aridity (precipitation/potential evapotranspiration) (R = 0.46; p < 0.05), and active cropland productivity was positively correlated with warm-season aridity (precipitation/potential evapotranspiration) (R = 0.42; p < 0.01). We also found that PPAMA cropland productivity was more sensitive to aridity when crop prices were low, potentially due to the influence of market value on management decisions. Our analysis highlights how biophysical (e.g., temperature and precipitation) and socioeconomic (e.g., water rights and crop market value) factors interact to explain seasonal patterns of cropland extent, water use and productivity. These findings indicate that increasing aridity across the region may result in reduced cropland productivity and increased land fallowing for some regions, particularly those with junior water rights.

TI  - Debris Flow and Rockslide Analysis with Advanced Photogrammetry Techniques Based on High-Resolution RPAS Data. Ponte Formazza Case Study (NW Alps)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of a Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) for the characterization and monitoring of landslides has been widely improved in the last decade. In particular, the use of this system is particularly effective for the study of areas prone to geohazards. Zones affected by landslides, such as rock slides and debris flows, are often quite critical in terms of accessibility due to unstable blocs that can strongly limit the direct access to the studied area. In this paper, we present the case study of Ponte Formazza in NW Italian Alps. In June 2019, a massive and complex debris flow re-mobilized about 300,000 m(3) of a rockslide deposit that occurred in 2009. In this particular environment, we tested traditional, direct and mixed photogrammetric approaches using various configurations of Ground Control Points (GCPs) of the photogrammetric block and by calculating the relative errors. The minimum configuration of GCPs was established to reduce in situ measurements without degrading the accuracy of the cartographic products. The images of three RPAS campaigns (2017, 2018 and 2019), processed with a Structure from Motion (SfM) technique, allowed us to obtain very high-resolution orthophoto and digital surface models (DSMs) before and after the 2019 event. A few GCPs, geolocated with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), improved the orthophoto and DSM quality (Root Mean Squared Error RMSE 5 cm) even in the areas far from the drone deployment. The availability of high-resolution models has been fundamental for the identification of the volume changes. Furthermore, the 3D view supported and completed the geomorphological mapping of affected areas, particularly in the areas where the field survey is dangerous. The use of ancillary meteorological data and Sentinel-2 satellite images allows for a better definition of the kinematics and the predisposal and triggering factors of the 2019 debris flow.

TI  - Moon Mapping Project Results on Solar Wind Ion Flux and Composition
T2  - UNIVERSE
M3  - Article
AB  - The "Moon Mapping" project is a collaboration between the Italian and Chinese Governments allowing cooperation and exchange between students from both countries. The main aim of the project is to analyze remotely-sensed data collected by the Chinese space missions Chang'E-1/2 over the Moon surface. The Italian Space Agency is responsible for the Italian side and the Center of Space Exploration, while the China Ministry of Education is responsible for the Chinese side. In this article, we summarize the results of the "Moon Mappining" project topic #1: "map of the solar wind ion" using the data collected by Chang'E-1 satellite. Chang'E-1 is a lunar orbiter, its revolution period lasts 2 h, and its orbit is polar. The satellite is equipped with two Solar Wind Ion Detectors (SWIDs) that are two perpendicular electrostatic spectrometers mapping the sky with a field of view of 15 degrees x 6.7 degrees x 24 ch. The spectrometers can measure solar wind flux in the range 40 eV/q-17 keV/q with an energy resolution of 8% and time resolution of similar to 3 s. The data collected by the two Solar Wind Ion Detectors are analyzed to characterize the solar wind flux and composition on the Moon surface and to study the time variations due to the solar activity. The data measured by Chang'E-1 compared with the one measured in the same period by the electrostatic spectrometers onboard the ACE satellite, or with another solar activity indicator as the sunspot number, enrich the multi-messenger/multi-particle view of the Sun, gathering valuable information about the space weather outside the Earth magnetosphere.

TI  - Oblique High Mach Number Heliospheric Shocks: The Role of <i>α</i> Particles
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spacecraft observations of heliospheric shocks often find oscillations in the magnetic field and density both, upstream and downstream. The downstream magnetic oscillations of oblique collisionless shocks were detected by Wind with 10.9 samples s(-1) and DSCOVR spacecraft with high temporal resolution of 50 samples s(-1). The density oscillations associated with the shocks are also evident in proton and alpha particle density by Wind (with much lower temporal resolution). Recently, we have investigated low Mach number low-beta oblique shock oscillations using satellite data and 2.5D hybrid modeling with electrons modeled as fluid and ions modeled as particles and found that alpha particles-an important component of heliospheric plasma-may affect considerably the downstream oscillations and the shock structure. The objective of the present study is to investigate the effects of alpha particles on high Mach number heliospheric shocks dynamics, oscillations, nonstationarity, and shock-front rippling. We extend the study to high Mach number shocks (M > 3), investigate several alpha particle typical densities, and compare the results for the various shock parameters. We model the effects of alpha particles on the shock ramp, wake, and downstream oscillation structure and the kinetic properties of proton and alpha particle velocity distributions at various locations downstream of the shocks. Using the 2.5D hybrid model we found that the modeled high Mach number quasi-perpendicular shock magnetic and density structures are significantly affected by alpha particles with typical solar wind relative abundances, suggesting that the observed high Mach number shocks are similarly affected by alpha particles.

TI  - Updating Standards of Facial Growth in Romanian Children and Adolescents Using the Anthropometric Method-A Pilot Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The anthropometric method is an important tri-dimensional and non-invasive assessment instrument for accurate diagnosis in paedodontics, orthodontics, and other medical fields. Our aim was to propose a technique that is accessible for clinicians and to determine the reference values for Romanian children and adolescents for the facial parameters selected. We proposed three basic instruments: a plastic compass, a ruler, and a digital caliper. Eighty-five children and adolescents (62% girls and 38% boys), aged between 3.5 and 14.5 years, were included in the study. We selected eight transversal, 12 vertical, and three sagittal measurements. Facial indices, according to Farkas L.G., were directly determined. The correlations between facial and general growth parameters, using Pearson correlation coefficient, for the entire sample were significant, direct, and strong for the following: Zy-Zy, Go-Go, N-Gn, N-Sn, Sto-Gn, Tr-Gn, Tr-Sn, Tr-Tr (r = 0.526-0.925, p < 0.001), and insignificant for Sn-Sto (r = 0.099-0.124, p > 0.354). The highest correlation coefficient is exhibited by Tr-Gn (r = 0.893 with height and r = 0.925 with weight). When performing a gender related comparison, we noticed that the vertical and transversal linear parameters and some facial indices are increased in boys (p < 0.05), depending on the age group. The simplified anthropometric technique represents an accessible method to every clinician, bringing important information related to dentofacial growth, diagnosis, and treatment planning in dentistry.

TI  - A Modeling Application for GHG Fluxes Estimates in Betel Nuts Plantations in Taiwan
T2  - PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Perennial woody crops could have a positive impact on carbon balance, absorbing carbon during growing season and storing it for several years, whereas annual crops do not have this particular effect. Usually, techniques for GHG (greenhouse gases) flux measurements have limited spatial representativeness, with some difficulties to extend leaf measurements to field scale. Models, especially if supported by remote sensing data, allow for upscaling the monitoring of these fluxes. The aim of this work was to evaluate the carbon fluxes (gross primary production, GPP; net ecosystem production, NEP) of the betel nut cultivars in Taiwan by a vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM). The model permitted estimating seasonal dynamics of GPP in a moist tropical evergreen forest. These plantations are very common in Taiwan and their role could be significant in environmental and development policies even though, until now, the consumption of the fruit of this tree is at the center of controversy due to their use and effects on the population. To obtain estimates of carbon fluxes on a large area that would appreciate its spatial variability, a model based on physiological processes was used. This model incorporated a series of procedures and monthly mean meteorological data, light use efficiency, and satellite enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were used as inputs. An additional purpose of this work was to compare the carbon uptake of different cultivars in Taiwan and Italy. Using a different model, always based on light use efficiency, a similar project was carried on Italian vineyards, with other climate conditions and different agricultural practices.

TI  - Land Cover-Specific Local Incidence Angle Correction: A Method for Time-Series Analysis of Forest Ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study deals with a local incidence angle correction method, i.e., the land cover-specific local incidence angle correction (LC-SLIAC), based on the linear relationship between the backscatter values and the local incidence angle (LIA) for a given land cover type in the monitored area. Using the combination of CORINE Land Cover and Hansen et al.'s Global Forest Change databases, a wide range of different LIAs for a specific forest type can be generated for each scene. The algorithm was developed and tested in the cloud-based platform Google Earth Engine (GEE) using Sentinel-1 open access data, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model, and CORINE Land Cover and Hansen et al.'s Global Forest Change databases. The developed method was created primarily for time-series analyses of forests in mountainous areas. LC-SLIAC was tested in 16 study areas over several protected areas in Central Europe. The results after correction by LC-SLIAC showed a reduction of variance and range of backscatter values. Statistically significant reduction in variance (of more than 40%) was achieved in areas with LIA range >50 degrees and LIA interquartile range (IQR) >12 degrees, while in areas with low LIA range and LIA IQR, the decrease in variance was very low and statistically not significant. Six case studies with different LIA ranges were further analyzed in pre- and post-correction time series. Time-series after the correction showed a reduced fluctuation of backscatter values caused by different LIAs in each acquisition path. This reduction was statistically significant (with up to 95% reduction of variance) in areas with a difference in LIA greater than or equal to 27 degrees. LC-SLIAC is freely available on GitHub and GEE, making the method accessible to the wide remote sensing community.

TI  - Depth Inversion of Coastal Waters Based on Bi-LSTM
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - With some offshore waters in China as the study area, relying on the bidirectional long short-term memory (Hi-I,STM), we established a model for optimizing and inverting the Sentinel-2A image data on August 20, 2017, and the measured water depth data by a single-beam sounding system. Then, the water depth was compared with that of traditional inversion methods in terms of accuracy. The results show that the model proposed in this paper achieves the optimal evaluation indexes, with root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean relative error (MRE) of 0.85 m and 18.93%, respectively. The MRE is 14%-29% higher than those of other methods. In particular, the RMSE in the 0-2 m offshore shallow water region displays a sharp rise of 0.68 m. Furthermore, 5 fold cross validation was used to test the network model cyclically, demonstrating the highest and most stable accuracy of Hi-LSTM. This model can invert coastal water depth with high accuracy and stability, and also apply to the depth inversion of regions without training samples, meeting the marine needs such as resource development, engineering construction, and environmental protection.

TI  - Impacts of Land Use/Land Cover Distributions and Vegetation Amount on Land Surface Temperature Simulation in East China
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) plays a crucial role in the earth system because its heterogeneous spatial distributions can trigger local circulations through land surface-atmosphere interactions. An accurate simulation of the LST spatial distribution heavily rely on the accuracy of the land surface characteristics, such as LULC (land use/land cover). To investigate the impact of uncertainty in LULC maps on LST simulation, the Community Land Model, version 4.5 (CLM4.5), was used in this study with four LULC products as overlying vegetation characteristics. East China, with its complex land surface characteristics, was employed as the study area. The simulation results were compared to the observations at nine China Meteorological Administration (CMA) stations and to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data (MOIDIS_LST) over the whole study region. Based on the comparison at CMA stations, CLM4.5 can properly simulate ground temperature. However, large differences are found between MODIS_LST and the simulated LST, particularly over crop areas. Comparison of simulated results using different LULC products showed a large dissimilarity over forest areas, mainly due to the different identification methods for forest types. Large biases in the prescribed leaf area index (LAI) of the model are also found compared with MODIS_LAI. Then, the LAI in the model default data was replaced by the MODIS_LAI product, which greatly reduces the LST simulation biases. These findings provide insights into improving the simulation of LST and land-atmosphere interactions in regional weather models or global climate models.

TI  - Stylistic and Semantic Features of Epitaphs (Based on Texts of Provincial Cemeteries in Perm Krai). Part II
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The second part of the article describes semantic features of folklore epitaphs - the most numerous collection in the corpus of poetic inscriptions, which is based on field surveys of Perm cemeteries. The denotative space of folklore epitaphs has undoubted significance for characterizing the mental categorization of the world among representatives of urban culture since it reveals the worldview of city dwellers in the field of eschatological issues. The analysis of the denotative content of folklore epitaphs comes down to the identification of textual universals - "space", "time", "person". The procedure for their characterization involves the definition and semiotic interpretation of the circle of vocabulary with the corresponding denotation - spatial, temporal, subjective. The analysis of the material showed that the spatial coordinates of the folklore epitaphs are set by the oppositions earth - sky and this world - that world. The movement of time is predominantly inscribed in a linear extent and is occasionally delivered vitally. The main subjects of communication are the "living" and the "dead" despite the fact that the content bias is towards the "dead". The "dead" have social, emotional and external characteristics, and are also attributed to the type of death, the posthumous hypostasis and its signs. The "living" are only awarded cognitive-psychological portraiture. The denotative space of the text is interfaced with other levels of content - emotive and conceptual. In the emotive space of epitaph texts, the sensitivity of the "living" is characterized by love, sorrow, sadness, pride, longing, guilt, grief, pain, wound, flour, tears, and the "dead" only by love. At the conceptual level, the symbolism captured in the cemetery texts attracts attention. It includes the following linguistic and cultural signs: angel, birch, wind, eternity, city, door, house, soul, living, life, star, earth, dead, grave, heaven, peace, light, tears, death, dream, that world, grass, care, flower, this world. Their cohesion is determined by the entry into the semantic oppositions earth - sky, this - that, living - dead, life - death, light - dark. However, the text "charge" of these symbols is not the same. The nuclear vocabulary of the statistical measurement of texts, the development of emotive content, as well as the thematic elaboration of the subject category suggest that the core of the epitaphs is the category of the living and the dead. The remaining symbolism is built on this basis and contributes to its conceptualization in texts. The described semantic categories of folklore epitaphs reproduce mainly the Christian model of the universe with its three-part spatial structure, linearity of time, the posthumous life of the soul and its ability to shine. The inclusions of pagan nature in the revealed picture are almost invisible - these are the once-indicated repeatability of time and the possibility of returning to the world in other forms.

TI  - Assessing the Spaceborne 183.31-GHz Radiometric Channel Geolocation Using High-Altitude Lakes, Ice Shelves, and SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this work is to perform the geolocation error assessment of the channel imagery at 183.31 GHz of the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS). The frequency around 183.31 GHz still represents the highest channel frequency of current spaceborne microwave and millimeter-wave radiometers. The latter will be extended to frequencies up to 664 GHz, as in the case of EUMETSAT Ice Cloud Imager (ICI). This use of submillimeter observations unfortunately prevents a straightforward geolocation error assessment using landmarkbased techniques. We used SSMIS data at 183.31 GHz as a submillimeter proxy to identify the most suitable targets for geolocation error validation in very dry atmospheric conditions, as suggested by radiative transfer modeling. Using a yearly SSMIS data set, three candidates' landmark targets are selected: 1) highaltitude lakes and high-latitude bays using a coastline reference database and 2) Antarctic ice shelves using coastlines derived from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. Data processing is carried out by using spatial cross correlation methods in the spatial frequency domain and performing a numerical sensitivity analysis to contour displacement. Cloud masking, based on a fuzzy-logic approach, is applied to automatically selected clear-air days. The results show that the average geolocation error is about 6.2 km for mountainous lakes and sea bays and 5.4 km for ice shelves, with a standard deviation of about 2.7 and 2.0 km, respectively. The results are in line with SSMIS previous estimates, whereas annual clear-air days are about 10% for mountainous lakes and sea bays and 18% for ice shelves.

TI  - River Planform Extraction From High-Resolution SAR Images via Generalized Gamma Distribution Superpixel Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The extraction of river planforms from remotely sensed satellite images is a task of crucial importance to many applications such as land planning, water resource monitoring, or flood prediction. In this article, we present a novel framework for the extraction of rivers from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, based on superpixel segmentation and subsequent classification. Superpixel segmentation is achieved by a modeling of the image pixels' amplitudes and spatial coordinates as a finite mixture model, where the generalized Gamma distribution is used to model accurately a variety of high-resolution SAR scenes. A number of features describing image texture and statistics are extracted on a superpixel level, facilitating the identification of river superpixels-planforms are then extracted by unsupervised, agglomerative clustering, thus eliminating the need for labeled training data. We present the results of our proposed method on the ICEYE-X2 and SENTINEL-1 SAR data, demonstrating its ability to produce pixel-accurate river masks.

TI  - Mineral Detection Using Sharpened VNIR and SWIR Bands of Worldview-3 Satellite Imagery
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldview-3 satellite imagery provides panchromatic images with a high spatial resolution and visible near infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands with a low spatial resolution. These images can be used for various applications such as environmental analysis, urban monitoring and surveying for sustainability. In this study, mineral detection was performed using Worldview-3 satellite imagery. A pansharpening technique was applied to the spatial resolution of the panchromatic image to effectively utilize the VNIR and SWIR bands of Worldview-3 satellite imagery. The following representative similarity analysis techniques were implemented for the mineral detection: the spectral angle mapper (SAM), spectral information divergence (SID) and the normalized spectral similarity score (NS3). In addition, pixels that could be estimated to indicate minerals were calculated by applying an empirical threshold to each similarity analysis result. A majority voting technique was applied to the results of each similarity analysis and pixels estimated to indicate minerals were finally selected. The results of each similarity analysis were compared to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed methods. From that comparison, it could be confirmed that false negative and false positive rates decreased when the methods proposed in the present study were applied.

TI  - IASI-Derived Sea Surface Temperature Data Set for Climate Studies
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) is an essential climate variable, that is directly used in climate monitoring. Although satellite measurements can offer continuous global coverage, obtaining a long-term homogeneous satellite-derived SST data set suitable for climate studies based on a single instrument is still a challenge. In this work, we assess a homogeneous SST data set derived from reprocessed Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) level-1 (L1C) radiance data. The SST is computed using Planck's Law and simple atmospheric corrections. We assess the data set using the ERA5 reanalysis and the EUMETSAT-released IASI level-2 SST product. Over the entire period, the reprocessed IASI SST shows a mean global difference with ERA5 close to zero, a mean absolute bias under 0.5 degrees C, with a SD of difference around 0.3 degrees C and a correlation coefficient over 0.99. In addition, the reprocessed data set shows a stable bias and SD, which is an advantage for climate studies. The interannual variability and trends were compared with other SST data sets: ERA5, Hadley Centre's SST (HadISST), and NOAA's Optimal Interpolation SST Analysis (OISSTv2). We found that the reprocessed SST data set is able to capture the patterns of interannual variability well, showing the same areas of high interannual variability (>1.5 degrees C), including over the tropical Pacific in January corresponding to the El Nino Southern Oscillation. Although the period studied is relatively short, we demonstrate that the IASI data set reproduces the same trend patterns found in the other data sets (i.e., cooling trend in the North Atlantic, warming trend over the Mediterranean).

TI  - A Novel Approach for the Snow Water Equivalent Retrieval Using X-Band Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, an algorithm for snow depth (SD) and snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieval is proposed based on a polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) decomposition model and field measured snow data. The field campaigns were conducted at the Dhundi observatory (in the Indian Himalaya) in January 2016 and 2018. The field-measured data are used here to build a linear regression between wetness ( w) and the imaginary part of the snow permittivity (epsilon ''), and the validation of retrieved SD and SWE. The snow density (rho(s)) and w are calculated with a generalized volume parameter derived using a theoretical model and SAR data (coherency matrix). These snow parameters and the field-based regression relating w and epsilon '' are eventually used for the SD and SWE retrieval. Three TerraSAR-X scenes of the quad-polarization X-band data acquired in January 2016 are used to study the effect of the snow conditions on the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. The mean absolute error (MAE), rootmean-square error (RMSE), and index of agreement (IOA) for SD are 4.84 cm, 5.12 cm, and 0.71, respectively. On the other hand, for SWE, it is 1.42 cm, 1.53 cm, and 0.71, respectively.

TI  - Coherent Satellite Monitoring of the Water Cycle Over the Amazon. Part 2: Total Water Storage Change and River Discharge Estimation
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In companion paper 1, the SAtellite Water Cycle (SAWC) satellite data set integration approach was presented. SAWC accounts for (1) the closure of the water budget at the sub-basin scale by (2) using upstream/downstream dependencies. Here, the SAWC database is used to reconstruct a missing water component. The total water storage change (dS) can be reconstructed prior to the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) period. In terms of seasonal and interannual variations, SAWC provides long-term dS estimates that are highly consistent with the GRACE estimate (2002-2015). When compared to the extent of inundation, correlation of anomalies reaches 0.6 over sub-basins presenting large floodplain. A strong relationship (correlation of 0.7) exists between the monthly dS and the El Nino index. The river discharge R can also be estimated using the SAWC approach during the GRACE period. A scheme was developed to estimate R continuously along the river through the indirect interpolation of discharge station measurements by using satellite estimates of dS, precipitation P, and evaporation E. These R estimates along the river were evaluated with 80 independent measurements and had a correlation of 0.86 and a Kling-Gupta efficiency index of 0.71. A comprehensive monthly river discharge estimate was proposed for the first time across the Amazon basin over 13 years (2002-2015) at a 0.25 degrees resolution. The SAWC framework is a pure observation tool for integrating a large range of satellite estimates, potentially facilitating the assimilation of such data into land surface models.

TI  - Using Landsat Imagery to Assess Burn Severity of National Forest Inventory Plots
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the frequency and size of wildfires increase, accurate assessment of burn severity is essential for understanding fire effects and evaluating post-fire vegetation impacts. Remotely-sensed imagery allows for rapid assessment of burn severity, but it also needs to be field validated. Permanent forest inventory plots can provide burn severity information for the field validation of remotely-sensed burn severity metrics, although there is often a mismatch between the size and shape of the inventory plot and the resolution of the rasterized images. For this study, we used two distinct datasets: (1) ground-based inventory data from the United States national forest inventory to calculate ground-based burn severity; and (2) remotely-sensed data from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) database to calculate different remotely-sensed burn severity metrics based on six weighting scenarios. Our goals were to test which MTBS metric would best align with the burn severity of national inventory plots observed on the ground, and to identify the superior weighting scenarios to extract pixel values from a raster image in order to match burn severity of the national inventory plots. We fitted logistic and ordinal regression models to predict the ground-based burn severity from the remotely-sensed burn severity averaged from six weighting scenarios. Among the weighting scenarios, two scenarios assigned weights to pixels based on the area of a pixel that intersected any parts of a national inventory plot. Based on our analysis, 9-pixel weighted averages of the Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) values best predicted the ground-based burn severity of national inventory plots. Finally, the pixel specific weights that we present can be used to link other Landsat-derived remote sensing metrics with United States forest inventory plots.

TI  - Surface Water Changes in Dongting Lake from 1975 to 2019 Based on Multisource Remote-Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dongting Lake plays an important role in water regulation and biodiversity protection, but it is vulnerable to climate change and human activities. To quantify surface water changes and factors driving them, long-term surface water variation in Dongting Lake was investigated using the multiple spectral indices method based on a decision tree classification for full time-series Landsat and MODIS datasets. Factors influencing surface water changes were explored by combining the annual maximum surface water and annual permanent occurrent water with meteorological and hydrological data. The results showed that both annual maximum surface water and annual permanent water decreased from 1975 to 2019 and the trends of rainfall and runoff at three outlets also changed. The annual maximum surface water surface of Dongting Lake increased during the 1990s due to high rainfall but decreased again after 2000. A significant change in both the hydrological stage and surface water sequence from 1986 to 2019 occurred in 2003, which coincided with the beginning of work to construct the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). The surface water decreased by about 360 km(2) and runoff at the three outlets decreased by about 150 x 10(8) m(3) after the impoundment of the TGD, which was likely the main cause of surface water changes after 2003. The area of surface water that changed from permanent water in the pre-TGD period into seasonally occurring water in the post-TGD periods is 209 km(2), while the area of surface water that changed from seasonally occurring water in the pre-TGD period into permanent occurrent water in the post-TGD period is 31 km(2). Meteorological elements and human activities have had a comprehensive impact on surface water changes in Dongting Lake. Rainfall and temperature account for about one-third of the influence on long-term changes of surface water, and rainfall is the main meteorological driving factor of surface water in the wet season, while temperature is the main factor in the dry season. Runoff at three outlets, four rivers and the Chenglingji explain about half of the change in surface water; the three outlets runoff is mainly affected by human activities and is the main hydrological driving factor of surface water. The monthly maximum surface water fluctuates regularly and Dongting Lake has a strong seasonal characteristic. Indeed, the seasonal changes are significantly altered when drought or flooding occurs, the causes of which are diverse and complex.

TI  - Quantifying the Response of German Forests to Drought Events via Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest systems provide crucial ecosystem functions to our environment, such as balancing carbon stocks and influencing the local, regional and global climate. A trend towards an increasing frequency of climate change induced extreme weather events, including drought, is hereby a major challenge for forest management. Within this context, the application of remote sensing data provides a powerful means for fast, operational and inexpensive investigations over large spatial scales and time. This study was dedicated to explore the potential of satellite data in combination with harmonic analyses for quantifying the vegetation response to drought events in German forests. The harmonic modelling method was compared with a z-score standardization approach and correlated against both, meteorological and topographical data. Optical satellite imagery from Landsat and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was used in combination with three commonly applied vegetation indices. Highest correlation scores based on the harmonic modelling technique were computed for the 6th harmonic degree. MODIS imagery in combination with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) generated hereby best results for measuring spectral response to drought conditions. Strongest correlation between remote sensing data and meteorological measures were observed for soil moisture and the self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI). Furthermore, forests regions over sandy soils with pine as the dominant tree type were identified to be particularly vulnerable to drought. In addition, topographical analyses suggested mitigated drought affects along hill slopes. While the proposed approaches provide valuable information about vegetation dynamics as a response to meteorological weather conditions, standardized in-situ measurements over larger spatial scales and related to drought quantification are required for further in-depth quality assessment of the used methods and data.

TI  - Tower-Based Remote Sensing Reveals Mechanisms Behind a Two-phased Spring Transition in a Mixed-Species Boreal Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The boreal forest is a major contributor to the global climate system, therefore, reducing uncertainties in how the forest will respond to a changing climate is critical. One source of uncertainty is the timing and drivers of the spring transition. Remote sensing can provide important information on this transition, but persistent foliage greenness, seasonal snow cover, and a high prevalence of mixed forest stands (both deciduous and evergreen species) complicate interpretation of these signals. We collected tower-based remotely sensed data (reflectance-based vegetation indices and Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence [SIF]), stem radius measurements, gross primary productivity, and environmental conditions in a boreal mixed forest stand. Evaluation of this data set shows a two-phased spring transition. The first phase is the reactivation of photosynthesis and transpiration in evergreens, marked by an increase in relative SIF, and is triggered by thawed stems, warm air temperatures, and increased available soil moisture. The second phase is a reduction in bulk photoprotective pigments in evergreens, marked by an increase in the Chlorophyll-Carotenoid Index. Deciduous leaf-out occurs during this phase, marked by an increase in all remotely sensed metrics. The second phase is controlled by soil thaw. Our results demonstrate that remote sensing metrics can be used to detect specific physiological changes in boreal tree species during the spring transition. The two-phased transition explains inconsistencies in remote sensing estimates of the timing and drivers of spring recovery. Our results imply that satellite-based observations will improve by using a combination of vegetation indices and SIF, along with species distribution information.Plain Language Summary The boreal forest is one of the most sensitive regions on the planet to climate change, yet its sensitivity remains poorly understood. In particular, the timing and drivers of the spring transition, as the forest changes from a winter adapted state to a summer adapted state, carry significant uncertainties. Remote sensing metrics can be used to characterize the spring transition, but their interpretation is complicated by persistent greenness, frequent snow cover, and a high prevalence of forests containing both deciduous and evergreen species. We collected tower-based remotely sensed metrics, stem radius, and carbon uptake measurements and show that the spring transition occurs in two distinct phases. The first phase is a reactivation of photosynthesis in evergreens and is triggered by thawed stems, warm air temperature, and moist soil. The second phase is a change in evergreen photoprotective pigment levels and the leaf-out of deciduous species. It is triggered by soil thaw. Both phases were detected with different remote sensing metrics that depended on species type. Our results illustrate how satellite measurements could be improved to capture the spring transition over diverse landscapes and what environmental factors control the spring transition.

TI  - A Practical Method for High-Resolution Burned Area Monitoring Using Sentinel-2 and VIIRS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping burned areas using satellite imagery has become a subject of extensive research over the past decades. The availability of high-resolution satellite data allows burned area maps to be produced with great detail. However, their increasing spatial resolution is usually not matched by a similar increase in the temporal domain. Moreover, high-resolution data can be a computational challenge. Existing methods usually require downloading and processing massive volumes of data in order to produce the resulting maps. In this work we propose a method to make this procedure fast and yet accurate by leveraging the use of a coarse resolution burned area product, the computation capabilities of Google Earth Engine to pre-process and download Sentinel-2 10-m resolution data, and a deep learning model trained to map the multispectral satellite data into the burned area maps. For a 1500 ha fire our method can generate a 10-m resolution map in about 5 min, using a computer with an 8-core processor and 8 GB of RAM. An analysis of six important case studies located in Portugal, southern France and Greece shows the detailed computation time for each process and how the resulting maps compare to the input satellite data as well as to independent reference maps produced by Copernicus Emergency Management System. We also analyze the feature importance of each input band to the final burned area map, giving further insight about the differences among these events.

TI  - Mapping Arctic Lake Ice Backscatter Anomalies Using Sentinel-1 Time Series on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seepage of geological methane through sediments of Arctic lakes might contribute conceivably to the atmospheric methane budget. However, the abundance and precise locations of such seeps are poorly quantified. For Lake Neyto, one of the largest lakes on the Yamal Peninsula in Northwestern Siberia, temporally expanding regions of anomalously low backscatter in C-band SAR imagery acquired in late winter and spring have been suggested to be related to seepage of methane from hydrocarbon reservoirs. However, this hypothesis has not been verified using in-situ observations so far. Similar anomalies have also been identified for other lakes on Yamal, but it is still uncertain whether or how many of them are related to methane seepage. This study aimed to document similar lake ice backscatter anomalies on a regional scale over four study regions (the Yamal Peninsula and Tazovskiy Peninsulas; the Lena Delta in Russia; the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska) during different years using a time series based approach on Google Earth Engine (GEE) that quantifies changes of sigma(0) from the Sentinel-1 C-band SAR sensor over time. An algorithm for assessing the coverage that takes the number of acquisitions and maximum time between acquisitions into account is presented, and differences between the main operating modes of Sentinel-1 are evaluated. Results show that better coverage can be achieved in extra wide swath (EW) mode, but interferometric wide swath (IW) mode data could be useful for smaller study areas and to substantiate EW results. A classification of anomalies on Lake Neyto from EW Delta sigma(0) images derived from GEE showed good agreement with the classification presented in a previous study. Automatic threshold-based per-lake counting of years where anomalies occurred was tested, but a number of issues related to this approach were identified. For example, effects of late grounding of the ice and anomalies potentially related to methane emissions could not be separated efficiently. Visualizations of Delta sigma(0) images likely reflect the temporal expansions of anomalies and are expected to be particularly useful for identifying target areas for future field-based research. Characteristic anomalies that clearly resemble the ones observed for Lake Neyto could be identified solely visually in the Yamal and Tazovskiy study regions. All data and algorithms produced in the framework of this study are openly provided to the scientific community for future studies and might potentially aid our understanding of geological lake seepage upon the progression of related field-based studies and corresponding evaluations of formation hypotheses.

TI  - Soil Erosion Assessment and Prediction in Urban Landscapes: A New G2 Model Approach
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is a global problem that negatively affects the quality of the environment, the availability of natural resources, as well as the safety of inhabitants. Soil erosion threatens the functioning of urban areas, which was the reason for choosing the territory of the Master Plan of Belgrade (Serbia) as the research area. The calculation of soil erosion loss was analyzed using the G2 erosion model. The model belongs to a group of empirical models and is based on the synthesis of the equation from the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the Erosion Potential Method (EPM). The estimation of soil degradation was analyzed in two time periods (2001 and 2019), which represent the time boundaries of the management of the Master Plan of Belgrade. The novel approach used in this research is based on using the land cover inventory as a dynamic indicator of the urbanization process. Land cover was identified using remote sensing, machine learning techniques, and the random forest algorithm applied to multispectral satellite images of the Landsat mission in combination with spectral indices. Climatic parameters were analyzed on the basis of data from meteorological stations (first scenario, i.e., 2001), as well as on simulations of changes based on climate scenario RCP8.5 (representative concentration pathways) concerning the current condition of the land cover (second scenario). A comparative analysis of the two time periods identified a slight reduction in total soil loss. For the first period, the average soil loss value is 4.11 t center dot ha(-1)center dot y(-1). The analysis of the second period revealed an average value of 3.63 t center dot ha(-1)center dot y(-1). However, the increase in non-porous surfaces has led to a change in the focus of soil degradation. Increased average soil loss as one of the catalysts of torrential flood frequencies registered on natural and semi-natural areas were 43.29% and 16.14%, respectively. These results are a significant contribution to the study of soil erosion in urban conditions under the impact of climate change.

TI  - Current Trend of Carbon Emissions from Wildfires in Siberia
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Smoke from wildfires in Siberia often affects air quality over vast territories of the Northern hemisphere during the summer. Increasing fire emissions also affect regional and global carbon balance. To estimate annual carbon emissions from wildfires in Siberia from 2002-2020, we categorized levels of fire intensity for individual active fire pixels based on fire radiative power data from the standard MODIS product (MOD14/MYD14). For the last two decades, estimated annual direct carbon emissions from wildfires varied greatly, ranging from 20-220 Tg C per year. Sporadic maxima were observed in 2003 (>150 Tg C/year), in 2012 (>220 Tg C/year), in 2019 (similar to 180 Tg C/year). However, the 2020 fire season was extraordinary in terms of fire emissions (similar to 350 Tg C/year). The estimated average annual level of fire emissions was 80 +/- 20 Tg C/year when extreme years were excluded from the analysis. For the next decade the average level of fire emissions might increase to 250 +/- 30 Tg C/year for extreme fire seasons, and to 110 +/- 20 Tg C/year for moderate fire seasons. However, under the extreme IPCC RPC 8.5 scenario for Siberia, wildfire emissions might increase to 1200-1500 Tg C/year by 2050 if there were no significant changes in patterns of vegetation distribution and fuel loadings.

TI  - Intermediary clip placement to assist accurate axillary lymph node localization*
T2  - CLINICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Localization of metastatic axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients is an increasingly common procedure performed by radiologists. In 2014, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines stated that ?clinically positive axillary lymph node (s) should be sampled by FNA or core biopsy and clipped with imagedetectable marker; clipped lymph nodes must be removed if FNA or core biopsy was positive prior to neoadjuvant therapy?. Since then, multiple studies have further supported targeted axillary surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), with excision of the clipped metastatic axillary node in addition to the sentinel node (s). Requests for image guided localization of clipped axillary nodes will continue to increase and likely become the standard of care. However, when lymph nodes have decreased in size after NAC, or when small deep lymph nodes are sampled, the clipped node can be difficult to identify under ultrasound at the time of localization. When the target node is questionable, we have found it valuable to place an intermediary clip, and use an axillary mammographic view to confirm this intermediary clip co-localizes with the intended target. With this confirmation, safe, accurate localization can then be performed. We describe 3 cases of intermediary clip placement facilitating successful localization of previously clipped axillary lymph nodes.

TI  - Geoinformatics-based assessment of land deformation and damage zonation for Gorkha earthquake, 2015, using SAR interferometry and ANN approach
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gorkha earthquake 2015 was one of the largest disastrous events that occurred in the main Himalayan thrust (MHT) region with epicenter at Gorkha region and magnitude of 7.8 which caused severe causality to life as well as property. The spatial statistics on vertical displacement and extent of damage zone is still too scarce to provide strong evidences of its hazard potential. In the present study, quantitative assessment on surface deformation has been carried out to compare land displacement of two different regions of Nepal (the Central Nepal and the Eastern Nepal), which are located at different distances from the epicenter, using InSAR technique on post- and pre-earthquake images from Sentinel 1A SLC product. The Central Nepal experiences an upliftment of 1.1 m and land subsidence of - 0.61 m, whereas for the Eastern Nepal the estimated upliftment and subsidence were 1.0 m and - 0.33 m, respectively. Further a regional earthquake-prone zone map was generated using the historical earthquake epicenter data and geographic information system (GIS) to understand the major vulnerability zones in the area. A total of 564 earthquake events were reported by USGS in Nepal region during 2000-2019, of which 476 (84.39%) were of magnitude greater than 4 on Richter scale and 376 events (66%) occurred at depth greater than 15 km. The damage assessment was done using machine learning (artificial neural network) back-propagation model in which the satellite imagery retrieved from the optical satellite Landsat 8 OLI sensor and digital elevation model was used to map slope, aspect, relief, drainage and lineament to be used as input layers to generate damage proxy map. The result obtained from ANN illustrated that despite being located comparatively at more distance from epicenter, the Eastern Nepal exhibited more damage-prone area (587 sq. km) in comparison with Central Nepal with 457sq. km damage prone in similar zone. Central Nepal evidences more damage-prone areas over compact build-up in contrast to Eastern Nepal, making greater risk potential in urban areas of Central Nepal during earthquake activity.

TI  - Deep Learning for Monitoring Agricultural Drought in South Asia Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought, a climate-related disaster impacting a variety of sectors, poses challenges for millions of people in South Asia. Accurate and complete drought information with a proper monitoring system is very important in revealing the complex nature of drought and its associated factors. In this regard, deep learning is a very promising approach for delineating the non-linear characteristics of drought factors. Therefore, this study aims to monitor drought by employing a deep learning approach with remote sensing data over South Asia from 2001-2016. We considered the precipitation, vegetation, and soil factors for the deep forwarded neural network (DFNN) as model input parameters. The study evaluated agricultural drought using the soil moisture deficit index (SMDI) as a response variable during three crop phenology stages. For a better comparison of deep learning model performance, we adopted two machine learning models, distributed random forest (DRF) and gradient boosting machine (GBM). Results show that the DFNN model outperformed the other two models for SMDI prediction. Furthermore, the results indicated that DFNN captured the drought pattern with high spatial variability across three penology stages. Additionally, the DFNN model showed good stability with its cross-validated data in the training phase, and the estimated SMDI had high correlation coefficient R-2 ranges from 0.57 similar to 0.90, 0.52 similar to 0.94, and 0.49 similar to 0.82 during the start of the season (SOS), length of the season (LOS), and end of the season (EOS) respectively. The comparison between inter-annual variability of estimated SMDI and in-situ SPEI (standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index) showed that the estimated SMDI was almost similar to in-situ SPEI. The DFNN model provides comprehensive drought information by producing a consistent spatial distribution of SMDI which establishes the applicability of the DFNN model for drought monitoring.

TI  - Analysis and Design of Hyperspectral Imaging LiDAR Scanning Mirror
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The scanning mirror is an important component of hyperspectral imaging LiDAR. Three scanning modes of polyhedral rotating mirror scanning, vibrator mirror scanning, and conical scanning arc analyzed in this paper. Traces of different scanning modes arc deduced, and the relationship between laser scanning traces and scanning modes is obtained by combining aircraft tracks. On this basis, a conical scanning mode for hyperspectral imaging LiDAR system is designed. Experimental results show that when the flight altitude is 500 m, the repetition frequency of the laser pulse is 130 kHz and the divergence angle of the laser pulse is 0.3 mrad. The method meets the requirements of the field angle of 30 and the angle between two adjacent pulses is less than 1 mrad. Compared with other scanning methods, conical scanning can improve the density of LiDAR spot footpoints, which provides help for effective data collection and accurate classification of ground objects.

TI  - Hapke Data Augmentation for Deep Learning-Based Hyperspectral Data Analysis With Limited Samples
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The emerging technology of deep neural networks has been proven to be successful for hyperspectral image analysis. However, it is still a great challenge to apply the deep learning method for quantitatively retrieving mineralogical composition, because typical deep neural networks generally require thousands of labeled samples for training, while only a few mineral samples can be acquired and examined for quantitative examination in practice. To address this challenge, this letter proposes a training data augmentation approach which incorporates the prior-knowledge of hyperspectral reflectance characteristics using the classic Hapke equations. Experiments over both laboratory and airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data show that the proposed method outperforms the widely used approaches for quantitative mineral analysis.

TI  - Variation of cool island effect for urban forest patches across an urbanrural gradient in Shanghai
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is a key factor to mitigate the urban heat island effect because it can form the local cool island. Previous studies focused on the local cooling effect of vegetation and water bodies in urbanized regions. However, few studies have figured out whether such effect would vary along the urban-rural gradient, as well as the relationship between such variations and the geometry characteristics of urban forest patches. In this study, we first retrieved the land surface temperature (LST) and the land use from Landsat 8 TIRS and GF-2 PMS imagery, respectively, and then analyzed the cooling effects of urban forest patches in Shanghai via buffer analysis method. Different urban development zones with various urbanization levels were used to represent the urban-rural gradient. Results showed that LST of the urban forest patches was 0.55. lower than the mean LST in Shanghai, indicating the role of forest patches as cool island in urban thermal environment during the daytime in summer. However, such effect of forest patches was not con. sistent along the urban. rural gradient. Strong cooling island effect was found for those in the downtown, with a reduction of LST up to 1.67 degrees C Forest patches did not serve as the cool island in the outskirt, such as in Chongming District. In each region, the area and shape characteristics of forest patches exerted great influences on the cool island effect. The patches with large size and regular shape had stronger cool island effect compared with those with small size and irregular shape. Compared to those in the region with low urbanization level, the small and irregular shape forest patches in the region with high urbanization level were apt to serve as cool islands. These findings can provide scientific support for future urban greening and ecological construction.

T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The open science movement continues to gain momentum, attention, and discussion. However, there are a number of different interpretations, viewpoints, and perspectives as to what the term "open science" means. In this study, we define open science as a collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information, and knowledge within the scientific community and the wider public to accelerate scientific research and understanding. As science has become increasingly data driven, data programs now play a critical role in enabling and accelerating open science.In this study, we describe specific actions that data programs can take to make the open science paradigm shift a reality. These actions range from implementing open data and software policies to reimaging data systems that move data out of organizational silos and into cyberinfrastructures that enable efficient research processes and accelerate knowledge dissemination. There are still a number of obstacles to be overcome by data programs which range from mitigating the risk of open data misuse to overcoming the inertia of legacy systems. Data programs need to support open science through the thoughtful development of open policies, systematic investment in innovative and collaborative infrastructures, and the promotion of cultural change. On the other hand, individual researchers play an equally important role by serving as advocates for open science principles and by adopting a number of best practices outlined in this study. By working together, a new and more open age of scientific research can be achieved to benefit science and society.

TI  - An Innovative Slepian Approach to Invert GRACE KBRR for Localized Hydrological Information at the Sub-Basin Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - GRACE spherical harmonics are well-adapted for representation of hydrological signals in river drainage basins of large size such as the Amazon or Mississippi basins. However, when one needs to study smaller drainage basins, one comes up against the low spatial resolution of the solutions in spherical harmonics. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approach based on Slepian functions which can reduce the energy loss by integrating information in the spatial, spectral and time domains. Another advantage of these regionally-defined functions is the reduction of the problem dimensions compared to the spherical harmonic parameters. This also induces a drastic reduction of the computational time. These Slepian functions are used to invert the GRACE satellite data to restore the water mass fluxes of different hydro-climatologic environments in Africa. We apply them to two African drainage basins chosen for their size of medium scale and their geometric specificities: the Congo river basin with a quasi-isotropic shape and the Nile river basin with an anisotropic and more complex shape. Time series of Slepian coefficients have been estimated from real along-track GRACE geopotential differences for about ten years, and these coefficients are in agreement with both the spherical harmonic solutions provided by the official centers CSR, GFZ, JPL and the GLDAS model used for validation. The Slepian function analysis highlights the water mass variations at sub-basin scales in both basins.

TI  - Using Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planet Imagery to Map Crop Type of Smallholder Farms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing offers a way to map crop types across large spatio-temporal scales at low costs. However, mapping crop types is challenging in heterogeneous, smallholder farming systems, such as those in India, where field sizes are often smaller than the resolution of historically available imagery. In this study, we examined the potential of relatively new, high-resolution imagery (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and PlanetScope) to identify four major crop types (maize, mustard, tobacco, and wheat) in eastern India using support vector machine (SVM). We found that a trained SVM model that included all three sensors led to the highest classification accuracy (85%), and the inclusion of Planet data was particularly helpful for classifying crop types for the smallest farms (<600 m(2)). This was likely because its higher spatial resolution (3 m) could better account for field-level variations in smallholder systems. We also examined the impact of image timing on the classification accuracy, and we found that early-season images did little to improve our models. Overall, we found that readily available Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planet imagery were able to map crop types at the field-scale with high accuracy in Indian smallholder systems. The findings from this study have important implications for the identification of the most effective ways to map crop types in smallholder systems.

TI  - Assessment of deforestation in sub-tropical forest using spatio-temporal landsat data
T2  - REVISTA CUBANA DE CIENCIAS FORESTALES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present research evaluated spatio-temporal change in the sub-tropical forest of district Malakand through Remote Sensing and GIS techniques. The main objective was to identify different land cover classes and to determine temporal changes in forest cover in the study area. This study was based on the two different classification techniques for the land cover classification. In this study, four Landsat images were acquired with the interval of 10 years from 1988 to 2018. The maximum likelihood classification and Minimum distance classification was applied on all the four images step by step. The total area of district Malakand was recorded as 975.32 km(2). Regarding percent wise area coverage Forest covered 22.1 % of the total area while other classes' settlements, agriculture, barren land and water have covered 17.7, 23.3, 33 and 3.9% respectively in 1988. Whereas in 2018, percent wise area coverage forest covered 9.3 % of the total area although other classes settlements, agriculture, barren land and water have covered 33.8, 22.3, 31.8 and 3.7 respectively. The change in forest area over the time was 60.4 km(2) which is equal to 6.2 % during 1998 to 2008 and ultimately overall deforestation was 124.4 km(2) which is equal to 12.7 % loss of forest area lost from 1998 to 2018. Thus, the forest area was changed to settlements and barren lands from 1988 to 2018. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated for 1988, 1998, 2008 and 2018. Based on NDVI analysis, total deforestation over the time was 166.29 km(2) in last 30 years (1988-2018) with percent deforestation of 43.66 % area lost. The Landsat images have 30 meters resolution and small forest area changes can not detected by Landsat images, thus high- resolution products can detect more deforestation comparatively.

AB  - This paper presents a methodology of road feature extraction from the different resolutions of Remote Sensing images of Landsat-8 Operational Lander Image (OLI) and ResourceSat-2 of Linear Imaging Self Sensor-3 (LISS-3) and LISS-4 sensors with the spatial resolutions of 15 m, 24 m, and 5 m. In the methodology of road extraction, an index is proposed based on the spectral profile of Roads, also involving Morphological transform (Top-Hat or Bot-Hat) and Markov Random Fields (MRF). In the proposed index, Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) band has a significant role in the detection of roads from sensors, and it is named Normalized Difference Road Index (NDRI). To enhancement of features from the index, Bot-Hat transforms used. To segment the road features from this image, MRF used. The methodology is performed on the OLI, LISS-3 and LISS-4 images, and presented with results.

TI  - Assessment of Land Degradation in Semiarid Tanzania-Using Multiscale Remote Sensing Datasets to Support Sustainable Development Goal 15.3
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring land degradation (LD) to improve the measurement of the sustainable development goal (SDG) 15.3.1 indicator ("proportion of land that is degraded over a total land area") is key to ensure a more sustainable future. Current frameworks rely on default medium-resolution remote sensing datasets available to assess LD and cannot identify subtle changes at the sub-national scale. This study is the first to adapt local datasets in interplay with high-resolution imagery to monitor the extent of LD in the semiarid Kiteto and Kongwa (KK) districts of Tanzania from 2000-2019. It incorporates freely available datasets such as Landsat time series and customized land cover and uses open-source software and cloud-computing. Further, we compared our results of the LD assessment based on the adopted high-resolution data and methodology (AM) with the default medium-resolution data and methodology (DM) suggested by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. According to AM, 16% of the area in KK districts was degraded during 2000-2015, whereas DM revealed total LD on 70% of the area. Furthermore, based on the AM, overall, 27% of the land was degraded from 2000-2019. To achieve LD neutrality until 2030, spatial planning should focus on hotspot areas and implement sustainable land management practices based on these fine resolution results.

TI  - Anisotropy Parameterization Development and Evaluation for Glacier Surface Albedo Retrieval from Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier albedo determines the net shortwave radiation absorbed at the glacier surface and plays a crucial role in glacier energy and mass balance. Remote sensing techniques are efficient means to retrieve glacier surface albedo over large and inaccessible areas and to study its variability. However, corrections of anisotropic reflectance of glacier surface have been established for specific shortwave bands only, such as Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (L5/TM) band 2 and band 4, which is a major limitation of current retrievals of glacier broadband albedo. In this study, we calibrated and evaluated four anisotropy correction models for glacier snow and ice, applicable to visible, near-infrared and shortwave-infrared wavelengths using airborne datasets of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). We then tested the ability of the best-performing anisotropy correction model, referred to from here on as the 'updated model', to retrieve albedo from L5/TM, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (L8/OLI) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery, and evaluated these results with field measurements collected on eight glaciers around the world. Our results show that the updated model: (1) can accurately estimate anisotropic factors of reflectance for snow and ice surfaces; (2) generally performs better than prior approaches for L8/OLI albedo retrieval but is not appropriate for L5/TM; (3) generally retrieves MODIS albedo better than the MODIS standard albedo product (MCD43A3) in both absolute values and glacier albedo temporal evolution, i.e., exhibiting both fewer gaps and better agreement with field observations. As the updated model enables anisotropy correction of a maximum of 10 multispectral bands and is implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE), it is promising for observing and analyzing glacier albedo at large spatial scales.

T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The precise extraction of the ccntroids of laser footprint spots has important practical significance for improving the plane accuracy of laser altimetry by domestic satellites. This paper compared three traditional extraction algorithms of spot ccntroids, i.c., gray ccntroid algorithm, Gaussian fitting algorithm, and ellipse fitting algorithm. Then, we proposed a algorithm in which the grayscale and distance thresholds were set by the Gaussian fitting algorithm and Canny edge detection and the spot ccntroid was extracted by the gray ccntroid algorithm. The tests of 100 sets of simulated spots reveal that the mean square deviation of the ccntroid offset extracted by the proposed algorithm is less than 0.05 pixel, and the accuracy is higher than that of the other three algorithms. Furthermore, this algorithm was used to extract the spot ccntroid of a certain segment of continuous laser data acquired by the Gaofen-7 (GF-7) satellite. The results show that the two laser footprint spots of the GF-7 satellite arc within 0.55 cm in the case of ground jitter. Our work can provide a certain reference for the subsequent usage research on laser altimetry data from the GF-7 satellite.

TI  - Forecasting Rainfed Agricultural Production in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands Using Learning Machine Methods: A Case Study
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rising demand for food products and the direct impact of climate change on food production in many parts of the world, recent years have seen growing interest in the subject of food security and the role of rainfed farming in this area. Machine learning methods can be used to predict crop yield based on a combination of remote sensing data and data collected by ground weather stations. This paper argues that forecasting drylands farming yield can be reliable for management purpose under uncertain conditions using machine learning methods and remote sensing data and determines which indicators are most important in predicting the yield of chickpea. In this study, the yield of rainfed chickpea farms in 11 top chickpea producing counties in Kermanshah province, Iran, was predicted using three machine learning methods, namely support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). To improve prediction accuracy, for each county, remote sensing data were overlaid by the satellite images of rainfed farms with a suitable slope and altitude for rainfed farming. An integrated database was created by combining weather data, remote sensing data, and chickpea yield statistics. The methods were evaluated using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique and compared in terms of multiple measures. Given the sensitivity of rainfed chickpea yield to the time of data, the predictions were made in two scenarios: (1) using the averages of the data of all growing months, and (2) using the data of a combination of months. The results showed that RF provides more accurate yield predictions than other methods. The predictions of this method were 7-8% different from the statistics reported by the Statistical Center and the Ministry of Agriculture of Iran. It was found that for pre-harvest prediction of rainfed chickpea yield, using the data of the March-April period (the averages of two months) offers the best result in terms of the correlation coefficient for the relationship between the yield and the predictor indices.

TI  - The seer Amos and Politics: Neo-Assyrians and Aramaeans in the Political Framework of the Protests in Northern Israel in the 8th Century B.C.E.
T2  - PERSPECTIVA TEOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The question of Amos' peasant origin has shaped the debate about his role in economic exploitation by the ruling elites, leaving the disputes of institutional authorities in ancient Israel barely discussed in his book. The internal historical context shows the opening of borders and the fluidity of identities resulting from the Israeli diplomatic relations that began in the 9th century in the period of the Omride dynasty. On the one hand, this led to economic development in Samaria, the capital; on the other hand, it resulted in the impoverishment of productive social groups in the rural sector due to the high taxation of land and production. In the regional context, the beginning of the provincialization process in the south of the Levant, operated by the Neo-Assyrian empire, added to the border conflicts between North Israel ("Northern Kingdom") and Aram-Damascus, which reflected in the economy and aggravated the Israeli political crisis. Put into perspective, the prophetic corpus projects a political worldview: the king's decisions must contemplate the benefits to small producers and traders excluded from the large trade routes. Methodologically, we will carry out a comparative historiographical study, as we will analyze biblical and extra -biblical sources contemporary to the prophetic literary representations of the Book of Amos. Our study intends to conclude that Amos' performance and what he represents historically are initially linked to this international political-economic situation.

TI  - A Revised Snow Cover Algorithm to Improve Discrimination between Snow and Clouds: A Case Study in Gran Paradiso National Park
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover plays an important role in biotic and abiotic environmental processes, as well as human activities, on both regional and global scales. Due to the difficulty of in situ data collection in vast and inaccessible areas, the use of optical satellite imagery represents a useful support for snow cover mapping. At present, several operational snow cover algorithms and products are available. Even though most of them offer an up-to-daily time scale, they do not provide sufficient spatial resolution for studies requiring high spatial detail. By contrast, the Let-It-Snow (LIS) algorithm can produce high-resolution snow cover maps, based on the use of both the normalized-difference snow index (NDSI) and a digital elevation model. The latter is introduced to define a threshold value on the altitude, below which the presence of snow is excluded. In this study, we revised the LIS algorithm by introducing a new parameter, based on a threshold in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band, and by modifying the overall algorithm workflow, such that the cloud mask selection can be used as an input. The revised algorithm has been applied to a case study in Gran Paradiso National Park. Unlike previous studies, we also compared the performance of both the original and the modified algorithms in the presence of cloud cover, in order to evaluate their effectiveness in discriminating between snow and clouds. Ground data collected by meteorological stations equipped with both snow gauges and solarimeters were used for validation purposes. The changes introduced in the revised algorithm can improve upon the overall classification accuracy obtained by the original LIS algorithm (i.e., up to 89.17 from 80.88%). The producer's and user's accuracy values obtained by the modified algorithm (89.12 and 95.03%, respectively) were larger than those obtained by the original algorithm (76.68 and 93.67%, respectively), thus providing a more accurate snow cover map.

TI  - A functional perspective on the analysis of land use and land cover data in ecology
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessments of large-scale changes in habitat are a priority for management and conservation. Traditional approaches use land use and land cover data (LULC) that focus mostly on "structural" properties of landscapes, rather than "functional" properties related to specific ecological processes. Here, we contend that designing functional analyses of LULC can provide important and complementary information to traditional, structural analyses. We substantiate this perspective with an example of functional changes in habitat due to industrial anthropogenic footprints in Alberta's boreal forest, where there has been little overall forest loss (similar to 6% structural change), but high levels of functional change (up to 93% functional change) for species' habitat, biodiversity, and wildfire ignition. We discuss the methods needed to achieve functional LULC analyses, when they are most appropriate to add to structural assessments, and conclude by providing recommendations for analyses of LULC in a future of increasingly high-resolution, dynamic remote sensing data.

TI  - Pneumococcal and Influenza Vaccination Rates and Pneumococcal Invasive Disease Rates Set Geographical and Ethnic Population Susceptibility to Serious COVID-19 Cases and Deaths
T2  - VACCINES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the relationship of pneumococcal vaccination rates, influenza, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccinations (DTP), polio, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (tuberculosis) vaccination rates to COVID-19 case and death rates for 51 nations that have high rates of COVID-19 testing and for which nearly complete childhood, at-risk adult and elderly pneumococcal vaccination data were available. The study is unique in a large number of nations examined, the range of vaccine controls, in testing effects of combinations of vaccinations, and in examining the relationship of COVID-19 and vaccination rates to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Analysis of Italian regions and the states of the United States were also performed. Significant positive correlations were found between IPD (but not lower respiratory infections) and COVID-19 rates, while significant negative correlations were found between pneumococcal vaccination and COVID-19 rates. Influenza and MMR vaccination rates were negatively correlated with lower respiratory infection (LRI) rates and may synergize with pneumococcal vaccination rates to protect against COVID-19. Pneumococcal and influenza vaccination rates were independent of other vaccination rates. These results suggest that endemic rates of bacterial pneumonias, for which pneumococci are a sentinel, may set regional and national susceptibility to severe COVID-19 disease and death.

AB  - This article is product of the articulation of two researches that aims to understand the rise of the newest brazilian rights and the technologies used to spread their worldview. By understanding that the first decades of the 21st century are being characterized by new ways of producing and disseminating information complements of the cyberspace age, a phenomenon that led the Oxford dictionary to bring 'post-truth' as word of the year in 2016, we saw the need to understand the emergence of the right-wing political traditions, such as the neoconservatives, conservative liberals, liberals and anarchocapitalist libertarians. Thus, this article sought to analyze, from an ethnographic research the forms of production and diffusion of their speeches, as well as their strategies of capillarization in brazilian politics.

TI  - Use of GNSS Tropospheric Delay Measurements for the Parameterization and Validation of WRF High-Resolution Re-Analysis over the Western Gulf of Corinth, Greece: The PaTrop Experiment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last thirty years, Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry (InSAR) and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) have become fundamental space geodetic techniques for mapping surface deformations due to tectonic movements. One major limiting factor to those techniques is the effect of the troposphere, as surface velocities are of the order of a few mm yr(-1), and high accuracy (to mm level) is required. The troposphere introduces a path delay in the microwave signal, which, in the case of GNSS Precise Point Positioning (PPP), can nowadays be partly removed with the use of specialized mapping functions. Moreover, tropospheric stratification and short wavelength spatial turbulences produce an additive noise to the low amplitude ground deformations calculated by the (multitemporal) InSAR methodology. InSAR atmospheric phase delay corrections are much more challenging, as opposed to GNSS PPP, due to the single pass geometry and the gridded nature of the acquired data. Thus, the precise knowledge of the tropospheric parameters along the propagation medium is extremely useful for the estimation and correction of the atmospheric phase delay. In this context, the PaTrop experiment aims to maximize the potential of using a high-resolution Limited-Area Model for the calculation and removal of the tropospheric noise from InSAR data, by following a synergistic approach and integrating all the latest advances in the fields of remote sensing meteorology (GNSS and InSAR) and Numerical Weather Forecasting (WRF). In the first phase of the experiment, presented in the current paper, we investigate the extent to which a high-resolution 1 km WRF weather re-analysis can produce detailed tropospheric delay maps of the required accuracy, by coupling its output (in terms of Zenith Total Delay or ZTD) with the vertical delay component in GNSS measurements. The model is initially operated with varying parameterization, with GNSS measurements providing a benchmark of real atmospheric conditions. Subsequently, the final WRF daily re-analysis run covers an extended period of one year, based on the optimum model parameterization scheme demonstrated by the parametric analysis. The two datasets (predicted and observed) are compared and statistically evaluated, in order to investigate the extent to which meteorological parameters that affect ZTD can be simulated accurately by the model under different weather conditions. Results demonstrate a strong correlation between predicted and observed ZTDs at the 19 GNSS stations throughout the year (R ranges from 0.91 to 0.93), with an average mean bias (MB) of -19.2 mm, indicating that the model tends to slightly underestimate the tropospheric ZTD as compared to the GNSS derived values. With respect to the seasonal component, model performance is better during the autumn period (October-December), followed by spring (April-June). Setting the acceptable bias range at +/- 23 mm (equal to the amplitude of one Sentinel-1 C-band phase cycle when projected to the zenithal distance), it is demonstrated that the model produces satisfactory results, with a percentage of ZTD values within the bias margin ranging from 57% in summer to 63% in autumn.

TI  - Environmental Transformation and the Current State of Hydrogeological Condition in the Wojkowice Area-Southern Poland
T2  - RESOURCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the analysis and interpretation of maps, remote sensing data published in the literature, and environmental reconnaissance, this article discusses environmental transformations in the Wojkowice area in southern Poland (up to the year 2020). A comprehensive analysis was carried out concerning spatial development, mining activity, hydrogeological conditions and the biotic environment. The current state of the hydrogeological conditions was also characterized. Mining activity in the vicinity of the studied town caused significant changes in its relief, which contributed to its area dropping by about 5 m. In fact, these terrain forms are overgrown by various forms of vegetation that colonized these areas both naturally and as a result of forest reclamation. The contemporary vegetation of Wojkowice differs from the potential natural vegetation, which is an indicator of the complete anthropogenization of the natural environment. Over 100 years of industrial activity in Wojkowice has also contributed to a strong transformation of the groundwater. There has been a quantitative depletion of usable groundwater in the Triassic and Carboniferous formations. With inflows to the ore mines of up to 17 m(3)/min, the groundwater table has dropped by more than 60 m. The aquifer of Muschelkalk has been practically drained. At present, wells extract the waters from the Roth aquifer. There has been a major transformation of groundwater chemistry. The waters of the Triassic carbonate complex are anthropogenically transformated and are characterized by increased mineralization, multi-ionic types and usually with a quality class III and IV, and, therefore, they require some treatment.

TI  - Selection of Lee Filter Window Size Based on Despeckling Efficiency Prediction for Sentinel SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radar imaging has many advantages. Meanwhile, SAR images suffer from a noise-like phenomenon called speckle. Many despeckling methods have been proposed to date but there is still no common opinion as to what the best filter is and/or what are its parameters (window or block size, thresholds, etc.). The local statistic Lee filter is one of the most popular and best-known despeckling techniques in radar image processing. Using this filter and Sentinel-1 images as a case study, we show how filter parameters, namely scanning window size, can be selected for a given image based on filter efficiency prediction. Such a prediction can be carried out using a set of input parameters that can be easily and quickly calculated and employing a trained neural network that allows determining one or several criteria of filtering efficiency with high accuracy. The statistical analysis of the obtained results is carried out. This characterizes improvements due to the adaptive selection of the filter window size, both potential and based on prediction. We also analyzed what happens if, due to prediction errors, erroneous decisions are undertaken. Examples for simulated and real-life images are presented.

TI  - Greenspace exposure and COVID-19 mortality in the United States: January-July 2020
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mortality from the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) continues to rise across the United States. Evidence is emerging that environmental factors may contribute to susceptibility to disease and mortality. Greenspace exposure promotes enhanced immunity and may protect against risk of mortality among those with COVID-19. Objectives: Our objective was to determine if high county level greenspace exposure is associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality.Methods: Greenspace exposure was characterized in 3049 counties across the conterminous United States using Leaf Area Index (LAI) deciles that were derived from satellite imagery via Moderate Resolution Imaging Spec-troradiometer from 2011 to 2015. COVID-19 mortality data were obtained from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. We used a generalized linear mixed model to evaluate the asso-ciation between county level LAI and COVID-19 mortality rate in analyses adjusted for 2015-2019 county level average total county population, older population, race, overcrowding in home, Medicaid, education, and physical inactivity. Results: A dose-response association was found between greenness and reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality. COVID-19 mortality was negatively associated with LAI deciles 8 [MRR = 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.93)], 9 [MRR = 0.78 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.89)], and 10 [MRR = 0.59 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.69)]. Aside from LAI decile 5, no associations were found between the remaining LAI deciles and COVID-19 mortality. Increasing prevalence of counties with older age residents, low education attainment, Native Americans, Black Americans, and housing overcrowding were significantly associated with increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, whereas Medicaid prevalence was associated with a reduced risk. Discussion: Counties with a higher amount of greenspace may be at a reduced risk of experiencing mortality due to COVID-19.

TI  - Staging Death: Christofascist Necropolitics during the National Legionary State in Romania, 1940-1941
T2  - NATIONALITIES PAPERS-THE JOURNAL OF NATIONALISM AND ETHNICITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The cult of death and the celebration of martyrdom lay at the core of interwar fascist movements across the European continent. However, it was in the Romanian Legionary Movement (also known as the Iron Guard) that these were articulated into a full-fledged ideology of thanatic ultranationalism. In this article, I examine the spectacular fascist necropolitics staged as state-sponsored funeral performances during the short-lived National Legionary State (September 14, 1940-February 14, 1941). A detailed description of the massive campaign of exhumations and reburials of the so-called "legionary martyrs" carried out during this short time span, culminating with the grandiose ceremony organized for the reburial of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu on November 30, 1940, provides insight into the legionary thanatic worldview and ritual praxis. It also sheds light on the movement's politics of commemoration, death, and afterlife and shows how these were embedded into a religious framework underpinned by theological concepts such as heroic martyrdom, vicarious atonement, and collective redemption.

AB  - With the rapid development of remote sensing technology, our ability to obtain remote sensing data has been improved to an unprecedented level. We have entered an era of big data. Remote sensing data clear showing the characteristics of Big Data such as hyper spectral, high spatial resolution, and high time resolution, thus, resulting in a significant increase in the volume, variety, velocity and veracity of data. This paper proposes a feature supporting, salable, and efficient data cube for time-series analysis application, and used the spatial feature data and remote sensing data for comparative study of the water cover and vegetation change.The spatial-feature remote sensing data cube (SRSDC) is described in this paper. It is a data cube whose goal is to provide a spatial-feature-supported, efficient, and scalable multidimensional data analysis system to handle large-scale RS data. It provides a high-level architectural overview of the SRSDC.The SRSDC offers spatial feature repositories for storing and managing vector feature data, as well as feature translation for converting spatial feature information to query operations.The paper describes the design and implementation of a feature data cube and distributed execution engine in the SRSDC. It uses the long time-series remote sensing production process and analysis as examples to evaluate the performance of a feature data cube and distributed execution engine. Big data has become a strategic highland in the knowledge economy as a new strategic resource for humans. The core knowledge discovery methods include supervised learning methods data analysis supervised learning, unsupervised learning methods data analysis unsupervised learning, and their combinations and variants.

TI  - Unsupervised Deep Transfer Learning-Based Change Detection for HR Multispectral Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - To overcome the limited capability of most state-of-the-art change detection (CD) methods in modeling spatial context of multispectral high spatial resolution (HR) images and exploiting all spectral bands jointly, this letter presents a novel unsupervised deep-learning-based CD method that can effectively model contextual information and handle the large number of bands in multispectral HR images. This is achieved by exploiting all spectral bands after grouping them into spectral-dedicated band groups. To eliminate the necessity of multitemporal training data, the proposed method exploits a data set targeted for image classification to train spectral-dedicated Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (ACGANs). They are used to obtain pixelwise deep change hypervector from multitemporal images. Each feature in deep change hypervector is analyzed based on the magnitude to identify changed pixels. An ensemble decision fusion strategy is used to combine change information from different features. Experimental results on the urban, Alpine, and agricultural Sentinel-2 data sets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Soil salinity mapping using Landsat 8 OLI data and regression modeling in the Great Hungarian Plain
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt's deposition in the subsoil is known as salinization. It is caused by natural processes such as mineral weathering or human-made activities such as irrigation with saline water. This environmental issue has grown more critical and is frequently occurring in the Hungarian Great Plain, adversely influencing agricultural productivity. This study aims to predict soil salinity in the Great Hungarian Plain, located in the east of Hungary, using Landsat 8 OLI data combined with four state-of-the-art regression models, i.e., Multiple Linear Regression, Partial Least Squares Regression, Ridge Regression, and Feedforward Artificial Neural Network. For this purpose, seventy-six soil samples were collected during a field survey conducted by the Research Institute for Soil Sciences and Agricultural Chemistry between the 15 of September and the 15 of October, 2016. We used the min-max accuracy, the root-mean-square error (RMSE), and the mean squared error (MSE) to evaluate and compare the four models' performance. The results showed that the ridge regression model performed the best in terms of prediction (MSEtraining = 0.006, MSEtest = 0.0007, RMSE = 0.081), with a min-max accuracy equal to 0.75. Hence, the application of regression modeling on spectral indices, principal component analysis, and land surface temperature derived from multispectral data is an efficient method for soil salinity assessment at local scales. The resulting map can provide an overview of salinity levels and evaluate the efficiency of land management strategies in irrigated areas. An increase in sampling density will be recommended to validate this approach on the regional scale.

TI  - Effect of Geoid Variations on ICESat Altimeter Based Water Surface Elevations
T2  - TEKNIK DERGI
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the effects of geoid variations on GLAS altimeter onboard ICESat satellite based water surface elevations (WSE) over Burdur Lake (BL). MODIS snow-covered area maps are used to detect water surfaces daily. The differences between ground observations of BL WSE and those calculated using ICESat Global EGM2008 geoid varied between -0.96m and -0.60m with a root mean square error of 0.73m. The errors of recalculated water levels with the updated geoid heights varied from -0 : 20m to 0.16m and the root mean square error decreased to 0.12m. Comparison with DSI ground observations yielded R-2 as 0.98. Water level differences between the successive winter and summer is 0.74m and remained within the maximum change of 1.0m.

TI  - Structural geometry of Ikogosi warm spring, southwestern Nigeria: evidence from aeromagnetic and remote sensing interpretation
T2  - GEOMECHANICS AND GEOPHYSICS FOR GEO-ENERGY AND GEO-RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In an attempt to understand the general structural patterns of Ikogosi warm spring and environs, remotely sensed images have been integrated with high resolution aeromagnetic anomaly dataset. This is because subsurface faults offer pathways for the upward flow of geothermal fluids and imaging these structures where they are concealed provides localized areas for geothermal investigation. Interpretation of the high resolution aeromagnetic, Landsat-8 and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data has resulted in the detection of structural features within Ikogosi and environs. The enhancement of aeromagnetic anomaly data using total gradient technique facilitated the identification of three distinct geologic trends. This technique offers good information of structural patterns within the region, including the estimated source depths from the source parameter imaging and 3-D Euler deconvolution methods, which ranges from 100 to 860 m. The results show the distribution and direction of lineaments with major N-S, NE-SW and E-W trends within the study area. The combination of the surface lineaments with magnetic depth maps has established that faults around the warm spring interact, connect and act as conduits for the flow of hydrothermal fluids at varying depths which subsequently channel the fluids to an exit fault/lineament on the surface. The result revealed that the Ikogosi warm spring is situated along a major NNE-trending fault with subsidiary minor E-trending faults. These minor concealed subsidiary faults associated with the Ikogosi warm spring provides a follow-up for geothermal investigation within the region.

TI  - Spatiotemporal ecological quality assessment of metropolitan cities: a case study of central Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study used the recently developed Remote Sensing-Based Ecological Index (RSEI) to assess the temporal-spatial variation of ecological quality in the metropolitan city of Isfahan (Iran) as a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network. This study was conducted from the Landsat TM/OLI satellite images of 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019. The RSEI was synthesized by principal component analysis for four indices of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), Land Surface Moisture (LSM) and Normalized Differential Build-up, and Bare Soil Index (NDBSI) based on the framework of the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) in the aforementioned years. The ecological quality of the city was assessed by RSEI over a 15-year period. The index has a value range of 0 (completely poor ecological quality) to 1 (completely desirable). In addition, the spatial heterogeneity of RSEIs at different intervals was assessed by the Moran index. The results showed that the RSEI value was always less than 0.4, which indicated the unfavourable ecological quality of the city. This index was 0.34, 0.37, 0.26 and 0.30 in 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019, respectively. Therefore, the ecological quality of the city did not have a constant trend during the studied period and had several fluctuations, which could be attributed to the natural and anthropogenic changes in the studied period. Additionally, the results of the Moran index showed a steady decline, which indicated a declining homogeneity during this period. Matching the calculated RSEIs with the realities of the region at each time interval suggested that the index could be a useful tool for assessing urban ecological quality.

TI  - Orr and Kant: An analysis of the intellectual encounter behind 'The Christian worldview'
T2  - SCOTTISH JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, Christianity is often described as a 'worldview', especially among Reformed evangelicals in the USA. In this article I return to the 1890 lectures where Scottish theologian James Orr adapted the concept of Weltanschauung for Christian purposes. Although it was coined by Immanuel Kant in 1790, and primarily used in subsequent decades to theorise cultural difference and evaluate aesthetic expression, Orr nevertheless claims that the idea of a worldview is 'as old as the dawn of reflection' and thus appropriate to articulating Christianity. I examine Orr's engagement with the Kantian and emerging historicist context, paying particular attention to his epistemological and aesthetic citations and showing how Orr both adopts and departs from the characteristic features of the Kantian subject. I conclude by assessing the philosophical and theological costs of this project that, among other things, positions Christianity for perpetual culture war within secular societies similarly shaped by the post-Kantian subject.

TI  - Multi-Parametric Portfolio to Assess the Fitness and Gonadal Maturation in Four Key Reproductive Phases of Brown Trout
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryBrown trout is a freshwater fish with economic importance and with a great potential to be used as an environmental biosensor species. Despite being selected as a model species in distinct scientific contexts, in cultured specimens, there is a surprising lack of works investigating the morpho-physiological changes associated with the reproductive cycle; particularly concerning the gonads. In this study, a multi-parameter portfolio of biometric, biochemical, hormonal, and morphological analysis was established, which allowed a seasonal and sex characterization of the gonad status of adult brown trout males and females. Sampling included four reproductive phases: spawning capable (December), regressing (March), regenerating (July), and developing (November). Sex- and season-specific changes were described. The discriminative parameters characterized here stand now as normal baseline values against which abnormal patterns can be compared with. These parameters have the potential to be used as tools for the environmental monitoring of the reproductive status of wild populations and for the control of breeding stocks in aquaculture.Brown trout is an environmental freshwater sentinel species and is economically important for recreational fishing and aquaculture. Despite that, there is limited knowledge regarding morpho-physiological variations in adults throughout the reproductive cycle. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the fitness and gonadal maturation of cultured adult brown trout in four reproductive phases (spawning capable-December, regressing-March, regenerating-July, and developing-November). The systematic evaluation of males and females was based on biometric, biochemical, and hormonal parameters, along with a histomorphological grading of gonads and the immunophenotype location of key steroidogenic enzymes. The total weight and lengths reached the lowest levels in December. Gonad weights were higher in December and November, while the opposite pattern was found for liver weights. The lowest levels of cholesterol and total protein were also noted during those stages. The 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) and testosterone (T) for males, and estradiol (E2) and T for females, mostly explained the hormonal variations. The immunohistochemistry of cytochrome P450c17 (CYP17-I), aromatase (CYP19), and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 beta-HSD) showed sex and site-specific patterns in the distinct reproductive phases. The sex- and season-specific changes generated discriminative multi-parameter profiles, serving as a tool for environmental and aquaculture surveys.

TI  - Reexamining the Potential to Classify Lava Flows From the Fractality of Their Margins
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Can fractal analysis of a lava flow's margin enable classification of the lava's morphologic type (e.g., pahoehoe)? Such classifications would provide insights into the rheology and dynamics of the flow when it was emplaced. The potential to classify lava flows from remotely-sensed data would particularly benefit the analysis of flows that are inaccessible, including flows on other planetary bodies. The technique's current interpretive framework depends on three assumptions: (1) measured margin fractality is scale-invariant; (2) morphologic types can be uniquely distinguished based on measured margin fractality; and (3) modification of margin fractality by topography, including substrate slope and confinement, would be minimal or independently recognizable. We critically evaluate these assumptions at meter scales (1-10 m) using 15 field-collected flow margin intervals from a wide variety of morphologic types in HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, Iceland, and Idaho. Among the 12 margin intervals that satisfy the current framework's suitability criteria (e.g., geomorphic freshness, shallowly-sloped substrates), we show that five exhibit notably scale-dependent fractality and all five from lava types other than 'a'a or pahoehoe would be classified as one or both of those types at some scales. Additionally, an 'a'a flow on a 15 degrees slope (Mauna Ulu, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai) and a spiny pahoehoe flow confined by a stream bank (Holuhraun, Iceland) exhibit significantly depressed fractalities but lack diagnostic signatures for these modifications. We therefore conclude that all three assumptions of the current framework are invalid at meter scales and propose a new framework to leverage the potential of the underlying fractal technique while acknowledging these complexities.

TI  - The Diurnal Variation in Stratospheric Ozone from MACC Reanalysis, ERA-Interim, WACCM, and Earth Observation Data: Characteristics and Intercomparison
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we compare the diurnal variation in stratospheric ozone of the MACC (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate) reanalysis, ECMWF Reanalysis Interim (ERA-Interim), and the free-running WACCM (Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model). The diurnal variation of stratospheric ozone results from photochemical and dynamical processes depending on altitude, latitude, and season. MACC reanalysis and WACCM use similar chemistry modules and calculate a similar diurnal cycle in ozone when it is caused by a photochemical variation. The results of the two model systems are confirmed by observations of the Superconducting Submillimeter-Wave Limb-Emission Sounder (SMILES) experiment and three selected sites of the Network for Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC) at Mauna Loa, Hawaii (tropics), Bern, Switzerland (midlatitudes), and Ny-angstrom lesund, Svalbard (high latitudes). On the other hand, the ozone product of ERA-Interim shows considerably less diurnal variation due to photochemical variations. The global maxima of diurnal variation occur at high latitudes in summer, e.g., near the Arctic NDACC site at Ny-angstrom lesund, Svalbard. The local OZORAM radiometer observes this effect in good agreement with MACC reanalysis and WACCM. The sensed diurnal variation at Ny-angstrom lesund is up to 8% (0.4 ppmv) due to photochemical variations in summer and negligible during the dynamically dominated winter. However, when dynamics play a major role for the diurnal ozone variation as in the lower stratosphere (100-20 hPa), the reanalysis models ERA-Interim and MACC which assimilate data from radiosondes and satellites outperform the free-running WACCM. Such a domain is the Antarctic polar winter where a surprising novel feature of diurnal variation is indicated by MACC reanalysis and ERA-Interim at the edge of the polar vortex. This effect accounts for up to 8% (0.4 ppmv) in both model systems. In summary, MACC reanalysis provides a global description of the diurnal variation of stratospheric ozone caused by dynamics and photochemical variations. This is of high interest for ozone trend analysis and other research which is based on merged satellite data or measurements at different local time.

TI  - Adverse Childhood Experiences in Trainees and Physicians With Professionalism Lapses: Implications for Medical Education and Remediation
T2  - ACADEMIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeUnprofessional behavior, which can include failure to engage, dishonest and/or disrespectful behavior, and poor self-awareness, can be demonstrated by medical trainees and practicing physicians. In the authors' experience, these types of behaviors are associated with exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Given this overlap, the authors studied the percentage of ACEs among trainees and physicians referred for fitness-for-duty evaluations and patterns between the types of ACEs experienced and the reason for referral.MethodA final sample of 123 cases of U.S. trainees and physicians who had been referred to a Midwestern center for assessment and/or remediation of professionalism issues from 2013 to 2018 was created. Included professionalism lapses fell within 3 categories: boundary violation, disruptive behavior, or potential substance use disorder concerns. All participants completed a psychosocial developmental interview, which includes questions about ACE exposure. Overall rate of reported ACEs and types of ACEs reported were explored.ResultsEighty-six (70%) participants reported at least 1 ACE, while 27 (22%) reported 4 or more. Compared with national data, these results show significantly higher occurrence rates of 1 or more ACEs and a lower occurrence rate of 0 ACEs. ACEs that predicted reasons for referral were physical or sexual abuse, feeling unwanted or unloved, witnessing abuse of their mother or stepmother, or caretaker substance use.ConclusionsIn this sample, ACE exposure was associated with professionalism issues. Remediating individuals with professionalism issues and exposure to ACEs can be complicated by heightened responses to stressful stimuli, difficulties with collaboration and trust, and decreased self-efficacy. Adoption of a trauma-informed medical education approach may help those that have been impacted by trauma rebuild a sense of control and empowerment. The findings of this study may be useful predictors in identifying those at risk of problematic behavior and recidivism before a sentinel event.

TI  - Effect of Street Lighting on the Urban and Rural Night-Time Radiance and the Brightness of the Night Sky
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In April 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic and the tourism decrease in Cracow (Poland), the Road Authority of the City of Cracow, followed by the authorities of several neighbouring municipalities, decided to turn off street lighting at night. It is worth noting that this is the first time that street lighting has been turned off in such a large area on a longer time frame at this scale, including one of the most populated cities in Poland, which made it possible to make unique observations. During this period, with the help of small night-sky radiance meters (Sky Quality Meters (SQM)), many ground-based measurements were made, both within the city and in its vicinity. For this purpose, the existing light pollution monitoring stations in Cracow and neighbouring cities were used. It was found that after switching off street lighting, the zenith surface brightness of the cloudless sky decreased by 15-39%, and this value was proportional to the city's population. The night-time light satellite data (VIIRS/DNB) on radiance from Cracow and neighbouring communes were also analysed, both their daily values as well as monthly and annual averages. It was found that in the case of a large city such as Cracow, turning off all street lighting reduces the amount of light energy radiated into the sky by about 50%, which is a relatively small decrease in radiance, while reducing the surface brightness of the night sky by about 40%, regardless of the state of the atmosphere. The effect of a significant decrease in radiance as a result of switching off street lighting was found in each of the analysed communes, especially the urbanised ones.

TI  - 46-Year (1973-2019) Permafrost Landscape Changes in the Hola Basin, Northeast China Using Machine Learning and Object-Oriented Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and cover changes (LUCC) in permafrost regions have significant consequences on ecology, engineered systems, and the environment. Obtaining more details about LUCC is crucial for sustainable development, land conservation, and environment management. The Hola Basin (957 km(2)) in the northernmost part of Northeast China, a boreal forest landscape underlain by discontinuous, sporadic, and isolated permafrost, was selected for the case study. The LUCC was analyzed using the Landsat archive of satellite images from 1973 to 2019. A thematic change detection analysis was performed by combining the object-based image analysis (OBIA) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Four types of LUCC (forest, grass, water, and anthropic) were extracted with an overall accuracy of 80% for 1973 and >90% for 1986, 2000, and 2019. Forest, the dominant class (750 km(2) in 1973), declined by 88 km(2) (11.8%) from 1973 to 1986 but had a recovery of 78 km(2) (12.5%) from 2000 to 2019. Grass, the second-largest class (187 km(2) in 1973), increased by 86 km(2) (46.5%) between 1973 and 1986 and decreased by 90 km(2) (40%) between 2000 and 2019. The anthropic class continuously increased from 10 km(2) (1973) to 37 km(2) (2019). Major features in LUCC are attributed to rapid population growth, resource exploitation, agriculture intensification, economic development, and frequent forest fires. Under a pronounced climate warming, these drivers have been accelerating the degradation of permafrost, subsequently triggering natural hazards and deteriorating the ecological environment. This study represents a benchmark for sustainable LUCC management in the Hola Basin, Northeast China.

TI  - Flash flood susceptibility mapping using a novel deep learning model based on deep belief network, back propagation and genetic algorithm
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash floods are responsible for loss of life and considerable property damage in many countries. Flood susceptibility maps contribute to flood risk reduction in areas that are prone to this hazard if appropriately used by land-use planners and emergency managers. The main objective of this study is to prepare an accurate flood susceptibility map for the Haraz watershed in Iran using a novel modeling approach (DBPGA) based on Deep Belief Network (DBN) with Back Propagation (BP) algorithm optimized by the Genetic Algorithm (GA). For this task, a database comprising ten conditioning factors and 194 flood locations was created using the One-R Attribute Evaluation (ORAE) technique. Various well-known machine learning and optimization algorithms were used as benchmarks to compare the prediction accuracy of the proposed model. Statistical metrics include sensitivity, specificity accuracy, root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC) were used to assess the validity of the proposed model. The result shows that the proposed model has the highest goodness-of-fit (AUC=0.989) and prediction accuracy (AUC=0.985), and based on the validation dataset it outperforms benchmark models including LR (0.885), LMT (0.934), BLR (0.936), ADT (0.976), NBT (0.974), REPTree (0.811), ANFIS-BAT (0.944), ANFIS-CA (0.921), ANFIS-IWO (0.939), ANFIS-ICA (0.947), and ANFIS-FA (0.917). We conclude that the DBPGA model is an excellent alternative tool for predicting flash flood susceptibility for other regions prone to flash floods.

TI  - Femtosecond Laser Etching of Aluminum Film on Tedlar Composite Surfaces
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The materials system of Tedlar composite-aluminum film, which has the advantages of high specific strength and modulus, light weight, good stability, and high reflectivity, can be used for frequency choice (Frequency Selecting Surfaces, FSS) preparation. FSS are widely used in the field of spatial filters, radar antenna masks, antenna array radar scattering cross sections, reflectors for transmitted and reflected electromagnetic waves in different spectra, and so on. With the development of satellite antennas to high-frequency bands, the graphics size of the FSS unit is required to be smaller and smaller, and the dimensional accuracy is required to be higher. At present, the market has an urgent processing precision demand of less than 10 mu m, the traditional microprocessing technology being unable to meet the technical requirements. The technology of a femtosecond pulse laser has the characteristics of short pulse width and high peak power. It has little thermal effect on the etching process of composite-aluminum film, and the overall effect of etching the boundary of graphic unit is better than with a nanosecond laser. Therefore, there are important theoretical significance and application value to carrying out relevant studies on femtosecond laser etching of aluminum film on a Tedlar composite substrate.Methods In this paper, the effects of laser power, laser spot diameter, and scanning rate on the properties of Tedlar composite substrate 2 mu m aluminum film using femtosecond laser etching technology are studied by the method of combining theoretical simulations and experiments. The optimal technological parameters are obtained by theoretical optimization using ANSYS 14. 0 software. The femtosecond laser etching composite technology under different process parameters is verified using Pharos-type equipment, and the surface morphology and sample size of the etched-processed samples are tested using noncontact three-dimensional surface graphic analysis equipment.Results and Discussions The simulation results show that the femtosecond laser etching pulse laser beam has enough energy to make the crystal lattice temperature exceed the melting point of aluminum in a very short time so that the aluminum film material on the composite substrate surface expands and is etched away rapidly (Fig. 2). The interface temperature increased as the power of the femtosecond laser etching increased. When the laser power increased from 3. 0 W to 5. 5 W, the interface temperature between the Tedlar composite and aluminum film increased from 417.68 K to 513. 19 K, causing damage to the Tedlar substrate and affecting the performance of the intrinsic material ( Figs. 3 and 4). When the laser scanning speed increased from 350 mm/s to 600 mm/s, the discontinuous point size increased from 1.2 mu m to 2.7 mu m in the femtosecond laser etching process, resulting in the size error of the laser etching process becoming greater than 10 ttm (Fig. 5). The experimental result shows that the larger the laser spot diameter and the smaller the laser spot overlap ratio are, the higher the scanning etching error is, while a smaller laser spot size and higher laser overlap ratio are conducive to the improvement of laser etching accuracy. When the spot diameter is 40 mu m, the overlap ratio is 25 %, and the etching error is 6.77 mu m so that the technical accuracy requirements of less than 10 mu m are fully met (Fig. 6). When the laser power is less than 4.0 W, there is a large amount of residual aluminum. When the laser power is greater than 4.0 W, the substrate is damaged around the etched area. When the laser power is 4.0 W, the aluminum film on the substrate is completely removed and Tedlar composite substrate is not damaged (Fig. 7). When the laser scanning rate is 500 mm/s, the spot overlap rate is 37.5 Yo and metal-aluminum film is completely etched and removed. However, when the laser scanning rate is 550 mm/s, the spot overlap rate is 25%.. At this time, the metal-aluminum film is etched clean and only a very small amount of metal aluminum remained. When the scanning rate continued to increase to 600 mm/s and 650 mm/s, the spot overlap rate is 0, but there is a large amount of etched metal-aluminum residue. With the increase of scanning rate, the residual aluminum content increased (Fig. 8). The simulation results are consistent with the experimental results.Conclusions Under the conditions of laser output power is 4.0 W, spot diameter is 40 mu m, and scanning rate is 500 mm/s, the surface of the material is clean, the residual aluminum content is very small, the etching diagram is arranged in a neat array, and the size accuracy and relative position accuracy of aluminum film graphics after laser etching are better than 10 mu m. Femtosecond laser etching technology can meet the high precision requirement of aluminum film micromachining on a Tedlar composite surface.

TI  - Identifying Seasonal Groundwater-Irrigated Cropland Using Multi-Source NDVI Time-Series Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater has become a major source of irrigation in the past few decades in India, but as it comes from millions of individual borewells owned by smallholders irrigating small fields, it is difficult to quantify the actual irrigated area across seasons and years. This study's main goal was to monitor seasonal irrigated cropland using multiple optical satellite images. The proposed research was performed over the Berambadi watershed, an experimental site in southern peninsular India. While cloud cover during crop growth is the greatest obstacle to optical remote sensing in tropical regions, the cloud-free images from multiple optical satellite platforms (Landsat-8 (OLI), EO1 (ALI), IRS-P6 (LISS3 and LISS4), and Spot5Take5 (HRG2)) were used to fill data gaps during crop growth periods. The seasonal cumulative normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated and resampled at 5 m spatial resolution for various cropping seasons. The support vector machine (SVM) classification was applied to seasonal cumulative NDVI images for irrigated cropland area classification. Validation of the classified irrigated cropland was performed by calculating kappa coefficients for three cropping seasons (summer, kharif, and rabi) from 2014-2016 using ground observations. Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.81-0.96 for 2014-2015 and 0.62-0.89 for 2015-2016, except for summer 2016, when it was 1.00. Groundwater irrigation in the watershed ranged from 4.6% to 16.5% of total cropland during these cropping seasons. These results showed that multi-source optical satellite data are relevant for quantifying areas under groundwater irrigation in tropical regions.

TI  - Vegetation Structure Index (VSI): Retrieving Vegetation Structural Information from Multi-Angular Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Utilization of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model parameters obtained from the multi-angular remote sensing is one of the approaches for the retrieval of vegetation structural information. In this research, the potential of multi-angular vegetation indices, formulated by the combination of multi-spectral reflectance from different view angles, for the retrieval of forest above-ground biomass was assessed in the New England region. The multi-angular vegetation indices were generated by the simulation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF/Albedo Model Parameters Product (MCD43A1 Version 6)-based BRDF parameters. The effects of the seasonal (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) composites of the multi-angular vegetation indices on the above-ground biomass, the angular relationship of the spectral reflectance with above-ground biomass, and the interrelationships between the multi-angular vegetation indices were analyzed. Among the existing multi-angular vegetation indices, only the Nadir BRDF-adjusted NDVI and Hot-spot incorporated NDVI showed significant relationship (more than 50%) with the above-ground biomass. The Vegetation Structure Index (VSI), newly proposed in the research, performed in the most efficient way and explained 64% variation of the above-ground biomass, suggesting that the right choice of the spectral channel and observation geometry should be considered for improving the estimates of the above-ground biomass. In addition, the right choice of seasonal data (summer) was found to be important for estimating the forest biomass, while other seasonal data were either insensitive or pointless. The promising results shown by the VSI suggest that it could be an appropriate candidate for monitoring vegetation structure from the multi-angular satellite remote sensing.

TI  - Local Climate Zone Mapping Using Multi-Source Free Available Datasets on Google Earth Engine Platform
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the widely concerned urban climate issues, urban heat island (UHI) has been studied using the local climate zone (LCZ) classification scheme in recent years. More and more effort has been focused on improving LCZ mapping accuracy. It has become a prevalent trend to take advantage of multi-source images in LCZ mapping. To this end, this paper tried to utilize multi-source freely available datasets: Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI), Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Luojia1-01 nighttime light (NTL), and Open Street Map (OSM) datasets to produce the 10 m LCZ classification result using Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Additionally, the derived datasets of Sentinel-2 MSI data were also exploited in LCZ classification, such as spectral indexes (SI) and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) datasets. The different dataset combinations were designed to evaluate the particular dataset's contribution to LCZ classification. It was found that: (1) The synergistic use of Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-1 SAR data can improve the accuracy of LCZ classification; (2) The multi-seasonal information of Sentinel data also has a good contribution to LCZ classification; (3) OSM, GLCM, SI, and NTL datasets have some positive contribution to LCZ classification when individually adding them to the seasonal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 datasets; (4) It is not an absolute right way to improve LCZ classification accuracy by combining as many datasets as possible. With the help of the GEE, this study provides the potential to generate more accurate LCZ mapping on a large scale, which is significant for urban development.

TI  - New Inventories of Global Carbon Dioxide Emissions through Biomass Burning in 2001-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the effect of large-scale fires on the global environment has attracted attention. Satellite observation data are used for global estimation of fire CO2 emissions, and available data sources are increasing. Although several CO2 emission inventories have already been released, various remote sensing data were used to create the inventories depend on the studies. We created eight global CO2 emission inventories through fires from 2001 to 2020 by combining input data sources, compared them with previous studies, and evaluated the effect of input sources on CO2 emission estimation. CO2 emissions were estimated using a method that combines the biomass density change (by the repeated fires) with the general burned area approach. The average annual CO2 emissions of the created eight inventories were 8.40 +/- 0.70 Pg CO2 year(-1) (+/- 1 standard deviation), and the minimum and maximum emissions were 3.60 +/- 0.67 and 14.5 +/- 0.83 Pg CO2 year(-1), respectively, indicating high uncertainty. CO2 Emissions obtained from four previous inventories were within +/- 1 standard deviation in the eight inventories created in this study. Input datasets, especially biomass density, affected CO2 emission estimation. The global annual CO2 emissions from two biomass maps differed by 60% (Maximum). This study assesses the performance of climate and fire models by revealing the uncertainty of fire emission estimation from the input sources.

TI  - Classifying Forest Type in the National Forest Inventory Context with Airborne Hyperspectral and Lidar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest structure and composition regulate a range of ecosystem services, including biodiversity, water and nutrient cycling, and wood volume for resource extraction. Forest type is an important metric measured in the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, the national forest inventory of the USA. Forest type information can be used to quantify carbon and other forest resources within specific domains to support ecological analysis and forest management decisions, such as managing for disease and pests. In this study, we developed a methodology that uses a combination of airborne hyperspectral and lidar data to map FIA-defined forest type between sparsely sampled FIA plot data collected in interior Alaska. To determine the best classification algorithm and remote sensing data for this task, five classification algorithms were tested with six different combinations of raw hyperspectral data, hyperspectral vegetation indices, and lidar-derived canopy and topography metrics. Models were trained using forest type information from 632 FIA subplots collected in interior Alaska. Of the thirty model and input combinations tested, the random forest classification algorithm with hyperspectral vegetation indices and lidar-derived topography and canopy height metrics had the highest accuracy (78% overall accuracy). This study supports random forest as a powerful classifier for natural resource data. It also demonstrates the benefits from combining both structural (lidar) and spectral (imagery) data for forest type classification.

TI  - Walkability and Greenness Do Not Walk Together: Investigating Associations between Greenness and Walkability in a Large Metropolitan City Context
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The existing environment literature separately emphasizes the importance of neighborhood walkability and greenness in enhancing health and wellbeing. Thus, a desirable neighborhood should ideally be green and walkable at the same time. Yet, limited research exists on the prevalence of such "sweet spot" neighborhoods. We sought to investigate this question in the context of a large metropolitan city (i.e., Sydney) in Australia. Methods: Using suburb level normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI), percentage urban greenspace, Walk Score(R) (Walk Score, Seattle, WA, USA), and other data, we explored the global and local relationships of neighborhood-level greenness, urban green space (percent park area) with walkability applying both non-spatial and spatial modeling. Results: We found an overall negative relationship between walkability and greenness (measured as NDVI). Most neighborhoods (represented by suburbs) in Sydney are either walkable or green, but not both. Sweet spot neighborhoods that did exist were green but only somewhat walkable. In addition, many neighborhoods were both less green and somewhat walkable. Moreover, we observed a significant positive relationship between percentage park area and walkability. These results indicate walkability and greenness have inverse and, at best, mixed associations in the Sydney metropolitan area. Conclusions: Our analysis indicates an overall negative relationship between greenness and walkability, with significant local variability. With ongoing efforts towards greening Sydney and improving walkability, more neighborhoods may eventually be transformed into becoming greener and more walkable.

TI  - An Artificial Neuron Network With Parameterization Scheme for Estimating Net Surface Shortwave Radiation From Satellite Data Under Clear Sky - Application to Simulated GF-5 Data Set
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Net surface shortwave radiation (NSSR) is a key parameter that drives the surface material exchange and energy balance. Herein, we propose an improved artificial neuron network (ANN) with parameterized (ANN-P) method to first calculate the albedo at the top of atmosphere (TOA) by considering the surface non-Lambertian effect. Subsequently, the NSSR is estimated based on the relationship between TOA broadband albedo and the Earth's surface-absorbed shortwave radiation using a parameterized method under clear sky. The modeling process is implemented with Chinese Gaofen-5 (GF-5) visible/near-infrared channels data simulated via MODTRAN. For comparison, a previously reported lookup table (LUT) with parameterized (LUT-P) method and an ANN method are also employed. The performances of all these methods are evaluated. In terms of model simulation part, the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) are 15.01 (17.07), 10.04 (13.67), and 20.39 (29.99) W/m(2) for land, water, and snow/ice surfaces, respectively, for the ANN-P (versus LUT-P) method. Their mean bias errors (MBEs) are within 0.9 W/m(2). With respect to the direct ANN method, it shows the highest accuracy yet relatively large deviation for water surface. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis of water vapor content (WVC) confirms that the ANN-P method is more stable than the LUT-P and ANN methods and is, thereby, recommended for clear-sky NSSR estimation. Finally, the ground validations indicate that the mean RMSEs (MBEs) for the LUT-P, ANN-P, and ANN methods are 49.33 (-3.01), 47.55 (1.75), and 104.24 (-75.72) W/m(2), respectively.

TI  - Φ-Net: Deep Residual Learning for InSAR Parameters Estimation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, deep learning (DL) finds application in a large number of scientific fields, among which the estimation and the enhancement of signals disrupted by the noise of different natures. In this article, we address the problem of the estimation of the interferometric parameters from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. In particular, we combine convolutional neural networks together with the concept of residual learning to define a novel architecture, named Phi-Net, for the joint estimation of the interferometric phase and coherence. Phi-Net is trained using synthetic data obtained by an innovative strategy based on the theoretical modeling of the physics behind the SAR acquisition principle. This strategy allows the network to generalize the estimation problem with respect to: 1) different noise levels; 2) the nature of the imaged target on the ground; and 3) the acquisition geometry. We then analyze the Phi-Net performance on an independent data set of synthesized interferometric data, as well as on real InSAR data from the TanDEM-X and Sentinel-1 missions. The proposed architecture provides better results with respect to state-of-the-art InSAR algorithms on both synthetic and real test data. Finally, we perform an application-oriented study on the retrieval of the topographic information, which shows that Phi-Net is a strong candidate for the generation of high-quality digital elevation models at a resolution close to the one of the original single-look complex data.

TI  - Runoff Projection from an Alpine Watershed in Western Canada: Application of a Snowmelt Runoff Model
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The rising global temperature is shifting the runoff patterns of snowmelt-dominated alpine watersheds, resulting in increased cold season flows, earlier spring peak flows, and reduced summer runoff. Projections of future runoff are beneficial in preparing for the anticipated changes in streamflow regimes. This study applied the degree-day Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) in combination with the MODIS to remotely sense snow cover observations for modeling the snowmelt runoff response of the Upper Athabasca River Basin in western Canada. After assessing its ability to simulate the observed historical flows, the SRM was applied for projecting future runoff in the basin. The inclusion of a spatial and temporal variation in the degree-day factor (DDF) and separation of the DDF for glaciated and non-glaciated areas were found to be important for improved simulation of varying snow conditions over multiple years. The SRM simulations, driven by an ensemble of six statistically downscaled GCM runs under the RCP8.5 scenario for the future period (2070-2080), show a consistent pattern in projected runoff change, with substantial increases in May runoff, smaller increases over the winter months, and decreased runoff in the summer months (June-August). Despite the SRM's relative simplicity and requirement of only a few input variables, the model performed well in simulating historical flows, and provides runoff projections consistent with historical trends and previous modeling studies.

TI  - An Integrated Approach to Chlorophyll Monitoring in Surface Freshwater: The Case Study of Lake Albano (Central Italy)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland freshwaters are of great importance for human health and activities, but major stressors such as nutrient pollution, deforestation, and urbanization are compromising their status. Water quality degradation and freshwater ecosystem preservation are current issues worldwide requiring frequent and efficient monitoring protocols. The increasing need for large amounts of data to comply with national and international regulations on water quality monitoring highlights traditional procedures limits. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to investigate the potential of alternative and rapid methods for chlorophyll concentration surveys in freshwaters. The Phyto-PAM (pulse amplitude-modulated) instrument and the Case-2 Regional Coast Colour (C2RCC) satellite image processor were selected to estimate chlorophyll concentration in the surface waters of Lake Albano (Central Italy), selected as a pilot area for the project BLOOWATER (Water JPI 2018 Joint Call Closing the Water Cycle Gap). The correlation tests' results indicate significant relations with chlorophyll data measured spectrophotometrically, confirming the suitability of both methods for chlorophyll retrieval. However, the relatively low strength of the correlation between remotely sensed and spectrophotometric data (r = 0.57, p < 2.2 x 10(-16)) was not as satisfactory as with Phyto-PAM values (r = 0.97, p = 1.2 x 10(-4)). Even though the techniques in this study proved to be promising in the water body under investigation, their current limitations suggest the need for further calibration and integration with other systems (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles).

TI  - A New Data Fusion Neural Network Scheme for Rainfall Retrieval Using Passive Microwave and Visible/Infrared Satellite Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - A new data fusion technique based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for the design of a rainfall retrieval algorithm is presented. The use of both VIS/IR (VISible and InfraRed) data from GEO (Geostationary Earth Orbit) satellite and of passive microwave data from LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite can take advantage of both types of sensors reducing their limitations. The technique can reconstruct the surface rain field with the MSG-SEVIRI (Meteosat Second Generation-Spinning Enhanced Visible Infrared Imager) spatial and temporal resolution, which means 3 km at the sub satellite point and 5 km at mid-latitudes, every 15 min, respectively. Rainfall estimations are also compared with H-SAF (Hydrology Satellite Application Facility) PR-OBS3A operational product showing better performance both on the identification of rainy areas and on the retrieval of the amount of precipitation. In particular, in the considered test cases, results report an improvement in average of 83% in terms of probability of rainy areas detection, of 45% in terms of false alarm rate, and of 47% in terms of root mean square error in the retrieval of the amount of precipitation.

AB  - The demand for rice production in Asia is expected to increase by 70% in the next 30 years, which makes evident the need for a balanced productivity and effective food security management at a national and continental level. Consequently, the timely and accurate mapping of paddy rice extent and its productivity assessment is of utmost significance. In turn, this requires continuous area monitoring and large scale mapping, at the parcel level, through the processing of big satellite data of high spatial resolution. This work designs and implements a paddy rice mapping pipeline in South Korea that is based on a time-series of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for the year of 2018. There are two challenges that we address; the first one is the ability of our model to manage big satellite data and scale for a nationwide application. The second one is the algorithm's capacity to cope with scarce labeled data to train supervised machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we implement an approach that combines unsupervised and supervised learning. First, we generate pseudo-labels for rice classification from a single site (Seosan-Dangjin) by using a dynamic k-means clustering approach. The pseudo-labels are then used to train a Random Forest (RF) classifier that is fine-tuned to generalize in two other sites (Haenam and Cheorwon). The optimized model was then tested against 40 labeled plots, evenly distributed across the country. The paddy rice mapping pipeline is scalable as it has been deployed in a High Performance Data Analytics (HPDA) environment using distributed implementations for both k-means and RF classifiers. When tested across the country, our model provided an overall accuracy of 96.69% and a kappa coefficient 0.87. Even more, the accurate paddy rice area mapping was returned early in the year (late July), which is key for timely decision-making. Finally, the performance of the generalized paddy rice classification model, when applied in the sites of Haenam and Cheorwon, was compared to the performance of two equivalent models that were trained with locally sampled labels. The results were comparable and highlighted the success of the model's generalization and its applicability to other regions.

TI  - Assessing Wildfire Burn Severity and Its Relationship with Environmental Factors: A Case Study in Interior Alaska Boreal Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, there have been rapid improvements in both remote sensing methods and satellite image availability that have the potential to massively improve burn severity assessments of the Alaskan boreal forest. In this study, we utilized recent pre- and post-fire Sentinel-2 satellite imagery of the 2019 Nugget Creek and Shovel Creek burn scars located in Interior Alaska to both assess burn severity across the burn scars and test the effectiveness of several remote sensing methods for generating accurate map products: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), and Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) supervised classification. We used 52 Composite Burn Index (CBI) plots from the Shovel Creek burn scar and 28 from the Nugget Creek burn scar for training classifiers and product validation. For the Shovel Creek burn scar, the RF and SVM machine learning (ML) classification methods outperformed the traditional spectral indices that use linear regression to separate burn severity classes (RF and SVM accuracy, 83.33%, versus NBR accuracy, 73.08%). However, for the Nugget Creek burn scar, the NDVI product (accuracy: 96%) outperformed the other indices and ML classifiers. In this study, we demonstrated that when sufficient ground truth data is available, the ML classifiers can be very effective for reliable mapping of burn severity in the Alaskan boreal forest. Since the performance of ML classifiers are dependent on the quantity of ground truth data, when sufficient ground truth data is available, the ML classification methods would be better at assessing burn severity, whereas with limited ground truth data the traditional spectral indices would be better suited. We also looked at the relationship between burn severity, fuel type, and topography (aspect and slope) and found that the relationship is site-dependent.

TI  - Investigating Vegetation Responses to Underground Nuclear Explosions Through Integrated Analyses
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation has the potential to respond to underground nuclear explosions, yet these links have not been fully explored. Given the lack of previously described signatures, the changes in vegetation are possibly subtle. The integration of multiple different data streams is potentially a useful approach to improve signal detection. Here, we investigate whether semi-arid vegetation growth patterns responded to eight legacy underground nuclear tests at the Nevada National Security Site in southern Nevada, USA. We tested for spatial and temporal changes in vegetation cover, tree growth patterns, and tree leaf spectral properties using ground-based measurements, including those from tree-rings and hyperspectral surface vegetation reflectance, as well as space-based measurements of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Landsat. Multiple data streams suggest a localized (<1.2 km) spatial pattern whereby tree growth is enhanced closer to the source of the underground test relative to sites further away. We also observed a more regional (>1.2-9 km) pattern whereby tree growth is suppressed coincident with a drought beginning 1 year before the 1989 tests, but continuing in the 5 years following the tests, which is anomalous relative to what is expected based on the response of tree growth to previous droughts. Quantification of the relative effects of the tests on vegetation remains a challenge due to the coincident drought and the potential for other disturbances to have impacted tree growth at this time, but the integration of these data reveals a more nuanced growth response than any other one data set indicates alone.

TI  - Without Systems and Complexity Thinking There Is No Progress - or Why Bureaucracy Needs to Become Curious Comment on "What Can Policy-Makers Get out of Systems Thinking? Policy Partners' Experiences of a Systems-Focused Research Collaboration in Preventive Health"
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The bureaucracy's goal is to maintain uniformity and control within discrete areas of activity and relies on hierarchical processes and procedural correctness as means to suppress autonomous decision-making. That worldview, however, is unsuited for problem solving of real world VUCA (Volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) problems. Solving wicked problems in the VUCA world requires curiosity, creativity and collaboration, and a willingness to deeply engage and an ability to painstakingly work through their seemingly contradictory and chaotic pathways. In addition, it necessitates leadership. Leaders require a deep - indeed academic - understanding of the nature of the problems and the veracity of various problem-solving approaches. Leadership after all means "[facilitating] the necessary adaptive work that needs to be done by the people connected to the problem." That are the people at the coalface who understand and have to manage the complexities relating to problems unique to their local environment for which of the shelf solutions never work. Systems and complexity thinking is more than a tool, it is - in a sense - a way of being, namely deeply interested in understanding the highly interconnected and interdependent nature of the issues affecting our life and work. Hence, system and complexity thinking is, contrary to what Haynes and colleagues state in their "summation for the public reader," neither "overwhelming and hard [nor difficult] to use practically." Such a view is as much misleading as self-defeating. Copyright: (c) 2021 The Author(s); Published by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.

TI  - High-Resolution Numerical Modeling of Barotropic Global Ocean Tides for Satellite Gravimetry
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The recently upgraded barotropic tidal model TiME is employed to study the influence of fundamental tidal processes, the chosen model resolution, and the bathymetric map on the achievable model accuracy, exemplary for the M-2 tide. Additionally, the newly introduced pole-rotation scheme allows to estimate the model's inherent precision (open ocean rms: 0.90 cm) and enables studies of the Arctic domain without numerical deviations originating from pole cap handling. We find that the smallest open ocean rms with respect to the FES14-atlas (3.39 cm) is obtained when tidal dissipation is carried out to similar parts by quadratic bottom friction, wave drag, and parametrized eddy-viscosity. This setting proves versatile to obtaining high accuracy values for a diverse ensemble of additional partial tides. Using the preferred model settings, we show that for certain minor tides it is possible to obtain solutions that are more accurate than results derived with admittance assumptions from data-constrained tidal atlases. As linear admittance derived minor tides are routinely used for de-aliasing of satellite gravimetric data, this opens the potential for improving gravity field products by employing the solutions from TiME.Plain Language Summary We introduce the upgraded computer model TiME, that simulates ocean tides originating from the gravitational attraction of the sun and moon. The model relies on the physics of relevant processes without incorporating actual observations of water level variations. Formerly unconsidered effects that strongly impact tidal dynamics are now included. We discuss the individual impact of these effects on the model accuracy, which is estimated relatively to local measurements from tide gauges. We further compare our results to external tidal models, that employ satellite observations for increased accuracy. Here we find that the upgraded model performs well in the open ocean, and has a reduced accuracy in shallow and coastal waters. The final model setting can simulate tides that recur once or twice per day at a similar level of accuracy. This weak dependence on the excitation amplitude renders TiME especially suited for studying minor tides. Due to their low amplitudes, these tides make up a smaller part of tidal dynamics and are hard to determine with satellite data, thus rendering solutions by our model being free of data constraints valuable. Comparing our solutions with routinely used, empirically motivated estimates of minor tides we show that an increased accuracy is obtained.

TI  - Assimilation of <i>FY</i>-<i>3D</i> MWHS-2 Radiances with WRF Hybrid-3DVAR System for the Forecast of Heavy Rainfall Evolution Associated with Typhoon Ampil
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - A detailed investigation about the effects of the Microwave Humidity Sounder-2 (MWHS-2) radiances on board the Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) satellite is combined with developments within the Weather Research and Forecasting Data Assimilation (WRFDA) system and analyses on the evolution of the heavy rainfall associated with Typhoon Ampil during 23-24 July 2018. In the analysis field, the position of Typhoon Ampil is found out to be distinctly affected by the MWHS-2 assimilation. The experiment that assimilates MWHS-2 radiances through hybrid-3DVAR generates the best analysis with large increments around the typhoon, which contributes to the typhoon moving inland to the southwest. In the forecast fields, the MWHS-2 assimilation improves the rainfall in not only the accumulated amount, but also the evolution characteristics. The hybrid-3DVAR experiment reduces the RMSE of the rainfall amount, and enhances the spatial correlation and the fractions skill score of the rainfall evolution to the greatest extent, followed by the 3DVAR MWHS-2 experiment. As for the cause of the rainfall improvements, analyses suggest that it could be closely connected with the characteristics of the circulation structures related to the typhoon evolution. On one hand, the increases of the rainfall amount and intensities in the MWHS-2 assimilation experiments (previously underestimated) correspond to the strengthened typhoon structures with strong anomalies in both the upper-layer temperature and the lower-layer geopotential height. On the other hand, the better rainfall evolution in the hybrid-3DVAR experiment could be explained by its clearer evolution of the structure of typhoon under the effects of an approaching upper trough, and its smallest typhoon track errors around the middle time period.

TI  - Comparative study of two contrast agents for intraoperative identification of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with early breast cancer
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Backgrounds: The use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to locate sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in breast cancer has been studied more and more in recent years. This prospective study aimed to compare periareolar injection of two different contrast agents, SonoVue (R) (SNV) and Sonazoid (R) (SNZ), followed by CEUS to identify SLNs in breast cancer patients with clinically negative nodes.Methods: A total of 205 patients with T1-2NOMO breast cancer were divided into the SNV group and SNZ group. All were administered a periareolar injection of SNV or SNZ and underwent US to identify contrast-enhanced SLNs. Each contrast-enhanced SLN underwent a biopsy with blue dye and examined again by CEUS in vitro.Results: In all cases, contrast-enhanced lymphatic vessels were dearly visualized using US soon after the periareolar injection of SNZ, and the SLNs were easily identified. The SLN identification rates were 75.27% (210/279) for SNV and 93.58% (102/109) for SNZ. Although the accuracy of detecting SLN metastasis was slightly different between the two groups, there was no statistically significant difference between those groups (P=0.615). Moreover, it was possible to identify SLNs in vitro in the SNZ group, and these could be compared with the lymph nodes (LNs) located using SNZ during the preoperative stage and with blue dye during the procedure. This helped in determining the resection requirements.Conclusions: When comparing the subdermal use of SNV and SNZ, no significant differences in the number of detected SLNs and the diagnosis of metastatic LNs were observed. Because SLNs can be detected for a longer time in living tissues with SNZ, this contrast agent may provide more intraoperative information for complete resection of all preoperative localization of SLN.

TI  - Effects of Hydro-Meteorological Factors on Streamflow Withdrawal for Irrigation in Yeongsan River Basin
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationships between a variety of hydro-meteorological variables and irrigation water use rates (WUR) were investigated in this study. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Potential Evapotranspiration (PET), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were explored to identify the relationship with the WUR. The Yeongsan river basin, the agricultural land of which is mostly occupied by well-irrigated paddy, was used for the pilot study. Four different temporal scales of SPI-3, 6, 9, and 12 were tested, and PET was calculated using the Thornthwaite method. To calculate NDVI, the surface spectral reflectance data, which was acquired by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) equipped on the Terra satellite, were used. As a result, there was a statistically significant relationship between SPI9 and the WUR during drought periods in which negative values of SPI9 were obtained. The WUR was strongly correlated with both PET and NDVI. Compared with SPI, the variability of WUR in this study area was more sensitively affected by PET and NDVI, which can cause a potential lack of agricultural water supply. The finding of this study implies that SPI9, PET, and NDVI are the critical factors for predicting water withdrawal during drought conditions so that they can be used for irrigational water use management. Although a part of the findings of this study has been discussed by a few previous studies, this study is novel in that it quantifies the relationship between these factors using actual field observations of streamflow withdrawal for irrigation.

TI  - How the cesarean delivery rate decreased at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Debrecen during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - ORVOSI HETILAP
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has catalized several changes in many fields of our lives, and also at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Debrecen, Hungary.Objectives: We wanted to analyse the compound effect of our new local protocols regarding elective labour inductions at term, the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting infection control measures, the merging of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Ward of the Ken & eacute;zy County Hospital of Debrecen and the University Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and also the change of the legal environment.Methods: Local protocols were introduced: 1. Labour induction. 2. Cervical ripening in labour induction. 3. Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean. 4. Management of pregnancy around term in the case of planned trial of labour after cesarean. We compared the obstetrical data (number of deliveries, cesarean section rate, perinatal outcome and the rate and success rate of labour inductions) before and after the implementation of the protocols. The results were also compared to the Hungarian national database.Results: The annual cesarean rate at our department dropped to 33.5% in 2020. In the first 9-month period, after the introduction of the new reforms, the cesarean rate decreased to 30.7%, whereas the Hungarian national rate was 40.3% in 2020. At our department, 20% of all the deliveries were induced and 74% of them led to vaginal deliveries in 2020, while in 2019 only 11% of deliveries were labour inductions, and 47% of these cases were vaginal deliveries. The monthly number of deliveries was rising constantly between January 2020 (250 deliveries) and January 2021 (450 deliveries), and the monthly cesarean rate decreased from 41% to 25%. Comparing the data of 2019 and 2020, the annual perinatal mortality rate dropped from 6.3%o in 2019 to 4.2%o in 2020. Neonatal morbidity, as measured by admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit, also decreased (14.8% in 2019 and 13.5% in 2020).Conclusions: As a compound result of the described factors, but mainly due to the new protocols, both the rate and the success rate of labour inductions increased significantly, while the cesarean rate decreased with improving perinatal mortality and morbidity.

TI  - Reconstruction of the Daily MODIS Land Surface Temperature Product Using the Two-Step Improved Similar Pixels Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The MODIS land surface temperature (LST) product is one of the most widely used data sources to study the climate and energy-water cycle at a global scale. However, the large number of invalid values caused by cloud cover limits the wide application of the MODIS LST. In this study, a two-step improved similar pixels (TISP) method was proposed for cloudy sky LST reconstruction. The TISP method was validated using a temperature-based method over various land cover types. The ground measurements were collected at fifteen stations from 2013 to 2018 during the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) field campaign in China. The estimated theoretical clear-sky temperature indicates that clouds cool the land surface during the daytime and warm it at nighttime. For bare land, the surface temperature shows a clear seasonal trend and very similar across stations, with a cooling amplitude of 4.14 K in the daytime and a warming amplitude of 3.99 K at nighttime, as a yearly average. The validation result showed that the reconstructed LST is highly consistent with in situ measurements and comparable with MODIS LST validation accuracy, with a mean bias of 0.15 K at night (-0.43 K in the day), mean RMSE of 2.91 K at night (4.41 K in the day), and mean R-2 of 0.93 at night (0.90 in the day). The developed method maximizes the potential of obtaining quality MODIS LST retrievals, ancillary data, and in situ observations, and the results show high accuracy for most land cover types.

TI  - A bibliometric analysis of remote sensing research hotspots on the South China Sea and its U-boundary
T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - We use bibliometrics to analyze journal articles with related themes published in and before 2019, to comprehensively evaluate ocean remote sensing applications in the South China Sea (SCS), especially in terms of its U-boundary. We employed CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) and WOSCC (Web of Science Core Collection) as the representatives of journal article databases in Chinese and in foreign languages, respectively. The classifying selection results are as follows: 10150 articles in Chinese and 10130 in foreign languages were published on natural sciences of SCS, 560 in Chinese and 1296 in foreign languages on remote sensing of SCS, and 303 in Chinese and 33 in foreign languages on the U-boundary of SCS. The bibliometric analysis shows that the country with the most articles in all kinds of languages was China (18253), where the top publishing institutions (such as No. 1 South China Sea Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences) and the journals (such as No. 1 Journal of Tropical Oceanography) were primarily from. The annual article qualities on SCS natural sciences experienced four stages (slow start, slow growth, fast growth, and fallback), those on SCS remote sensing experienced two stages (slow start and fast growth), while those on the U-boundary experienced three stages (slow start, fast growth and fallback). The research hotspots of SCS natural sciences were monsoon, gas hydrate and typhoon, while the research hotspots of SCS remote sensing were sea surface temperature, chlorophyll and typhoon, and those of the U-boundary were SCS disputes and geologic features. Our study finds that it was in 1974 that remote sensing data were first applied to the research of SCS typhoons, and it was in 2019 that remote sensing data were first used on ecological environment research of the U-boundary. It is of great significance to develop comprehensive scientific research on the U-boundary corridor in SCS by developing remote sensing technology.

TI  - Inversion of Chlorophyll-a Concentration in Donghu Lake Based on Machine Learning Algorithm
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning algorithm, as an important method for numerical modeling, has been widely used for chlorophyll-a concentration inversion modeling. In this work, a variety of models were built by applying five kinds of datasets and adopting back propagation neural network (BPNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector machine (SVM). The results revealed that modeling with multi-factor datasets has the possibility to improve the accuracy of inversion model, and seven band combinations are better than seven single bands when modeling, Besides, SVM is more suitable than BPNN and ELM for chlorophyll-a concentration inversion modeling of Donghu Lake. The SVM model based on seven three-band combination dataset (SVM3) is the best inversion one among all multi-factor models that the mean relative error (MRE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) of the SVM model based on single-factor dataset (SF-SVM) are 30.82%, 9.44 mu g/L and 12.66 mu g/L, respectively. SF-SVM performs best in single-factor models, MRE, MAE, RMSE of SF-SVM are 28.63%, 13.69 mu g/L and 16.49 mu g/L, respectively. In addition, the simulation effect of SVM3 is better than that of SF-SVM. On the whole, an effective model for retrieving chlorophyll-a concentration has been built based on machine learning algorithm, and our work provides a reliable basis and promotion for exploring accurate and applicable chlorophyll-a inversion model.

TI  - Mapping Impervious Surface Areas Using Time-Series Nighttime Light and MODIS Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping impervious surface area (ISA) dynamics at the regional and global scales is an important task that supports the management of the urban environment and urban ecological systems. In this study, we aimed to develop a new method for ISA percentage (ISA%) mapping using Nighttime Light (NTL) and MODIS products. The proposed method consists of three major steps. First, we calculated the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)-adjusted NTL index (EANTLI) and performed intra-annual and inter-annual corrections on the DMSP-OLS data. Second, based on the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, we built a consistent NTL product from 2000 to 2019 by performing an intercalibration between DMSP-OLS and VIIRS images. Third, we adopted a GA-BP neural network model to monitor ISA% dynamics using NTL imagery, MODIS imagery, and population data. Taking the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay as the study area, our results indicate that the ISA% in our study area increased from 7.97% in 2000 to 17.11% in 2019, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0647, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.1003, Pearson's coefficient of 0.9613, and R-2 (R-squared) of 0.9239. Specifically, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in mapping ISA and investigating ISA dynamics using temporal features extracted from consistent NTL and MODIS products. The proposed method is feasible when generating ISA% at a large scale at high frequency, given the ease of implementation and the availability of input data sources.

TI  - Status of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Endometrial Cancer
T2  - GEBURTSHILFE UND FRAUENHEILKUNDE
M3  - Review
AB  - The role of lymphadenectomy in surgical staging remains one of the biggest controversies in the management of endometrial cancer. The concept of sentinel lymph node biopsy in endometrial cancer has been evaluated for a number of years, with promising sensitivity rates and negative predictive values. The possibility of adequate staging while avoiding systematic lymphadenectomy leads to a significant reduction in the rate of peri- and postoperative morbidity. Nevertheless, the status of sentinel lymph node biopsy in endometrial cancer has not yet been fully elucidated and is variously assessed internationally. According to current European guidelines and recommendations, sentinel lymph node biopsy in endometrial cancer should be performed only in the context of clinical studies. In this review article, the developments of the past decade are explored concisely. In addition, current data regarding the technical aspects, accuracy and prognostic relevance of sentinel lymph node biopsy are explained and evaluated critically.Zusammenfassung Eine der gro ss ten Kontroversen im Management des Endometriumkarzinoms bleibt die Rolle der Lymphonodektomie im Rahmen des operativen Stagings. Das Konzept des Sentinellymphknoten-Verfahrens beim Endometriumkarzinom wird bereits seit mehreren Jahren evaluiert - mit vielversprechenden Sensitivitatsraten und negativen Vorhersagewerten. Die Moglichkeit des adaquaten Stagings unter Verzicht auf eine systematische Lymphonodektomie fuhrt zu einer wesentlichen Reduktion der peri- und postoperativen Morbiditatsrate. Dennoch ist der Stellenwert der Sentinellymphonodektomie beim Endometriumkarzinom bislang noch nicht ganzlich geklart und wird international unterschiedlich bewertet. Gema ss den geltenden europaischen Leitlinien und Empfehlungen sollte die Sentinellymphonodektomie beim Endometriumkarzinom nur im Rahmen von klinischen Studien durchgefuhrt werden. Im Rahmen dieser ubersichtsarbeit werden die Entwicklungen der letzten Dekade pragnant erlautert. Des Weiteren wird die aktuelle Datenlage hinsichtlich technischer Aspekte, Genauigkeit und prognostischer Relevanz der Sentinellymphonodektomie erlautert und kritisch bewertet.

TI  - Coupling Historical Maps and LiDAR Data to Identify Man-Made Landforms in Urban Areas
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, there has been growing interest in urban geomorphology both for its applications in terms of landscape planning, and its historical, cultural, and scientific interest. Due to recent urban growth, the identification of landforms in cities is difficult, particularly in Mediterranean and central European cities, characterized by more than 1000 years of urban stratification. By comparing and overlapping 19th-century cartography and modern topography from remote sensing data, this research aims to assess the morphological evolution of the city of Genoa (Liguria, NW Italy). The analysis focuses on a highly detailed 1:2'000 scale map produced by Eng. Ignazio Porro in the mid-19th century. The methodology, developed in QGIS, was applied on five case studies of both hillside and valley floor areas of the city of Genoa. Through map overlay and digitalization of elevation data and contour lines, it was possible to identify with great accuracy the most significant morphological transformations that have occurred in the city since the mid-19th century. In addition, the results were validated by direct observation and by drills data of the regional database. The results allowed the identification and quantification of the main anthropic landforms. The paper suggests that the same methodology can be applied to other historical urban contexts characterized by urban and architectural stratification.

TI  - Multiscale mapping of plant functional groups and plant traits in the High Arctic using field spectroscopy, UAV imagery and Sentinel-2A data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, leading to rapid changes in species composition and plant functional trait variation. Landscape-level maps of vegetation composition and trait distributions are required to expand spatially-limited plot studies, overcome sampling biases associated with the most accessible research areas, and create baselines from which to monitor environmental change. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a low-cost method to generate high-resolution imagery and bridge the gap between fine-scale field studies and lower resolution satellite analyses. Here we used field spectroscopy data (400-2500 nm) and UAV multispectral imagery to test spectral methods of species identification and plant water and chemistry retrieval near Longyearbyen, Svalbard. Using the field spectroscopy data and Random Forest analysis, we were able to distinguish eight common High Arctic plant tundra species with 74% accuracy. Using partial least squares regression (PLSR), we were able to predict corresponding water, nitrogen, phosphorus and C:N values (r (2) = 0.61-0.88, RMSEmean = 12%-64%). We developed analogous models using UAV imagery (five bands: Blue, Green, Red, Red Edge and Near-Infrared) and scaled up the results across a 450 m long nutrient gradient located underneath a seabird colony. At the UAV level, we were able to map three plant functional groups (mosses, graminoids and dwarf shrubs) at 72% accuracy and generate maps of plant chemistry. Our maps show a clear marine-derived fertility gradient, mediated by geomorphology. We used the UAV results to explore two methods of upscaling plant water content to the wider landscape using Sentinel-2A imagery. Our results are pertinent for high resolution, low-cost mapping of the Arctic.

TI  - The Use of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar for Isolating the Contribution of Major Shocks: The Case of the March 2021 Thessaly, Greece, Seismic Sequence
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We study the surface deformation following a moderate size M5+ earthquake sequence that occurred close to Tyrnavos village (Thessaly, Greece) in March 2021. We adopt the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique to exploit several pairs of Sentinel-1 acquisitions and successfully retrieve the ground movement caused by the three major events (M5+) of the sequence. The mainshocks occurred at depths varying from similar to 7 to similar to 10 km, and are related to the activation of at least three normal faults characterizing the area previously unknown. Thanks to the 6-day repeat time of the Sentinel-1 mission, InSAR analysis allowed us to detect both the surface displacement due to the individual analyzed earthquakes and the cumulative displacement caused by the entire seismic sequence. Especially in the case of a seismic sequence that occurs over a very short time span, it is quite uncommon to be able to separate the surface effects ascribable to the mainshock and the major aftershocks because the time frequency of radar satellite acquisitions often hamper the temporal separation of such events. In this work, we present the results obtained through the InSAR data analysis, and are able to isolate single seismic events that were part of the sequence.

TI  - Shifting Patterns of Summer Lake Color Phenology in Over 26,000 US Lakes
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are often defined by seasonal cycles. The seasonal timing, or phenology, of many lake processes are changing in response to human activities. However, long-term records exist for few lakes, and extrapolating patterns observed in these lakes to entire landscapes is exceedingly difficult using the limited number of available in situ observations. Limited landscape-level observations mean we do not know how common shifts in lake phenology are at macroscales. Here, we use a new remote sensing data set, LimnoSat-US, to analyze U.S. summer lake color phenology between 1984 and 2020 across more than 26,000 lakes. Our results show that summer lake color seasonality can be generalized into five distinct phenology groups that follow well-known patterns of phytoplankton succession. The frequency with which lakes transition from one phenology group to another is tied to lake and landscape level characteristics. Lakes with high inflows and low variation in their seasonal surface area are generally more stable, while lakes in areas with high interannual variations in climate and catchment population density show less stability. Our results reveal previously unexamined spatiotemporal patterns in lake seasonality and demonstrate the utility of LimnoSat-US, which, with over 22 million remote sensing observations of lakes, creates novel opportunities to examine changing lake ecosystems at a national scale.

TI  - MAPPING OF PASTURE AREAS IN THE CERRADO BIOME FROM SATELLITE DATA
T2  - HUMANIDADES & INOVACAO
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing products allow to understand the use of space at different spatial and temporal scales. This articleanalyzes thespatial dynamics of pasture areas in the Cerrado biome, specifically in the microregion of the Medio Araguaia - MT, in order to quantify the percentage of change in pasture areas and the role of agricultural occupation in this dynamic. The mapping was performed from the supervised classification of landsat 5/TM and Landsat 8/OLI satellite images from 1998 and 2018, respectively, in Spring software. The comparison with agricultural occupation was verified from IBGE data. The results showed that the pasture areas in the microregion of the Medio Araguaia - MT, presented a percentage of reduction between 1998 and 2018 of 8.4%, being converted mainly into agricultural areas. Thus, the effectiveness of the products and the methodology used in this study is highlighted.

TI  - Effect of Cloud Cover on Land Use Land Cover dynamics using Remotely Sensed Data of Western Niger Delta, Nigeria
T2  - Journal of Applied Sciences & Environmental Management
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of cloud cover on land use land cover (LULC) changes in the tropical region of Western Niger Delta was investigated. Landsat images of more than 11/2 decades (2002-2019) of path 189 row 056 with bands 1-5 were used for the analysis. Supervised classification was applied to obtain the LULC statistics. Cloud cover for 2002, 2014 and 2019 were 0.48%, 0% and 32% respectively. The extracted statistics shows that cultivation, built-up area, exposed soil, secondary regrowth and water body increased between 2002 and 2014. These LULC except oil spills decreased between 2014 and 2019. These LULC were expected to record further increment between 2014 and 2019 due to increase in population. Dense forest and light forest maintained a decrease over the entire period. The real values were affected by cloud appearing as noise in 2019 image, which is a problem in a damp and humid climate. Climate change could be another reason because the data were acquired in the dry season. The satellite image of 2019 may not be used for accurate land mapping due to the high value of cloud cover. This has shown the effect of dynamic nature of climate in the region and the importance of supervised classification in the analysis of satellite images. Copyright (C) 2021 Uchegbulam et al.

TI  - Land cover change alters seasonal photosynthetic activity and transpiration of Amazon forest and Cerrado
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical vegetation influences local, regional, and global climates, largely through its relationship with the atmosphere, including seasonal patterns of photosynthesis and transpiration. Removal and replacement of natural vegetation can alter both of these processes. In the Amazon, land use/land cover change (LULCC; e.g. deforestation) started decades ago and is expected to continue, with potentially strong effects on climate. However, long-term data on tropical photosynthetic activity and transpiration are scarce, limiting our ability to estimate large-scale effects of LULCC. Here, we use remote sensing data to analyze the impact of LULCC on seasonal patterns of photosynthetic activity and transpiration in the southern Amazon. This region, naturally dominated by forest and Cerrado, has seen high rates of LULCC. Within each of these two ecosystems, we compare estimates of photosynthetic activity (from GOME-2 and GOSIF solar induced fluorescence, SIF) and transpiration (from the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model, GLEAM) in paired sites with high and low rates of LULCC. In forest-dominated regions, deforestation has reduced photosynthetic activity and transpiration, particularly during the dry season, and replaced dry season greening with dry season browning. The SIF datasets disagree on wet season responses; SIF increases with deforestation according to GOME-2, but decreases according to GOSIF. In Cerrado-dominated areas, LULCC has increased photosynthetic activity during the wet season. In both ecosystems, LULCC has resulted in a higher seasonal or annual range of photosynthetic activity levels. The observed effects are often stronger in regions with more extensive LULCC. We found large differences between the two SIF products in both forest- and Cerrado-dominated pixels, with GOME-2 consistently providing higher maximum SIF values. These discrepancies merit further consideration. This analysis broadly characterizes the effects of LULCC on photosynthetic activity and transpiration in this region, and can be used to validate model representations of these effects.

TI  - Effect of Different Atmospheric Correction Algorithms on Sentinel-2 Imagery Classification Accuracy in a Semiarid Mediterranean Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal imagery classification using spectral information and indices with random forest allows improving accuracy in land use and cover classification in semiarid Mediterranean areas, where the high fragmentation of the landscape caused by multiple factors complicates the task. Hence, since data come from different dates, atmospheric correction is needed to retrieve surface reflectivity values. The Sen2Cor, MAJA and ACOLITE algorithms have proven their good performances in these areas in different comparative studies, and DOS is a basic method that is widely used. The aim in this study was to test the feasibility of its application to the data set to improve the values of accuracy in classification and the performance in properly labelling different classes. Additionally, we tried to correct accuracy and separability mixing predictors with different algorithms. The results showed that, using a single algorithm, the general accuracy and kappa index from ACOLITE were the highest, 0.80 +/- 0.01 and 0.76 +/- 0.01., but the separability between problematic classes was slightly improved by using MAJA. Any combination of the different algorithms tested increased the values of classification, although they may help with separability between some pairs of classes.

TI  - Spectral signature analysis of false positive burned area detection from agricultural harvests using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of burned area is of key importance for fire emissions modeling and post-fire rehabilitation planning. In this research, Sentinel-2 data were used to analyze the difference in spectral signature between burned area and false positives from agricultural harvests. 26 fires that were mapped in the field using Global Navigation Satellite System during 2017 and 2018 were analyzed over California and Utah, USA. Individual Sentinel-2 bands and a wide range of commonly used spectral indices for burned area were tested using a spectral separability index. The separability index assessed discrimination between the classes burned area and 1) unburned area and 2) area in agricultural land that were flagged as false positive from agricultural harvest. Separability values higher than one indicate good separation and the higher the values, the better the separation. For each class, we first determined the multitemporal difference, i.e. the absolute value of the pre-minus-post-change value. Second, we compared with other classes by using the spectral separability index. We found that for the burned-to-unburned comparison the near and shortwave infrared spectral regions and spectral indices that make use of these spectral regions, were the best discriminators (separability (M) values of approximately 2), corroborating findings from earlier works. For the burned-to-agricultural false positive comparison Sentinel-2 bands 4 and 5, corresponding with the Red and Red-edge spectral regions, were the best discriminator (M values greater than 2). Consequently, spectral indices containing the Red band show a similar strong separability of agricultural false positives. The results from our research reveal an additional layer of information that could be exploited to minimize false positives in agricultural lands in space-borne burned area products.

TI  - Ambiguous Agricultural Drought: Characterising Soil Moisture and Vegetation Droughts in Europe from Earth Observation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-lasting precipitation deficits or heat waves can induce agricultural droughts, which are generally defined as soil moisture deficits that are severe enough to negatively impact vegetation. However, during short soil moisture drought events, the vegetation is not always negatively affected and sometimes even thrives. Due to this duality in agricultural drought impacts, the term "agricultural drought" is ambiguous. Using the ESA's remotely sensed CCI surface soil moisture estimates and MODIS NDVI vegetation greenness data, we show that, in major European droughts over the past two decades, asynchronies and discrepancies occurred between the surface soil moisture and vegetation droughts. A clear delay is visible between the onset of soil moisture drought and vegetation drought, with correlations generally peaking at the end of the growing season. At lower latitudes, correlations peaked earlier in the season, likely due to an earlier onset of water limited conditions. In certain cases, the vegetation showed a positive anomaly, even during soil moisture drought events. As a result, using the term agricultural drought instead of soil moisture or vegetation drought, could lead to the misclassification of drought events and false drought alarms. We argue that soil moisture and vegetation drought should be considered separately.

TI  - Estimating Farm Wheat Yields from NDVI and Meteorological Data
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on crop yield at scales ranging from the field to the global level is imperative for farmers and decision makers. The current data sources to monitor crop yield, such as regional agriculture statistics, are often lacking in spatial and temporal resolution. Remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs) such as NDVI are able to assess crop yield using empirical modelling strategies. Empirical NDVI-based crop yield models were evaluated by comparing the model performance with similar models used in different regions. The integral NDVI and the peak NDVI were weak predictors of winter wheat yield in northern Belgium. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) yield variability was better predicted by monthly precipitation during tillering and anthesis than by NDVI-derived yield proxies in the period from 2016 to 2018 (R-2 = 0.66). The NDVI series were not sensitive enough to yield affecting weather conditions during important phenological stages such as tillering and anthesis and were weak predictors in empirical crop yield models. In conclusion, winter wheat yield modelling using NDVI-derived yield proxies as predictor variables is dependent on the environment.

TI  - Combining Geostatistics and Remote Sensing Data to Improve Spatiotemporal Analysis of Precipitation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The wide availability of satellite data from many distributors in different domains of science has provided the opportunity for the development of new and improved methodologies to aid the analysis of environmental problems and to support more reliable estimations and forecasts. Moreover, the rapid development of specialized technologies in satellite instruments provides the opportunity to obtain a wide spectrum of various measurements. The purpose of this research is to use publicly available remote sensing product data computed from geostationary, polar and near-polar satellites and radar to improve space-time modeling and prediction of precipitation on Crete island in Greece. The proposed space-time kriging method carries out the fusion of remote sensing data with data from ground stations that monitor precipitation during the hydrological period 2009/10-2017/18. Precipitation observations are useful for water resources, flood and drought management studies. However, monitoring stations are usually sparse in regions with complex terrain, are clustered in valleys, and often have missing data. Satellite precipitation data are an attractive alternative to observations. The fusion of the datasets in terms of the space-time residual kriging method exploits the auxiliary satellite information and aids in the accurate and reliable estimation of precipitation rates at ungauged locations. In addition, it represents an alternative option for the improved modeling of precipitation variations in space and time. The obtained results were compared with the outcomes of similar works in the study area.

TI  - A new small area estimation algorithm to balance between statistical precision and scale
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining national forest inventory (NFI) data with auxiliary information allows downscaling and improving the precision of NFI estimates for small domains, where normally too few field plots are available to produce reliable estimates. In most situations, small domains represent administrative units that could greatly vary in size and forested area. In small and poorly sampled domains, the precision of estimates often drop below expected standards.To tackle this issue, we introduce a downscaling algorithm generating the smallest possible groups of domains satisfying prescribed sampling density and estimation error. The binary space partitioning algorithm recursively divides the population of domains in two groups while the prescribed precision conditions are fulfilled.The algorithm was tested on two major forest attributes (i.e. growing stock and basal area) in an area of 7,500 km(2) dominated by hardwood forests in the centre of France. The estimation domains consisted in 157 municipalities. The field data included 819 NFI plots surveyed during a 5 years period. The auxiliary data consisted in 48 metrics derived from a forest map, photogrammetric models and Landsat images. A model-assisted framework was used for estimation. For each forest attribute, the best model was selected using a best-subset approach using a Bayesian Information Criteria. The retained models explained 58% and 41% of the observed variance for the growing stocks and basal areas respectively. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using a minimum of 3 NFI points per domain and estimation errors varying from 10 to 50%.For a target estimation error set to 10%, the algorithm led to a limited number of estimation domains (<23 for both attributes) of large size (similar to 15,000 ha) having an average estimation error lower than 7.7% for both attributes. Relaxing the targeted error threshold to 50% led to a larger amount of smaller domains (80 domains of 4,176 ha in average) for both attributes, and maximum estimation errors reaching 42.8%. Among those domains 65% consisted in single municipalities. For the sake of comparison, the estimation was also conducted at the scale of municipalities. Out of the 157 municipalities studied, only 93 were sampled with at least 3 NFI points and therefore estimated. Missing values were generated for the remaining 64 municipalities. Average errors of 15.9% and 15.6% were obtained for growing stock and basal area respectively, but estimation errors greater than 50% were obtained for some municipalities.The algorithm provides a flexible estimation framework for small area estimation. The key advantages of the approach are relying on its capacity to produce estimations based on a preselected precision threshold and to produce results over the whole area of interest, avoiding areas without any estimates. The algorithm could also be used on any kind of polygon layers (not only administrative ones), provided that the field sampling design enable estimation. This makes the proposed algorithm a convenient tool notably for decision makers and forest managers.

TI  - Vulnerability Indicators for Coastal Roadways Based on Barrier Island Morphology and Shoreline Change Predictions
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal roadways are vulnerable to changes in landscape that occur at variable spatiotemporal scales. In particular, highways on barrier islands suffer the consequences of the combined action of the ocean, the back-barrier lagoon, and the morphological changes in the island. Coastal dunes and beaches are typically the only barrier between the ocean and the island's infrastructure, while low-lying marshes separate the infrastructure from back-barrier lagoons. This work addresses the spatiotemporal variability of these coastal features along a barrier island and proposes a set of vulnerability indicators that allow evaluating past, present, and future vulnerability of a coastal roadway. Systematically collected remotely sensed data were used to digitize dune elevations and oceanfront and estuarine shorelines in the northern portion of Hatteras Island, North Carolina, US. Based on these morphological data and their distance to the main roadway on the island, three vulnerability indicators were defined along shore-normal transects: (1) island width <305 m, (2) dune crest elevation <3 m above the highway, and (3) edge of pavement within 70 m of the ocean shoreline. In addition, potentially vulnerable areas of the coastal roadway have been predicted until 2030 based on historical records of shoreline positions (mid-1940s to present). Of the 20 km of roadway analyzed, currently, nearly 6 km meet at least one vulnerability criterion. By year 2030, 9 km of roadway will potentially become vulnerable because of proximity to the shoreline. These results reveal five main regions of concern; of those regions, two breached during Hurricane Irene (2011) and the others have suffered major dune erosion, overwash, and flooding during winter storms and hurricanes. The vulnerability assessment presented here allowed identification of historical, present, and future vulnerable spots along the island and continues to inform the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) for their planning and adaption strategies for future phases of highway improvements. The simplicity of the indicators makes them applicable to other coastal roadways and even other types of critical infrastructure in barrier islands and coastal regions. However, if used at different locations, the specific thresholds for the indicators can vary depending on local conditions that may differ from the ones analyzed here.

TI  - Crowdsourced air temperatures contrast satellite measures of the urban heat island and its mechanisms
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The ubiquitous nature of satellite data has led to an explosion of studies on the surface urban heat island (SUHI). Relatively few have simultaneously used air temperature measurements to compare SUHI with the canopy UHI (CUHI), which is more relevant to public health. Using crowdsourced citizen weather stations (>50,000) and satellite data over Europe, we estimate the CUHI and SUHI intensity in 342 urban clusters during the 2019 heat wave. Satellites produce a sixfold overestimate of UHI relative to station measurements (mean SUHI 1.45 degrees C; CUHI 0.26 degrees C), with SUHI exceeding CUHI in 96% of cities during daytime and in 80% at night. Using empirical evidence, we confirm the control of aerodynamic roughness on UHI intensity, but find evaporative cooling to have a stronger overall impact during this time period. Our results support urban greening as an effective UHI mitigation strategy and caution against relying on satellite data for urban heat risk assessments.

TI  - Bi-hemispherical Canopy Reflectance Model with Surface Heterogeneity Effects for the Estimation of LAI and fAPAR from MODIS White-Sky Spectral Albedo Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bi-hemispherical reflectance (BHR), in the land surface research community also known as "white-sky albedo", is independent of the directions of incidence and viewing. For vegetation canopies, it is also nearly independent of the leaf angle distribution, and therefore it can be considered an optical quantity that is only dependent on material properties. For the combination leaf canopy and soil background, the most influential material properties are the canopy LAI (leaf area index), optical properties of the leaves, and soil brightness. When the leaf and soil optical properties are known or assumed, one may estimate the canopy LAI from its white-sky spectral albedo. This is also because a simple two-stream radiative transfer (RT) model is available for the BHR of the leaf canopy and soil combination. In this contribution, crown clumping and lateral linear mixing effects are incorporated in this model. A new procedure to estimate soil brightness is introduced here, even under a moderate layer of green vegetation. The procedure uses the red and NIR spectral bands. A MODIS white-sky albedo product at a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees is used as a sample input to derive global maps of LAI, soil brightness, and fAPAR at the local moments of minimum and maximum NDVI over a 20-year period. These maps show a high degree of spatial coherence and demonstrate the possible utility of products that can be generated with little effort by using a direct LUT technique.

TI  - A Compilation of Snow Cover Datasets for Svalbard: A Multi-Sensor, Multi-Model Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable and accurate mapping of snow cover are essential in applications such as water resource management, hazard forecasting, calibration and validation of hydrological models and climate impact assessments. Optical remote sensing has been utilized as a tool for snow cover monitoring over the last several decades. However, consistent long-term monitoring of snow cover can be challenging due to differences in spatial resolution and retrieval algorithms of the different generations of satellite-based sensors. Snow models represent a complementary tool to remote sensing for snow cover monitoring, being able to fill in temporal and spatial data gaps where a lack of observations exist. This study utilized three optical remote sensing datasets and two snow models with overlapping periods of data coverage to investigate the similarities and discrepancies in snow cover estimates over Nordenskiold Land in central Svalbard. High-resolution Sentinel-2 observations were utilized to calibrate a 20-year MODIS snow cover dataset that was subsequently used to correct snow cover fraction estimates made by the lower resolution AVHRR instrument and snow model datasets. A consistent overestimation of snow cover fraction by the lower resolution datasets was found, as well as estimates of the first snow-free day (FSFD) that were, on average, 10-15 days later when compared with the baseline MODIS estimates. Correction of the AVHRR time series produced a significantly slower decadal change in the land-averaged FSFD, indicating that caution should be exercised when interpreting climate-related trends from earlier lower resolution observations. Substantial differences in the dynamic characteristics of snow cover in early autumn were also present between the remote sensing and snow model datasets, which need to be investigated separately. This work demonstrates that the consistency of earlier low spatial resolution snow cover datasets can be improved by using current-day higher resolution datasets.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer with <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-Tilmanocept: A Multicenter Study on Real-Life Use of a Novel Tracer
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tc-99m-tilmanocept is a novel radiopharmaceutical for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in breast cancer. Our aim was to describe results with Tc-99m-tilmanocept in a heterogeneous group of breast cancer patients scheduled for SLN biopsy. Methods: Radiotracer preparation followed the manufacturer's indications. Local protocols for SLN detection within 9 participant centers were not changed for the entire duration of the study. In total, 344 patients with T1-T4, N0-N2 breast cancer (352 lesions) were included. Superficial (ntradermal or periareolar) or deep (peritumoral or intratumoral) injections were performed. The doses were adjusted depending on the scheduled time for surgery. Results: Lymphoscintigraphy was able to depict at least 1 SLN in 339 of 352 breast lesions (96.3%), and the intraoperative SLN detection rate reached 97.2%. On univariable analysis, SLN detection rates did not differ by age, clinical T or N stage, tumor location, histologic subtype, or prior neoadjuvant therapy. Lymphoscintigraphy showed higher SLN detection in patients with a normal weight (body mass index < 25) than in those who were overweight or obese (body mass index >= 25), at 99.2% versus 94.6%, respectively (P = 0.031). The proportion of patients with preoperative lymphoscintigraphic detection or excised SLNs was higher with superficial than deep injections. Reinjected cases were significantly lower when superficial injection was chosen first (P < 0.001). Injection site and the tumor markers human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and estrogen receptor had an impact on preoperative SLN visualization and intraoperative localization. In 80 cases, SLN biopsy resulted in a positive lymph node. During a mean follow-up of 19 mo, no axillary recurrences were observed. Conclusion: Whatever the protocol, Tc-99m-tilmanocept showed good results in a heterogeneous breast cancer population, although the best results were achieved when a superficial injection was chosen.

TI  - Representative Learning via Span-Based Mutual Information for PolSAR Image Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The optimal parameters of polarimetric scattering decomposition are critical to classify the pixels in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images by utilizing the method of machine learning. Therefore, span-based mutual information (Sp-MI) is proposed to lighten the dependence on labeling information, and then a heuristic representative learning scheme is also given by artificial neural network (ANN) to classify parameters separately with the increasing sequence according to the values of Sp-MI. Furthermore, an innovative method of using the sine function is presented to map the parameters of angular, and a min-max scaling method is applied to complete the procedure of normalization. Except for the support vector machine, three ANN-based classifiers are implemented to verify the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed representative learning and normalization scheme. Meanwhile, the classification method is compared with four similar comparison methods on three real PolSAR images. Finally, the classification results show the effectiveness of the proposed Sp-MI and the validation of the representative learning scheme in the aspect of classification overall accuracy and visual effect.

TI  - Establishment of a model for predicting sentinel lymph node metastasis in early breast cancer based on contrast-enhanced ultrasound and clinicopathological features
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SI,NB) is the standard procedure for axillary staging in clinically node-negative (cN0) breast cancer patients. However, the positive rate of SLNs among cN0 stage patients is 26-35%. The identification of appropriate candidates for SLNB is quite challenging. This study aimed to establish and verify a predictive model of SLN metastasis using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and other clinicopathological indicators.Methods: The clinicopathological data of 224 patients who had undergone SLNB at the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University from June 2018 to July 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. The risk prediction model of SLN metastasis was established by logistic regression analysis. According to the beta value of each variable in the model, a risk score system of SLN metastasis was established and verified using the internal population. The predictive model was prospectively applied to 73 patients from July 2019 to September 2019 to evaluate the clinical value of the model in patients with early breast cancer.Results: Multivariate analysis confirmed that body mass index (BMI), SLN aspect ratio of CEUS mode, SLN aspect ratio of mammography, lympho-vascular invasion, and cytokeratin (CK)5/6 were independent risk factors for SLN metastasis. A scoring system was established according to the above risk factors, and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn. After internal- and external verification, a corrected ROC curve was drawn, respectively. The ROC curve of the modeling group, internal verification group, and external verification group was 0.9075 (95% CI: 0.8616-0.9534), 0.8766 (95% CI: 0.8192-0.9341), and 0.8505 (95% CI: 0.7333-0.9676), respectively.Conclusions. We constructed and verified a prediction model of SLN metastasis in early breast cancer. The model has a specific predictive value for preoperative evaluation of SLN status.Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SI,NB) is the standard procedure for axillary staging in clinically node-negative (cN0) breast cancer patients.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe our effort to produce the first-ever near-real-time (NRT) global daily chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) anomaly products that can be used to detect and identify algae blooms from satellite ocean color measurements such as those from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) and NOAA-20. Specifically, the production of the two Chl-a anomaly products, one for the Chl-a anomaly in difference and another for the Chl-a anomaly ratio (or in its relative difference) compared to the 61-day Chl-a median value from the previous time period (as a Chl-a reference), has been implemented in the daily global NRT satellite data processing. These two Chl-a anomaly products represent the global ocean and coastal/inland water Chl-a abnormal condition for a given location and can provide more complete characteristics for the daily phytoplankton (or algae) biomass status by comparing to the normal condition. Detailed satellite Chl-a anomaly algorithms, the implementation of the algorithms in the routine satellite data processing, and the global data processing procedure are described and discussed. In addition, we provide several specific examples from the VIIRS-measured global daily Chl-a anomaly products to demonstrate various applications in the detection of algae blooms, including the harmful algal blooms (HABs), in various ocean and coastal/inland waters. Some quantitative seasonal and interannual evaluations and characterizations of Chl-a anomalies over global oceans and several coastal/inland waters are also provided and discussed.

TI  - Analysis of the Response of Long-Term Vegetation Dynamics to Climate Variability Using the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) Method and Disturbance Lag Model (DLM) Based on Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study in Guangdong Province (China)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic change and spatial-temporal distribution of vegetation coverage are of great significance for regional ecological evolution, especially in the subtropics and tropics. Identifying the heterogeneity in vegetation activities and its response to climate factors is crucial for projecting ecosystem dynamics. We used long-term (2001-2018) satellite-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI) datasets and climatic factors to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation activities in an experimental area in Guangdong Province (China), as well as their links to changes in temperature (TEM), relative humidity (HUM), precipitation (PRE), sunshine duration (SUN), and surface runoff. The pruned exact linear time change point detection method (PELT) and the disturbance lag model (DLM) were used to understand the detailed ecological coverage status and time lag relationships between the EVI and climatic factors. The results indicate the following. (1) At the whole regional scale, a significant overall upward trend in the EVI variation was observed in 2001-2018. More specifically, there were two distinct periods with different trends, which were split by a turning point in 2005. PRE was the main climate-related driver of the rising EVI pre-2005, and the increase in TEM was the main climate factor influencing the forest EVI variation post-2006. (2) A three-month time lag effect was observed in the EVI response to relative humidity. The same phenomenon was found in the sunshine duration factor. (3) The EVI of farmlands (one type of land use) exhibited the largest lags between relative humidity and the sunshine duration factor, followed by grasslands and forests. (4) The comprehensive index of surface runoff could explain the time lags of vegetation activities, and the surface runoff value showed an apparently negative relationship with the vegetation coverage change.

TI  - A Sentinel-2 Image-Based Irrigation Advisory Service: Cases for Tea Plantations
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we aim to develop an inexpensive site-specific irrigation advisory service for resolving disadvantages related to using immobile soil moisture sensors and to the differences in irrigation needs of different tea plantations affected by variabilities in cultivars, plant ages, soil heterogeneity, and management practices. In the paper, we present methodologies to retrieve two biophysical variables, surface soil water content and canopy water content of tea trees from Sentinel-2 (S2) (European Space Agency, Paris, France) images and consider their association with crop water availability status to be used for making decisions to send an alert level. Precipitation records are used as auxiliary information to assist in determining or modifying the alert level. Once the site-specific alert level for each target plantation is determined, it is sent to the corresponding farmer through text messaging. All the processes that make up the service, from downloading an S2 image from the web to alert level text messaging, are automated and can be completed before 7:30 a.m. the next day after an S2 image was taken. Therefore, the service is operated cyclically, and corresponds to the five-day revisit period of S2, but one day behind the S2 image acquisition date. However, it should be noted that the amount of irrigation water required for each site-specific plantation has not yet been estimated because of the complexities involved. Instead, a single irrigation rate (300 t ha(-1)) per irrigation event is recommended. The service is now available to over 20 tea plantations in the Mingjian Township, the largest tea producing region in Taiwan, free of charge since September 2020. This operational application is expected to save expenditures on buying irrigation water and induce deeper root systems by decreasing the frequency of insufficient irrigation commonly employed by local farmers.

TI  - Greenspace, Air Pollution, Neighborhood Factors, and Preeclampsia in a Population-Based Case-Control Study in California
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - To investigate preeclampsia etiologies, we examined relationships between greenspace, air pollution, and neighborhood factors. Data were from hospital records and geocoded residences of 77,406 women in San Joaquin Valley, California from 2000 to 2006. Preeclampsia was divided into mild, severe, or superimposed onto pre-existing hypertension. Greenspace within 100 and 500 m residential buffers was estimated from satellite data using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Air quality data were averaged over pregnancy from daily 24-h averages of nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter <10 mu m (PM10) and <2.5 mu m (PM2.5), and carbon monoxide. Neighborhood socioeconomic (SES) factors included living below the federal poverty level and median annual income using 2000 US Census data. Odds of preeclampsia were estimated using logistic regression. Effect modification was assessed using Wald tests. More greenspace (500 m) was inversely associated with superimposed preeclampsia (OR = 0.57). High PM2.5 and low SES were associated with mild and severe preeclampsia. We observed differences in associations between greenspace (500 m) and superimposed preeclampsia by neighborhood income and between greenspace (500 m) and severe preeclampsia by PM10, overall and among those living in higher SES neighborhoods. Less greenspace, high particulate matter, and high-poverty/low-income neighborhoods were associated with preeclampsia, and effect modification was observed between these exposures. Further research into exposure combinations and preeclampsia is warranted.

TI  - LOESS radiometric correction for contiguous scenes (LORACCS): Improving the consistency of radiometry in high-resolution satellite image mosaics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyses of Planet Dove (CubeSat) satellite imagery can prove challenging when radiometric consistency among contiguous scenes is necessary to apply algorithms across mosaics or through time. While temporal resolution is excellent due to the high number of Dove satellites, the radiometric consistency between scenes can be a limiting factor in the utility of the imagery when creating mosaics. To date, methods of addressing the radiometric consistency problem have focused on radiometric correction in a time-series stack, but do not address how to achieve seamless mosaics within that stack. We demonstrate a method to correct Planet Dove radiometric inconsistencies in mosaics using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS). LOESS is a non-parametric regression technique that is more flexible to fitting a line to data than ordinary least squares regression (OLS), and better conforms to the nonlinearities in spectral responses among Dove sensors across brightness levels. A straightforward application of LOESS uses overlap areas between contiguous scenes, enabling correction independent of outside data sources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method to improve the quality of mosaics by reducing spectral discontinuities between overlapping images in multiple locations across multiple biome and landcover types. Further, the LOESS Radiometric Correction for Contiguous Scenes, or LORACCS, is able to be integrated with methods previously developed to normalize Dove imagery with sensors such as Landsat or Sentinel-2, typically for use in time series analysis. Written in Python, this method offers an open source solution to a significant challenge when working with Dove data.

TI  - Astrape: A System for Mapping Severe Abiotic Forest Disturbances Using High Spatial Resolution Satellite Imagery and Unsupervised Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe forest disturbance events are becoming more common due to climate change and many forest managers rely heavily upon airborne surveys to map damage. However, when the damage is extensive, airborne assets are in high demand and it can take managers several weeks to account for the damage, delaying important management actions. While some satellite-based systems exist to help with this process, their spatial resolution or latency can be too large for the needs of managers, as evidenced by the continued use of airborne imaging. Here, we present a new, operational-focused system capable of leveraging high spatial and temporal resolution Sentinel-2 and Planet Dove imagery to support the mapping process. This system, which we have named Astrape ("ah-STRAH-pee"), uses recently developed techniques in image segmentation and machine learning to produce maps of damage in different forest types and regions without requiring ground data, greatly reducing the need for potentially dangerous airborne surveys and ground sampling needed to accurately quantify severe damage. Although some limited field work is required to verify results, similar to current operational systems, Astrape-produced maps achieved 78-86% accuracy with respect to damage severity when evaluated against reference data. We present the Astrape framework and demonstrate its flexibility and potential with four case studies depicting four different disturbance types-fire, hurricane, derecho and tornado-in three disparate regions of the United States. Astrape is capable of leveraging various sources of satellite imagery and offers an efficient, flexible and economical option for mapping severe damage in forests.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Changes and Driving Force Analysis of Green Space in Coastal Cities of Southeast China over the Past 20 Years
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to reveal the spatial-temporal change and driving factors of green space in coastal cities of southeast China over the past 20 years. A supervised classification method combining support vector machines (SVMs) and visual interpretation was used to extract the green space from Landsat TM/OLI imageries from 2000-2020. The landscape pattern index was used to calculate geospatial information of green space and analyze their spatial-temporal changes. The hierarchical partitioning analysis was then used to determine the influences of anthropogenic and geographic environmental factors on the spatial-temporal changes in green space. The results indicated that the total area of green space remained constant over the past 20 years in coastal cities of southeast China (1% reduction). The spatial change of green space mainly occurred in the area near the ocean and the southern region. 41.37% of forest land was transferred from cultivated land, while 44.56%, 41.83%, 43.20%, 46.31%, 41.98% and 40.20% of shrub land, sparse woodland, other woodland, high-coverage grassland, moderate-coverage grassland and low-coverage grassland were transferred from forest land. The number of patches, patch density, edge density, landscape shape index and Shannon's diversity index increased from 2000-2015, and then decreased to the minimum in 2020, while largest patch index continued to decline from 2000-2020. The contribution of anthropogenic factors (0.53-0.61) on the spatial-temporal changes of green space continually increased over the past 20 years, which was also higher than geographical environment factors (0.39-0.41). Our study provides a new perspective to distinguish the impact of anthropogenic activities and geographical environmental factors on the change of green space area, thereby providing a theoretical support for the construction and ecological management of green space.

TI  - Epidemiology of soil-transmitted helminths following sustained implementation of routine preventive chemotherapy: Demographics and baseline results of a cluster randomised trial in southern Malawi
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Malawi has successfully leveraged multiple delivery platforms to scale-up and sustain the implementation of preventive chemotherapy (PCT) for the control of morbidity caused by soil-transmitted helminths (STH). Sentinel monitoring demonstrates this strategy has been successful in reducing STH infection in school-age children, although our understanding of the contemporary epidemiological profile of STH across the broader community remains limited. As part of a multi-site trial evaluating the feasibility of interrupting STH transmission across three countries, this study aimed to describe the baseline demographics and the prevalence, intensity and associated risk factors of STH infection in Mangochi district, southern Malawi. Between October-December 2017, a community census was conducted across the catchment area of seven primary healthcare facilities, enumerating 131,074 individuals across 124 villages. A cross-sectional parasitological survey was then conducted between March-May 2018 in the censused area as a baseline for a cluster randomised trial. An age-stratified random sample of 6,102 individuals were assessed for helminthiasis by Kato-Katz and completed a detailed risk-factor questionnaire. The age-cluster weighted prevalence of any STH infection was 7.8% (95% C.I. 7.0%-8.6%) comprised predominantly of hookworm species and of entirely low-intensity infections. The presence and intensity of infection was significantly higher in men and in adults. Infection was negatively associated with risk factors that included increasing levels of relative household wealth, higher education levels of any adult household member, current school attendance, or recent deworming. In this setting of relatively high coverage of sanitation facilities, there was no association between hookworm and reported access to sanitation, handwashing facilities, or water facilities. These results describe a setting that has reduced the prevalence of STH to a very low level and confirms many previously recognised risk-factors for infection. Expanding the delivery of anthelmintics to groups where STH infection persist could enable Malawi to move past the objective of elimination of morbidity, and towards the elimination of STH. Trial registration: NCT03014167.Author summary The major public health strategy to control soil-transmitted helminths (STH) is preventive chemotherapy, whereby those at greatest risk of morbidity-including children and women of childbearing age-are presumptively treated with a safe, effective and inexpensive anthelminthic drug. In Malawi, this has been successfully sustained for nearly a decade through annual school-based deworming, in addition to integration within child health campaigns and antenatal care. Routine surveillance of schoolchildren demonstrates that STH has been reduced to very low levels in this age group, but few community-based epidemiological surveys have been conducted to investigate STH in the broader population. In this study, we observed that while infection with STH has been reduced to low levels overall, it is much higher in adults and particularly in males, with the odds of being infected greater in those from less wealthy households or from households with lower levels of adult education. These results underline that while preventive chemotherapy has likely been key to reductions in STH; sub-populations not routinely targeted by preventive chemotherapy, and the most disadvantaged members of society, continue to be disproportionately affected. We propose that evaluation of more comprehensive control strategies-such as entire-community deworming-could overcome these limitations, and present a route to STH elimination.

TI  - From State Repression to Fear of non-state Actors: Examining Emerging Threats of Journalism Practice in Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNALISM PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-state media journalists in Ethiopia traditionally faced safety threats emanating from state-sponsored attacks and punitive legal frameworks. Recently, however, state hostility is being replaced by non-state actors' aggression against journalists. By framing emerging threats of reporters' safety in Ethiopia within normative vis-a-vis alternative debates of journalism practice in the context of transitional, unstable, pluralistic-partizan societies, this study examines the prevalence of non-state actors in remapping threats of journalistic impunity in Ethiopia. Key findings from interviews conducted with editors, reporters, and other practitioners indicate, while the government cannot be ruled out as a safety threat for journalists, there is an emerging consensus that identifies non-state actors such as vigilante groups, influential social media political personalities, and weaponized media as the most perceptible safety risks to journalism practice. Although threat levels vary depending on journalists' regional affiliation or perceived ethnic identity/political worldview, domestic journalists face increased native othering that amounts to mobility restrictions and physical aggression compared to foreign correspondents.

TI  - Early Growing Season Anomalies in Vegetation Activity Determine the Large-Scale Climate-Vegetation Coupling in Europe
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate-vegetation coupling exerts a strong control on terrestrial carbon budgets and will affect the future evolution of global climate under continued anthropogenic forcing. Nonetheless, the effects of climatic conditions on such coupling at specific times in the growing season remain poorly understood. We quantify the climate-vegetation coupling in Europe over 1982-2014 at multiple spatial and temporal scales, by decomposing sub-seasonal anomalies of vegetation greenness using a grid-wise definition of the growing season. We base our analysis on long-term vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index), growing conditions (including 2m temperature, downwards surface solar radiation, and root-zone soil moisture), and multiple teleconnection indices that reflect the large-scale climatic conditions over Europe. We find that the large-scale climate-vegetation coupling during the first two months of the growing season largely determines the full-year coupling. The North Atlantic Oscillation and Scandinavian Pattern phases one-to-two months before the start of the growing season are the dominant and contrasting drivers of the early growing season climate-vegetation coupling over large parts of boreal and temperate Europe. The East Atlantic Pattern several months in advance of the growing season exerts a strong control on the temperate belt and the Mediterranean region. The strong role of early growing season anomalies in vegetative activity within the growing season emphasizes the importance of a grid-wise definition of the growing season when studying the large-scale climate-vegetation coupling in Europe.Plain Language Summary Climate and terrestrial ecosystems interact and affect the global climate. Such a climate-vegetation relationship can be effectively quantified by using satellites to measure how leafy and active the vegetation is, and numerical indices reflecting large-scale climate patterns over a given region. Previous studies generally focused on changes in mean vegetation indices over the full growing season, which is usually defined by a fixed range of astronomical months for large geographical regions. This overlooks the fact that growing seasons differ in space and vegetation responds differently to the climate in different growing season periods. In this study, we explore how vegetation and climate interact within a growing season, here defined specifically for the local conditions. We find that there are strong relationships between the large-scale climate patterns and vegetation indices during the first two months of the growing season. Our findings highlight the important role of the vegetation activity during the early growing season for the year-to-year vegetation changes in Europe. Hence, for a better understanding of the climate-vegetation relationships, it is necessary to consider the spatial differences in the growing season, in particular for large geographical regions.

TI  - Experimental study and numerical simulation analysis of the fire resistance of high-strength steel columns with rectangular sections under axial compression
T2  - FIRE SAFETY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the performance of Q550 (yield strength fy = 550 MPa) high-strength steel, mechanical property tests at room temperature and elevated temperatures were first carried out. Second, fire tests were carried out on 8 unconstrained Q550 high-strength steel columns with rectangular sections under axial compression. The mechanical properties and failure modes of high-strength steel columns under fire exposure were revealed. Finally, ABAQUS finite element software was used to establish a refined finite element model of high-strength steel columns, and numerical simulation analysis was carried out to analyse the influence of various parameters on the fire resistance. The results show that (1) the critical temperature and the maximum axial displacement of the steel columns decrease with increasing load ratio n. (2) the smaller the slenderness ratio ? is, the smaller the maximum axial displacement, while the critical temperature changes slightly. (3) there are two failure modes of the specimens: overall buckling and overall and local coupling buckling. (4) the thermal mechanical coupling analysis method can effectively simulate the behaviour of high-strength steel columns under fire exposure. The research in this paper establishes a theoretical foundation for the improvement of the fire resistance design method of high-strength steel columns.

TI  - Temperature and Humidity Influence in Field Spectroradiometer Measurement
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Field spectroradiometer is becoming more and more important in the remote sensing area. It is used to investigate the spectral radiometric characteristics of different geographic environment, such as spectral radiance, spectral irradiance or spectral directional reflectance factor from visible to infrared wavelengths. The accuracy of the spectral measurements plays an important role in space sensor calibration and remote sensing data inversion. It is the basis of quantitative analysis in optical remote sensing. Field spectroradiometer must be calibrated before use. On the one hand, the spectral responsivity may change during the calibration process. On the other hand, the field measurement environment may be totally different from the calibration conditions. The measurement accuracy cannot be guaranteed. The experiment is designed to investigate the influence of the environmental conditions on spectral responsivity. At constant temperature and humidity, spectral line lamp, and integrating sphere lamp are used to test whether the wavelength and spectral responsivity change or not when the silicon array detector' s temperature is changed. Results show that the wavelength is nearly unchanged when the silicon array detector's temperature rises. However, the spectral responsivity rises as the temperature rises. When the silicon array detector's temperature rises from 28. 3 to 35. 2 degrees C, the spectral responsivity increases by 1. 8% to 7. 3% from 380 to 990 nm, 3. 0% from 1 000 to 1 800 nm and 1. 9% from 2 000 to 2 500 nm. When the environment humidity and temperature are changed, results show that humidity only affects the spectral responsivity near the water molecules' absorption peaks. Also, results show that the spectral responsivity has nearly one to one correspondence with detector temperature. The influence of environment temperature can be nearly characterized according to the detector temperature change. When a group of detector temperature and corresponding spectral responsivity is measured, the relationship between the detector temperature and spectral responsivity can be obtained using the least square method. The spectral responsivity at other temperature can be calculated by interpolation. The measurement data at different environmental conditions can be corrected as long as the detector temperature is measured. The spectral responsivity difference between the calculated and measured results is less than 0. 2% when the detector is 35 which show that the relationship between the detector temperature and spectral responsivity can be used to solve the environment problem.

TI  - Implications of GNSS-Inferred Tropopause Altitude Associated with Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal structure of the environmental atmosphere associated with Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs) is investigated with the combined observations from several detectors (FERMI, RHESSI, and Insight-HXMT) and GNSS-RO (SAC-C, COSMIC, GRACE, TerraSAR-X, and MetOp-A). The geographic distributions of TGF-related tropopause altitude and climatology are similar. The regional TGF-related tropopause altitude in Africa and the Caribbean Sea is 0.1-0.4 km lower than the climatology, whereas that in Asia is 0.1-0.2 km higher. Most of the TGF-related tropopause altitudes are slightly higher than the climatology, while some of them have a slightly negative bias. The subtropical TGF-producing thunderstorms are warmer in the troposphere and have a colder and higher tropopause over land than the ocean. There is no significant land-ocean difference in the thermal structure for the tropical TGF-producing thunderstorms. The TGF-producing thunderstorms have a cold anomaly in the middle and upper troposphere and have stronger anomalies than the deep convection found in previous studies.

TI  - Analysis of Regional Distribution of Tree Species Using Multi-Seasonal Sentinel-1&2 Imagery within Google Earth Engine
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on tree species is in high demand for forestry management and further investigations on biodiversity and environmental monitoring. Over regional or large areas, distinguishing tree species at high resolutions faces the challenges of a lack of representative features and computational power. A novel methodology was proposed to delineate the explicit spatial distribution of six dominant tree species (Pinus tabulaeformis, Quercus mongolia, Betula spp., Populus spp., Larix spp., and Armeniaca sibirica) and one residual class at 10 m resolution. Their spatial patterns were analyzed over an area covering over 90,000 km(2) using the analysis-ready large volume of multisensor imagery within the Google Earth engine (GEE) platform afterwards. Random forest algorithm built into GEE was used together with the 20th and 80th percentiles of multitemporal features extracted from Sentinel-1/2, and topographic features. The composition of tree species in natural forests and plantations at the city and county-level were performed in detail afterwards. The classification achieved a reliable accuracy (77.5% overall accuracy, 0.71 kappa), and the spatial distribution revealed that plantations (Pinus tabulaeformis, Populus spp., Larix spp., and Armeniaca sibirica) outnumber natural forests (Quercus mongolia and Betula spp.) by 6% and were mainly concentrated in the northern and southern regions. Arhorchin had the largest forest area of over 4500 km(2), while Hexingten and Aohan ranked first in natural forest and plantation area. Additionally, the class proportion of the number of tree species in Karqin and Ningcheng was more balanced. We suggest focusing more on the suitable areas modeling for tree species using species' distribution models and environmental factors based on the classification results rather than field survey plots in further studies.

TI  - Spatial Scaling of Gross Primary Productivity Over Sixteen Mountainous Watersheds Using Vegetation Heterogeneity and Surface Topography
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface models intended for large-scale applications are often executed at coarse resolutions, and the sub-grid heterogeneity is usually ignored. Here, a spatial scaling algorithm that integrates the information of vegetation heterogeneity (land cover type and leaf area index) and surface topography (elevation, slope, relative azimuth (Raz) between the sun and the slope background, sky-view factor, and topographic wetness index), was proposed to correct errors in gross primary productivity (GPP) estimates at a coarse spatial resolution. An eco-hydrological model named BEPS-TerrainLab was used to simulate GPP at 30 and 480 m resolutions for 16 mountainous watersheds selected globally. Results showed that an obvious improvement on GPP estimates at 480 m resolution was achieved after the correction in comparison with GPP modeled at 30 m resolution, with the determination coefficient increased by 0.38 and mean bias error reduced by 203gCm(-2) yr(-1). The combination of all the seven factors made the largest improvement for GPP estimation at 480 m resolution, suggesting that a larger improvement would be achieved when more factors of surface heterogeneity are considered. More specifically, our results indicated that five factors, including land cover type and leaf area index regarded as integrated outcomes of all the environmental conditions, Raz and sky-view factor associated with radiation redistribution, and slope related to soil water redistribution, were especially important in the spatial scaling procedure. This study suggests that incorporating the information of surface heterogeneity into the spatial scaling algorithm is useful for improving coarse resolution GPP estimates over mountainous areas.

TI  - Six-Dimensional Force/Torque Sensor Based on Fiber Bragg Gratings With Low Coupling
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we present a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based 6-D force/torque (F/T) sensor that can be mounted on robot joints for the detection of comprehensive F/T information. The sensor is designed based on a new concept of multilayer measurement in which the elastic structure is divided into four layers. A single optical fiber inscribed with 12 FBGs is symmetrically attached to the elastic structure to sense F/T-induced strains by means of differential measurements. Because of the mechanical decoupling function of the structure and the reasonable arrangement of the FBG sensing elements, the designed sensor possesses a great advantage of low cross coupling compared with the existing 6-D F/T sensors, which simplifies the calibration and maintenance of the sensor. Calibration experiments demonstrate high resolutions of 7.8 N center dot mm, 7.2 N center dot mm, 15.8 N center dot mm, 0.0067 N, 0.0066 N, and 0.0825 N within the range of +/- 1.56 N center dot m, +/- 1.56 N center dot m, +/- 1.56 N center dot m, +/- 10 N, +/- 10 N, and +/- 25 N for the detection of M-x, M-y, M-z, F-x, F-y, and F-z, respectively. Dynamic performances of the designed sensor have been evaluated in comparison with a commercial F/T sensor.

TI  - Fusing Precipitable Water Vapor Data in CHINA at Different Timescales Using an Artificial Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate change has noticeable influences on the water vapor redistribution in China, which is embodied by the fact that both wetting and drying tendencies were observed across China. This poses the necessity to monitor and understand the water vapor evolution in China. However, observations of water vapor from different techniques are subjected to systematic biases, different spatiotemporal resolutions and coverages, and different accuracy, which would hamper their joint use, potentially leading to contradictory conclusions when using different techniques. Data fusion is a promising way to address this problem. Some scholars have proposed several methods to fuse multi-source PWV data in China region, such as the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model, the hybrid PWV fusion model, and the linear calibration model. Although these models can produce PWV products with improved accuracy, they still have some shortcomings, such as no consideration for spatial or temporal variations in bias or inevitably impose some biases inaccurate information since assumptions made for interpolations are imperfect. In this study, we use the high-quality Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) precipitable water vapor (PWV) to calibrate and optimize the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ReAnalyses 5 (ERA5) PWV in 2018-2019 through a Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) at annual, quarterly, and monthly timescales. Validation results demonstrate that modifying the MODIS and ERA5 PWV at the monthly timescale results in the best accuracy. In the monthly experiment, the average bias, standard deviation (STD), and root mean square (RMS) error of modified MODIS PWV are 0.0 mm, 2.6 mm, and 2.6 mm, respectively. The percentage improvement is as high as 50% in terms of RMS compared to the original MODIS PWV. It becomes 0.0 mm, 1.7 mm, and 1.7 mm for the modified ERA5 PWV and the percentage improvement is 40%. Since the biases among different products are well-calibrated and the accuracy of MODIS and ERA5 PWV is improved to the same level of GNSS PWV, we can fuse them by simply merging them. Finally, we generate a new product of PWV in China with a temporal resolution of 1 day, a spatial resolution better than 31 km, and an accuracy better than 2.7 mm, which will serve as a high-quality product for investigating the water vapor redistribution under a changing climate.

TI  - Robust Joint Representation of Intrinsic Mean and Kernel Function of Lie Group for Remote Sensing Scene Classification
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing scene classification is used to label specific semantic categories for images. The current methods have achieved competitive performances, but they are only for Euclidean space samples. As a result, their representations are not robust for non-Euclidean space samples, which affects the classification accuracy. In this letter, we introduce the Lie group manifold into the traditional feature representation method and propose a novel intrinsic mean representation method within the Lie group. At the same time, the kernel function based on the sample of the Lie group is designed to further improve the robustness and accuracy of classification. In addition, our method achieves satisfactory performance on two public and challenging remote sensing data sets of UC Merced and NWPU-RESISC45.

TI  - LiDAR Applications to Estimate Forest Biomass at Individual Tree Scale: Opportunities, Challenges and Future Perspectives
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Accurate forest biomass estimation at the individual tree scale is the foundation of timber industry and forest management. It plays an important role in explaining ecological issues and small-scale processes. Remotely sensed images, across a range of spatial and temporal resolutions, with their advantages of non-destructive monitoring, are widely applied in forest biomass monitoring at global, ecoregion or community scales. However, the development of remote sensing applications for forest biomass at the individual tree scale has been relatively slow due to the constraints of spatial resolution and evaluation accuracy of remotely sensed data. With the improvements in platforms and spatial resolutions, as well as the development of remote sensing techniques, the potential for forest biomass estimation at the single tree level has been demonstrated. However, a comprehensive review of remote sensing of forest biomass scaled at individual trees has not been done. This review highlights the theoretical bases, challenges and future perspectives for Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) applications of individual trees scaled to whole forests. We summarize research on estimating individual tree volume and aboveground biomass (AGB) using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS), Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Laser Scanning (UAV-LS) and Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS, including Vehicle-borne Laser Scanning (VLS) and Backpack Laser Scanning (BLS)) data.

TI  - Air Pollution Control: An Analysis of China's Industrial Off-Peak Production Policy through the Quasi-Natural Experiment Method
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - To reduce frequent heavy air pollution, the Chinese government suspends clinker production during the heating season in most areas of the North, which is known as the Clinker Off-peak Production Policy. The questions regarding such a repressive production policy for environmental purposes are whether this policy is effective in reducing pollutants and whether the marginal cost is high. To explore these policy effects, a quasi-experiment is designed, taking advantage of spatial-temporal variations in policy implementation. With the triple-difference method and environmental satellite data, the effect on air pollution is estimated to be -1900 mu g/m(2) (similar to 2%) of SO2 and -3200 mu g/m(2) (similar to 10%) of NO2. With daily price information and the difference-in-differences method, the market effect is estimated to be an approximately 10% increase in annual sale prices. The marginal cost estimated through a back-of-the-envelope analysis is 32 k RMB yuan/ton SO2 or NO2, which is 24.88 times the pollutant discharge fee but which better reflects the pollutant shadow price.

TI  - Sparse SAR Imaging and Quantitative Evaluation Based on Nonconvex and TV Regularization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sparse signal processing has been used in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging due to the maturity of compressed sensing theory. As a typical sparse reconstruction method, L-1 regularization generally causes bias effects as well as ignoring region-based features. Our team has proposed to linearly combine the nonconvex penalty and the total variation (TV)-norm penalty as a compound regularizer in the imaging model, called nonconvex and TV regularization, which can not only reduce the bias caused by L-1 regularization but also enhance point-based and region-based features. In this paper, we use the variable splitting scheme and modify the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), generating a novel algorithm to solve the above optimization problem. Moreover, we analyze the radiometric properties of sparse-signal-processing-based SAR imaging results and introduce three indexes suitable for sparse SAR imaging for quantitative evaluation. In experiments, we process the Gaofen-3 (GF-3) data utilizing the proposed method, and quantitatively evaluate the reconstructed SAR image quality. Experimental results and image quality analysis verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the reconstruction accuracy and the radiometric resolution without sacrificing the spatial resolution.

TI  - Novel Weight-Based Approach for Soil Moisture Content Estimation via Synthetic Aperture Radar, Multispectral and Thermal Infrared Data Fusion
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Though current remote sensing technologies, especially synthetic aperture radars (SARs), exhibit huge potential for soil moisture content (SMC) retrievals, such technologies also present several performance disadvantages. This study explored the merits of proposing a novel data fusion methodology (partly decision level and partly feature level) for SMC estimation. Initially, individual estimations were derived from three distinct methods: the inversion of an Empirically Adapted Integral Equation Model (EA-IEM) applied to SAR data, the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI), and the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) determined from Landsat-8 data. Subsequently, three feature level fusions were performed to produce three different novel salient feature combinations where said features were extracted from each of the previously mentioned methods to be the input of an artificial neural network (ANN). The latter underwent a modification of its performance function, more specifically from absolute error to root mean square error (RMSE). Eventually, all SMC estimations, including the feature level fusion estimation, were fused at the decision level through a novel weight-based estimation. The performance of the proposed system was analysed and validated by measurements collected from three study areas, an agricultural field in Blackwell farms, Guildford, United Kingdom, and two different agricultural fields in Sidi Rached, Tipasa, Algeria. Those measurements contained SMC levels and surface roughness profiles. The proposed SMC estimation system yielded stronger correlations and lower RMSE values than any of the considered SMC estimation methods in the order of 0.38%, 1.4%, and 1.09% for the Blackwell farms, Sidi Rached 1, and Sidi Rached 2 datasets, respectively.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrievals Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-1 Data over Nagqu Region of Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an approach for retrieval of soil moisture in Nagqu region of Tibetan Plateau using VV-polarized Sentinel-1 SAR and MODIS optical data, by coupling the semi-empirical Oh-2004 model and the Water Cloud Model (WCM). The Oh model is first used to estimate the surface roughness parameter based on the hypothesis that the roughness is invariant among SAR acquisitions. Afterward, the vegetation water content (VWC) in the WCM is calculated from the daily MODIS NDVI data obtained by temporal interpolation. To improve the performance of the model, the parameters A, B, and alpha of the WCM are analyzed and optimized using randomly selected half of the sampled dataset. Then, the soil moisture is retrieved by minimizing a cost function between the simulated and measured backscattering coefficients. The comparison of the retrieved soil moisture with the ground measurements shows the determination coefficient R-2 and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are 0.46 and 0.08 m(3)/m(3), respectively. These results demonstrate the capability and reliability of Sentinel-1 SAR data for estimating the soil moisture over the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Near-infrared laparoscopy with indocyanine green for axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy in early breast cancer: preliminary experience of a single unit
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a routine procedure for axillary staging in cN0 breast cancer (BC) patients. Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence can detect sentinel lymph nodes with higher sensitivity than carbon nanoparticle suspension (CNS). The present study investigated the availability and benefits of a near-infrared (NIR) laparoscopy-assisted SLNB using ICG and carbon nanoparticle suspension as tracers.Method: Forty patients with invasive BC, who had clinically negative axillary lymph nodes, participated in this observational study. ICG and CNS tracers were injected into the periareolar region simultaneously or sequentially. In the endoscopy-assisted group (n=20), the patients were given NIR laparoscopic SLNB based on ICG fluorescence and CNS staining. In the open-surgery group, the patients were given traditional SLNB using an open incision, and CNS tracers were injected into the same region as that in the endoscopy-assisted group.Results: In the endoscopy-assisted group, lymphatic vessels and sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were successfully identified using ICG fluorescence imaging in most patients (19/20). The average number of SLNs removed was 2.85 (range, 1-4) in the endoscopy-assisted group, and 3.40 (range, 1-7) in the open-surgery group. There was no significant difference between the number of detected nodes (P=0.30). The patients who underwent endoscopy-assisted SLNBs had similar operating times, blood loss and hospital-stay lengths, but lower postoperative drainage volumes and higher satisfaction scores, as they did not have axillary incisions.Conclusion: The NIR laparoscopy-assisted ICG-guided technique is a feasible and surgeon-friendly method for SLNB with good efficacy and acceptable safety. When combined with CNS, more SLNs can be detected and dissected.

TI  - A High-Resolution Flood Inundation Archive (2016-the Present) from Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery over CONUS
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Most existing inundation inventories are based on surveys, news, or passive remote sensing imagery. Affected by spatiotemporal resolution or weather conditions, these inventories are limited in spatial details or coverage. Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have recently enabled flood mapping at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. However, the bottleneck in producing SAR-based flood maps is the requirement of expert manual processing to maintain acceptable accuracy by most SAR-driven mapping techniques. To fill the vacancy, we generate a high-resolution (10 m) flood inundation dataset over the contiguous United States (CONUS) from nearly the entire Sentinel-1 SAR archive (from January 2016 to the present), using a recently developed automated Radar Produced Inundation Diary (RAPID) system. RAPID uses U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) water watch system and accumulated precipitation to identify SAR images that potentially overlap a flood event. The dataset include inundation events with the temporal scale from several days to months. Concluded from all 559 overlapping images in the period from 2016 to the first half of 2019, the comparison of the proposed dataset against the USGS Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE) product yields an overall, user, producer agreements, and critical success index of 99.06%, 87.63%, 91.76%, and 81.23%, respectively, demonstrating the high accuracy of the proposed dataset and the robustness of the automated system. We anticipate this archive to facilitate many applications, including large-scale flood loss and risk assessment, and inundation model calibration and validation.

TI  - Measuring the Impact of the Multiple Cropping Index of Cultivated Land during Continuous and Rapid Rise of Urbanization in China: A Study from 2000 to 2015
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous and rapid rise of urbanization in China, land use transition research has been carried out extensively. Multiple cropping is the content of land use recessive morphology research, and it is also a common agricultural system in China. Accordingly, further research on multiple cropping index (MCI) can enrich the land use transition research and help to evaluate China's food security. In order to examine the spatiotemporal changes and factors influencing the MCI of cultivated land in China, we collected MODIS remote sensing image data and land use classification data and conducted a remote sensing inversion on China's MCI from 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The spatial distributions and evolution processes of the MCI were explored through spatial mapping, statistical analysis, and processing with the Geographic Information System; moreover, the influencing factors of MCI were explored quantitatively with principal component regression. The results were as follows: (1) at the provincial scale, the average MCI across Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu was high; meanwhile, the average MCI across Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Qinghai was low. Between 2000 and 2015, the number of provinces with low MCI increased gradually, and the average MCI decreased greatly in the southern provinces. (2) At the county scale, the Taihang Mountains, Qinling Mountains, and Hengduan Mountains formed the boundary of China's single cropping and multiple cropping indices. Dynamic changes in China's MCI were obvious, and the number of counties with MCI change values lower than 0 increased gradually. Last, (3) natural conditions, nonagricultural process, cultivated land quality, and agricultural intensification demonstrated different degrees of impact on the MCI; in particular, the influence of nonagricultural industries, pesticides, and agricultural plastic film on the MCI proved especially important. Future research should strengthen the existing work on related transformations in farmers' livelihoods, especially in terms of the return of rural labor force, the body of agricultural production, agricultural ecological issues, and the balance between increased crop production and reduced environmental pollution. In addition, agricultural policy design should pay more attention to cultivated land quality, the farmer who cultivates the land, and the multiple cropping potential of cultivated land.

TI  - Detecting Recent Crop Phenology Dynamics in Corn and Soybean Cropping Systems of Kentucky
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate phenological information is essential for monitoring crop development, predicting crop yield, and enhancing resilience to cope with climate change. This study employed a curve-change-based dynamic threshold approach on NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index) time series to detect the planting and harvesting dates for corn and soybean in Kentucky, a typical climatic transition zone, from 2000 to 2018. We compared satellite-based estimates with ground observations and performed trend analyses of crop phenological stages over the study period to analyze their relationships with climate change and crop yields. Our results showed that corn and soybean planting dates were delayed by 0.01 and 0.07 days/year, respectively. Corn harvesting dates were also delayed at a rate of 0.67 days/year, while advanced soybean harvesting occurred at a rate of 0.05 days/year. The growing season length has increased considerably at a rate of 0.66 days/year for corn and was shortened by 0.12 days/year for soybean. Sensitivity analysis showed that planting dates were more sensitive to the early season temperature, while harvesting dates were significantly correlated with temperature over the entire growing season. In terms of the changing climatic factors, only the increased summer precipitation was statistically related to the delayed corn harvesting dates in Kentucky. Further analysis showed that the increased corn yield was significantly correlated with the delayed harvesting dates (1.37 Bu/acre per day) and extended growing season length (1.67 Bu/acre per day). Our results suggested that seasonal climate change (e.g., summer precipitation) was the main factor influencing crop phenological trends, particularly corn harvesting in Kentucky over the study period. We also highlighted the critical role of changing crop phenology in constraining crop production, which needs further efforts for optimizing crop management practices.

TI  - Monitoring fire regimes and assessing their driving factors in Central Asia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Relatively little is known about fire regimes in grassland and cropland in Central Asia. In this study, eleven variables of fire regimes were measured from 2001 to 2019 by utilizing the burned area and active fire product, which was obtained and processed from the GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform, to describe the incidence, inter-annual variability, peak month and size of fire in four land cover types (forest, grassland, cropland and bare land). Then all variables were clustered to define clusters of fire regimes with unique fire attributes using the K-means algorithm. Results showed that Kazakhstan (KAZ) was the most affected by fire in Central Asia. Fire regimes in cropland in KAZ had the frequent, large and intense characters, which covered large burned areas and had a long duration. Fires in grassland mainly occurred in central KAZ and had the small scale and high-intensity characters with different quarterly frequencies. Fires in forest were mainly distributed in northern KAZ and eastern KAZ. Although fires in grassland underwent a shift from more to less frequent from 2001 to 2019 in Central Asia, vigilance is needed because most fires in grassland occur suddenly and cause harm to humans and livestock.

TI  - CERES MODIS Cloud Product Retrievals for Edition 4-Part II: Comparisons to CloudSat and CALIPSO
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessments of the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Edition 4 (Ed4) cloud retrievals are critical for climate studies. Ed4 cloud parameters are evaluated using instruments in the A-Train Constellation. Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) retrievals are compared with Ed4 retrievals from the AquaModerate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) as a function of the CALIOP horizontal averaging (HA) scale. Regardless of the HA scale, MODIS daytime (nighttime) water cloud fraction (CF) is greater (less) than that from CALIOP. MODIS ice CF is less than CALIOP overall, with the largest differences in polar regions. Ed4 and CALIOP retrieve the same cloud phase in 70%-98% of simultaneous observations depending on the time of day, surface conditions, HA scales, and type of cloud vertical structure. Mean cloud top height (CTH) differences for single-layer water clouds over snow-/icefree surfaces are less than 100 m. Base altitude positive biases of 170-460 m may be impacted by CPR detection limitations. Average MODIS ice CTHs are underestimated by 70 m for some deep convective clouds and up to similar to 2.2 km for thin cirrus. Ice cloud base altitudes are typically underestimated (overestimated) during daytime (nighttime). MODIS and CALIOP cirrus optical depths over oceans are within 46% and 5% for daytime and nighttime observations, respectively. Ice water path differences depend on the CALIOP retrieval version and warrant further investigation. Except for daytime cirrus optical depth, Ed4 cloud property retrievals are at least as accurate as other long-term operational cloud property retrieval systems.

TI  - All models of satellite-derived phenology are wrong, but some are useful: A case study from northern Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived phenology (or apparent phenology) is frequently used to illustrate changes in plant phenology (i.e. true phenology) and the effects of climate forcing. However, each study uses a different method to detect phenology. Plant phenology refers to the relationship between the life cycle of plants and weather and climate events. Phenology is often studied in the field, but recently studies have transitioned towards using satellite images to monitor phenology at the plot, country, and continental scales. The problem with this approach is that there is an ever-increasing variety of earth observation satellites collecting data with different spatial, spectral, and temporal characteristics. In this paper we ask if studies that detect phenology using different sensors over the same site produce comparable results. Mangrove forests are one example where different methods have been used to examine their apparent phenology. In general, plant phenology, including mangroves, is described using few individual plants, but continental-scale descriptions of phenological events are scarce or inexistent. Few attempts have been made to describe the phenology of mangroves using satellite imagery, and each study presents a different method. We hypothesize that apparent phenology changes with: 1) areal extent; 2) site location; 3) frequency of observation; 4) spatial resolution; 5) temporal coverage; and 6) the number of cloud contaminated observations. Intuitively, one would assume that these hypotheses hold true, yet few studies have investigated this. For example, one would expect that clouds change the observed phenology of vegetation, that the number of species captured at spatial resolution will impact the apparent phenology, or that mangroves in different places display different phenologies, but how are these changes represented in the apparent phenology? We use the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) to examine the changes in the start of season and peak growing season dates, as well as the shape and amplitude of the apparent phenology in each hypothesis. We use Landsat and Sentinel 2 imagery over the mangrove forests in Darwin Harbour (Northern Territory, Australia) as a case study, and found that apparent phenology does change with the sensor, site, and cloud contamination. Importantly, the apparent phenology is comparable between Landsat and Sentinel 2 sensors, but it is not comparable to phenology derived from MODIS. This is due to differences in the spatial resolution of the sensors. Cloud contamination also significantly changes the apparent phenology of vegetation. In this paper we expose the complexity of modelling phenology with remote sensing and help guide future phenology investigations.

TI  - Global Comparisons of ERA5 and the Operational HRES Tropospheric Delay and Water Vapor Products With GPS and MODIS
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable water vapor (PWV) from numerical weather models, such as the latest generation of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA5) and the ECMWF High RESolution (HRES) models, are important to meteorological studies and to error mitigation of geodetic observations such as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar. In this study, we provide global validations of these new weather models with respect to Global Positioning System (GPS, similar to 13,000 stations) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS, similar to 1 km resolution) using data from January 2016 to December 2018 of every 1 h. The global standard deviations of the Zenith Tropospheric Delay (ZTD) differences (DSTDs) between weather models and GPS are 1.69 cm for ERA5 and 1.54 cm for HRES. The global PWV DSTDs between weather models and MODIS are 0.34 cm for ERA5 and 0.32 cm for HRES. The two weather models generally perform better in western North America, Europe, and Arctic by having low ZTD DSTDs (<1.3 cm) or PWV DSTDs (<0.3 cm). HRES also has a low ZTD DSTD of less than 1.3 cm in Antarctic, Japan, New Zealand, and Africa and outperforms ERA5 in most regions of the world, despite the fact that 83% of the HRES PWV values are temporally interpolated (from 6 to 1-h). However, under extreme weather conditions, ERA5 performs better owing to its high temporal resolution (1 h). Our results can be used as a global reference for evaluating uncertainties when utilizing these weather models.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Arable Land Monitoring in Arid Region of Northwest China Using a New Extraction Index
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of a high-accuracy method to extract arable land using effective data sources is crucial to detect and monitor arable land dynamics, servicing land protection and sustainable development. In this study, a new arable land extraction index (ALEI) based on spectral analysis was proposed, examined by ground truth data, and then applied to the Hexi Corridor in northwest China. The arable land and its change patterns during 1990-2020 were extracted and identified using 40 Landsat TM/OLI images acquired in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can distinguish arable land areas accurately, with the User's (Producer's) accuracy and overall accuracy (kappa coefficient) exceeding 0.90 (0.88) and 0.89 (0.87), respectively. The mean relative error calculated using field survey data obtained in 2012 and 2020 was 0.169 and 0.191, respectively, indicating the feasibility of the ALEI method in arable land extracting. The study found that arable land area in the Hexi Corridor was 13217.58 km(2) in 2020, significantly increased by 25.33% compared to that in 1990. At 10-year intervals, the arable land experienced different change patterns. The study results indicate that ALEI index is a promising tool used to effectively extract arable land in the arid area.

TI  - Advances in the automatic detection algorithms for lightning whistlers recorded by electromagnetic satellite data
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Lightning whistlers, found frequently in electromagnetic satellite observation, are the important media to study the plasmasphere of the earth space. With the increasing number of data observed from electromagnetic satellites, a considerable amount of time and human efforts are needed to detect lightning whistlers from these tremendous data. However, in recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as computer vision and deep learning, algorithms for lightning whistlers automatic detection in the time-frequency profile of the electromagnetic satellites data have been conducted. This study analyzes and summarizes the existing automatic detection algorithms. Firstly, we describe the time-frequency characteristics and types of lightning whistlers recorded by electromagnetic satellites. Secondly, we introduce the automatic detection technique, which is composed of three steps involving extracting the feature of the object (the lightning whistler or noise), choosing the correct class label for the feature, and providing the boundaries of each object. Then, we analyze and summarize the existing research methods from three aspects including lightning whistler feature extraction, classification and positioning. Thirdly, we briefly describe the metrics to evaluate the mathematical model for automatic detection of lightning whistler. Fourthly, we apply three typical algorithms on the search coil magnetometer data of ZH-1 satellite to detect the lightning whistler automatically and conduct a deep analysis on the results. Lastly, we present existing problems and future possible research directions.

TI  - A review of deep learning methods for semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery has been employed in many applications and is a key research topic for decades. With the success of deep learning methods in the field of computer vision, researchers have made a great effort to transfer their superior performance to the field of remote sensing image analysis. This paper starts with a summary of the fundamental deep neural network architectures and reviews the most recent developments of deep learning methods for semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery including non conventional data such as hyperspectral images and point clouds. In our review of the literature, we identified three major challenges faced by researchers and summarize the innovative development to address them. As tremendous efforts have been devoted to advancing pixel-level accuracy, the emerged deep learning methods demonstrated much-improved performance on several public data sets. As to handling the non-conventional, unstructured point cloud and rich spectral imagery, the performance of the state-of-the-art methods is, on average, inferior to that of the satellite imagery. Such a performance gap also exists in learning from small data sets. In particular, the limited non-conventional remote sensing data sets with labels is an obstacle to developing and evaluating new deep learning methods.

TI  - Conceptual Model of Ecosystem Service Flows from Carbon Dioxide to Blue Carbon in Coastal Wetlands: An Empirical Study Based on Yancheng, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large amounts of blue carbon exist in the ecosystems of coastal wetlands. Accurate calculations of the stocks and economic value of blue carbon in various plant communities can facilitate vegetation rehabilitation. Based on this objective, first, a blue carbon estimation model was constructed by combining a Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model, and second, the distribution pattern of blue carbon and flow direction of ecosystem services (carbon sequestration) in a coastal wetland in China was analyzed utilizing a combination of field surveys, remote sensing data, and laboratory analysis techniques. Finally, the wetland carbon sequestration value and its income-expenditure status were measured using the carbon tax method. The results show that the aboveground net primary productivity of coastal wetland vegetation exhibits a non-zonal distribution in the south-north direction, whereas it presented a three-level gradient distribution, characterized as "low (200-300 g/m(2)center dot y)-intermediate (300-400 g/m(2)center dot y)-high (400-500 g/m(2)center dot y)", in the east-west direction. The accumulation of carbon gradually increased from the ground surface to the underground (litter < underground roots < soil) in Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis. On the type scale, Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis wetlands were of the "blue carbon" net outflow type (supply type), with mean annual outflow carbon sequestration values of 3272.3 $/ha and 40.9 $/ha, respectively. The Suaeda glauca wetland was of the "blue carbon" net inflow type (benefit type), with a mean annual inflow carbon sequestration value of 190.7 $/ha.

TI  - Detection and Quantification of Irrigation Water Amounts at 500 m Using Sentinel-1 Surface Soil Moisture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed information about irrigation timing and water use at a high spatial resolution is critical for monitoring and improving agricultural water use efficiency. However, neither statistical surveys nor remote sensing-based approaches can currently accommodate this need. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach based on the TU Wien Sentinel-1 Surface Soil Moisture product, characterized by a spatial sampling of 500 m and a revisit time of 1.5-4 days over Europe. Spatiotemporal patterns of soil moisture are used to identify individual irrigation events and estimate irrigation water amounts. To retrieve the latter, we include formulations of evapotranspiration and drainage losses to account for vertical fluxes, which may significantly influence sub-daily soil moisture variations. The proposed approach was evaluated against field-scale irrigation data reported by farmers at three sites in Germany with heterogeneous field sizes, crop patterns, irrigation systems and management. Our results show that most field-scale irrigation events can be detected using soil moisture information (mean F-score = 0.77). Irrigation estimates, in terms of temporal dynamics as well as spatial patterns, were in agreement with reference data (mean Pearson correlation = 0.64) regardless of field-specific characteristics (e.g., crop type). Hence, the proposed approach has the potential to be applied over large regions with varying cropping systems.

TI  - Study of Water Exchange in the Kerch Strait Based on Historical Data and Contact Measurements in 2019
T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Results of the study of water exchange between the Azov and Black seas based on the data of contact measurements in 2019 are presented. Estimates of the scale of the Sea of Azov plume were obtained under conditions of a strong northeasterly wind (9-10 m/s). The results of field measurements confirmed the determining role of wind in water exchange through the Kerch Strait, which made it possible to form statistics on the flow of the Sea of Azov waters into the Black Sea based on wind reanalysis data over the past twenty years. A new method for calculating the flow of the Sea of Azov water through the Kerch Strait based on the comparison of satellite and field data is proposed and applied. The calculation of the Sea of Azov water transport is generally based on the assessment of the spatial characteristics of the Sea of Azov plume in the Black Sea and, in particular, on the determination of the dependence of its area on wind parameters. The average annual transport of the Sea of Azov water estimated using the new method practically coincides with the average value of all estimates of water exchange through the Kerch Strait, obtained using other calculation methods. We also considered the reverse case of the inflow of the Black Sea waters into the Sea of Azov after the end of the period of intense flow of the Sea of Azov waters into the Black Sea.

TI  - Machine learning strategies for lithostratigraphic classification based on geochemical sampling data: A case study in area of Chahanwusu River, Qinghai Province, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the complex correlation between the geochemical element distribution patterns at the surface and the types of bedrock and the powerful capabilities in capturing subtle of machine learning algorithms, four machine learning algorithms, namely, decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and LightGBM (LGBM), were implemented for the lithostratigraphic classification and lithostratigraphic prediction of a quaternary coverage area based on stream sediment geochemical sampling data in the Chahanwusu River of Dulan County, Qinghai Province, China. The local Moran's I to represent the features of spatial autocorrelations, and terrain factors to represent the features of surface geological processes, were calculated as additional features. The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores were chosen as the evaluation indices and Voronoi diagrams were applied for visualization. The results indicate that XGB and LGBM models both performed well. They not only obtained relatively satisfactory classification performance but also predicted lithostratigraphic types of the Quaternary coverage area that are essentially consistent with their neighborhoods which have the known types. It is feasible to classify the lithostratigraphic types through the concentrations of geochemical elements in the sediments, and the XGB and LGBM algorithms are recommended for lithostratigraphic classification.

TI  - Nonpairwise-Trained Cycle Convolutional Neural Network for Single Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Single image super-resolution (SISR) is to recover the high spatial resolution image from a single low spatial resolution one, which is a useful procedure for many remote sensing applications. Most previous convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods adopt supervised learning. However, paired high-resolution and low-resolution remote sensing images are actually hard to acquire for supervised learning SR methods. To handle this problem, we propose a novel cycle convolutional neural network (Cycle-CNN). Our network consists of two generative CNNs for down-sampling and SR separately and can be trained with unpaired data. We perform comprehensive experiments on panchromatic and multispectral images of the GaoFen-2 satellite and the UC Merced land use data set. Experimental results indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art CNN-based SR results and is robust against noise and blur in remote sensing images. Comprehensively considering super-resolved image quality and time costs, our proposed method outperforms the compared learning-based SISR approaches.

TI  - Creating 1-km long-term (1980-2014) daily average air temperatures over the Tibetan Plateau by integrating eight types of reanalysis and land data assimilation products downscaled with MODIS-estimated temperature lapse rates based on machine learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature (Tair) is critical to modeling environmental processes (e.g. snow/glacier melting) in high-elevation areas of the Tibetan Plateau (TP). To resolve the issue that Tair observations are scarce in the TP western part and at high elevation, many studies have estimated daily air temperatures by using MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and various reanalysis datasets. These estimates are however inadequate for supporting high-resolution long-term hydrological simulations or climate analysis due to the high cloud cover, short time span or low spatial resolution. To improve the Tair estimation, this study develops a novel machine-learning based method that uses the Gradient Boosting model to efficiently integrate observations from high-elevation stations with eight widely used air temperature reanalysis and assimilation datasets (i.e., NNRP-2, 20CRV2c, JRA-55, ERA-Interim, MERRA-2, CFSR, ERA5 and GLDAS2) downscaled with remote sensing-based temperature lapse rates (TLR). This method is used to generate a new dataset of daily air temperature with the 1-km resolution for the period of 1980-2014. To overcome the problem that TLR derived from limited stations may be unreliable, a new TLR estimation method is developed to first estimate spatially continuous monthly TLRs from MODIS LST and then downscale daily mean Tair from eight reanalysis and assimilation datasets to obtain Tair at the 1-km resolution using the MODIS-estimated TLRs. The Gradient Boosting (GB) model is selected for integrating the eight downscaled Tair and five other auxiliary variables. The models are trained and validated using observations from 100 common stations (i.e. China Meteorology Administration stations) and 13 independent high-elevation stations (4 on glaciers). The results show that the proposed TLR estimation method can efficiently reduce exceptional TLRs in the meantime keeping acceptable downscaling accuracy. The downscaled Tair from JRA-55 is the best among the eight downscaled datasets followed by ERA-Interim, MERRA-2, CFSR and others. Finally, the GB-integrated Tair further outperforms the downscaled JRA-55 Tair with the mean root-mean-squared-deviation (RMSD) of 1.7 degrees C versus 2.0 degrees C, especially in high-elevation stations with mean RMSD of 1.9 degrees C versus 2.7 degrees C. Both the MODIS-estimated TLR and the high-elevation training observations are demonstrated to significantly improve the air temperature estimation accuracy of the GB model in high-elevation stations. This study also provides a framework for integrating multiple reanalysis and assimilation temperature data with elevation correction in mountainous regions that is not restricted to the TP.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Spatiotemporal Fusion Using a Generative Adversarial Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to technological limitations and budget constraints, spatiotemporal fusion is considered a promising way to deal with the tradeoff between the temporal and spatial resolutions of remote sensing images. Furthermore, the generative adversarial network (GAN) has shown its capability in a variety of applications. This article presents a remote sensing image spatiotemporal fusion method using a GAN (STFGAN), which adopts a two-stage framework with an end-to-end image fusion GAN (IFGAN) for each stage. The IFGAN contains a generator and a discriminator in competition with each other under the guidance of the optimization function. Considering the huge spatial resolution gap between the high-spatial, low-temporal (HSLT) resolution Landsat imagery and the corresponding low-spatial, high-temporal (LSHT) resolution MODIS imagery, a feature-level fusion strategy is adopted. Specifically, for the generator, we first super- resolve the MODIS images while also extracting the high-frequency features of the Landsat images. Finally, we integrate the features from the MODIS and Landsat images. STFGAN is able to learn an end-to-end mapping between the Landsat-MODIS image pairs and predicts the Landsat-like image for a prediction date by considering all the bands. STFGAN significantly improves the accuracy of phenological change and land-cover-type change prediction with the help of residual blocks and two prior Landsat-MODIS image pairs. To examine the performance of the proposed STFGAN method, experiments were conducted on three representative Landsat-MODIS data sets. The results clearly illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Remote Sensing Based Spatial-Temporal Monitoring of the Changes in Coastline Mangrove Forests in China over the Last 40 Years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a developing country, China's mangrove landscape pattern has undergone significant temporal and spatial changes over the last four decades. However, we know little about the changes in the mangrove landscape pattern characteristics other than the area at the national scale. The analysis of mangrove landscape pattern changes from different perspectives on a national scale can provide scientific support for mangrove protection and restoration. In this study, the temporal and spatial changes in the pattern of the mangrove landscape over the last 40 years in China were analyzed based on remote sensing data with high classification accuracy (99.3% of 2018). First, according to the natural geographical conditions of the coastal zone and the distribution of the mangroves, the distribution area of the mangroves in China was divided into 31 natural shores. Then, by selecting representative landscape indexes and constructing an integrated landscape index, the spatial-temporal changes in the landscape pattern of China's mangroves over the last 40 years were analyzed based on five perspectives: Total area change, shape complexity, connectivity, fragmentation, and the integrated state of the landscape. From a temporal viewpoint, before 2000, the total area of each shore exhibited a downward trend, and the degree of connectivity deteriorated continuously, but the degree of fragmentation was stable at a low level. After 2000, although the total area improved, the degree of fragmentation gradually increased. The spatial changes are mainly reflected by the fact that the shores in Guangdong and Hainan exhibited significant differences within the same province. Based on the above analysis, corresponding scientific suggestions are proposed from temporal and spatial viewpoints to provide guidance for mangrove management and protection in China and to provide a reference for mangrove research in other regions of the world.

TI  - Coastal Wetland Classification with GF-3 Polarimetric SAR Imagery by Using Object-Oriented Random Forest Algorithm
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - When the use of optical images is not practical due to cloud cover, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is a preferred alternative for monitoring coastal wetlands because it is unaffected by weather conditions. Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) enables the detection of different backscattering mechanisms and thus has potential applications in land cover classification. Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is the first Chinese civilian satellite with multi-polarized C-band SAR imaging capability. Coastal wetland classification with GF-3 polarimetric SAR imagery has attracted increased attention in recent years, but it remains challenging. The aim of this study was to classify land cover in coastal wetlands using an object-oriented random forest algorithm on the basis of GF-3 polarimetric SAR imagery. First, a set of 16 commonly used SAR features was extracted. Second, the importance of each SAR feature was calculated, and the optimal polarimetric features were selected for wetland classification by combining random forest (RF) with sequential backward selection (SBS). Finally, the proposed algorithm was utilized to classify different land cover types in the Yancheng Coastal Wetlands. The results show that the most important parameters for wetland classification in this study were Shannon entropy, Span and orientation randomness, combined with features derived from Yamaguchi decomposition, namely, volume scattering, double scattering, surface scattering and helix scattering. When the object-oriented RF classification approach was used with the optimal feature combination, different land cover types in the study area were classified, with an overall accuracy of up to 92%.

TI  - Statistical Characteristics of Mesoscale Convective Systems Initiated over the Tibetan Plateau in Summer by Fengyun Satellite and Precipitation Estimates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to investigate the key characteristics of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) initiated over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in recent years and the main differences in circulation and environmental factors between different types of MCSs, an automatic MCS identification and tracking method was applied based on the data from China's Fengyun satellite and precipitation estimates. In total, 8820 MCSs were found to have been initiated over the TP during the summers from 2013 to 2019, and a total of 9.3% of them were able to move eastward out of the TP (EO). The number of MCSs showed a monthly variation, with a maximum in July and a minimum in June, while most EOs occurred in June. Compared with other types of MCSs, EOs usually had a lower cloud-top temperature, a greater rainfall intensity, a longer life duration, more rapid development, larger areas of rainfall and convective clouds, longer tracks and a wider influence range, indicating that EOs are more vigorous than the other types of MCSs. The movement of MCSs is mainly due to the mid- to high-level dynamic conditions, and moisture is an essential factor in their development and maintenance.

TI  - Impact Assessments of Typhoon Lekima on Forest Damages in Subtropical China Using Machine Learning Methods and Landsat 8 OLI Imagery
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind damage is one of the major factors affecting forest ecosystem sustainability, especially in the coastal region. Typhoon Lekima is among the top five most devastating typhoons in China and caused economic losses totaling over USD 8 billion in Zhejiang Province alone during 9-12 August 2019. However, there still is no assessment of its impacts on forests. Here we detected forest damage and its spatial distribution caused by Typhoon Lekima by classifying Landsat 8 OLI images using the random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm and the univariate image differencing (UID) method on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The accuracy assessment indicated a high overall accuracy (>87%) and kappa coefficient (>0.75) for forest-damage detection, as evaluated against field-investigated plot data, with better performance using the RF method. The total affected forest area by Lekima was 4598.87 km(2), accounting for 8.44% of the total forest area in Zhejiang Province. The light-, moderate- and severe-damage forest areas were 2106.29 km(2), 2024.26 km(2) and 469.76 km(2), respectively. Considering the damage severity, the net forest canopy loss fraction was 2.57%. The affected forest area and damage severity exhibited large spatial variations, which were affected by elevation, slope, precipitation and forest type. Our study indicated a larger uncertainty for affected forest area and a smaller uncertainty for the proportion of damage severity, based on multiple assessment approaches. This is among the first studies on forest damage due to typhoons at a regional scale in China, and the methods can be extended to examine the impacts of other super-strong typhoons on forests. Our study results on damage severity, spatial distribution and controlling factors could help local governments, the forest sector and forest landowners make decision on tree-planting planning and sustainable management after typhoon strikes and could also raise public and governmental awareness of typhoons' damage on China's inland forests.

TI  - High Repetition Frequency Narrow Pulse Width Single Frequency Laser
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective As a space active photoelectric remote sensing technology, lidar is of great significance to high-precision three-dimensional imaging, ground detection with high vertical resolution, and deep space exploration with high spatio-temporal resolution. For traditional spaceborne and high-altitude airborne lidars, laser signals with low repetition rate and high pulse energy and linear photoelectric detection technology were mostly used, which had problems such as high power consumption, large size, and low surface resolution. The development of single-photon detection technology can simplify the lidar system, and improve the detection sensitivity and detection efficiency. However, it also requires laser signals with different performance parameters. Laser with high repetition rates can increase the sampling frequency and describe the sampling target more accurately. And the laser signal with a narrower pulse width can reduce the detection error and improve the detection accuracy of the lidar. And the narrower linewidth laser, combined with the corresponding narrowband filter, can reduce the influence of background noise on the detector and improve the sensitivity of the detection system. In this paper, we report a compact single-frequency laser with high repetition rate, high pulse energy, and narrow pulse width output. We hope that our laser will be helpful to space active detection lidar based on single-photon detection technology.Methods In order to achieve narrow pulse laser output, electro-optic Q-switch is selected to obtain narrow pulses under 10 ns and generate high peak power laser. According to the theory of electro-optic Q-switched laser, the factors affecting the pulse width are analyzed: Nd YVO, crystal with higher 621r value is selected to obtain a higher small signal gain; the cavity length is shortened and the pump power is increased to obtain a narrower laser pulse. In order to achieve a narrow linewidth laser output, a volume Bragg grating mode selection method is used to build a solid single-frequency laser. The laser is end-pumped by a continuous-wave laser diode. The semiconductor laser with a pigtail output has a center wavelength of 808 nm, which can realize an adjustable continuous output with a power of 0-15 W. The core diameter and numerical aperture of the fiber are 200 dm and 0.22. The collimating and focusing system is a combination of two piano-convex lenses with focal lengths of 15 mm and 23 mm, respectively. The 808 nm pump light is focused on the gain crystal. The actual spot radius of the focal point is about 300 dm. The 0 total reflection plane mirror Ml coated with 808 nm high-transmittance film and 1064 nm high-reflection film forms a flat cavity structure with the coupling output element reflective volume Bragg grating (RBG), and the physical cavity length is 48 mm. The polarization beam splitting is used as a polarizing element. The rubidium titanyl phosphate (RTP) crystal pair is used as an electro-optic Q-switch. PBS, RTP and the 1/4 wave plate together constitute the Q-switch of the laser. It adopts a voltage-increased electro-optic Q-switched method, and is driven by a high-frequency and high-voltage signal to realize the on and off switch of the optical circuit, forming a Q-switched giant pulse output.Results and Discussions At a repetition frequency of 10 kHz, when the pump power is 9. 67 W, a laser output with an average power of 1.68 W is obtained (Fig. 4). The power instability within 3 h is 0.32% (Fig. 5). The output laser pulse width is 1. 3 ns, and the pulse waveform is smooth ( Fig. 6). The output wavelength is 1064.355 nm, and the line width is 1. 0 pm (Fig. 8). According to the longitudinal mode interval formula.AA = A20/(21'), the longitudinal mode interval is 8. 6 pm in the condition of 65. 7 mm optical cavity length in this experiment, which is larger than line width of the output laser. So the laser realizes single longitudinal mode output. The beam quality factor of two directions is M: =1.22 and M: =1.18 (Fig. 9).Conclusions A single-frequency solid-state laser with high repetition rate and narrow pulse width is introduced in this paper. The laser is end-pumped by a continuous-wave laser diode, Nd YVO, crystal as gain medium, the RTP crystal pair as the electro-optic Q-switch, and RBG as output mirror. In a resonant cavity with an optical cavity length of 65. 7 mm, the single-frequency laser output with a wavelength of 1064. 355 nm is locked. And at a repetition frequency of 10 kHz, the laser has a pulse width of 1.3 ns, an average power of 1.68 W, and the beam quality of M2, = 1.22 and M2 = 1.18. The laser has a compact structure and achieves a narrow pulse width, a narrow line width, and a large energy laser output at a high repetition rate. It can be used as a laser radar emission source for single-photon detection, and can also be used as a seed source of the main oscillation power amplification system for amplification to achieve more long-distance detection.

TI  - Satellite remote sensing of atmospheric particulate matter mass concentration: Advances, challenges, and perspectives
T2  - FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the mass concentration of near-surface atmospheric particulate matter (PM) using satellite observations has become a popular research niche, leading to the development of a variety of instruments, algorithms, and datasets over the past two decades. In this study, we conducted a holistic review of the major advances and challenges in quantifying PM, with a specific focus on instruments, algorithms, datasets, and modeling methods that have been developed over the past 20 years. The aim of this study is to provide a general guide for future satellite-based PM concentration mapping practices and to better support air quality monitoring and management of environmental health. Specifically, we review the evolution of satellite platforms, sensors, inversion algorithms, and datasets that can be used for monitoring aerosol properties. We then compare various practical methods and techniques that have been used to estimate PM mass concentrations and group them into four primary categories: (1) univariate regression, (2) chemical transport models (CTM), (3) multivariate regression, and (4) empirical physical approaches. Considering the main challenges encountered in PM mapping practices, for example, data gaps and discontinuity, a hybrid method is proposed with the aim of generating PM concentration maps that are both spatially continuous and have high precision.

TI  - Diurnal Variation of the Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient for Downwelling Irradiance at 490 nm in Coastal East China Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The diurnal variation of the diffuse attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance at 490 nm (K-d(490)) has complex characteristics in the coastal regions. However, owing to the scarcity of in situ data, our knowledge on the diurnal variation is inadequate. In this study, an optical-buoy dataset was used to investigate the diurnal variation of K-d(490) in the coastal East China Sea, and to evaluate the K-d(490) L2 products of geostationary ocean color imager (GOCI), as well as the performance of six empirical algorithms for K-d(490) estimation in the Case-2 water. The results of validation show that there was high uncertainty in GOCI L2 K-d(490), with mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) of 69.57% and 68.86% and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.70 and 0.71 m(-1) compared to buoy-measured K-d12(490) and K-d13(490), respectively. Meanwhile, with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.71, as well as the lowest MAPE of 27.31% and RMSE of 0.29 m(-1), the new dual ratio algorithm (NDRA) performed the best in estimating K-d(490) in the target area, among the six algorithms. Further, four main types of K-d(490) diurnal variation were found from buoy data, showing different variabilities compared to the area closer to the shore. One typical diurnal variation pattern showed that K-d(490) decreased at flood tide and increased at ebb tide, which was confirmed by GOCI images through the use of NDRA. Hydrometeorological factors influencing the diurnal variations of K-d(490) were also studied. In addition to verifying the predominant impact of tide, we found that the dominant effect of tide and wind on the water column is intensifying sediment resuspension, and the change of sediment transport produced by them are secondary to it.

TI  - Determination of Key Phenological Phases of Winter Wheat Based on the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping Algorithm and MODIS Time-Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate determination of phenological information of crops is essential for field management and decision-making. Remote sensing time-series data are widely used for extracting phenological phases. Existing methods mainly extract phenological phases directly from individual remote sensing time-series, which are easily affected by clouds, noise, and mixed pixels. This paper proposes a novel method of phenological phase extraction based on the time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) algorithm using MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 5-day time-series data with a spatial resolution of 500 m. Firstly, based on the phenological differences between winter wheat and other land cover types, winter wheat distribution is extracted using the TWDTW classification method, and the results show that the overall classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient reach 94.74% and 0.90, respectively. Then, we extract the pure winter-wheat pixels using a method based on the coefficient of variation, and use these pixels to generate the average phenological curve. Next, the difference between each winter-wheat phenological curve and the average winter-wheat phenological curve is quantitatively calculated using the TWDTW algorithm. Finally, the key phenological phases of winter wheat in the study area, namely, the green-up date (GUD), heading date (HD), and maturity date (MD), are determined. The results show that the phenological phase extraction using the TWDTW algorithm has high accuracy. By verification using phenological station data from the Meteorological Data Sharing Service System of China, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the GUD, HD, and MD are found to be 9.76, 5.72, and 6.98 days, respectively. Additionally, the method proposed in this article is shown to have a better extraction performance compared with several other methods. Furthermore, it is shown that, in Hebei Province, the GUD, HD, and MD are mainly affected by latitude and accumulated temperature. As the latitude increases from south to north, the GUD, HD, and MD are delayed, and for each 1 degrees increment in latitude, the GUD, HD, and MD are delayed by 4.84, 5.79, and 6.61 days, respectively. The higher the accumulated temperature, the earlier the phenological phases occur. However, latitude and accumulated temperature have little effect on the length of the phenological phases. Additionally, the lengths of time between GUD and HD, HD and MD, and GUD and MD are stable at 46, 41, and 87 days, respectively. Overall, the proposed TWDTW method can accurately determine the key phenological phases of winter wheat at a regional scale using remote sensing time-series data.

TI  - Weighted Information Models for the Quantitative Prediction and Evaluation of the Geothermal Anomaly Area in the Plateau: A Case Study of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The prediction of geothermal high-temperature anomalies along the plateau railway will be helpful in the construction of the project and its later management. Taking the Sichuan-Tibet railway as the study area and based on Landsat8 thermal infrared images, map data, and measured data regarding the cause and distribution of geothermal high-temperature anomalies, through correlation analysis, we selected six impact factors including the LST, combined entropy of geological formation, fault density, buffer distance to rivers, magnetic anomaly, and earthquake peak acceleration as the input maps of the model. The index-overlay information model, the weights of the entropy information model, and the weights of the evidence information model were established to quantitatively predict the geothermal anomaly in the study area, and the prediction maps were divided into four classes. The results show that the weights of the evidence information model achieved a high prediction accuracy; the success index and the ratio of the high anomaly area reached 0.0053% and 0.872, respectively, and the spatial distribution of the geothermal points is basically consistent with the prediction results. This research can act as a reference for the design and construction of the Sichuan-Tibet railway.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Water Colour Variations in Baiyangdian Lake after the Establishment of the Xiong'an New Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Forel-Ule Index (FUI) is an important parameter that can be calculated from optical remote sensing data to assess water quality based on water colour. Using Sentinel-2 images from April to November within the 2016-2020 period coupled with the Google Earth Engine Platform, we calculated FUI to analyse the spatial distribution, seasonal variations, and inter-annual variations of water colour in Baiyangdian Lake in the Xiong'an New Area established on 1 April 2017. The lake was divided into seven sub-regions, A-G; subsequently, high and low FUI values were observed in the south and north, respectively. Additionally, the mean FUI values of G and F zones in the south were 11.9 and 12.7, respectively, whereas those for the A, B, C, D, and E zones in the north were 10.5, 9.8, 10.4, 11.1, 11.2, respectively. The seasonal variations in the Baiyangdian Lake and seven sub-regions were consistent, with turbid water in spring and autumn, and clear water in summer. Inter-annual variations analyses for 2016-2020 indicated that the zone of A became progressively turbid, whereas the B, C, D, E, F, and G zones exhibited slow and gradually decreasing trends. Our findings suggest that the overall water quality of Baiyangdian Lake may be better, which may be related to the governance policies of the region.

TI  - Analysis Ready Data of the Chinese GaoFen Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis Ready Data (ARD) has been greatly recommended by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) for simplifying and fostering long time series analysis at large scale with minimum additional user effort. Landsat ARD has been successfully made and widely used for large scale analysis. Subsequently, the Chinese satellite data similar to Landsat data have been processed and will be processed into ARDs to promote the use of the Chinese satellite data. At the first stage of the mission, the 4 Wide Field Viewing (WFV) data on GaoFen 1 (GF1) covering the whole of China and the surrounding areas have been processed into ARD. The ARD is provided as standard tiles under a common and unified projection with per pixel quality assurance and metadata for tracing back and further processing data, which are finally stored into a Hierarchical Data File (HDF); furthermore, all spectral bands are georegistered and radiometrically cross-calibrated as top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and are atmospherically corrected as surface reflectance (SR). Therefore, the ARD can be further used easily to produce land cover and land cover change maps and retrieve geophysical and biophysical parameters.

TI  - Cloud vertical structure measurements from a ground-based cloud radar over the southeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) is the critical region of water vapor transport over the TP. Ground-based Ka-band cloud radar (KaCR) measurements collected at the Motuo National Climate Observatory in 2019 were used to analyze the physical properties of clouds at the front of the water vapor channel over the TP. The cloud top heights (CTHs) measured by the KaCR were verified through a comparison with observations from the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite at the same location. The KaCR-obtained CTHs were generally consistent with the FY-4A-obtained CTHs, although the KaCR slightly overestimated the CTHs of nonprecipitation clouds and underestimated the CTHs of precipitation clouds. Negative deviations between the KaCR- and FY-4A-obtained CTHs increased with rainfall rate. Cloud cover frequently occurred over Motuo, with an annual mean occurrence frequency of 65.3%. Clouds tended to form frequently at night and dissipate gradually in the daytime. Two peaks in the cloud base height (CBH) distribution were observed in Motuo, located at 0-1 km and 2-3 km, corresponding to precipitation and nonprecipitation clouds, respectively. The CTHs reached a peak at 6-7 km, which might be related to precipitation clouds. Moreover, a maximum CTH probability was observed in the midnight-early morning hours during the rainy season, while the CTH frequency peaked in the evening during the dry season. In addition, low and middle clouds were prevalent in Motuo for the period of observation in 2019. Understanding the characteristics of clouds over the TP will provide key validations of satellite measurements and promote research on cloud forces over the TP.

TI  - Vegetation dynamics of coal mining city in an arid desert region of Northwest China from 2000 to 2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal mining has led to serious ecological damages in arid desert region of Northwest China. However, effects of climatic factor and mining activity on vegetation dynamics and plant diversity in this region remain unknown. Wuhai City located in the arid desert region of Northwest China is an industrial city and dominated by coal mining. Based on Landsat data and field investigation in Wuhai City, we analyzed the vegetation dynamics and the relationships with climate factors, coal mining activity and ecological restoration projects from 2000 to 2019. Results showed that vegetation in Wuhai City mostly consisted of desert plants, such as Caragana microphylla, Tetraena mongolica and Achnatherum splendens. And the vegetation fractional coverage (VFC) and greenness rate of change (GRC) showed that vegetation was slightly improved during the study period. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was positively correlated with annual mean precipitation, relative humidity and annual mean temperature, indicating that these climate factors might play important roles in the improved vegetation. Vegetation coverage and plant diversity around the coal mining area were reduced by coal mining, while the implementation of ecological restoration projects improved the vegetation coverage and plant diversity. Our results suggested that vegetation in the arid desert region was mainly affected by climate factors, and the implementation of ecological restoration projects could mitigate the impacts of coal mining on vegetation and ecological environment.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring of Advancing and Surging Glaciers in the Tien Shan, 1990-2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The advancing of glaciers is a manifestation of dynamic glacial instability. Glaciers in the Tien Shan region, especially in the Central Tien Shan, show instability, and advancing glaciers have been recently detected. In this study, we used Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI remote sensing images to identify glaciers in the Tien Shan region from 1990 to 2019 and found that 48 glaciers advanced. Among them, thirty-four glaciers exhibited terminal advances, and 14 glaciers experienced advances on the tributary or trunk. Ten of the glaciers experiencing terminal advances have been identified as surging glaciers. These 48 glaciers are distributed in the western part of the Halik and Kungey Mountain Ranges in the Central Tien Shan, and Fergana Mountains in the Western Tien Shan, indicating that the Tien Shan is also one of the regions where advancing and surging glaciers are active. From 1990 to 2019, a total of 169 times advances occurred on 34 terminal advancing glaciers in the Tien Shan region; the highest number of advancing and surging of glaciers occurred in July (26 and 14 times, respectively). With reference to the existing literature and the present study, the surge cycle in the Tien Shan is longer than that in other regions at high latitudes in Asia, lasting about 35-60 years. Surging glaciers in the Tien Shan region may be affected by a combination of thermal and hydrological control. An increase in temperature and precipitation drives surging glaciers, but the change mechanism is still difficult to explain based on changes in a single climate variable, such as temperature or precipitation.

TI  - RSIMS: Large-Scale Heterogeneous Remote Sensing Images Management System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the remarkable development and progress of earth-observation techniques, remote sensing data keep growing rapidly and their volume has reached exabyte scale. However, it's still a big challenge to manage and process such huge amounts of remote sensing data with complex and diverse structures. This paper designs and realizes a distributed storage system for large-scale remote sensing data storage, access, and retrieval, called RSIMS (remote sensing images management system), which is composed of three sub-modules: RSIAPI, RSIMeta, RSIData. Structured text metadata of different remote sensing images are all stored in RSIMeta based on a set of uniform models, and then indexed by the distributed multi-level Hilbert grids for high spatiotemporal retrieval performance. Unstructured binary image files are stored in RSIData, which provides large scalable storage capacity and efficient GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) compatible I/O interfaces. Popular GIS software and tools (e.g., QGIS, ArcGIS, rasterio) can access data stored in RSIData directly. RSIAPI provides users a set of uniform interfaces for data access and retrieval, hiding the complex inner structures of RSIMS. The test results show that RSIMS can store and manage large amounts of remote sensing images from various sources with high and stable performance, and is easy to deploy and use.

TI  - Toward Improved Comparisons Between Land-Surface-Water-Area Estimates From a Global River Model and Satellite Observations
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface water is a key component of the global water cycle. Compared to remote sensing by satellites, both temporal extension and spatial continuity are superior in modeling of water surface area. However, overall evaluation of models representing different kinds of surface waters at the global scale is lacking. We estimated land surface water area (LSWA) using the Catchment-based Macro-scale Floodplain model (CaMa-Flood), a global hydrodynamic model, and compared the estimates with Landsat at 3 '' resolution (similar to 90 m at the equator) globally. Results show that the two methodologies show agreement in the general spatial patterns of LSWA (e.g., major rivers and lakes, open-to-sky floodplains), but globally consistent mismatches are found under several land surface conditions. CaMa-Flood underestimates LSWA in high northern latitudes and coastal areas, as the presence of isolated lakes in local depressions or small coastal rivers is not considered by the model's physical assumptions. In contrast, model-estimated LSWA is larger than Landsat estimates in forest-covered areas (e.g., Amazon basin) due to the opacity of vegetation for optical satellite sensing, and in cropland areas due to the lack of dynamic water processes (e.g., re-infiltration, evaporation, and water consumption) and constraints of water infrastructure (e.g., canals, levees). These globally consistent differences can be reasonably explained by the model's physical assumptions or optical satellite sensing characteristics. Applying filters (e.g., floodplain topography mask, forest and cropland mask) to the two datasets improves the reliability of comparison and allows the remaining local-scale discrepancies to be attributed to locally varying factors (e.g., channel parameters, atmospheric forcing).

TI  - Crop Yield Prediction Based on Agrometeorological Indexes and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and reliable estimations of crop yield are essential for crop management and successful food trade. In previous studies, remote sensing data or climate data are often used alone in statistical yield estimation models. In this study, we synthetically used agrometeorological indicators and remote sensing vegetation parameters to estimate maize yield in Jilin and Liaoning Provinces of China. We applied two methods to select input variables, used the random forest method to establish yield estimation models, and verified the accuracy of the models in three disaster years (1997, 2000, and 2001). The results show that the R-2 values of the eight yield estimation models established in the two provinces were all above 0.7, Lin's concordance correlation coefficients were all above 0.84, and the mean absolute relative errors were all below 0.14. The mean absolute relative error of the yield estimations in the three disaster years was 0.12 in Jilin Province and 0.13 in Liaoning Province. A model built using variables selected by a two-stage importance evaluation method can obtain a better accuracy with fewer variables. The final yield estimation model of Jilin province adopts eight independent variables, and the final yield estimation model of Liaoning Province adopts nine independent variables. Among the 11 adopted variables in two provinces, ATT (accumulated temperature above 10 degrees C) variables accounted for the highest proportion (54.54%). In addition, the GPP (gross primary production) anomaly in August, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) anomaly in August, and standardized precipitation index with a two-month scale in July were selected as important modeling variables by all methods in the two provinces. This study provides a reference method for the selection of modeling variables, and the results are helpful for understanding the impact of climate on potential yield.

TI  - Estimation of Apple Flowering Frost Loss for Fruit Yield Based on Gridded Meteorological and Remote Sensing Data in Luochuan, Shaanxi Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increase in the frequency of extreme weather events in recent years, apple growing areas in the Loess Plateau frequently encounter frost during flowering. Accurately assessing the frost loss in orchards during the flowering period is of great significance for optimizing disaster prevention measures, market apple price regulation, agricultural insurance, and government subsidy programs. The previous research on orchard frost disasters is mainly focused on early risk warning. Therefore, to effectively quantify orchard frost loss, this paper proposes a frost loss assessment model constructed using meteorological and remote sensing information and applies this model to the regional-scale assessment of orchard fruit loss after frost. As an example, this article examines a frost event that occurred during the apple flowering period in Luochuan County, Northwestern China, on 17 April 2020. A multivariable linear regression (MLR) model was constructed based on the orchard planting years, the number of flowering days, and the chill accumulation before frost, as well as the minimum temperature and daily temperature difference on the day of frost. Then, the model simulation accuracy was verified using the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method, and the coefficient of determination (R-2), the root mean square error (RMSE), and the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were 0.69, 18.76%, and 18.76%, respectively. Additionally, the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (EFAST) method was used for the sensitivity analysis of the model parameters. The results show that the simulated apple orchard fruit number reduction ratio is highly sensitive to the minimum temperature on the day of frost, and the chill accumulation and planting years before the frost, with sensitivity values of >= 0.74, >= 0.25, and >= 0.15, respectively. This research can not only assist governments in optimizing traditional orchard frost prevention measures and market price regulation but can also provide a reference for agricultural insurance companies to formulate plans for compensation after frost.

TI  - Evaluating the SSEBop and RSPMPT Models for Irrigated Fields Daily Evapotranspiration Mapping with MODIS and CMADS Data
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great convenience to map daily evapotranspiration (ET) by remote sensing for agricultural water management without computing each surface energy component. This study used the operational simplified surface energy balance (SSEBop) and the remote sensing-based Penman-Monteith and Priestly-Taylor (RSPMPT) models to compute continuous daily ET over irrigated fields with the MODIS and CMADS data. The estimations were validated with eddy covariance (EC) measurements. Overall, the performance of RSPMPT with locally calibrated parameters was slightly better than that of SSEBop, with higher NSE (0.84 vs. 0.78) and R-2 (0.86 vs. 0.81), lower RMSE (0.78 mm.d (-1) vs. 0.90 mm . d (-1)), although it had higher bias (0.03 mm.d (-1) vs. 0.01 mm.d (-1)) and PBias (1.41% vs. 0.59%). Due to the consideration of land surface temperature, the SSEBop was more sensitive to ET's change caused by irrigation before sowing in March and had a lower PBias (6.7% vs. 39.8%) than RSPMPT. On cloudy days, the SSEBop is more likely to overestimate ET than the RSPMPT. To conclude, driven by MODIS and CMADS data, the two simple models can be easily applied to map daily ET over cropland. The SSEBop is more practical in the absence of measured data to optimize the RSPMPT model parameters.

TI  - Effects of Buoyancy Flux on Upper-Ocean Turbulent Mixing Generated by Non-Breaking Surface Waves Observed in the South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface waves are the most energetic motions, which have great contribution to the turbulent mixing in the upper ocean. In this study, a novel turbulent mixing scheme is proposed in terms of the non-breaking wave velocity shear module with the buoyancy flux. In the scheme, the mixing coefficients can be calculated empirically from the significant wave height, the wave number, the wave frequency, the buoyancy frequency, and the turbulence Prandtl number. The buoyancy fluxes, as well as the non-breaking wave velocity shear production, are important for the upper-ocean turbulent mixing, and make the calculated turbulence dissipation rate closer to in situ observations, which are provided by the "Responses of Marine Hazards to Climate Change in the Western Pacific (ROSE)" Project. The effects of the buoyancy flux on the turbulent mixing are examined based on three numerical experiments using the MASNUM ocean model. In the experiments, the topography, the lateral boundaries, initialization conditions, and the surface forcing fluxes are taken from the GEBCO, HYCOM/NCODA, and ERA5 data, respectively. Comparing to the AVHRR remote sensing sea surface temperature (SST) products and in situ observations, the simulated results with the non-breaking wave-generated turbulent mixing gain significant improvement in the SST, upper-ocean temperature structure, and the mixed layer compared with the classic Mellor-Yamada scheme. The results show that the buoyancy flux is able to suppress the enhanced non-breaking wave-generated turbulent mixing, so that the improved model simulates the observations better than that without the buoyancy effects.Plain Language Summary The sea surface waves can transfer the energy from the wave fields to turbulent mixing in the upper ocean. A novel turbulent mixing scheme is proposed in terms of non-breaking wave velocity shear module with buoyancy flux. The simulated results from the ocean circulation model with the novel scheme gain significant improvement in the SST and the upperocean temperature structure compared with the classic Mellor-Yamada scheme. Buoyancy flux slightly suppresses the enhanced vertical mixing induced by non-breaking wave-generated turbulence, so that the improved model simulates the observations much better than that without the buoyancy effects.

TI  - Classification of Mediterranean hedgerows: A methodological approximation
T2  - METHODSX
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper addresses the methodology carried out to obtain a new classification of hedgerow networks in the Mediterranean region using GIS and Remote Sensing. A new methodology has been developed due to the need to establish a typification of the hedgerows in this sector of southern Europe, where the variable conditioning the localization, area and type of these landscapes is degree of surface soil moisture. In the continental Mediterranean context, this age-old agricultural system is closely linked to access to, and management of, water resources, which are vital in the dry season. For this reason, we mapped the hedgerow network of a continental Mediterranean mountain, establishing different levels of surface soil moisture provided by images from the satellite Sentinel-2. The results render three types of hedgerows: moist, semi-moist and dry, each one presenting clearly differentiated localizations and characteristics. To this can be added the analysis of the evolution of their area from 1956 to the present time from aerial pictures and satellite images and their correlation with surface soil moisture and slope. We present results on this tested method from the central sector of the Iberian Peninsula, Spain.The presented procedure focuses on a new classification of hedgerow networks in the Mediterranean region based on the degree of surface soil moisture.The method stablishes different levels of surface soil moisture provided by images from the satellite Sentinel-2The procedure allows us to analyze and correlate the evolution of Mediterranean hedgerows with surface soil moisture.

TI  - Evaluating single and multi-date Landsat classifications of land-cover in a seasonally dry tropical forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on the land cover is crucial for efficient monitoring and development of environmental studies in the Brazilian Caatinga forest. It is one of the largest and most biodiverse dry forests on the planet. Distinguishing different patterns of land cover through medium spatial-resolution remote sensing, such as the Landsat image series, is challenging to Caatinga due to heterogeneous land cover, complex climate-soil - vegetation interactions, and anthropogenic disturbance. Two remote sensing approaches have a high potential for accurate and efficient land-cover mapping in Caatinga: single and multi-date imagery. The heterogeneity of the land cover of this environment can contribute to a better performance of multispectral approaches, although it is usually applied for single-date images. In a land-cover mapping effort in Caatinga, the temporal factor gains relevance, and the use of time series can bring advantages, but, in general, this approach uses vegetation index, losing multispectral information. This manuscript assesses the accuracies and advantages of single-date multispectral and multi-date Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) approaches in land-cover classification. Both approaches use the Random Forest method, and the results are evaluated based on samples collected during field surveys. Results indicate that land-cover classification obtained from multi-date NDVI performs better (overall accuracy of 88.8% and kappa of 0.86) than single-date multispectral data (overall accuracy of 81.4% and kappa coefficient of 0.78). The Z-test indicated that the difference in performance between the two approaches was statistically significant. The lower performance observed for single-date multispectral classification is due to similarities in spectral responses for targets of deciduous vegetation that lose their foliage and can be misread as non-vegetated areas. Meanwhile, an accurate classification by time series of plant clusters in seasonal forests allows incorporating seasonal variability of land-cover classes during the rainy and dry seasons, as well as transitions between seasons. The most important variables that contributed to the accuracy were the red, Near Infrared (NIR) and Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands in single-date multispectral classification and the months in the dry season were the most relevant in multi-date NDVI classification.

TI  - Land degradation modeling of dust storm sources using MODIS and meteorological time series data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation affects environmental integrity and threatens sustainable development worldwide by contributing to a number of social, economic, and ecological problems. This study uses time series of MODIS products, meteorological data, and ground truth map from dust storm sources to assess the spatial-temporal behavior of land degradation through a Random Forest algorithm in the southwest of Iran. Spatial-temporal variations in land surface biophysical properties of dust sources and surrounding areas were modeled using different time-series data on a 16-days, monthly, seasonal, annual, and 20-year basis from 2000 to 2019. Land degradation was estimated using the Random Forest algorithm. Dust storm sources were used to evaluate land degradation estimates. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the most influential biophysical variables. The results revealed that (i) 16-day time series data performs best in assessing land degradation; (ii) Apparent Thermal Inertia (ATI) was identified as the most influential variable for land degradation assessment; and (iii) there is a marked tendency towards land degradation in areas with severe land cover changes, mainly change from wetland to other classes.

TI  - Human-climate interactions shape fire regimes in the Cerrado of Sa∼o Paulo state, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerrado is the most diverse tropical savanna in the world. As a fire-prone ecosystem, natural fire in the Cerrado shapes plant communities and drives evolutionary processes. Human activities and landscape management can alter natural fire regimes and reshape Cerrado dynamics, making biodiversity conservation a challenge, particularly in densely populated areas. We reconstructed the historical fire regime of three protected areas (PA) and their buffer zones in Sa similar to o Paulo state to understand how current fire exclusion policies are affecting fire regimes and to measure how human-climate-fire relationships can change in areas under different land management. We used Landsat satellite imagery, from 1984 to 2017, with 30 m of spatial resolution and 16 days of temporal resolution. In total, we mapped 49,471 ha of burned area, and we detected variations in fire frequency and fire size among sites. PA dominated by open savanna in Itirapina concentrated 93 % of all observed fires, while PA dominated by forest-like formations in Assis represented only 2% of the fires. Annual rainfall showed a very weak relationship (R2 = 0.04) with annual total burned area, while the rainfall split between dry and wet seasons showed a tendency to have a fuel moisture effect which determined the vegetation available to burn in the dry season (R2 = 0.09). Fire regimes in PA were similar to those observed in buffer zones suggesting that fire-exclusion policies do not effectively prevent fires in PA that are surrounded by an anthropic matrix where fire is often used. When we included human factors in addition to rainfall, our models explained 44 % of variation of burned areas. We conclude that fire regimes in Sa similar to o Paulo Cerrado have been modified by humans and that fire exclusion is not a suitable policy for protected areas in this fire-prone ecosystem.

TI  - Integration of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for change detection: A case study in a war conflict area of Mosul city
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The city of Mosul located approximately 400 km North of Baghdad was captured by the Islamic State during the period 04th - 06th of June in 2014. The impact of conflict had devastated results on buildings and the infrastructure of the city.Remote sensing technology has proven an extremely useful tool for monitoring changes. In this study, a combination of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery is used to map and monitor changes in the urban environment due to war.In total, twenty of both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images were collected during the period of 2015 and 2019. The data were pre-processed and integrated to develop a supervised machine learning classification approach using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Texture analysis such as Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) was also performed and combined with the other datasets.Spectral indices have been used to improve the classification results such as: Band Ratio Built up Area (BRBA), New Built-up Area (BUI), Dry Bare Soil Index (DBSI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) which were derived from the optical data (Sentinel-2) to serve as an input to the classification scheme. The built-up area index was found to be one of the most important features in the classification scheme.Results: show an overall accuracy of approximately 96% was achieved for all the scenes between 2015 and 2019. The change detection results show that the largest devastation occurred between 2017 and 2018 where the urban area was decreased by 427.65 km(2), where in 2019 the impact of the Mosul city was the lowest with a 296.8 km(2) urban loss. The developed approach showed an effectiveness in mapping the areas where conflict had the strongest impact.

TI  - The Features of Ukrainian Media Art in a Global Context
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article seeks to explore Ukrainian media art and its features in a global context. In particular, it performs an in-depth analysis of the stages of its development from video art of the 1990s, media installations of the 2000s, and to various digital and VR technologies today. Due to historical circumstances, the development of media art was quite rapid, as young artists sought to gain new experience in media art. Most often, their experience was broadened through international cooperation and studying abroad. The paper analyzes the presentation of Ukrainian media art outside the country during 1993-2020 and distinguishes the main thematic areas of the artists' work. It examines how artists present and reveal the peculiarities of the Ukrainian worldview, aesthetics, and culture through the problematization of certain aspects and themes in their work. Specifically, among the principal topics which are problematized in the work of media artists are a sensory experience, limited sensory capabilities, gender issues, the Chernobyl tragedy, the development of utopian models of the city, and global communication. The leading themes of Ukrainian artists also include revolution and war. Notably, political and social sentiments determine the unique energy and vitality of contemporary Ukrainian art, create a revolutionary creative environment, and unite media artists in group art projects. It is concluded that by showing, exhibiting, and presenting them outside the country, artists shape the image of Ukrainian art in a global context.

TI  - Importance of community containment measures in combating the COVID-19 epidemic: from the perspective of urban planning
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To contain the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, unprecedented interventions, including city lockdown and community closure, have been implemented. However, most of the current studies focused on evaluation of the city lockdown, but paid limited attention to the impacts of the community containment measures within the city. This research addressed this important issue from the perspective of urban planning, based on the epidemic and remote sensing data of 194 communities of Wuhan. We found that the number of confirmed cases of communities is highly related to urban planning factors, e.g. area percentage of buildings and density of neighboring markets. These factors are relevant to the residents' activity patterns, which therefore impact the mode of virus transmission. Our research confirmed the effectiveness of the community-oriented control strategies, provided a valuable reference for other cities that are suffering from the epidemic, and exhibited new thoughts into future urban planning.

TI  - Assessment of land surface temperature dynamics over the Bharathapuzha River Basin, India
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic interventions have altered the natural environment and affected many of its physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Changes in land use-land cover (LULC) are one of the main drivers that alter the hydrologic cycle and cause significant impacts on local, regional, and even the global climate system. It is now widely recognised and accepted that climate change is one of the gravest problems that our planet Earth is facing at present. This study analyses the impact of LULC dynamics on the spatial and temporal variation of land surface temperature (LST) in an inter-state river basin, which also happens to be the largest river basin in the state of Kerala, India, viz. the Bharathapuzha river basin, during the period 1990-2017. LST time-series analysis (derived from Landsat) revealed that 98% of the river basin experienced LST less than 298 K in January 1990. Over time, along with changes in LULC, LST also increased; in 2017, about 7.82% of the river basin experienced LST greater than 312 K. A notable change in LULC that occurred during this period was the drastic increase in areas with high albedo. The seasonal curves of LST derived from MODIS data are strong evidence of the devastating impacts of change in LULC on LST and, in turn, on climate change. The major spatial and temporal components of change in LST in the study region were identified by principal component analysis (PCA). The results of this spatiotemporal analysis spread over a period of 28 years can be used for formulating sustainable development policies and mitigation strategies against extreme climatic events in the river basin.

TI  - Using the Red Band Difference Algorithm to Detect and Monitor a <i>Karenia</i> spp. Bloom Off the South Coast of Ireland, June 2019
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - During the months of May, June, July and August 2019 the Red Band Difference algorithm was tested over Irish waters to assess its suitability for the Irish harmful algal bloom alert system. Over the 4 weeks of June an extensive localised surface phytoplankton bloom formed in the Celtic Sea, south of Ireland. Satellite imagery from the Sentinel-3a's Ocean and Land Colour Instrument, processed using the Red Band Difference algorithm detected the bloom in surface shelf waters and helped monitor its movement. Daily satellite images indicated that the bloom appeared at the sea surface on the 2nd June 2019 and peaked in size and surface abundance in offshore shelf waters within 4 weeks, remnants remained at the surface into July. A particle tracking approach was used to replicate oceanic circulation patterns in the vicinity of the observed algal bloom and estimate its trajectory. The initial horizontal distribution of particles in the tracking model were based on a satellite imagery polygon of the bloom when it first appeared in surface waters. Good agreement was observed between satellite imagery of the bloom and the particle tracking model. In situ sampling efforts from a research cruise and the national inshore phytoplankton monitoring programme confirmed that Karenia mikimotoi was the causative organism of the bloom. This pilot study shows great potential to use the Red Band Difference algorithm in the existing Irish harmful algal bloom alert system. In addition, satellite ocean colour data combined with particle tracking model estimates can be a useful tool to monitor high biomass harmful algal bloom forming species, such as Karenia mikimotoi, in surface coastal waters around Ireland and elsewhere.

TI  - Effects of household-level attributes and agricultural land-use on deforestation patterns along a forest transition gradient in the Miombo landscapes, Zambia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dry forests in tropical and subtropical areas continue to experience high deforestation rates that affect households' dependence on forest resources. Little remains understood about the relationship between household factors and deforestation patterns in Zambia. We integrate remotely sensed data with surveys of 1123 households collected in the Miombo areas between 2017 and 2019 to better understand the effects of household attributes on regional deforestation patterns along a forest transition gradient.We found, in early-to-mid-transition, deforestation patterns systematically decreased further from settlements (homesteads), but this was reversed in regions with advanced forest transition. The socio-demographic attributes, land and non-land-based attributes, and location factors differently affected deforestation across provinces. Although agricultural land-use was significantly associated with deforestation, no distinct patterns emerged across distance categories or along the forest transition. Furthermore, increases in non-farm income reduced the likelihood of high deforestation, but the impact was not always significant across provinces.Our results indicate that economic effects of distance in Miombo areas complement the forest transition, but are not exclusively related to crop productivity. We assume that different aspects of livelihoods can explain the deforestation patterns in the Miombo areas. Thus, forest management should be regional-specific, such as improving access to financial incentives in North-Western, and reforestation and agroforestry in Copperbelt and the Eastern Province.

TI  - Optimal window period for mapping Parthenium weed in South Africa, using high temporal resolution imagery and the ExtraTrees classifier
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus) is one of the most noxious herbaceous weeds in the world with adverse impacts on among others animal and human health, crop production, the environment, local as well as national economies. To optimize Parthenium mitigation, it is necessary to accurately monitor its spread using earth observation data. However, one of the challenges of mapping Parthenium weed is that its spectral response is similar to that of surrounding herbaceous plant species, resulting in low classification accuracies. Due to variability in its phenological characteristics and associated species, determining differences within the growing season may optimize the discrimination and subsequent mapping of the Parthenium weed. However, determination of the window(s) with the most prominent variability has been overlooked in past studies. Furthermore, no specific algorithm has been determined to be efficient in finding such window(s). ExtraTrees (EXT), an underused classifier in earth observation studies, possess interesting properties for satellite image processing such as high speed and performance. In this regard, this study attempted to (1) determine the optimal window period for discriminating Parthenium weed from coexisting plant species and (2) to compare the performance of EXT and the random forest (RF) algorithms. Results showed that the beginning of February was the optimal period for mapping Parthenium weed, with overall accuracy of 88.1%. EXT outperformed RF for most of the dates. This study lays the foundation for optimizing earth observation data derived models for characterizing invasive species, leveraging on the high temporal resolution of the new generation sensors.

TI  - Chemical composition and source attribution of sub-micrometre aerosol particles in the summertime Arctic lower troposphere
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol particles impact the Arctic climate system both directly and indirectly by modifying cloud properties, yet our understanding of their vertical distribution, chemical composition, mixing state, and sources in the summertime Arctic is incomplete. In situ vertical observations of particle properties in the high Arctic combined with modelling analysis on source attribution are in short supply, particularly during summer. We thus use airborne measurements of aerosol particle composition to demonstrate the strong contrast between particle sources and composition within and above the summertime Arctic boundary layer. In situ measurements from two complementary aerosol mass spectrometers, the Aircraft-based Laser Ablation Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (ALABAMA) and an Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS), are presented alongside black carbon measurements from an single particle soot photometer (SP2). Particle composition analysis was complemented by trace gas measurements, satellite data, and air mass history modelling to attribute particle properties to particle origin and air mass source regions. Particle composition above the summertime Arctic boundary layer was dominated by chemically aged particles, containing elemental carbon, nitrate, ammonium, sulfate, and organic matter. From our analysis, we conclude that the presence of these particles was driven by transport of aerosol and precursor gases from mid-latitudes to Arctic regions. Specifically, elevated concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, and organic matter coincided with time spent over vegetation fires in northern Canada. In parallel, those particles were largely present in high CO environments (> 90 ppb(v)). Additionally, we observed that the organic-to-sulfate ratio was enhanced with increasing influence from these fires. Besides vegetation fires, particle sources in mid-latitudes further include anthropogenic emissions in Europe, North America, and East Asia. The presence of particles in the Arctic lower free troposphere, particularly sulfate, correlated with time spent over populated and industrial areas in these regions. Further, the size distribution of free tropospheric particles containing elemental carbon and nitrate was shifted to larger diameters compared to particles present within the boundary layer. Moreover, our analysis suggests that organic matter, when present in the Arctic free troposphere, can partly be identified as low molecular weight dicarboxylic acids (oxalic, malonic, and succinic acid). Particles containing dicarboxylic acids were largely present when the residence time of air masses outside Arctic regions was high. In contrast,particle composition within the marine boundary layer was largely driven by Arctic regional processes. Air mass history modelling demonstrated that alongside primary sea spray particles, marine biogenic sources contributed to secondary aerosol formation via trimethylamine, methanesulfonic acid, sulfate, and other organic species. Our findings improve our knowledge of mid-latitude and Arctic regional sources that influence the vertical distribution of particle chemical composition and mixing state in the Arctic summer.

TI  - Laparoscopic inguinal lymph node dissection in carcinoma of the vulva: experience and intermediate results at one institution
T2  - SOUTHERN AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The goal of the study was to assess the feasibility of Laparoscopic Minimally Invasive Inguinal Lymph Node Dissection (L-MILND) for carcinoma of the vulva where sentinel lymph node biopsy could not be done. Laparoscopic Minimally Invasive Inguinal Lymph Node Dissection (L-MILND) is a procedure developed to decrease morbidity associated with inguinal lymphadenectomy while maintaining acceptable oncological outcomes. Initial experience and feasibility of this technique at the authors' institution is reported.Setting: Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital/Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University.Patients: Sixteen L-MILND performed in nine patients with T1b squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva from May 2016 to April 2020. This is a retrospective analysis of the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative characteristics.Results: The median age was 40 years (37-71 years). L-MILND's median duration and the radical wide local excision was 223 +/- 40 minutes (180 to 300 minutes). There were no intraoperative complications. The mean drain output per patient of both inguinal areas was 315 ml (50-990 ml). On average, drains were removed on day 6 (range 3-10 days). The mean number of nodes harvested was 5 (range 0-32 nodes). One patient had 1 positive node out of 32 harvested. The postoperative complications included: lymphoedema (1 groin, 6.25%), seroma (6 groins, 37.5%) and lymphorrhea (4 groins, 25.0%). Overall follow-up has been 3-50 (mean 28.3 months) months, and all patients were alive with no disease.Conclusion: The significant advantage of L-MILND appears to be the low rate of inguinal wound complications that may be associated with open procedures. This nevertheless comes at the expense of long operative times and seroma formation. This procedure is feasible and safe, though there is a need for large prospective studies with extended follow-up.

TI  - Self-calibration dense bundle adjustment of multi-view Worldview-3 basic images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Very high-resolution satellite images (VHRSIs) with improved spatial resolution provide unprecedented opportunities to explore the geometric and semantic information of the world. Accordingly, to compensate for the bias of exterior orientation parameters, bundle adjustment of VHRSIs is required. Owing to the sparse points, the bundle adjustment of a few VHRSIs omits high-frequency errors and attitude jitters; therefore, the rational function model (RFM) can achieve an accuracy comparable to that of a rigorous sensor model (RSM), despite the significant difference between the RSM and RFM. In this study, we provide insight into the role of RSM in modeling attitude jitters for the Worldview-3 basic imagery product. Penalized splines were proposed to model the attitude jitters. After correcting the photogrammetric refraction using Saastamoinen's model and light aberration, the RSM was built for agile satellites. The difference between RSM and RFM is consistent with attitude jitters, which is calculated using the penalized splines model and third-degree polyniomials. To fully explore the attitude jitters, a dense bundle adjustment was proposed to process 47 scenes of the Worldview-3 basic product imagery, which was provided by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory for the "Multi-View Stereo 3D Challenge." Pairwise feature matching and feature tracking were adopted to generate over 16 000 tie-points (TPs), which were detected in an average of 9.38 images. The bundle adjustment residuals with RFM exhibited distortions similar to those of the attitude jitter. The experiments verified that the bundle adjustment with RFM introduced significant errors triggered by attitude jitters, with a maximum of over 5.0 pixels. The bundle adjustment with RSM could eliminate significant errors caused by attitude jitters and reduce the root mean square errors (RMSEs) from 1.12 pixels to 0.61 pixels. However, the basic product imagery of Worldview-3 exhibited errors in the interior orientation parameters. After analyzing the physical meanings of bias compensation, a self-calibration model was proposed. After comparing the shift compensation, affine compensation, self-calibration, temporal self-calibration, second-degree self-calibration, and second-degree polynomial models, the dense bundle adjustment with self-calibration was suggested because it could compensate for errors in the interior orientation parameters (IOPs) and obtain an accuracy similar to that of high-degree models. Thus, a selfcalibration dense bundle adjustment with RSM compensates for the attitude jitters and errors in the IOPs, and achieves a remarkable accuracy of 0.49 pixels in the image coordinates.

TI  - Intraoperative radiotherapy boost as part of breast-conservation therapy for breast cancer: a single-institution retrospective analysis
T2  - STRAHLENTHERAPIE UND ONKOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background There are currently no data from randomized controlled trials on the use of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) as a tumor bed boost as part of a breast-conservation approach for breast cancer. This study retrospectively reviewed the safety and efficacy of IORT as a boost treatment at a tertiary cancer center. Methods From 2015 to 2019, patients underwent breast-conserving surgery with axillary lymph node staging and a single dose of 20 Gy IORT with 50-kV photons, followed by whole-breast irradiation (WBI) and adjuvant systemic therapy (if applicable). Patients were followed for assessment of acute and late toxicities (using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0) at 3-6-month intervals. Outcomes included ipsilateral (IBTR) and contralateral breast progression-free survival (CBE), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and overall survival (OS). Results Median follow-up for the 214 patients was 28 (range 2-59) months. Most patients had T1 disease (n = 124) and were clinically node negative. Only few patients had high-grade and/or triple-negative disease. The vast majority of patients underwent sentinel node biopsy, and 32 (15%) required re-resection for initially positive margins. Finally, all tumor bed margins were clear. Nine (4.2%) and 48 (22.4%) patients underwent neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy, respectively. WBI was predominantly performed as conventionally fractionated WBI (n = 187, 87.4%), and the median time from BCS to WBI was 54.5 days. IORT was delivered with a single dose of 20 Gy. The median WBI dose was 50 Gy (range 29.4-50.4 Gy). No patients experienced grade 4 events; acute grade 3 toxicities were limited to 17 (8%) cases of radiation dermatitis. Postoperative toxicities were mild. After WBI only one case of late grade >= 2 events was reported. There were two recurrences in the tumor bed and one contralateral breast event. Conclusion This investigation provides additional preliminary data supporting the using of IORT in the boost setting and corroborates the existing literature. These encouraging results should be prospectively validated by the eventual publication of randomized studies such as TARGIT-B.

TI  - Determining the impacts of climate change and urban expansion on net primary productivity using the spatio-temporal fusion of remote sensing data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change (CLC) and urban expansion (URE) have profoundly altered the terrestrial net primary productivity (NPP). Many studies have determined the effects of CLC and URE on the NPP. However, these studies were conducted at low resolutions (250-1000 m), making it difficult to detect many smaller new urban lands, and thus potentially underestimating the contribution of URE. To accurately determine the contributions of CLC and URE to the NPP, this study takes Beijing as an example and uses an Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) to fuse the spatial resolution of the Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the temporal resolution of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI to generate a new NDVI with a high spatio-temporal resolution. Compared with the Landsat NDVI, the NDVI fused by the ESTARFM is found to be reliable. The fused NDVI was then inputted into the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model to generate the NPP with a high spatio-temporal resolution, namely, the 30-m NPP. Compared with the 250-m NPP generated by directly inputting the MODIS NDVI into the CASA model, the 30-m NPP as a new ecological indicator is more accurate than the 250-m NPP. Due to the high resolution of the 30-m NPP and its increased ability to detect more new urban lands, the total loss of the 30-m NPP caused by URE is much higher than that of the 250-m NPP. For the same reason, especially in rapidly urbanized areas, the contribution ratio of URE to the 30-m NPP is much higher than that to the 250-m NPP. Moreover, in natural vegetation cover areas, CLC, which is measured by the interannual changes in temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation, is the leading factor of the change in the NPP. However, within the urban areas, residual factors other than CLC and URE, such as the introduction of exotic high-productivity vegetation, irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, dominate the change in the NPP. The results of this study are expected to contribute to a deeper understanding of the influences of CLC and URE on terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycles and provide an important theoretical reference for urban planning.

TI  - Response of net primary productivity to grassland phenological changes in Xinjiang, China
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the relationship between net primary productivity (NPP) and grassland phenology is important for an in-depth understanding of the impact of climate change on ecosystems. In this study, the NPP of grassland in Xinjiang, China, was simulated using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) grassland phenological (MCD12Q2) data to study trends in phenological metrics, grassland NPP, and the relations between these factors from 2001-2014. The results revealed advancement of the start of the growing season (SOS) for grassland in most regions (55.2%) in Xinjiang. The percentage of grassland area in which the end of the growing season (EOS) was delayed (50.9%) was generally the same as that in which the EOS was advanced (49.1%). The percentage of grassland area with an increase in the length of the growing season (LOS) for the grassland area (54.6%) was greater than that with a decrease in the LOS (45.4%). The percentage of grassland area with an increase in NPP (61.6%) was greater than that with a decrease in NPP (38.4%). Warmer regions featured an earlier SOS and a later EOS and thus a longer LOS. Regions with higher precipitation exhibited a later SOS and an earlier EOS and thus a shorter LOS. In most regions, the SOS was earlier, and spring NPP was higher. A linear statistical analysis showed that at various humidity (K) levels, grassland NPP in all regions initially increased but then decreased with increasing LOS. At higher levels of K when NPP gradually increased, the LOS gradually decreased.

TI  - Maximum entropy-based forest fire likelihood mapping: analysing the trends, distribution, and drivers of forest fires in Sikkim Himalaya
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent episodes of forest fires in Brazil and Australia of 2019 are tragic reminders of the hazards of forest fire. Globally incidents of forest fire events are on the rise due to human encroachment into the wilderness and climate change. Sikkim with a forest cover of more than 47%, suffers seasonal instances of frequent forest fire during the dry winter months. To address this issue, a GIS-aided and MaxEnt machine learning-based forest fire prediction map has been prepared using a forest fire inventory database and maps of environmental features. The study indicates that amongst the environmental features, climatic conditions and proximity to roads are the major determinants of forest fire. Model validation criteria like ROC curve, correlation coefficient, and Cohen's Kappa show a good predictive ability (AUC = 0.95, COR = 0.81, kappa = 0.78). The outcomes of this study in the form of a forest fire prediction map can aid the stakeholders of the forest in taking informed mitigation measures.

TI  - MODIS Does Not Capture the Spatial Heterogeneity of Snow Cover Induced by Solar Radiation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating snowmelt in semi-arid mountain ranges is an important but challenging task, due to the large spatial variability of the snow cover and scarcity of field observations. Adding solar radiation as snowmelt predictor within empirical snow models is often done to account for topographically induced variations in melt rates. This study examines the added value of including different treatments of solar radiation within empirical snowmelt models and benchmarks their performance against MODIS snow cover area (SCA) maps over the 2003-2016 period. Three spatially distributed, enhanced temperature index models that, respectively, include the potential clear-sky direct radiation, the incoming solar radiation and net solar radiation were compared with a classical temperature-index (TI) model to simulate snowmelt, SWE and SCA within the Rheraya basin in the Moroccan High Atlas Range. Enhanced models, particularly that which includes net solar radiation, were found to better explain the observed SCA variability compared to the TI model. However, differences in model performance in simulating basin wide SWE and SCA were small. This occurs because topographically induced variations in melt rates simulated by the enhanced models tend to average out, a situation favored by the rather uniform distribution of slope aspects in the basin. While the enhanced models simulated more heterogeneous snow cover conditions, aggregating the simulated SCA from the 100 m model resolution towards the MODIS resolution (500 m) suppresses key spatial variability related to solar radiation, which attenuates the differences between the TI and the radiative models. Our findings call for caution when using MODIS for calibration and validation of spatially distributed snow models.

TI  - Deformation monitoring and failure mode research of mining-induced Jianshanying landslide in karst mountain area, China with ALOS/PALSAR-2 images
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Jianshanying landslide in Guizhou province, China, is a typical mining-induced landslide with its complex formation in karst mountainous area. However, the spatiotemporal deformation characteristics and failure mechanism are still unknown. In this paper, the surface deformation time series from 2017 to 2020 is firstly estimated by combining multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry and improved offset-tracking methods to overcome the difficulties caused by the large gradient surface deformation and surface material changes. Then, the spatiotemporal characteristics of Jianshanying landslide is analyzed in terms of line-of-sight (LOS) deformation with stacking InSAR method and two-dimensional (2D) deformation with improved SAR offset-tracking method. And the different deformation features between sliding body and surrounding areas are uncovered. Accordingly, we point out the "three-section" surface deformation model. We further analyze the deformation time series by considering the joint effects of rainfall and underground mining. Finally, we conceptualize the landslide failure mode for the Jianshanying landslide, which can be extended to the similar landslide in karst mountainous areas of southwestern China.

TI  - To map or not to map the cN0 neck: Impact of sentinel lymph node biopsy in canine head and neck tumours
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumour stage is a prognostic indicator for canine malignant head and neck tumours (MHNT). However, consensus is lacking on nodal staging in the absence of clinically apparent nodal disease (cN0 neck). This prospective observational study aims to determine the diagnostic accuracy of radiopharmaceutical and blue dye for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), to assess the correspondence between sentinel lymph node (SLN) and clinically expected regional lymph node (RLN) and the impact on staging of the procedure in dogs with MHNT and cN0 neck. Twenty-three dogs with MHNT and cN0 neck underwent tumour excision and SLNB guided by preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative gamma-probe and blue dye. Diagnostic performances and detection rate were calculated. Correspondence between SLN and RLN, number of nodes excised, histopathological status of the SLN and complications related to the procedure were recorded. The mapping technique identified at least one SLN in 19/23 dogs, with a detection rate of 83%. The SLN did not correspond to the RLN in 52% of dogs. Multiple nodes were removed in 61% of dogs. At histopathology, eight (42%) dogs had SLN+, of which four differed from the RLN. Only minor self-limiting complications occurred in five (22%) dogs. Radiopharmaceutical and blue dye guidance is accurate (sensitivity 88.9%; specificity 100%) for SLNB in dogs with MHNT and cN0 and allowed the extirpation of unpredictable and/or multiple SLN with minimal morbidity. Incorporation of SLNB in the management of MHNT is desirable to correctly stage the cN0 neck, owing the unpredictability of the lymphatic drainage.

TI  - Assessment of the relative influences of long-range transport, fossil fuel and biomass burning from aerosol pollution under restricted anthropogenic emissions: A national scenario in India
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was conducted with the purpose to understand the spatial heterogeneity and the inter-state variability of the relative contributions of the long-range transport, fossil fuel and biomass burning on the atmospheric aerosol pollution across India. Satellite and reanalysis datasets (MODIS and MERRA-2) were used to study the total aerosol and its differential components over each of the Indian states under the limited anthropogenic emission condition (April 2020) and compared with the normal condition (April 2015-2019). We observed that the changes in aerosol pollution with the changes in sources from normal to limited anthropogenic activities were not homogeneous across the country. Based on such heterogeneity in "aerosol source-aerosol pollution" relationship, we divided the entire country in four different groups. The states under Group 1 (most of Indo-Gangetic Plain, north-eastern and parts of western and southern India) are found to be mostly influenced by the local/regional anthropogenic sources. The sources other than the biomass burning are the most influential for the aerosol pollution over Group 2 states (Punjab, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Tripura). Both the biomass burning and long range transport are the major factors for Group 3 state, Telangana. Rest of the states (Group 4) exhibit the relative dominance of the regional and trans-boundary transport over local anthropogenic emissions. Relative influences of fossil fuel and biomass burning over each other and how it changed from the normal to limited activities have also been quantified for each of the states of different groups. The results from the study would be an input of immense importance for the policy makers building state-wise strategies in air pollution control in India.

TI  - Semi-field assessment of the Gravid <i>Aedes</i> Trap (GAT) with the aim of controlling <i>Aedes</i> (<i>Stegomyia</i>) <i>aegypti</i> populations
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the main vector of arboviroses and current approaches to control this vector are not sufficiently effective. Adult traps, such as the BG-Sentinel (BGS), have been successfully used for mosquito surveillance and can also suppress vector populations. A new "passive" trap for gravid Ae. aegypti (Gravid Aedes Trap-GAT) has been shown efficient for Aedes collection and suppress Ae. albopictus populations using mass trapping techniques. Here the GAT was evaluated for the first time as a new tool to control Ae. aegypti in semi-field conditions using simulated outdoor environments (SOE). Two identical large screened chambers inside of a SOE containing different numbers and sizes of artificial breeding sites were used to assess the trapping efficiency of the GAT. One hundred mosquitoes were released into the chambers, and recapture rates evaluated after 48h. The parity status of the captured mosquitoes was also recorded. The number of eggs laid, and breeding productivity were also monitored when using different numbers and sizes of breeding sites. The BGS trap was used here as a control (gold standard) trap to compare capture rates to those of the GAT. The GAT recaptured between 50-65% of the mosquitoes independent of the number and sizes of the breeding sites in the SOEs, whereas the BGS recaptured 60-82% of the females. Both traps showed similar results regarding to the parity status of recaptured mosquitoes. Our results confirmed the effectiveness of GAT for the capture of adult female Ae. aegypti in simulated field environments. The BGS trap recaptured gravid Ae. aegypti before egg-laying in different sizes and number of breading sites, whereas the oviposition activity occurred prior to recapture mosquitoes in the GAT. Based on the results, we believe that GAT is a promising candidate for mass-trapping intervention in urban settings, but a source reduction intervention should be made prior trap deployment. Therefore, we suggest future field studies to confirm the use of GAT as a complementary tool in vector control activities.

AB  - PurposeKhan Jahan Ali (KJA) Bridge was constructed to promote industrial and commercial activity and improve economic and employment activity for local people. This study assessed the post-socioeconomic and environmental impacts of KJA Bridge on the inhabitants living adjacent to 2 Km from the bridge. As there is a slum adjacent to the bridge, the bridge has impacted much on the improvement of the social economic condition and lifestyle of the slum people.Design/methodology/approachThe study approached a questionnaire-based field survey data collection through interviewing the people in the surrounding areas. To assess the environmental impacts, land cover change (LCC), carbon emissions and land surface temperature (LST) data were derived from Landsat images and processed in geospatial environment.FindingsThe study suggests that after bridge construction, 84% people have new jobs and about 87% people's income level has been increased. As a tourist spot, the bridge served employment opportunities for the 12% of the inhabitants. About 83% house structures have been improved, where the percentages of pucca and semi-pucca houses increased by 11% and 23%, respectively. The frequency of school-going children and literacy rate also increased. Despite all the socioeconomic development, 7.48% agricultural, 9.75% vegetation, 1.74% waterbodies were declined. Net carbon emissions increased to 13,432.39 tons from 3,323.46 tons; average LST increased from 25.750 to 32.550 degrees C after the bridge construction.Originality/valueThis study focused on descriptive statistical analysis and portrayed the impact of the bridge on social, economic and environment from a micro point of view.

TI  - Sustainable forest management is vital for the persistence of sun bear<i> Helarctos</i><i> malayanus</i> populations in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With large mammals in Southeast Asia facing a host of threats such as forest loss and poaching, one important strategy in supporting conservation interventions is to understand local trends in species distributions. In Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, selective logging has both historically (conventional selective logging) and currently (reduced impact logging) impacted large areas of forest. Furthermore, the impact of poaching remains difficult to assess, potentially leading forest managers to underestimate its effects on large mammals. Our study focused on the sun bear (Helarctos malayanus), a forest dependent species threatened by poaching across its range. We used camera trap data collected in 2014 and 2018 from 127 camera trap stations in two adjacent forest blocks in Sabah. One of these blocks is a complex of degraded protected areas (formerly logged using conventional selective logging), interspersed with two areas of forest plantations (Tangkulap), while the other block is an active production forest logged using reduced impact logging techniques (Deramakot). We ran single-season occupancy models using covariates representing both habitat quality and poaching pressure to understand what factors most influenced sun bear habitat use and projected their distribution over the study area. We found that sun bear habitat selection was most strongly influenced by a dynamic covariate representing habitat quality, Normalised Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) from Landsat satellite data. Sun bear occupancy marginally increased from 2014 to 2018, in response to forest regeneration in Deramakot and Tangkulap. Overall, sun bear distribution was higher in the reduced impact logged and sustainably managed Deramakot compared to Tangkulap. Our proxies for poaching pressure had very minor effects on sun bear occupancy, suggesting that the population in this study area may not be subject to intense poaching. We highlight that sun bear populations can in fact better persist in well-managed production forests as compared to degraded protected areas.

TI  - Relationship between multi-scale climate factors and performance of ecological engineering on the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term "Grain-to-Green Program" (GGP) on China's Loess Plateau is a major global ecological engineering project which has significantly boosted vegetation renewal. Some studies have found that the rate of restoration is quite rapid during the implementation of ecological engineering, however, the influence of multi-scale climatic conditions on the performance of ecological engineering is unclear. In this study, multiple sources of remote sensing data were used to estimate the dynamics of vegetation structural and functional indicators, water-related local climatic factors, and atmospheric circulation factors. These datasets were also used to detect possible causes for vegetation restoration on the Loess Plateau over the past 20 years. The results show that widespread increases in rates of normalized difference vegetation indexes (NDVI), leaf area indexes (LAI), gross primary production (GPP), and aboveground biomass carbon (ABC) during 2000-2016 were significantly higher than before 2000. GPP was significantly correlated with rainfall and surface runoff on a monthly scale, and there were significant positive correlations between GPP and atmospheric circulation. Our results demonstrate that both vegetation structural and functional indicators rapidly increase, and ecological engineering greatly accelerated vegetation restoration after 2000. Local climatic conditions and atmospheric circulation patterns enhance vegetation growth and impact of ecological engineering.

TI  - A new approach of deep neural computing for spatial prediction of wildfire danger at tropical climate areas
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire is an environmental hazard that has both local and global effects, causing economic losses and various severe environmental problems. Due to the adverse effects of climate changes and anthropogenic activities, wildfire is anticipated more frequent and extreme; therefore, new and more efficient tools for forest fire prevention and control are essential. This study proposes a new deep neural computing approach for spatial prediction of wildfire in a tropical climate area. For this purpose, deep neural computing (Deep-NC) with a structure of 3 hidden layers was proposed. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function was adopted to infer wildfire dangers from the input factors. To search and optimize the weights of the model, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and Adadelta optimizers were employed. Also, this study has established a Geographic Information System (GIS) database for Gia Lai province (Vietnam) to train and verify the newly developed deep computing approach. The twelve ignition factors, namely, slope, aspect, elevation, curvature, land use, NVDI, NDWI, NDMI, temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and rainfall, have been used to characterize the study area with respect to forest fire susceptibility. According to experimental results, the Adam optimized Deep-NC model delivered the highest predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.894, Kappa = 0.63). Accordingly, this model has been employed to establish a forest fire susceptibility map for Gia Lai province. The proposed Deep-NC model and the newly constructed forest fire susceptibility map can help local authorities in land use planning and hazard mitigation/prevention.

TI  - Estimating the aboveground biomass of coniferous forest in Northeast China using spectral variables, land surface temperature and soil moisture
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As a crucial indicator of forest growth and quality, estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) plays a key role in monitoring the global carbon cycle and forest health assessments. Novel methods and applications in remote sensing technology can greatly reduce the investigation time and cost and therefore have the potential to efficiently estimate AGB. Random forest (RF), combined with remote sensing images, is a popular machine learning method that has been widely used for AGB estimation. However, the accuracy of the ordinary linear variable selection method in the AGB estimation of coniferous forests is challenging due to the complexity of these forest biomes. In this study, spectral variables (spectral reflectance and vegetation index), land surface temperature (LST) and soil moisture were extracted from the operational land imager (OLI) and thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) of Landsat 8, and optimized RF regressions were established to estimate the AGB of coniferous forests in the Wangyedian forest farm, Inner Mongolia, Northeast China. We applied one linear (Pearson correlation coefficient (PC)) and four nonlinear (Kendall's tau coefficient (KC), Spearman coefficient (SC), distance correlation coefficient (DC) and the importance index) indices to select variables and establish optimized RF regressions for AGB estimation. The results showed that all the nonlinear indices provided significantly lower estimation errors than the linear index, in which the minimum root mean square error (RMSE) of 40.92 Mg/ha was obtained by the importance index in the nonlinear indices. In addition, the inclusion of LST and soil moisture significantly improved AGB estimation. The RMSE of the models constructed through the five indices decreased by 12.93%, 7.31%, 8.33%, 6.28% and 10.78%, respectively, following the application of the LST variable. In particular, when LST and soil moisture were both added into the model, the RMSE decreased by 31.47%. This study demonstrates that combining the nonlinear variable selection method with optimized RF regression can improve the efficiency of AGB estimation to support regional forest resource management and monitoring.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Detection and analysis of tick-borne infections in communal dogs of northwest Zimbabwe
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN VETERINARY ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) may serve as a reservoir or a sentinel for infectious disease pathogens that can affect human and wildlife health. To understand the role of tick-borne diseases in rural and lesser developed regions, we investigated the prevalence of several tick-borne pathogens in communal dogs of Zimbabwe. Blood samples from 225 dogs in northwest Zimbabwe were assessed by serology for Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi, and 241 samples were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Ehrlichia. There was a high seroprevalence (73%) of E. canis-specific antibodies in domestic dogs in northwest Zimbabwe, but follow up analyses via PCR and genetic sequencing indicated only 7.5% of the canines were actively infected with the organism. Whilst indicating that an organism serologically related to E. canis is likely present in the region, this data also shows that the organism is currently present in a relative minority of the domestic dogs in the region. Its presence as evidenced by both serologic and PCR analysis is significant because of the 'one health' paradigm, where humans and wildlife may be affected by the exposure to this pathogen in domestic dogs.

TI  - A review on deep learning techniques for cloud detection methodologies and challenges
T2  - SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Cloud detection (CD) with deep learning (DL) algorithms has been greatly developed in the applications involving the predictions of extreme weather and climate. In this review, the different conventional CD methods based on threshold, time differentiation, machine learning, and the intelligent algorithms including convolution neural networks (CNN), simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC), and semantic segmentation algorithms (SSAs) are introduced in detail, and, especially, the majority of CD publications employing the advanced and prevalent DL algorithms during the last decade are summarized and analyzed. First, in terms of the detection for different types of clouds, we meticulously compare the labels, scenarios and volumes of three popular CD datasets and put forward further the constructive recommendations about the cloud images selection, multi-bands images preprocessing, and truth labels combination for creating similar datasets. Subsequently, the structures, detection accuracies, and operating speeds of several different CD network models comprising the fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs), U-Net, SegNet, pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet), as well as the associated derivatives are conducted elaborately to explore the comprehensively optimal performance for CD. In addition, aiming at expanding the applications in the resource-limited space-borne environment, we conclude the mainstream compression strategies of a number of different lightweight networks. Finally, the various limitations constraining the performance of the existing state-of-the-art DL CD methods and the corresponding development tendency are presented, which, expectantly, could be referential for the following researches.

TI  - Country-scale spatio-temporal monitoring of soil erosion in Iran using the G2 model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was the spatial and temporal monitoring of soil erosion patterns in Iran. The G2 model was used, as an appropriate tool to provide the required month-time step country-wide soil loss maps and statistical outputs. The input parameters were derived with field surveys and remote sensing imagery (MODIS, SRTM, SPOT, and Sentinel-2 scenes). An innovation for G2 was the consideration of the snow cover effect on the rainfall erosivity. It was also the first time G2 was used to map such a big country like Iran on a country scale. The mean annual soil erosion in Iran was found to be 16.5 t ha(-1), which is equal to about 2.7 billion tons of soil loss. In spatial terms, the highest soil loss values were found in the north, west and southwest part of Iran, in the steep slopes in Alborz and Zagros mountains. In temporal terms, the highest and lowest monthly erosion values of 3.2 and 0.09 t ha(-1) correspond to January and July, respectively.

TI  - Evapotranspiration Intensification Over Unchanged Temperate Vegetation in the Baltic Countries Is Being Driven by Climate Shifts
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Y Shifts in climate driven by anthropogenic land use and land cover change are expected to alter various land-atmosphere interactions. Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of these processes and plays a fundamental role in the hydrologic cycle. Using gridded reanalysis and remote sensing data, we investigated the spatiotemporal trends of precipitation, temperature, and ET for areas in the Baltic countries Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia where the land cover type had not changed from 2000 to 2018. We focused on ET but investigated the spatiotemporal trends for the three variables at monthly, seasonal, and annual time scales during this period to quantify trade-offs among months and seasons. We used the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope to calculate the trends and rate of change for the three variables. Although precipitation showed fewer statistically significant increasing and decreasing trends due to its high variability, temperature showed only increasing trends. The trends were concentrated in late spring (May, +0.14 degrees C annually), summer (June and August, +0.10 degrees C), and early autumn (September, +0.13 degrees C). For unchanged forest and cropland areas, we found no statistically significant ET trends. However, Sen's slope indicated increasing ET in April, May, June, and September for forest areas and in May and June for cropland. Our results indicate that during the study period, the temperature changes may have lengthened the growing season, which affected the ET patterns of forest and cropland areas. The results also provide important insights into the regional water balance and complement the findings of other studies.

T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN), Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were applied for rainfall-runoff modeling of the Gilgel Abay catchment, Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia. Daily precipitations from satellite sources and rain gauge stations and outlet discharge were used. The dominant inputs were selected by non-linear sensitivity analysis. The study was conducted in two stages. First, single models for each data source with input fusion were trained. Second, ensemble runoff modeling using rainfall data fusion from only satellite products (strategy 1) and satellite and gauge (strategy 2) was conducted by Simple Average (SA), Weighted Average (WA), and Neural Network Ensemble (NNE) methods. NNE method using input fusion of strategy 2 improved performance of the best single satellite model up to 14.5% and a single gauge model up to 8% in the validation. Strategy 2 input data fusion ensemble rainfall-runoff modeling indicated substantial improvement over satellite data-based runoff modeling. This could be due to the bias correction ability of gauge rainfall over satellite rainfall products. Overall, results showed that ensemble modeling of input fusion from multiple source satellite rainfall products is a promising option for accurate modeling of the rainfall-runoff process for ungagged or sparsely gauged catchments.

TI  - Potential impact of the extensive oil spill on primary productivity in the Red Sea waters
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Red Sea is one of the world's major strategic shipping routes for crude oil transportation. Accidental spills of crude oil into the environmentally sensitive marine environments are known to impact the marine life. However, studies on direct assessment of oil spill on marine ecosystem, in particular on the primary productivity and biooptical parameters in the Red Sea waters were poorly constrained owing to lack of sustained observations. Thus, in this study, an attempt has been made to use high spatial and temporal resolution of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations to monitor the oil spill explosion occurred on October 11, 2019, and its impact on the chlorophyll -a (Chl-a) concentrations. We noticed a significant increase in concentrations of Chl-a on the following day of oil spill. These changes are accounted for and are influenced by hydrocarbons along the track of oil spill. Our findings suggest that both wind speed and high Ekman pumping velocity support the upwelling of nutrient-rich water from subsurface, which facilitated the growth of phytoplankton and thus the high Chl-a in the oil spill areas.

TI  - Miscarriage matters: the epidemiological, physical, psychological, and economic costs of early pregnancy loss
T2  - LANCET
M3  - Review
AB  - Miscarriage is generally defined as the loss of a pregnancy before viability. An estimated 23 million miscarriages occur every year worldwide, translating to 44 pregnancy losses each minute. The pooled risk of miscarriage is 15.3% (95% CI 12.5-18.7%) of all recognised pregnancies. The population prevalence of women who have had one miscarriage is 10.8% (10.3-11.4%), two miscarriages is 1.9% (1.8-2.1%), and three or more miscarriages is 0.7% (0.5-0.8%). Risk factors for miscarriage include very young or older female age (younger than 20 years and older than 35 years), older male age (older than 40 years), very low or very high body-mass index, Black ethnicity, previous miscarriages, smoking, alcohol, stress, working night shifts, air pollution, and exposure to pesticides. The consequences of miscarriage are both physical, such as bleeding or infection, and psychological. Psychological consequences include increases in the risk of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicide. Miscarriage, and especially recurrent miscarriage, is also a sentinel risk marker for obstetric complications, including preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, placental abruption, and stillbirth in future pregnancies, and a predictor of longer-term health problems, such as cardiovascular disease and venous thromboembolism. The costs of miscarriage affect individuals, health-care systems, and society. The short-term national economic cost of miscarriage is estimated to be 471 pound million per year in the UK. As recurrent miscarriage is a sentinel marker for various obstetric risks in future pregnancies, women should receive care in preconception and obstetric clinics specialising in patients at high risk. As psychological morbidity is common after pregnancy loss, effective screening instruments and treatment options for mental health consequences of miscarriage need to be available. We recommend that miscarriage data are gathered and reported to facilitate comparison of rates among countries, to accelerate research, and to improve patient care and policy development.

TI  - Analysis of the New Zealand's Taranaki regional wave climate using high-resolution modelling
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the regional wave climate is essential for engineering applications. The last two decades have not been included in assessments of the wave climate of New Zealand's Taranaki region, where the country exploits offshore oil and gas. To make up for this lack of assessment, we carried out a high-resolution long-term (1979-2018) wave hindcast and examined several aspects of the climate in the region. The hindcast data validation against buoy and satellite data showed good agreement and suitability for wave climate analysis. Seasonal wave distributions reveal a bi-modal pattern, composed of (1) more energetic and long period (13-15 s) westerly-southwesterly swells; and (2) shorter-period (similar to 8 s) southwesterly wind-seas. These signatures result from the region's high exposure to swells generated by persistent strong winds blowing over long fetches in the Southern Ocean, and to local storm-associated wind-seas, respectively. The largest waves are found offshore, with mean H-s value reaching 2.83 m, 90th percentile 4.3 m, 99th percentile 6.1 m, and maximum 10.8 m. Storm wave monthly climatologies show that storm peaks are largest in the austral autumn, especially in May, while the number of events is the largest in July. Trends in H-s statistics reveal an increase over the past 40 years, with higher rates at higher percentiles. Storm peaks have also increased, by up to 8 cm/decade, whereas the number of storm events has decreased. In agreement with previous work, we found relationships between H-s and climate patterns. Waves get larger in Taranaki waters during El Nino events, as a result of stronger southwesterly winds, and during negative Antarctic Oscillation phases, as westerly winds displace northward.

TI  - Integration of airborne geophysics and satellite imagery data for exploration targeting in porphyry Cu systems: Chahargonbad district, Iran
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL PROSPECTING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study illustrates the application of a geometric average integration of aeromagnetic, radiometric and satellite imagery data over a region prone to Cu-bearing mineralization at Chahargonbad area in Kerman province of Iran. Processing aeromagnetic, radiometric and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer satellite data can provide exploratory insights about favourable zones in association with porphyry-type ore occurrences, which can be synthesized through a combination of knowledge- and data-driven approaches as a geometric average and be represented in a mineral prospectivity map. The existence of known deposits in a prospect region can facilitate the investigation of significant exploratory footprints extracted from airborne data by calculating each indicator layer's weight by plotting a prediction-area curve accompanied by a concentration-area fractal curve. Among various indicators, the most important ones are determined based on derived weights from the prediction-area plots to be synthesized in a single Cu favorability map. To fulfil this aim, indicator layers from airborne geophysics (magmatic bodies, magnetic lineaments and potassium radiometry) and remote-sensing data (alterations such as argillic, phyllic, propylitic and iron oxide along with geological lineaments) were prepared and evaluated using the known porphyry Cu mineralization by the simultaneous plot of the concentration-area fractal model and the prediction-area curve to attain the ore prediction rate and the relevant occupied area of each map for weight assignment of indicators. The geometric average prospectivity model was applied to synthesize the leading indicators, and the result was compared with a multi-class index overlay map. This study's significance lies in improvement of the performance of the mineral prospectivity/potential mapping after running a geometric average by a higher ore prediction rate of 79%, which has occupied 21% of the area as potential zones for further mining investigations.

TI  - From land cover to land use: Applying random forest classifier to Landsat imagery for urban land-use change mapping
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The extensive record of Landsat imagery is commonly used to map urban land-cover and land-use change. Random forest (RF) classification was applied for mapping more detailed urban land-use and change categories than is typically attempted with Landsat data. Two dates of Landsat imagery (1990 and 2015) were utilized with surface reflectance, Vegetation-Impervious-Soil (V-I-S) fractions, grey-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) of V-I-S, and temporal variation of V-I-S inputs. GLCM V-I-S and temporal variation of Vegetation as input features of RF classifiers slightly improved accuracies of land use maps. A change map derived from an overlay analysis between the 2015 map and a Landsat-derived urban expansion map was more accurate than one from post-classification comparison of 1990 and 2015 maps. For the Taiwan study area, Transportation Corridor land use tended to lead conversion to Residential and Employment types in relatively undeveloped districts, and extensive urban land-use change occurred in peri-urban areas.

TI  - Utilization of hydroxyprogesterone caproate among pregnancies with live birth deliveries in the sentinel distributed database
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Makena(R) (hydroxyprogesterone caproate [HPC] injection) in February 2011 for reducing the risk of preterm birth (PTB) in women with a singleton pregnancy who had a history of singleton spontaneous PTB (sPTB). Makena was approved under accelerated approval and required a postmarketing study to verify its clinical benefits. However, the postmarketing trial (PROLONG) failed to verify Makena's clinical benefit to neonates and substantiate its effect on reducing the risk of recurrent PTB. This study examined the utilization of HPC, along with another progestogen (vaginal progesterone) used to reduce the risk of sPTB during pregnancy, to inform the landscape of HPC use in the United States. Methods We included pregnant women aged 10-54 years with a live birth delivery from 1 January, 2008 to 31 December, 2018 in the Sentinel Distributed Database (SDD). We examined the prevalence of injectable HPC (Makena and its generics), compounded HPC, and vaginal progesterone use during the second and third trimesters during the study period. We also assessed the proportion of these HPC-exposed pregnancies with obstetrical conditions of interest as potential reasons for use: (1) history of preterm delivery; (2) cervical shortening in the current pregnancy; and (3) preterm labor in the current pregnancy. Results We identified a total of 3,445,739 live-birth pregnancies (among 2.9 million women) between 2008 and 2018 in the SDD. Of these pregnancies, 6.5 per 1,000 pregnancies used injectable HPC, 2.3 per 1,000 pregnancies used compounded HPC, and 1.5 per 1,000 pregnancies used vaginal progesterone during the second and/or third trimesters. The yearly uptakeof pregnancies with injectable HPC use increased during the study period from 2.1 per 1,000 pregnancies in 2012 to 12.6 per 1,000 pregnancies in 2018; use of compounded HPC decreased from 3.3 per 1,000 pregnancies to 0.25 per 1,000 pregnancies over the same period. Of 16,524 pregnancies with injectable HPC use, 12,054 (73%) had at least one related obstetrical condition, including 6,439 (39%) with a recorded history of preterm delivery. In addition, 4,665 (28%) had a PTB recorded as the outcome for the current pregnancy. Conclusions We found modest use of HPC during the second and/or third trimesters among all live-birth pregnancies in SDD. The majority of pregnancies with injectable HPC use had at least one of three obstetrical indications of interest recorded before or during the pregnancy.

TI  - Adverse health manifestations in the hands of vibration exposed carpenters-a cross sectional study
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Despite EU regulatory standards, many workers suffer injury as a result of working with hand-held vibrating tools. Our aim of this study was to confirm whether carpenters, a highly exposed group, suffer more injuries to their hands than painters, a group assumed to be less exposed to vibration. Methods 193 carpenters (participation rate 100%) and 72 painters (participation rate 67%), all men, answered a questionnaire and underwent a clinical examination to identify manifestations of neural and vascular origin in the hands. Neurosensory affection was defined as having at least one symptom in the fingers/hands (impaired perception of touch, warmth, or cold, impaired dexterity, increased sensation of cold, numbness or tingling, or pain in the fingers/hands when cold) and at least one clinical finding (impaired perception of touch, warmth, cold, vibration, or two-point discrimination). Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Neurosensory affection was fulfilled for 31% of the carpenters and 17% of the painters, age-adjusted OR 3.3 (CI 1.6-7.0). Among carpenters with neurosensory affection 18% reported interference with daily life activities, the most common symptoms being increased sensation of cold, numbness and pain in the fingers/hands when cold, the most common clinical findings were impaired perception of touch and vibration. Neurosensory affection was found in 12% of young carpenters (<= 30 years old). No difference was found in the prevalence of white fingers between carpenters and painters. Conclusions Carpenters showed more symptoms and clinical findings of neurosensory affection than painters, probably due to vibration exposure. Also young carpenters showed signs of neurosensory affection, which indicates that under current conditions workers at these companies are not protected against injury. This underlines the importance of reducing exposure to vibration and conducting regular medical check-ups to detect early signs of neural and vascular manifestations indicating hand-arm vibration injuries. Special attention should be given to symptoms of increased sensation of cold, pain in the fingers when cold, and numbness, as these were the most common initiating ones, and should be addressed as early as possible in the preventive sentinel process. It is also important to test clinically for small- and large-fibre neuropathy, as the individual may be unaware of any pathology.

TI  - Feeling a little bit blue for not finding the right blue
T2  - REVUE FRANCAISE D ALLERGOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - In medicine, blue dyes are widely used for lymphatic mapping and biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with malignant tumors. Three dyes are used for this purpose, namely patent blue, isosulfan blue and methylene blue. They are also used to stain tissues for chromoendoscopy. Reports of anaphylactic reactions to blue dyes are increasing. The allergological work-up is based mainly on history. In the case of perioperative anaphylaxis, it relies on a thouroughly review of the perioperative record. The incorrect identification of the blue dye in the peroperative record will lead to an incorrect diagnosis which could cause serious consequences for patients in case of re-exposure. We describe here two cases of patients who presented peroperative anaphylactic shocks. Both of them had the wrong dye identified in their perioperative record. (C) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Long-term trends in air quality in major cities in the UK and India: a view from space
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Air quality networks in cities can be costly and inconsistent and typically monitor a few pollutants. Space-based instruments provide global coverage spanning more than a decade to determine trends in air quality, augmenting surface networks. Here we target cities in the UK (London and Birmingham) and India (Delhi and Kanpur) and use observations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), ammonia (NH3) from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), formaldehyde (HCHO) from OMI as a proxy for non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), and aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for PM2.5. We assess the skill of these products at reproducing monthly variability in surface concentrations of air pollutants where available. We find temporal consistency between column and surface NO2 in cities in the UK and India (R = 0.5-0.7) and NH3 at two of three rural sites in the UK (R = 0.5-0.7) but not between AOD and surface PM2.5 (R < 0.4). MODIS AOD is consistent with AERONET at sites in the UK and India (R >= 0.8) and reproduces a significant decline in surface PM2.5 in London (2.7% a(-1)) and Birmingham (3.7% a(-1)) since 2009. We derive long-term trends in the four cities for 2005-2018 from OMI and MODIS and for 2008-2018 from IASI. Trends of all pollutants are positive in Delhi, suggesting no air quality improvements there, despite the roll-out of controls on industrial and transport sectors. Kanpur, identified by the WHO as the most polluted city in the world in 2018, experiences a significant and substantial (3.1% a(-1)) increase in PM2.5. The decline of NO2, NH3, and PM2.5 in London and Birmingham is likely due in large part to emissions controls on vehicles. Trends are significant only for NO2 and PM2.5. Reactive NMVOCs decline in Birmingham, but the trend is not significant. There is a recent (2012-2018) steep (> 9% a(-1)) increase in reactive NMVOCs in London. The cause for this rapid increase is uncertain but may reflect the increased contribution of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from household products, the food and beverage industry, and domestic wood burning, with implications for the formation of ozone in a VOC-limited city.

M3  - Article
AB  - National-based prospective surveillance of all-age patients with acute diarrhea was conducted in China between 20092018. Here we report the etiological, epidemiological, and clinical features of the 152,792 eligible patients enrolled in this analysis. Rotavirus A and norovirus are the two leading viral pathogens detected in the patients, followed by adenovirus and astrovirus. Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli and nontyphoidal Salmonella are the two leading bacterial pathogens, followed by Shigella and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Patients aged <5 years had higher overall positive rate of viral pathogens, while bacterial pathogens were more common in patients aged 1845 years. A joinpoint analysis revealed the age-specific positivity rate and how this varied for individual pathogens. Our findings fill crucial gaps of how the distributions of enteropathogens change across China in patients with diarrhea. This allows enhanced identification of the predominant diarrheal pathogen candidates for diagnosis in clinical practice and more targeted application of prevention and control measures. Diarrhoea is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in China. Here, the authors present results from a large sentinel surveillance scheme from 217 hospitals in all 31 provinces in mainland China, including similar to 150,000 patients with acute diarrhoea and covering years 2009-2018.

TI  - Meta-classification of remote sensing reflectance to estimate trophic status of inland and nearshore waters
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Common aquatic remote sensing algorithms estimate the trophic state (TS) of inland and nearshore waters through the inversion of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs (lambda)) into chlorophyll-a (chla) concentration. In this study we present a novel method that directly inverts Rrs (lambda) into TS without prior chla retrieval. To successfully cope with the optical diversity of inland and nearshore waters the proposed method stacks supervised classification algorithms and combines them through meta-learning. We demonstrate the developed methodology using the waveband configuration of the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument on 49 globally distributed inland and nearshore waters (567 observations). To assess the performance of the developed approach, we compare the results with TS derived through optical water type (OWT) switching of chla retrieval algorithms. Meta-classification of TS was on average 6.75% more accurate than TS derived via OWT switching of chla algorithms. The presented method achieved > 90% classification accuracies for eutrophic and hypereutrophic waters and was > 12% more accurate for oligotrophic waters than derived through OWT chla retrieval. However, mesotrophic waters were estimated with lower accuracy from both our developed method and through OWT chla retrieval (52.17% and 46.34%, respectively), highlighting the need for improved base algorithms for low - moderate biomass waters. Misclassified observations were characterised by highly absorbing and/or scattering optical properties for which we propose adaptations to our classification strategy.

TI  - Validation of CP-GEP (Merlin Assay) for predicting sentinel lymph node metastasis in primary cutaneous melanoma patients: A US cohort study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Approximately 85% of melanoma patients who undergo a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) are node-negative. Melanoma incidence is highest in patients >= 65 years, but their SLNB positivity rate is lower than in younger patients. CP-GEP, a model combining clinicopathologic and gene expression variables, identifies primary cutaneous melanoma (CM) patients who may safely forgo SLNB due to their low risk for nodal metastasis. Here, we validate CP-GEP in a U.S. melanoma patient cohort.Methods A cohort of 208 adult patients with primary CM from the Mayo Clinic and West Virginia University was used. Patients were stratified according to their risk for nodal metastasis: CP-GEP High Risk and CP-GEP Low Risk. The main performance measures were SLNB reduction rate (RR) and negative predictive value (NPV).Results SLNB positivity rate for the entire cohort was 21%. Most patients had a T1b (34%) or T2a (31%) melanoma. In the T1-T2 group (153 patients), CP-GEP achieved an SLNB RR of 41.8% (95% CI: 33.9-50.1) at an NPV of 93.8% (95% CI: 84.8-98.3). Subgroup analysis showed similar performance in T1-T2 patients >= 65 years of age (51 patients; SLNB positivity rate, 9.8%): SLNB RR of 43.1% (95% CI: 29.3-57.8) at an NPV of 95.5% (95% CI: 77.2-99.9).Conclusion We confirmed the potential of CP-GEP to reduce negative SLNB in all relevant age groups. Our findings are especially relevant to patients >= 65 years, where surgery is often elective. CP-GEP may guide SLNB decision-making in clinical practice.

TI  - Establishment and Verification of a Predictive Model for Node Pathological Complete Response After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Initial Node Positive Early Breast Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveAxillary node status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) in early breast cancer patients influences the axillary surgical staging procedure. This study was conducted for the identification of the likelihood of patients being node pathological complete response (pCR) post NCT. We aimed to recognize patients most likely to benefit from sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) following NCT and to reduce the risk of missed detection of positive lymph nodes through the construction and validation of a clinical preoperative scoring prediction model.MethodsThe existing data (from March 2010 to December 2018) of the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer Database (CSCO-BC) was used to evaluate the independent related factors of node pCR after NCT by Binary Logistic Regression analysis. A predictive model was established according to the score of considerable factors to identify ypN0. Model performance was confirmed in a cohort of NCT patients treated between January 2019 and December 2019 in Henan Cancer Hospital, and model discrimination was evaluated via assessing the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC).ResultsMultivariate regression analysis showed that the node stage before chemotherapy, the expression level of Ki-67, biologic subtype, and breast pCR were all independent related factors of ypN0 after chemotherapy. According to the transformation and summation of odds ratio (OR) values of each variable, the scoring system model was constructed with a total score of 1-5. The AUC for the ROC curves was 0.715 and 0.770 for the training and the validation set accordingly.ConclusionsA model was established and verified for predicting ypN0 after chemotherapy in newly diagnosed cN+ patients and the model had good accuracy and efficacy. The underlined effective model can suggest axillary surgical planning, and reduce the risk of missing positive lymph nodes by SLNB after NCT. It has great value for identifying initial cN+ patients who are more appropriate for SLNB post-chemotherapy.

TI  - Assessment of landslide susceptibility zonation using frequency ratio and statistical index: a case study of Al-Fawar basin, Tartous, Syria
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide is one of the most morpho-dynamic patterns of slopes in the coastal region of Syria. The assessment of landslide susceptibility is a complex procedure because of limited data and lack of related literature in Syria. Therefore, the current paper explored the landslide susceptibility in Al-Fawar basin, based on remote sensing data in the GIS environment. Inventorization of the current landslide was carried out as points utilizing satellite images, fieldwork, and photographs. Thirteen dominant factors of landslide including slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, plan curvature, profile curvature, elevation, proximity to faults, proximity to streams, proximity to roads, NDVI, rainfall, lithology, and TWI were utilized for landslide susceptibility mapping. In this study, two bivariate statistical models, i.e., frequency ratio (FR) and statistical index (SI), were used for spatial calibration between the resulting inventory map and the geofactors. The quality of models performance in mapping the landslide susceptibility was assessed utilizing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The prediction accuracy curves showed that the landslide susceptibility map using FR model has the greatest prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.824) compared with SI model that showed 0.801 of AUC. Identically, the success rate curve graph showed that the AUC for FR and SI models was 0.799 and 0.778, respectively. Although the susceptibility assessment utilizing the FR model produced higher accurate output, the validation results indicate that the two models used in this study can be encouraging approaches for the assessment of landslide susceptibility hazard in the Syrian coastal basin, thus fruitfully creating spatial mitigation and conservation measures.

TI  - Trends in Axillary Management of Early Breast Cancer: a Questionnaire-Based Pattern of Practice Survey for India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surgical management of breast cancer (BC) has evolved from radical surgeries to conservative with better cosmetic and comparable oncological outcomes. For axillary staging, it has evolved from axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). No detailed information exists in terms of the clinical practice pattern of surgical management of axilla for BC patients in India. A questionnaire-based survey was developed. The survey was done at the annual meeting of the Association of Breast Surgeons of India (ABSI) in November 2018. Responses were recorded and analysed by SPSS 23. One hundred twelve out of 400 (28%) responded to the survey. Half of the respondents were surgical oncologist and 36.6% were performing > 150 BC surgeries/year. The primary technique for axillary staging in node-negative BC was SLNB for 68.5% of respondents. Majority of surgeons (47%) reported performing SLNB by methylene blue dye only. Unavailability of radioisotope (46.7%) and lack of frozen section (26.7%) were reported as two major barriers for not performing SLNB. Twenty-three percent did perform SLNB in post-NACT setting. Only 15.8% have omitted completion ALND in Z0011 trial eligible SLN-positive patients. 45.9% skipped completion ALND in SLN positive with micro metastasis only. Many surgeons in India are adopting SLNB as a method of axillary staging into their clinical practice. However, large number of surgeons still believe in conservative approach, most probably due to unavailability of resources and lack of Indian data. Barrier identified in this survey may be useful for future development.

TI  - Cross-scale monitoring of habitat suitability changes using satellite time series and ecological niche models
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the biggest challenges to deal with the global crisis of biodiversity loss is the lack of efficient and viable monitoring systems across scales. Unlike traditional in situ biodiversity monitoring, a usually costly and time-consuming enterprise, satellite remote sensing (SRS) data offer a technically feasible and sustainable in time solution. Here, we devise a cost-effective and upgradeable spatiotemporal framework for monitoring the species-specific habitat availability changes across scales by trend analysis of habitat suitability index (HSI) de -rived from ecological niche models (ENMs; Maxent) and using time series of SRS data (MODIS). The SRS-ENM framework was applied for a large suite of native species (911), from major taxonomic groups (flora (vascular plants), amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals), and listed in the IUCN Red List at regional (Iberian Peninsula) and continental (Europe) scales. The HSI-trend analyses predict cumulative reductions in habitat suitability for Threatened and Non-Threatened species across scales for the period 2002-2016. Specifically, 19% and 66% of the total grid cells for both species' groups showed negative trends at both regional and continental scales, re-spectively. Results were similar when considering all IUCN threat categories. All taxa groups showed a decrease in habitat suitability, but amphibians and reptiles groups hosted the largest number of negative HSI-trends grid cells. Considering all groups together, 12% and 34% of both study areas have strong reductions in habitat quality. We conclude that our framework detects increases and decreases in species' habitat suitability regardless of the spatial scale, extent, and pixel size. Species' range predictions across space and time based on SRS time series rep-resent a promising Earth observation tool to support traditional risk assessment protocols and anticipate the decision-making process, while serving as a cross-scale biodiversity monitoring system.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Evapotranspiration in the Amazon: spatial patterns, seasonality, and recent trends in observations, reanalysis, and climate models
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water recycled through transpiring forests influences the spatial distribution of precipitation in the Amazon and has been shown to play a role in the initiation of the wet season. However, due to the challenges and costs associated with measuring evapotranspiration (ET) directly and high uncertainty in remote-sensing ET retrievals, the spatial and temporal patterns in Amazon ET remain poorly understood. In this study, we estimated ET over the Amazon and 10 sub-basins using a catchment-balance approach, whereby ET is calculated directly as the balance between precipitation, runoff, and change in groundwater storage. We compared our results with ET from remote-sensing datasets, reanalysis, models from Phase 5 and Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIP5 and CMIP6 respectively), and in situ flux tower measurements to provide a comprehensive overview of current understanding. Catchment-balance analysis revealed a gradient in ET from east to west/southwest across the Amazon Basin, a strong seasonal cycle in basin-mean ET primarily controlled by net incoming radiation, and no trend in ET over the past 2 decades. This approach has a degree of uncertainty, due to errors in each of the terms of the water budget; therefore, we conducted an error analysis to identify the range of likely values. Satellite datasets, reanalysis, and climate models all tended to overestimate the magnitude of ET relative to catchment-balance estimates, underestimate seasonal and interannual variability, and show conflicting positive and negative trends. Only two out of six satellite and model datasets analysed reproduced spatial and seasonal variation in Amazon ET, and captured the same controls on ET as indicated by catchment-balance analysis. CMIP5 and CMIP6 ET was inconsistent with catchment-balance estimates over all scales analysed. Overall, the discrepancies between data products and models revealed by our analysis demonstrate a need for more ground-based ET measurements in the Amazon as well as a need to substantially improve model representation of this fundamental component of the Amazon hydrological cycle.

TI  - Why and How Does the Actual Spectral Response Matter for Microwave Radiance Assimilation?
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on Global/Regional Assimilation and PrEdiction System-Global Forecast System and actual Spectral Response Functions (SRFs) of three Selected Single-Passband Channels (Channels 5-7) of FengYun-3D MicroWave Temperature Sounders-2, impacts of actual SRFs on Brightness Temperature (TB) simulation were analyzed. Compared with simulation by ideal SRFs, averaged STandard DeViation and bias of Observation minus Background by actual SRFs decrease about -5.0% and 37.3%. The reductions on Equatorial regions are more obvious than middle and high latitudes. Five types of deformations were put forward to analyze their impacts on TB simulation. Attenuation, shifting, and extending of passband have more impacts on simulated TB compared with trap on passband. The differences between TBs simulated using ideal and actual SRFs do not depend on the magnitude of the difference between ideal and actual SRFs, but on the balances of different types of deformations of actual SRF.

TI  - BGC-Argo Floats Observe Nitrate Injection and Spring Phytoplankton Increase in the Surface Layer of Levantine Sea (Eastern Mediterranean)
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the eastern Mediterranean Sea, satellites have observed events of spring surface-chlorophyll increase in the Rhodes Gyre region recurring intermittently. Few in situ biogeochemical data, however, exist to confirm their consistency, elucidate their seasonal characteristics, or discriminate among the possible drivers. During the year 2018, an array of BGC-Argo floats was deployed in the region, collecting the first-ever annual time series of in situ profiles of biogeochemical parameters in this area. Their observations demonstrated that nitrates, driven by mixed-layer dynamics, were available at surface from December 2018 onwards and could have sustained phytoplankton growth. Phytoplankton accumulation at the surface was observed by satellite only in March 2019 when the mixed-layer depth shoaled. These findings confirm that blooms occurring before the start of seasonal stratification are not easily recorded by satellite observations and reaffirm the need to consolidate the BGC-Argo network to establish time series of the evolution of biogeochemical processes.Plain Language Summary The Levantine Sea, the easternmost area of Mediterranean Sea, is considered one of the poorest oceans on the Earth in terms of abundance of phytoplankton, the microscopic organisms that fuel the marine food web. However, historical data and satellite maps of chlorophyll (the pigment that reveals phytoplankton presence in the water) show episodic increases in the concentration of this pigment in the area near the island of Rhodes. To elucidate the characteristics of these events, a set of six robotic instruments (i.e. the BGC-Argo floats) was deployed in the Levantine Sea in 2018. A BGC-Argo float is an autonomous, free-floating instrument that makes oceanic observations over the first 2,000 m of the water column on a regular basis. This article presents an analysis of the data collected by these six robots. They provided the very first annual time series of biogeochemical observations in area, including during winter, when ship and satellite data are hard to collect. Our results reveal the increase in phytoplankton occurring before the start of seasonal stratification, increase that is not easily recorded by satellite observations and reaffirm the need to consolidate the BGC-Argo network to establish time series of the evolution of biogeochemical processes.

TI  - Prevalence of extracapsular extension in metastatic sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Axillary lymph node involvement is recognized as a key prognostic factor for invasive breast cancer. Retrospective analyzes have shown that extracapsular extension (ECE) is correlated with negative prognostic factors in this neoplasia. Objective: to evaluate the measurement of ECE and its relationship with the number of affected non-sentinel lymph nodes, as well as to investigate the association between ECE with other clinical and pathological prognostic factors. Methods: This is a cross-sectional observational study carried out from January 2015 to June 2019, at the Breast Surgical Oncology service of Liga Contra o Cancer (LIGA), in Natal, Brazil. A total of 150 patients were included in the study and were divided into three groups: absence of ECE, ECE less than or equal to 2 mm and ECE greater than 2 mm. Results: The mean age was 58 years for the group with ECE and 57 years for the group without ECE. Most of the patients were mixed race (66.7%), had no family history of breast cancer (64%) and underwent quadrantectomy (64.5%). Regarding the characteristics of the disease, most presented a histological report compatible with Invasive Carcinoma of the non-special type (IC NST) (87.5%), histological grade II (52.7%), negative Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (52.7%), Tumor Size T1 (<2.0 cm) (52%) and Luminal B molecular subtype (36.7%). Regarding sentinel lymph nodes: 103 patients (68.7%) had ECE and 1 positive sentinel lymph node was identified in most cases. There was a statistically significant association between the presence of ECE and of being mixed race (p = 0.03), between ECE and LVI (p = 0.05) and between ECE and a greater number of positive nonsentinel lymph nodes (p 0.001). Conclusion: Our study showed that ECE 2 mm is associated with increased axillary nodal load compared to groups without ECE and ECE <= 2 mm in sentinel node biopsy in patients who met the Z0011 criteria.

TI  - Surface urban heat island intensity in five major cities of Bangladesh: Patterns, drivers and trends
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is currently a lack of knowledge regarding the spatiotemporal variation of day and night surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) in the major cities of Bangladesh. These cities have a large population base and generally lack the resources to deal with rapid urbanisation impacts, so any increase in urban temperature has the potential to affect people both directly (due to heatwave conditions) or indirectly (due to loss of livelihood). Time series diurnal (day/night) MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data for the period 2000-2019 was used to produce baseline information about SUHI intensity, drivers and temporal trends. Five large cities were selected based on population size and historical urban expansion rates. Results indicated that annual SUHII was greater in the larger cities of Dhaka and Chittagong than in the smaller cities. SUHII observed during the day was also greater than at night. Population (in terms of city size and surface cover), lack of greenness and anthropogenic forcing were major factors affecting SUHII. Trend assessments revealed positive trends during daytime in four out of five cities, while one city recorded negative trends at night. The findings may provide new insights into impacts arising from rapid urbanisation and demographic shifts.

TI  - Terra and Aqua MODIS Thermal Emissive Bands Calibration and RVS Stability Assessments Using an In Situ Ocean Target
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), whose openly public data have been used for over two decades to monitor and address global issues, has 16 thermal emissive bands (TEBs) with central wavelengths that range from 3.7 to 14.4 mu m and are calibrated on-orbit using observations from its on-board blackbody. To maintain MODIS' rich, well-calibrated archive of multispectral imagery and data, Earth targets are regularly used to track its long-term stability as well as the consistency between the two sensors onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. Moreover, these scenes can be used to compare MODIS Earth view data over the complete scan-angle range and evaluate the on-orbit performance of the TEBs response-versus-scan-angle (RVS) over the mission lifetime. This article focuses on evaluating the MODIS TEBs Collection (C6.1) radiometric calibration stability for both instruments using an in situ ocean target as reference [hereafter referred to as in situ sea surface temperature (SST)]. Furthermore, it will assess the calibration consistency between the MODIS sensors. Finally, it will analyze the on-orbit RVS stability for Terra and Aqua MODIS. Only cloud-free, nighttime MODIS TEB retrievals were used for the study. A normalization methodology is applied to standardize the MODIS data to the in situ SST. In addition, spectral corrections were derived between some of the Terra and Aqua MODIS TEBs by using a combination of the MODIS Atmospheric Profile product and MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission (MODTRAN) simulations. Results indicate that most MODIS TEBs exhibit mission-long trends of +/- 0.50 K--with Terra band 30 presenting the largest downward drift due to residual electronic crosstalk effects. Moreover, the calibration consistency analysis over a warm ocean target demonstrated that the average Terra-to-Aqua MODIS bias for most bands is well within +/- 0.50 K (bands 27 and 30 show the largest--electronic crosstalk-related--biases). Finally, the MODIS TEBs RVS trends display changes of +/- 0.50 K (except for bands 25 and 27 at the end-of-scan angles) for both instruments. Overall, the MODIS TEBs remain well-calibrated and their RVSs aptly characterized.

TI  - Applying the System of Environmental Economic Accounting-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) framework at catchment scale to develop ecosystem extent and condition accounts
T2  - ONE ECOSYSTEM
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem accounting is a tool to integrate nature into decision-making in a more structured way. Applying the use of nationally available datasets at catchment scale and following the System of Environmental Economic Accounting-Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EA) framework, we present results from a catchment case study in Ireland, highlighting findings specifically in relation to the development of ecosystem extent and condition accounts. In the absence of a national ecosystem map, CORINE landcover mapping formed the basic data for extent and type of ecosystems, distinguishing woodlands and forest, peatland and heathland, grasslands and cropland and urban areas, with limited coverage of linear freshwater rivers, hedgerows and coastal ecosystems. Additional remote sensing data provided higher resolution at catchment scale, while limited site-level survey data were available. Condition data gathered for reporting under the EU Water Framework Directive were available at sub-basin level for surface waterbodies. Data were available at national level for habitats reported for the EU under the Habitats Directive (59 habitats reported), covering similar to 25% of the study area. Data for ecosystem types outside of these reporting frameworks were in the form of ancillary data only, providing information on pressures, threats and intensity of use. Our findings in Ireland reflect work across the European region, highlighting the role of data gathering and stakeholder engagement. We outline some of the data gaps to provide information for future research and alignment of data for the purpose of NCA, both at catchment and national scale.

TI  - Wind speed and mesoscale features drive net autotrophy in the South Atlantic Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive in situ dataset of chlorophyll a (Chl a; N = 18,001), net primary production (NPP; N = 165) and net community production (NCP; N = 95), were used to evaluate the performance of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on Aqua (MODIS-A) algorithms for these parameters, in the South Atlantic Ocean, to facilitate the accurate generation of satellite NCP time series. For Chl a, five algorithms were tested using MODISA data, and OC3-CI performed best, which was subsequently used to compute NPP. Of three NPP algorithms tested, a Wavelength Resolved Model (WRM) was the most accurate, and was therefore used to estimate NCP with an empirical relationship between NCP with NPP and sea surface temperature (SST). A perturbation analysis was deployed to quantify the range of uncertainties introduced in satellite NCP from input parameters. The largest reductions in the uncertainty of satellite NCP came from MODIS-A derived NPP using the WRM (40%) and MODIS-A Chl a using OC3-CI (22%).The most accurate NCP algorithm, was used to generate a 16 year time series (2002 to 2018) from MODIS-A to assess climate and environmental drivers of NCP across the South Atlantic basin. Positive correlations between wind speed anomalies and NCP anomalies were observed in the central South Atlantic Gyre (SATL), and the Benguela Upwelling (BENG), indicating that autotrophic conditions may be fuelled by local wind-induced nutrient inputs to the mixed layer. Sea Level Height Anomalies (SLHA), used as an indicator of mesoscale eddies, were negatively correlated with NCP anomalies offshore of the BENG upwelling fronts into the SATL, suggesting autotrophic conditions are driven by mesoscale features. The Agulhas bank and Brazil-Malvinas confluence regions also had a strong negative correlation between SLHA and NCP anomalies, similarly indicating that NCP is forced by mesoscale eddy generation in this region. Positive correlations between SST anomalies and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) in the SATL, indicated the influence of El Nino events on the South Atlantic Ocean, however the plankton community response was less clear.

TI  - ICESat-2 Meltwater Depth Estimates: Application to Surface Melt on Amery Ice Shelf, East Antarctica
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface melting occurs during summer on the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, but the volume of stored surface meltwater has been difficult to quantify due to a lack of accurate depth estimates. NASA's ICESat-2 laser altimeter brings a new capability: photons penetrate water and are reflected from both the water and the underlying ice; the difference provides a depth estimate. ICESat-2 sampled Amery Ice Shelf on January 2, 2019 and showed double returns from surface depressions, indicating meltwater. For four melt features, we compared depth estimates from eight algorithms: six based on ICESat-2 and two from coincident Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery. All algorithms successfully identified surface water at the same locations. Algorithms based on ICESat-2 produced the most accurate depths; the image-based algorithms underestimated depths (by 30%-70%). This implies that ICESat-2 depths can be used to tune image-based algorithms, moving us closer to quantifying stored meltwater volumes across Antarctica and Greenland.

TI  - Habitat loss on the breeding grounds is a major contributor to population declines in a long-distance migratory songbird
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Many migratory species are declining and for most, the proximate causes of their declines remain unknown. For many long-distance Neotropical migratory songbirds, it is assumed that habitat loss on breeding or non-breeding grounds is a primary driver of population declines. We integrated data collected from tracking technology, community science and remote sensing data to quantify migratory connectivity (MC), population trends and habitat loss. We quantified the correlation between forest change throughout the annual cycle and population declines of a long-distance migratory songbird, the Connecticut warbler (Oporornis agilis, observed decline: -8.99% yr(-1)). MC, the geographic link between populations during two or more phases of the annual cycle, was stronger between breeding and autumn migration routes (MC = 0.24 +/- 0.23) than between breeding and non-breeding locations (MC = -0.2 +/- 0.14). Different Connecticut warbler populations tended to have population-specific fall migration routes but overlapped almost completely within the northern Gran Chaco ecoregion in South America. Cumulative forest loss within 50 km of breeding locations and the resulting decline in the largest forested patch index was correlated more strongly with population declines than forest loss on migratory stopover regions or on wintering locations in South America, suggesting that habitat loss during the breeding season is a driver of observed population declines for the Connecticut warbler. Land-use practices that retain large, forested patches within landscapes will likely benefit breeding populations of this declining songbird, but further research is needed to help inform land-use practices across the full annual cycle to minimize the impacts to migratory songbirds and abate ongoing population declines.

TI  - Glacier Retreat in Iceland Mapped from Space: Time Series Analysis of Geodata from 1941 to 2018
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, glaciers outside Greenland and Antarctica have shown increasingly rapid rates of mass loss and retreat of the ice front, which is associated with climatic and oceanic warming. Due to their maritime location, Icelandic glaciers are sensitive to short-term climate fluctuations and have shown rapid rates of retreat and mass loss over the last decade. In this study, historical maps (1941-1949) of the US Army Map Service (AMS series C762) and optical satellite imagery (Landsat 1, Landsat 5, Landsat 7, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2) are used to study the Langjokull, Hofsjokull and Vatnajokull ice caps. By the help of the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), the glacier terminus fluctuations of the ice caps from 1973 to 2018 and the Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) from 1973 to 2018 are analyzed. The results are compared with climate data, especially with mean summer temperatures and winter precipitation. Due to the negative temperature gradient with increasing altitude, bivariate histograms are generated, showing the glaciated area per altitude zone and time, and providing a prediction of the future development until 2050 and beyond. The results indicate that Langjokull, Hofsjokull and Vatnajokull are retreating and advancing over the study period in correlation with the mean summer temperature, with a steady decrease over time being the clearest and most significant trend. The lower parts of the glaciers, thus, will probably disappear during the next decades. This behaviour is also evident by an exceptional increase of the ELA observed on all three glaciers, which leads to a reduction of the accumulation zone.

AB  - A 43-year-old woman presented to the hospital with severe low back pain and paresthesias in the bilateral lower extremities. MRI of the spine revealed spinal subarachnoid and subdural hemorrhage extending from T11 to L5-S1. A diagnostic spinal angiogram demonstrated a dissecting, partially thrombosed aneurysm of the artery of Adamkiewicz. At four weeks from the sentinel event, her symptoms had completely resolved with resolution on imaging. Isolated artery of Adamkiewicz aneurysms, which are most often dissecting, fusiform aneurysms are extremely rare and management controversial

TI  - Abnormal reverse intrusion of the Kuroshio Branch Current induced by super typhoon soudelor
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kuroshio Current has a considerable impact on the environmental characteristics and dynamic of the East China Sea (ECS). On the ECS continental shelf within the study area of (124 degrees E-126 degrees E, 25 degrees N-27 degrees N), the Kuroshio Branch Current (KBC) exists in a stable state and flows towards the main Kuroshio axis. The significant difference in potential vorticity is on both sides of the Kuroshio main axis, which makes it difficult for the seawater on the right side of the Kuroshio main axis to intrude the ECS continental shelf. Based on Argo data, satellite data and reanalysis data, an abnormal reverse intrusion of the KBC was observed during the passage of super typhoon Soudelor in 2015. The mean reverse volume transport during the period of Soudelor reached about 0.56 Sv, and the daily mean volume transport on August 9 reached up to 1.29 Sv. Soudelor inputted additional positive potential vorticity fluxes on the right side of the Kuroshio main axis and counteracted the significant potential vorticity difference on both sides of the Kuroshio main axis, which provided a channel for the apparently reverse enhanced ocean current. The significant Ekman downwelling and changes of the upper ocean stratification also promoted the reverse intrusion of KBC. This study offers new insights into the influence of typhoons on the intrusion of the Kuroshio onto the ECS continental shelf.

TI  - The tree cover and temperature disparity in US urbanized areas: Quantifying the association with income across 5,723 communities
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban tree cover provides benefits to human health and well-being, but previous studies suggest that tree cover is often inequitably distributed. Here, we use National Agriculture Imagery Program digital ortho photographs to survey the tree cover inequality for Census blocks in US large urbanized areas, home to 167 million people across 5,723 municipalities and other Census-designated places. We compared tree cover to summer land surface temperature, as measured using Landsat imagery. In 92% of the urbanized areas surveyed, low-income blocks have less tree cover than high-income blocks. On average, low-income blocks have 15.2% less tree cover and are 1.5 degrees C hotter than high-income blocks. The greatest difference between low- and high-income blocks was found in urbanized areas in the Northeast of the United States, where low-income blocks in some urbanized areas have 30% less tree cover and are 4.0 degrees C hotter. Even after controlling for population density and built-up intensity, the positive association between income and tree cover is significant, as is the positive association between proportion non-Hispanic white and tree cover. We estimate, after controlling for population density, that low-income blocks have 62 million fewer trees than high-income blocks, equal to a compensatory value of $56 billion ($1,349/person). An investment in tree planting and natural regeneration of $17.6 billion would be needed to close the tree cover disparity, benefitting 42 million people in low-income blocks.

TI  - Multitemporal satellite imagery analysis for soil organic carbon assessment in an agricultural farm in southeastern Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a crucial role for soil health. However, large datasets needed to accurately assess SOC at high resolution across scales are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. Ancillary geodata, including remote sensing spectral indices (RS-SIs) and topographic indicators (TIs), have been proposed as spatial covariates. Reported relationships between SOC and RS-SIs are erratic, possibly because single-date RS-SIs do not accurately capture SOC spatial variability due to transient confounding factors in the soil (e.g., moisture). However, multitemporal RS-SI data analysis may lead to noise reduction in SOC versus RS-SI relationships. This study aimed at: i) comparing single-date versus multitemporal RS-Sis derived from Sentinel-2 imagery for assessment of topsoil (0-0.2 m) SOC in two agricultural fields located in south-eastern Brazil; ii) comparing the performance of RS-SIs and TIs; iii) using adequate RS-SIs and TIs to compare sampling schemes defined on different collection grids; and iv) studying the temporal changes of SOC (0-0.2 m and 0.2- 0.4 m). Results showed that: i) single-date RS-SIs were not reliable proxies for topsoil SOC at the study sites. For most of the tested RS-SIs, multitemporal data analysis produced accurate proxies for SOC; e.g., for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, the 4.5th multitemporal percentile predicted SOC with an R-2 of 0.64; ii) The best TI was elevation (ranging from 643 to 684 m) with an R-2 of 0.70; iii) The multitemporal SI and elevation maps indicated that the different sampling schemes were equally representative of the topsoil SOC's distribution across the entire area; and iv) From 2012 through 2019, topsoil SOC increased from 19.3 to 24.1 g kg(-1). The ratio between SOC in the topsoil and subsoil (0.2-0.4 m) decreased from 1.7 to 1.1. Further testing of the proposed multitemporal RS-SI analysis is necessary to confirm its dependability for SOC assessment in Brazil and elsewhere. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud Computing (CC) is an innovative worldview technique that allows for the registration of resources. Some examples of computing resources are an organization, stockpiling, applications, and administrations when there is an interesting perspective. In CC, the assets are shared by Cloud customers. A registered framework is given by the cloud which is an advanced stage on which clients can build up their applications. Having a limited service, the consumers of the cloud can gain resources from anywhere irrespective of time. One of the topical issues is Edge and Fog computing along with the cloud security that is associated with the processing paradigm, data storage, and managing. When attacks occur on the advancement of fog computing, IoT Cloud figuring, ineradicable and appalling impacts transpire. Subsequently, numerous security frameworks and models have been proposed and executed for security in Fog computing. The proposed model addresses the privacy concerns as many networks are involved, and there are many fog nodes that each end-user is accessible to those nodes. This is due to more sensitive information that is transferred from end-users to the fog nodes. The proposed model uses multi-layered intermittent neural organizations intended to be executed for Fog computing figuring the security that is exceptionally near the end-clients and IoT gadgets. The proposed model utilizes a reasonable adaptation of the difficult dataset such as the NSL-KDD dataset. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated using a range of existing models, features. The research findings and replications are used to demonstrate the robustness and stability of the proposed model in comparison with other types of execution measurements.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work tried to develop multiparametric statistical and machine learning models of wetland water richness at two phases in the pre-dam period and at one phase in the post-dam period. Eight models four each in statistical and machine learning approaches including six relevant parameters have been developed. The performance of the EBF among statistical models and REPtree among machine learning models are found as the best representative. REPtree model has identified 212.58 km(2), 136.51 km(2), and 34.02 km(2) areas as very high water richness at phase I, II, and III respectively in the core wetland stretches. The decreasing rate has almost doubled after damming (35% to 75%). The Reduction rate of water richness area in-between phase I and II in the pre-dam period is not statistically significant (p < 0.98), but this is significant between pre- and post-dam period figuring out the crucial role of damming on wetland water richness.

TI  - Spatial variation characteristics of vegetation phenology and its influencing factors in the subtropical monsoon climate region of southern China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the response mechanism of ecosystems to climate change and human disturbance can be improved by analyzing the spatial patterns of vegetation phenology and its influencing factors. Because the diverse phenological patterns are impacted by cloud cover contamination issues in the satellite observations, there are few remote sensing phenological research data in subtropical monsoon climate regions. To better understand the horizontal and vertical changes of vegetation phenology in these regions and how it may be affected by climatic factors and topographical features, we first extracted vegetation phenological information (such as start of growth season (SOS), end of growth season (EOS) and length of growth season (LEN)) from a reconstructed MODIS EVI time-series data. We then used geographic detectors to identify the influencing factors of phenology in different elevation zoning areas. We have found that in the Xiangjiang River Basin: 1) gradual changes in the longitudinal or latitudinal gradient of vegetation phenology were not obvious. Instead of horizontal changes, the variation pattern of phenology was similar to the striped river network of the Xiangjiang River. Earlier SOS mainly appeared in the areas far away from the river; later SOS appeared in the midstream and downstream reaches.2) Elevation played an important role in the regional differentiation of phenology. Boundaries at elevations of 320 m and 520 m distinctly separated the region into plain, hilly, and mountain vegetation phenological characteristics. 3) The impacts of climatic factors were quite different in the three vertical zoning areas. Precipitation was the most crucial factor affecting SOS both in plain and mountain areas. There was no significant factor affecting EOS in the plain area, but temperature had an essential effect on EOS in the mountain area. The hilly areas had a concentrated growth period with no significant factors affecting phenology. These findings highlight the importance of elevation in phenology at a watershed scale, enhance our understanding of the impact of climate changes on subtropical ecosystems, and provide a reference for further land-use change monitoring.

TI  - Safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated eastern equine encephalitis virus vaccine
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a mosquito borne alphavirus spread primarily in Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions of the United States. EEEV is the causative agent of a devastating meningoencephalitis syndrome, with approximately 30% mortality and significant morbidity. There is no licensed human vaccine against EEEV. An inactivated EEEV vaccine has been offered under investigational new drug (IND) protocols at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) since 1976. Methods: Healthy at-risk laboratory personnel received inactivated PE-6 strain EEEV (TSI-GSD 104) vaccine under two separate IND protocols. Protocol FY 99?11 (2002?2008) had a primary series consisting of doses on day 0, 7, and 28. Protocol FY 06?31 (2008?2016) utilized a primary series with doses on day 0 and 28, and month 6. Participants with an inadequate immune response, plaque reduction neutralization test with 80% cut-off (PRNT80) titer 40, received booster vaccination. Volunteers with prior EEEV vaccination were eligible to enroll for booster doses based on annual titer evaluation. Results: The FY06-31 dosing schema resulted in significantly greater post-primary series immune response (PRNT80 40) rates (84% vs 54%) and geometric mean titers (184.1 vs 39.4). The FY 06?31 dosing schema also resulted in significantly greater cumulative annual immune response rates from 1 to up to 7 years post vaccination (75% vs 59%) and geometric mean of titers (60.1 vs 43.0). The majority of probably or definitely related adverse events were mild and local; there were no probably or definitely related serious adverse events. Conclusions: Inactivated PE-6 EEEV vaccine is safe and immunogenic in at-risk laboratory personnel. A prolonged primary series, with month 6 dose, significantly improved vaccine immunogenicity both post-primary series and longitudinally on annual titers. Despite decades of safe use under IND, full licensure is not planned due to manufacturing constraints, and ongoing development of alternatives. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Intended wilderness as a Nature-based Solution: Status, identification and management of urban spontaneous vegetation in cities
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have been an increasingly recognized framework that uses naturally occurring processes to maximise the provisioning of ecosystem services and improve the life quality of city dwellers. One of the more widely applied NbS is an intentional abandonment of green space cultivation and promoting wilderness. In this study, we developed urban spontaneous vegetation (USV) identification algorithm based on NDVI from Sentinel-2 data in Warsaw's green spaces, Poland. We verified the study in an on-site survey where we collected 2863 field reference plots for USV and cultivated vegetation identification. We achieved 74 % accuracy for USV and 70 % for cultivated vegetation identification. The study assessed the spatial resources and extent of USV in the scale of the city and within various types of urban greenery. We identified the vegetation development persistence over 3 years and assessed the spontaneity levels of urban greenery. Classification of Warsaw's vegetation revealed that 54 % of Warsaw's greenery is cultivated while the remaining part is characterized by various levels of spontaneity. Only in 34.7 % of USV, we found no interruption of vegetation development due to cultivation for at least 3 years. USV was common in both cultivated parks where it accounted for 46.6 % of vegetation, as well as in the vacant lots, where it occurred in 55.3 % of the area. The proposed USV detection methodology can be an efficient tool for restoration effectiveness assessment and can support cultivation abandonment as NbS - an intended action promoting wilderness.

TI  - Hydrogeomorphic indicators of wetland health inferred from multi-temporal remote sensing data for a new Ramsar site (Kaabar Tal), India
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands form an important and dynamic ecosystem, and therefore, need continuous monitoring. We have developed a framework to assess the status of wetland health based on hydrogeomorphic characteristics and vegetation dynamics and have implemented it on a newly designated Ramsar site, Kaabar Tal, a large floodplain wetland in Ganga Plains, eastern India. The study has attempted to integrate the hydrological, geomorphological, and ecological concepts and tools to develop the protocols for a hydrogeomorphic assessment of wetland health. We have used multi-temporal Landsat imageries to define several health indicators based on water-spread area, geomorphology, and vegetation and have integrated them to compute wetland health index (WHI) scores. These health indicators correspond to a range of spatial scales - landscape (wetland) scale, ecosystem (sub-wetland) scale, and local (pixel) scale and individually represent different hydrogeomorphic and ecological functions as well as dynamics of a wetland. We have also presented four different wetland health scenarios based on dominating health indicator and two integrated scenarios representing the best and the worst WHI scores in all four scenarios. Our results show that the Kaabar Tal is in a degraded state and the degree of degradation varies spatially within the wetland. Agriculture is the prime factor for its degradation, augmented by decreasing rainfall and anthropogenic drainage reorganization. Based on our data analysis, we have suggested several recommendations to restore the health of this wetland. The framework presented in this work has a potential to understand the relationship between hydrodynamics and ecological functions in wetland systems in different hydro-climatic settings.

T2  - NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The search behavior and parasitism of trichogrammatids can be affected by volatile compounds emitted by plants under herbivory and/or oviposition. Our aim was to evaluate the chemotactic behavior and parasitism rates of Trichogramma pretiosum Riley (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) females against two varieties of corn and one of rice that underwent herbivory or oviposition by Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). In a glass Y-tube olfactometer, the parasitoids were given the choice between plants damaged by either herbivory or oviposition, with and without sentinel eggs, against those without damage. We also evaluated the average of parasitized eggs and the parasitoid emergence in sentinel eggs, which were next to plants that underwent herbivory contrasted with eggs next to undamaged plants. Trichogramma pretiosum was more attracted to rice and corn plants evaluated 24 h after herbivory compared to undamaged plants. Parasitoids preferred oviposited rice plants over control plants. Oviposited corn plants after 48 h were more attractive than non-oviposited plants without sentinel eggs. In the presence of sentinel eggs on the olfactometer tests, there was no difference in oviposition preference in corn. Parasitism was higher in sentinel eggs located near plants damaged by herbivory. This suggested that the egg parasitoid T. pretiosum not only uses chemical clues from rice and corn plants, damaged by herbivory, but also uses them as a strategy to search and increase parasitism in S. frugiperda eggs. However, the results of oviposition tests showed that plants of different species and varieties might respond differently to this type of damage.

TI  - Ship Detection in SAR Images by Aggregating Densities of Fisher Vectors: Extension to a Global Perspective
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fisher vectors (FVs) can capture multiple order information from superpixels (SPs) in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Existing FV-based ship detectors mainly exploit the local contrast of FVs (LCFVs) but do not consider their global density features. This may lead to degraded performance in terms of discrimination between ship targets and the complex sea clutter. In this article, two new global cues from FVs are designed based on the fact that target FVs exhibit much lower densities than those of clutter FVs and also have large distances to the latter. Our two new global cues can suppress the sea clutter and significantly enhance ship targets throughout the SAR image. We also design an improved local cue from FVs for ship detection, in which the intensity contrast of SPs is incorporated into the existing LCFV indicator to reduce false alarms. By fusing the above two new global cues (and an improved local cue from FVs), we propose a new method for ship detection in SAR images. Experimental results based on Gaofen-3 SAR images show that the newly proposed detector provides better detection performance than other state-of-the-art detectors, especially in the presence of strong and highly heterogeneous sea clutter.

TI  - Gated Spatial Memory and Centroid-Aware Network for Building Instance Extraction
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic building extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images plays an important role in many application fields, such as the urban planning and photogrammetry. However, the complex background and large variety in building appearances in high-resolution remote sensing images make the building instance extraction challenging. In this study, we propose a novel two-stage instance segmentation network named gated spatial memory and centroid-aware network (GSMC) to handle these problems. Two new modules, including a gated spatial memory module (GSM) and a centroid-aware head (CH), are developed in our GSMC. The GSM is a top-down spatial structure and semantic information transmission module, where two gates including an input gate and a state gate are designed to strengthen the important features and replenish the lacking information. The CH is a new task head for regressing the geometric center of each instance, which can help to promote the accurate and complete recognition for irregularly shaped buildings. Experiments on the WHU Aerial data set, the WHU Satellite data set, and the Massachusetts Building data set demonstrate that the proposed GSMC can achieve consistently superior performances when compared with the recent state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

TI  - Testing the efficacy of hyperspectral (AVIRIS-NG), multispectral (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) remote sensing images to detect native and invasive non-native trees
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive alien species threaten tropical grasslands and native biodiversity across the globe, including in the natural mosaic of native grasslands and forests in the Shola Sky Islands of the Western Ghats. Here, grasslands have been lost to exotic tree invasion (Acacias, Eucalyptus, and Pines) since the 1950s, but differing invasion intensities between these species and intermixing with native species constitutes a major challenge for remotely sensed assessments. In this study, we assess the accuracy of three satellite and airborne remote sensing sensors (Sentinel-1 radar data, Sentinel-2 multispectral data and AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data) and three machine learning classification algorithms to identify the spatial extent of native habitats and invasive tree species. We used the support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression trees (CART), and random forest (RF) algorithms implemented on the Google Earth Engine platform. Results indicate that AVIRIS-NG data in combination with SVM produced the highest classification accuracy (98.7%). Fused Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 produce 91% accuracy, while Sentinel-2 alone yielded 91% accuracy; but only with higher coverage of ground control points. The hyperspectral data (AVIRIS-NG) was the only sensor that permitted distinguishing recent invasions (young trees) with high precision. We suspect that large areas will have to be mapped and assessed in the coming years by conservation managers, NGOs to plan restoration or to assess the success of restoration activities, for which a choice of sensors may have to be made based on the age of invasion being mapped, and the quantum of ground control data available.

TI  - Bisphenols' occurrence in bivalves as sentinel of environmental contamination
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Bisphenols are massively used in several manufacture processes such that bisphenol A (BPA) is ubiquitous in envi-ronment worldwide. After the implementation of regulations about BPA use, manufacturers have moved their pro-duction toward alternative substances structurally similar to it. Unfortunately, BPA analogues, given their structural similarity, exert also similar adverse effects. This review aims to investigate the occurrence of bisphenols (BPs) in bi-valve molluscs. In this way, valuable information on the amount of BPs released into the environment in different areas are given. The current research indicates that BPA presence in bivalve molluscs has been investigated in Asia (Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean), Europe (Mediterranean Sea, Baltic Sea and Atlantic Ocean) and America (Lake Mead, Nevada) with the highest amount of studies reported in bivalves harvested in Asian Coasts. BPA ana-logues are frequently detected in several matrices and their levels will continuously increase in the environment. Nevertheless, there isa current lack of studies analysing BPs other than BPA in bivalves. Further investigations should be conducted in this direction, in order to assess environmental distribution and the hazard for animals and human health given that seafood consumption could be an important pathway of bisphenols intake.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Developing an Evidence-base to Guide Ethical Action in Global Challenges Research in Complex and Fragile Contexts: A Scoping Review of the Literature
T2  - ETHICS AND SOCIAL WELFARE
M3  - Review
AB  - The 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals have heightened awareness of the interconnectedness of our global future resulting in new research priorities and corresponding funding to address complex global challenges through partnership. This has generated the potential for powerful new solutions but also for ethical risks within and between disciplinary, geographic and cultural boundaries, in turn necessitating a greater emphasis on equitable partnerships and novel, just, transdisciplinary methodological approaches. Given this changing global research landscape, current ethical frameworks can seem fragmented, incoherent and no longer fit-for-purpose. The objectives of this scoping review were to (i) identify key issues of research ethics and integrity in GCR; and (ii) practices that can help address them. The review yielded 65, which were analysed in depth. Thematic analysis informed the development of a 4-part framework to support ethical action through analysis of ethical dilemmas pre-emptively and dynamically: Place (contextual ethical issues associated with cultural and language differences), People (ethical issues associated with human relationships involving participants and/or the research team), Principles (the worldview and values that influence decision making during the research) and Precedent (the way in which the research provides useful information to solve complex problems in a fragile context).

TI  - High sensitivity sanger sequencing detection of BRAF mutations in metastatic melanoma FFPE tissue specimens
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mutations in the BRAF gene at or near the p. V600 locus are informative for therapy selection, but current methods for analyzing FFPE tissue DNA generally have a limit of detection of 5% variant allele frequency (VAF), or are limited to the single variant (V600E). These can result in false negatives for samples with low VAFs due to low tumor content or subclonal heterogeneity, or harbor non-V600 mutations. Here, we show that Sanger sequencing using the NuProbe VarTrace BRAF assay, based on the Blocker Displacement Amplification (BDA) technology, is capable of detecting BRAF V600 mutations down to 0.20% VAF from FFPE lymph node tissue samples. Comparison experiments on adjacent tissue sections using BDA Sanger, immunohistochemistry (IHC), digital droplet PCR (ddPCR), and NGS showed 100% concordance among all 4 methods for samples with BRAF mutations at >= 1% VAF, though ddPCR did not distinguish the V600K mutation from the V600E mutation. BDA Sanger, ddPCR, and NGS (with orthogonal confirmation) were also pairwise concordant for lower VAF mutations down to 0.26% VAF, but IHC produced a false negative. Thus, we have shown that Sanger sequencing can be effective for rapid detection and quantitation of multiple low VAF BRAF mutations from FFPE samples. BDA Sanger method also enabled detection and quantitation of less frequent, potentially actionable non-V600 mutations as demonstrated by synthetic samples.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy alone for breast cancer patients with residual nodal disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - For residual N1 nodal disease following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for patients with breast cancer, the optimal local therapy for axilla is an evolving area. We analyzed the long-term results of these patients according to axillary surgical methods using propensity score matching (PSM) to clarify whether omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is oncologically safe. This was a single institution retrospective study of patients with ypN1 from Asan Medical Center (AMC). We included 324 patients who had undergone axillary surgery with either sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) only or ALND. The patients received NAC at AMC between 2008 and 2013. General indications for ALND included prominent nodes detected clinically before NAC, evident macrometastasis on multiple nodes during SLNB. Patients who had either micrometastasis or macrometastasis in 1 or 2 node(s) were included. SLNB was performed for patients with good responders to NAC with limited nodal burden. Patients were matched for baseline characteristics. After matching, we included 98 patients in each SLNB only group and ALND group respectively. We compared axillary recurrence-free survival (ARFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), overall survival (OS), and breast cancer-free survival (BCSS) according to the surgical method. The median follow-up period was 71 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed no statistically significant differences between the two groups for ARFS, DMFS, OS, and BCSS. After the propensity score matching, no significant statistical differences were observed in 5-year ARFS, DMFS, OS, and BCSS between the SLNB only group and ALND group. SLNB might be a possible option for ALND in patients with breast cancer who have limited axillary node metastasis after NAC without compromising survival outcomes.

TI  - Unsaturated zone model complexity for the assimilation of evapotranspiration rates in groundwater modelling
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The biophysical processes occurring in the unsaturated zone have a direct impact on the water table dynamics. Representing these processes through the application of unsaturated zone models of different complexity has an impact on the estimates of the volumes of water flowing between the unsaturated zone and the aquifer. These fluxes, known as net recharge, are often used as the shared variable that couples unsaturated to groundwater models. However, as recharge estimates are always affected by a degree of uncertainty, model-data fusion methods, such as data assimilation, can be used to inform these coupled models and reduce uncertainty. This study assesses the effect of unsaturated zone models complexity (conceptual versus physically based) to update groundwater model outputs, through the assimilation of actual evapotranspiration rates, for a water-limited site in South Australia. Actual evapotranspiration rates are assimilated because they have been shown to be related to the water table dynamics and thus form the link between remote sensing data and the deeper parts of the soil profile. Results have been quantified using standard metrics, such as the root mean square error and Pearson correlation coefficient, and reinforced by calculating the continuous ranked probability score, which is specifically designed to determine a more representative error in stochastic models. It has been found that, once properly calibrated to reproduce the actual evapotranspiration-water table dynamics, a simple conceptual model may be sufficient for this purpose; thus using one configuration over the other should be motivated by the specific purpose of the simulation and the information available.

TI  - Effect of contrast agent viscosity and massage on success of computed tomography lymphangiography with aqueous contrast for sentinel lymph node identification in healthy dogs
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) evaluation is important for accurate cancer staging. Computed tomography (CT) lymphangiography with aqueous contrast is a feasible technique for SLN identification in dogs. Although most studies report success rates around 90%, success rates as low as 60% have been reported. One reason for low success rates may be the difference in viscosity of the various agents used in comparison to normal lymph viscosity. The objective of this study was to evaluate contrast agents of differing viscosities for use in CT lymphangiography for SLN identification and to determine the influence of massage on contrast flow rates. The hypothesis was that lower viscosity agents would have a higher success rate and faster time to identification of the SLN than higher viscosity agents and that massage would increase contrast flow rates. Dogs were anaesthetised and CT lymphangiography was performed with four contrast agents of differing viscosities in a randomized crossover design. Injections were made on the dorsal pes bilaterally on two study days and the popliteal lymph nodes were evaluated for contrast uptake. There was no significant difference in success of SLN identification or time to SLN identification among the four agents. Massage of the injection site increased rate of contrast flow through the lymphatics. No specific recommendation for one contrast agent over another can be made with these results. Massage is recommended to improve lymphatic flow when performing CT lymphangiography with aqueous contrast in dogs.

TI  - Succession pattern and phylotype analysis of microphytobenthic communities in a simulated oil spill seagrass mesocosm experiment
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Microphytobenthic communities play a significant role in nutrient modulation, sediment stabilization, and primary production in seagrass beds, which provide various ecosystem services. We hypothesized that microphytobenthic communities in sediments of chronically oil-exposed seagrass beds will exhibit increased resiliency to stressors associated with oil exposure as opposed to seagrass beds never exposed to oil spills. We prepared 14-liter seawater mesocosms, each containing a submersed macrophyte Ruppia maritima collected from the Chandeleur Islands, Louisiana, and Estero Bay, Florida. Mesocosms were initially exposed to 50% wateraccommodated oil fractions (WAF) and subsequently diluted by 50% with daily artificial seawater exchanges over 8 days to simulate tidal dilution. High-throughput amplicon sequencing based on 23S rRNA gene targeting cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of eukaryotic microphytobenthos was conducted to assess the impact of oiling on microphytobenthic communities with additional assessment via microscopy. High-throughput sequencing in combination with traditional microscopic analysis provided a robust examination in which both methods roughly complemented each other. Distinct succession patterns were detected in benthic algal communities of chronically oil-exposed (Louisiana) versus unexposed (Florida) seagrass bed sediments. The impact of oiling in microphytobenthos across all samples showed that benthic diatoms dominated all algal communities with sample percentages ranging from 42 to 97%, followed by cyanobacteria (2 to 50%). It is noteworthy that drastic changes in microphytobenthic community structure in terms of the larger taxonomic level were not observed, rather change occurred at the phylotype level. These results were also confirmed by microscopy. Similarity percentages (SIMPER) analysis identified seven phylotypes (Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyceae, and Mediophyceae)

TI  - Fatal arterial hemorrhage after pancreaticoduodenectomy: How do we simultaneously accomplish complete hemostasis and hepatic arterial flow?
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF HEPATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDAlthough arterial hemorrhage after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is not frequent, it is fatal. Arterial hemorrhage is caused by pseudoaneurysm rupture, and the gastroduodenal artery stump and hepatic artery (HA) are frequent culprit vessels. Diagnostic procedures and imaging modalities are associated with certain difficulties. Simultaneous accomplishment of complete hemostasis and HA flow preservation is difficult after PD. Although complete hemostasis may be obtained by endovascular treatment (EVT) or surgery, liver infarction caused by hepatic ischemia and/or liver abscesses caused by biliary ischemia may occur. We herein discuss therapeutic options for fatal arterial hemorrhage after PD.AIMTo present our data here along with a discussion of therapeutic strategies for fatal arterial hemorrhage after PD.METHODSWe retrospectively investigated 16 patients who developed arterial hemorrhage after PD. The patients' clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, actual treatments [transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE), stent-graft placement, or surgery], clinical courses, and outcomes were evaluated.RESULTSThe frequency of arterial hemorrhage after PD was 5.5%. Pancreatic leakage was observed in 12 patients. The onset of hemorrhage occurred at a median of 18 d after PD. Sentinel bleeding was observed in five patients. The initial EVT procedures were stent-graft placement in seven patients, TAE in six patients, and combined therapy in two patients. The rate of technical success of the initial EVT was 75.0%, and additional EVTs were performed in four patients. Surgical approaches including arterioportal shunting were performed in eight patients. Liver infarction was observed in two patients after TAE. Two patients showed a poor outcome even after successful EVT. These four patients with poor clinical courses and outcomes had a poor clinical condition before EVT. Fourteen patients were successfully treated.CONCLUSIONTranscatheter placement of a covered stent may be useful for simultaneous accomplishment of complete hemostasis and HA flow preservation.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of albedo using MODIS and PCA analysis in Iran
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of albedo in Iran. To this aim, the daily albedo datasets of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from onboard Aqua and Terra (MCD43A3v006) were applied for the period of 2000 to 2019 with a spatial resolution of 500 x 500 m(2). First, the long-term average of Iran's albedo was calculated; the obtained results show that the average albedo of spring, summer, autumn, and winter in Iran is 13.7%, 14.7%, 15.2%, and 19.2%, respectively. Second, the temporal-spatial variations of albedo values in Iran were analyzed using principal component analysis, and the results showed that the three main components are able to explain 97% of the data variation. The first component explains more than 74% of the total changes, the second component more than 20%, and finally, the third component explains more than 3% of the changes. Finally, the linkage between the three main components with aspect, slope, and elevation was examined in Iran. The results showed that the role of solar zenith angle, elevation, and aspect in the first and third components and also the role of slope and elevation in the second component were the most significant. In general, it can be said that snow cover in the first component, salt cover in the second component, and also snow reservoirs in the third component had albedo above average; this issue depends on the roughness and the surface of the ground. The results showed that this technique is very suitable for the analysis of the spatiotemporal variations of Albedo.

TI  - Sea snail (Hexaplex trunculus) and sea cucumber (Holothuria polii) as potential sentinel species for organic pollutants and trace metals in coastal ecosystems
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal bioaccumulation of trace metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs) in sea snail (Hexaplex trunculus) and sea cucumber (Holothuria polii) from Mar Menor lagoon were characterised. The highest concentrations of p,p'-DDE were detected in the central and south part of Mar Menor lagoon. However, the highest concentrations of metals in sea snail and holothurians were detected in the influence area of El Beal wadi. Biomagnification factors (BMF) in sea snail from cockle (sea snail-cockle concentration ratio) were higher than 5 for metal and organochlorinated compounds. However, similar concentrations were observed in both species for PAHs due to gastropods capability of metabolising these pollutants. Consequently, sea snail is proposed as a sentinel for trace metals, PCBs and OCPs in the coastal lagoons, not only due to its bioaccumulation and biomagnification capacity but also the easy sampling and amply distribution in many coastal areas.

TI  - Tracking the global reduction of marine traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unparalleled global impacts on human mobility. In the ocean, ship-based activities are thought to have been impacted due to severe restrictions on human movements and changes in consumption. Here, we quantify and map global change in marine traffic during the first half of 2020. There were decreases in 70.2% of Exclusive Economic Zones but changes varied spatially and temporally in alignment with confinement measures. Global declines peaked in April, with a reduction in traffic occupancy of 1.4% and decreases found across 54.8% of the sampling units. Passenger vessels presented more marked and longer lasting decreases. A regional assessment in the Western Mediterranean Sea gave further insights regarding the pace of recovery and long-term changes. Our approach provides guidance for large-scale monitoring of the progress and potential effects of COVID-19 on vessel traffic that may subsequently influence the blue economy and ocean health. The COVID-19 response has led to unparalleled changes in the functioning of human society, from travel restrictions to changes in consumption. Here the authors use high resolution satellite data to track the global reduction in marine traffic during the pandemic, and more recent hints of recovery to pre-lockdown levels.

TI  - The furin cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is required for transmission in ferrets
T2  - NATURE MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among infected ferrets requires a functional furin cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.SARS-CoV-2 entry requires sequential cleavage of the spike glycoprotein at the S1/S2 and the S2MODIFIER LETTER PRIME cleavage sites to mediate membrane fusion. SARS-CoV-2 has a polybasic insertion (PRRAR) at the S1/S2 cleavage site that can be cleaved by furin. Using lentiviral pseudotypes and a cell-culture-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus with an S1/S2 deletion, we show that the polybasic insertion endows SARS-CoV-2 with a selective advantage in lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cells, but impairs replication in Vero E6, a cell line used for passaging SARS-CoV-2. Using engineered spike variants and live virus competition assays and by measuring growth kinetics, we find that the selective advantage in lung and primary human airway epithelial cells depends on the expression of the cell surface protease TMPRSS2, which enables endosome-independent virus entry by a route that avoids antiviral IFITM proteins. SARS-CoV-2 virus lacking the S1/S2 furin cleavage site was shed to lower titres from infected ferrets and was not transmitted to cohoused sentinel animals, unlike wild-type virus. Analysis of 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences derived from patients and 24 human postmortem tissues showed low frequencies of naturally occurring mutants that harbour deletions at the polybasic site. Taken together, our findings reveal that the furin cleavage site is an important determinant of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

TI  - Preliminary Study on the Clinical Significance and Methods of Using Carbon Nanoparticles in Endoscopic Papillary Thyroid Cancer Surgery
T2  - CONTRAST MEDIA & MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The purpose of this study was to find the clinical significance and methods of using CN in endoscopic treatment for PTC. Materials and Methods. A total of 108 cases were randomly enrolled and divided into two groups, with 50 cases in the CN injection group who were injected with CN and 58 cases in the control group with no CN injection. All cases were analyzed with the size of carcinoma, the number of lymph node, and parathyroid gland injury. Results. All operations were successfully completed. The lymph node dissection number was 274 for the control group and 322 (the rate of black stained was 87%) for the CN injection group. The average number of lymph nodes in the CN injection group was 6.44 +/- 2.08, which was significantly higher than that in the control group (4.72 +/- 1.89). The control group had a relatively higher incidence of incidental parathyroidectomy, compared to the CN injection group (27.6% in the control group vs. 12% in the CN injection group, P = 0.045). However, the incidence of hypoparathyroidism failed to show the significant difference between the two groups. Conclusion. Using CN in endoscopic PTC surgery could increase the detection rate of lymph nodes and reduce the injury of parathyroid glands to a certain extent.

TI  - Evaluating NISAR's cropland mapping algorithm over the conterminous United States using Sentinel-1 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate knowledge of the distribution, breadth and change in agricultural activity is important to food security and the related trade and policy mechanisms. Routine observations afforded by spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) allows for high-fidelity monitoring of agricultural parameters at the field scale. Here we evaluate the approach to be used for generating NASA's upcoming NASA ISRO SAR (NISAR) mission's L-band cropland product using Sentinel-1C-band data. This study uses all ascending Sentinel-1A/B data collected over the conterminous United States in 2017 to compute the coefficient of variation (CV) at 150 m x 150 m resolution and evaluates the overall accuracy (OA) of CV-based crop/non-crop classifications at 100 one-by-one degree tiles. We calculate accuracies using two approaches: (a) using a literature-recommended constant CV threshold of 0.5 (CVthr_0.5) and (b) determining optimal CV thresholds for every tile using Youden's J statistic (YJS), CVthr_YJS. These accuracy comparisons are important for determining (1) the viability of using a computationally inexpensive and straightforward approach for cropland classification over large spatial scales/diverse land covers (i. e., can accuracies >= 80% be routinely achieved?), (2) how closely OA0.5 compares to the performance ceiling (OAYJS). This information will help determine whether approach (a) is appropriate and how much potential room of improvement there could be in modifying it. Results for OA0.5 and OAYJS are 81.5% and 86.8%, respectively. A breakdown by census geographic region, showed that OA0.5 (OAYJS) exceeded 80% (90%) in the South and Midwest, but was only 76.1% (73.5%) in the West. The improvement in OAYJS mainly stems from tiles with >40% crop prevalence having about 10% greater OA values. To better examine the potential of the approach for land cover classification, results of approach (b) were also stratified by crop. Approach (b) accurately detected most non-crop classes as non-crop (>80%), but with low OAYJS values for grasslands/pasture, especially in the West. CV values for crop were distinct from non-crop indicating that the approach is suitable for crop/non-crop classifications. Because results CV values have substantial overlap within crop/non-crop classes, indicating the approach is poorly suited for land cover classifications. We also detected a strong geographic dependence of CVthr_YJS: values ranged from about 0.2 at the coasts and gradually increase to about 0.6 in the Central United States, most often falling close to 0.3 and 0.5.

TI  - The Approach to the Chinese Diplomatic Discourse
T2  - FUDAN JOURNAL OF THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This research article aims to examine the problem of comprehending Chinese diplomatic discourse. We argue that China's diplomatic discourse is a multilevel and complicated system underpinned by figurative and symbolic semantics, divergent translations into foreign languages, multidimensionality of the cognitive sphere and versatility of communication. The discussions of well-known Chinese scholars on the issue of comprehension of China's diplomatic discourse are highlighted in the article. We also analyze the concept of a "shared future for humankind," which is the systemic core of China's diplomatic discourse today and represents a brand of a global worldview promoted by Chinese leadership. We examine this concept using sociolinguistic, cognitive and pragmatic approaches.

TI  - Calibrating vegetation phenology from Sentinel-2 using eddy covariance, PhenoCam, and PEP725 networks across Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology obtained from time series of remote sensing data is relevant for a range of ecological applications. The freely available Sentinel-2 imagery at a 10 m spatial resolution with a similar to 5-day repeat cycle provides an opportunity to map vegetation phenology at an unprecedented fine spatial scale. To facilitate the production of a Europe-wide Copernicus Land Monitoring Sentinel-2 based phenology dataset, we design and evaluate a framework based on a comprehensive set of ground observations, including eddy covariance gross primary production (GPP), PhenoCam green chromatic coordinate (GCC), and phenology phases from the Pan-European Phenological database (PEP725). We test three vegetation indices (VI) - the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), and the plant phenology index (PPI) - regarding their capability to track the seasonal trajectories of GPP and GCC and their performance in reflecting spatial variabilities of the corresponding GPP and GCC phenometrics, i.e., start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS). We find that for GPP phenology, PPI performs the best, in particular for evergreen coniferous forest areas where the seasonal variations in leaf area are small and snow is prevalent during wintertime. Results are inconclusive for GCC phenology, for which no index is consistently better than the others. When comparing to PEP725 phenology phases, PPI and EVI2 perform better than NDVI regarding the spatial correlation and consistency (i.e., lower standard deviation). We also link VI phenometrics at various amplitude thresholds to the PEP725 phenophases and find that PPI SOS at 25% and PPI EOS at 15% provide the best matches with the ground-observed phenological stages. Finally, we demonstrate that applying bidirectional reflectance distribution function correction to Sentinel-2 reflectance is a step that can be excluded for phenology mapping in Europe.

TI  - How we treat locoregional melanoma
T2  - ESMO OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - Cutaneous melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer and its incidence has been increasing in the past 30 years. Although this is completely resectable in most cases, thicker melanoma and those with regional lymph-node involvement are at a high risk of relapse. In recent years, the management of locoregional disease has drastically changed. In particular, in the 8th Edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), subgroup classification of TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) has been modified, with the addition of the IIID stage. Furthermore, in recent randomized trials, completion lymph node dissection in case of sentinel lymph node biopsy positivity has not been shown to offer any improvement in overall survival versus observation. Consequently, radical dissection has been recommended as the standard treatment, but only in patients with palpable nodal metastases. However, the major novelty in the treatment of locally advanced melanoma has been the introduction of drugs, already used for metastatic disease, that have also shown clinical efficacy in the adjuvant setting. In fact, immunotherapies and, in the case of BRAF V600E/K-mutated melanoma, combination treatment of BRAF and MEK inhibitors have improved recurrence-free survival in these patients. In this paper, we will describe the current management of a patient with radically resectable melanoma and discuss the key points in light of the latest scientific evidence.

TI  - Evapotranspiration mapping of cotton fields in Brazil: comparison between SEBAL and FAO-56 method
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective was to compare the evapotranspiration of cotton (Gossypium sp. L.) estimated by the SEBAL model and the FAO-56 method, throughout the phenological cycle of the plant on eight fields located in the upper area of the Rio das Mortes basin, State of Mato Grosso-Brazil. Images from the Landsat 8 satellite were used under the Geographic Information Systems environment through the capabilities of the QGIS 3.6.2 and GRASS 7.6.1 software. The reference evapotranspiration was determined by the FAO Penman-Monteith method implementing the Ref-ET software and data from the Campo Verde meteorological station of INMET-Brazil. The R software was applied to the statistical analyses of correlation and regression. The dataset of the available stages of the cotton phenological cycle shows a strong positive correlation, with approximately 68% of the evapotranspiration variation of the SEBAL model related to the estimates of the FAO-56 method.

M3  - Article
AB  - Following the progress of satellite data assimilation in the 1990s, the combination of meteorological satellites and numerical models has changed the way scientists understand the earth. With the evolution of numerical weather prediction models and earth system models, meteorological satellites will play a more important role in earth sciences in the future. As part of the space-based infrastructure, the Fengyun (FY) meteorological satellites have contributed to earth science sustainability studies through an open data policy and stable data quality since the first launch of the FY-1A satellite in 1988. The capability of earth system monitoring was greatly enhanced after the second-generation polar orbiting FY-3 satellites and geostationary orbiting FY-4 satellites were developed. Meanwhile, the quality of the products generated from the FY-3 and FY-4 satellites is comparable to the well-known MODIS products. FY satellite data has been utilized broadly in weather forecasting, climate and climate change investigations, environmental disaster monitoring, etc. This article reviews the instruments mounted on the FY satellites. Sensor-dependent level 1 products (radiance data) and inversion algorithm-dependent level 2 products (geophysical parameters) are introduced. As an example, some typical geophysical parameters, such as wildfires, lightning, vegetation indices, aerosol products, soil moisture, and precipitation estimation have been demonstrated and validated by in-situ observations and other well-known satellite products. To help users access the FY products, a set of data sharing systems has been developed and operated. The newly developed data sharing system based on cloud technology has been illustrated to improve the efficiency of data delivery.

TI  - In-Flight Spectral Response Function Retrieval of a Multispectral Radiometer Based on the Functional Data Analysis Technique
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spectral response function (SRF) is a crucial parameter in multispectral radiometers, and it influences the radiometric calibration accuracy and quantitative application capabilities. The in-flight SRF often has errors due to prelaunch contamination or postlaunch degradation. This study proposes an innovative new method to retrieve SRFs of multispectral radiometers based on intercomparisons with hyperspectral sounders via the functional data analysis (FDA) technique. Under the FDA framework, all variables, including the hyperspectral radiance and SRF, are regarded as functions rather than discrete data by expanding in the Fourier functional basis. The forward convolution equation is processed directly into a functional integration model rather than a normally pointwise summation; this ensures that the unknown quantities are transformed from numerous SRF samples to several function parameters, thus avoiding the ill-posed problem. The proposed algorithm is verified with both simulated and real data from multiple thermal infrared bands of the FY-3 IRAS and FY-4 AGRI using collocations with METOP-B IASI. All these results demonstrate our algorithm's qualitative and quantitative effectiveness for infrared SRF retrieval. Although the demonstrations are particularly relevant to infrared spectra, the algorithm is universal and also applicable to other spectral bands.

TI  - Mitigation of Ionospheric Noise in Azimuth Offset Based on the Split-Spectrum Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The pixel-offset method has been utilized as a powerful tool to measure large ground movements. However, L-band spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are often affected by the ionosphere, which produces serious noises in the azimuth component of the pixel offset field, called as azimuth streaks. Here, we propose a new method to mitigate azimuth streaks based on physical modeling. Azimuth streaks cannot be removed by simply combining the known relationship between ionospheric azimuth offset and the ionospheric phase delay with the phase delay obtained by the split-spectrum method. Thus, taking into account that image matching (coregistration) affects the measurement of azimuth offsets, we formulate a theoretical correction formula of azimuth streaks by subtracting the coregistration-induced effects approximated by a polynomial function from ionospheric azimuth offsets modeled using the split-spectrum method. Applying the method to two pairs of Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2)/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) stripmap images which are severely affected by the ionosphere, we demonstrate effective mitigation of azimuth streaks. In the application to the case that no significant ground movement is detected by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), while the standard deviation of azimuth pixel offset before the correction is 87.2 cm, the value after the correction is 29.2 cm, which is comparable to the theoretical measurement accuracy of the azimuth pixel offset. In the application to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, we substantially reduce the azimuth streaks and successfully extract the ground movements from the azimuth offset fields within an accuracy of about 20 cm. The result suggests the proposed method enables more accurate and operational estimation of the 3-D ground displacement.

TI  - Uncertainty of land surface model and land use data on WRF model simulations over China
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The land-atmosphere interaction has been considered one of the most important part for weather prediction and climate modeling. To evaluate the uncertainty coming from land surface models (LSMs) and land use (LU) data in WRF simulated climatology over China, we have conducted fifteen 10-year simulations from 1996 to 2005 with three LSMs (NOAH, CLM and RUC) and five LU data sets (MODIS, HYDE, HH, RF and CESM). Compared to the MODIS, the most major differences for HYDE, HH and RF include the reduction of the barren or sparsely vegetated area and the CESM map shows the largest arid and semi-arid area. Based on performance evaluation of WRF model, the uncertainties of LSMs and LU data are analyzed in a three-dimension aspect: the magnitudes of response, spatial and temporal patterns. The impact of LSM and LU data is statistically significant in some regions and the LSM effect is substantially higher than the LU data especially for precipitation. The temporal effect of combinations of LSM and LU data varied across regions. For temperature, we find that the effects of LSMs and LU data on the spatial pattern and magnitude are one order smaller than those on temporal pattern, and the uncertainties from LSMs and LU datasets are as the same order when considering the temporal and spatial patterns. The results also indicate that the uncertainty of LU data on precipitation is much smaller than that of LSMs on magnitude and spatial patterns. These findings reflect that the relative importance of LSMs and LU data in the WRF climate modeling largely depends on the specific LSM.

TI  - Spectral index to improve the extraction of built-up area from WorldView-2 imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, the unprecedented increase in population in many cities has led to rapid changes in urban landscape, which requires timely assessments and monitoring. Accurate determination of built-up information is vital for urban planning and environmental management. Often, the determination of the built-up area information has been dependent on field surveys, which is laborious and time-consuming. Remote sensing data are the only option for deriving spatially explicit and timely built-up area information. There are few spectral indices for built-up areas and often not accurate as they are specific to impervious material, age, colour, and thickness, especially using higher resolution images. The objective of this study is to test the utility of a new built-up extraction index (NBEI) using WorldView-2 (WV-2) to improve built-up material mapping irrespective of material type, age, and color. The new index was derived from spectral bands such as green, red edge, NIR1, and NIR2 bands that profoundly explain the variation in built-up areas on WV-2 image. The result showed that NBEI improves the extraction of built-up areas with high accuracy [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, (AUROC) = similar to 0.82] compared to the existing indices such as built-up area index (AUROC = similar to 0.73), built-up spectral index (AUROC = similar to 0.78), red edge/green index (AUROC = similar to 0.71) and WorldView-Built-up Index (WV-BI) (AUROC = similar to 0.67). The study demonstrated that the new built-up index could extract built-up areas using high-resolution images. The performance of NBEI could be attributed to the fact that it is not material-specific, and would be necessary for urban area mapping.

TI  - The Association of Diabetes and Hyperglycemia on Inpatient Readmissions
T2  - ENDOCRINE PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the association between inpatient glycemic control and readmission in individuals with diabetes and hyperglycemia (DM/HG).Methods: Two data sets were analyzed from fiscal years 2011 to 2013: hospital data using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for DM/HG and point of care (POC) glucose monitoring. The variables analyzed included gender, age, mean, minimum and maximum glucose, along with 4 measures of glycemic variability (GV), standard deviation, coefficient of variation, mean amplitude of glucose excursions, and average daily risk range.Results: Of 66 518 discharges in FY 2011-2013, 28.4% had DM/HG based on ICD-9 codes and 53% received POC monitoring. The overall readmission rate was 13.9%, although the rates for individuals with DM/HG were higher at 18.9% and 20.6% using ICD-9 codes and POC data, respectively. The readmitted group had higher mean glucose (169 +/- 47 mg/dL vs 158 +/- 46 mg/dL, P < .001). Individuals with severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia had the highest readmission rates. All 4 GV measures were consistent and higher in the readmitted group.Conclusion: Individuals with DM/HG have higher 30-day readmission rates than those without. Those readmitted had higher mean glucose, more extreme glucose values, and higher GV. To our knowledge, this is the first report of multiple metrics of inpatient glycemic control, including GV, and their associations with readmission. (C) 2021 AACE. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Temperature patterns along an arid coastline experiencing extreme and rapid urbanization, case study: Dubai
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Today more than one billion people are living in coastal regions, and coastal urbanization is rapidly growing worldwide. Here, we explore the impact of an extreme and rapid coastal urbanization on temperature patterns, based on MODIS data. We study Dubai, one of the fastest growing cities in the world over the last two decades. Dubai's urbanization centers along its coastline-in land, massive skyscrapers and infrastructure have been built, while in sea, just nearby, unique artificial islands have been constructed. Studying the coastline during the years of intense urbanization, we show that the coastline exhibits surface urban heat island characteristics, where the urban center experiences higher temperatures, by as much as 2.5 degrees C and more, compared to the adjacent less urbanized zones. During development, the coastal surface urban heat island has nearly doubled its size, expanding towards the newly developed areas. This newly developed zone also exhibits the largest temperature trend along the coast of over 0.1 degrees C/year on average. In addition, an opposite linear relation was found between the surface temperature and albedo trends. In sea, temperature decreases were observed, particularly over the artificial islands, exceeding & minus;0.1 degrees C/year, in one of them. The positive trends in land along with the negative trends in sea decreased the coastal sea-land temperature gradient by up to about & minus;30% in only 12 years, which also decreased the land breeze intensity. The findings shown here directly affect the local coastal population and ecosystem, exacerbate the thermal comfort, and add additional burden to this area, which is already considered as one of the warmest in the world.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Regional-level prediction model with difference equation model and fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) concentration data
T2  - MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN THE APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Accurate reporting and prediction of PM2.5 concentration is very important for improving public health. In this article, we use spectral clustering algorithm to cluster 15 cities in the Pearl River Delta. On this basis, we propose a special difference equation model, especially the use of nonlinear diffusion equations to characterize the temporal and spatial dynamic characteristics of PM2.5 propagation between and within clusters for real-time prediction. For example, through the analysis of PM2.5 concentration data for 91 consecutive days in the Pearl River Delta, and according to different accuracy definitions, the average prediction accuracy of the difference equation model in all city clusters is 97% or 88%. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the forecast data for each urban agglomeration is within 7 units ( mu g/m3). Experimental results show that the difference equation model can effectively reduce the prediction time and improve the prediction accuracy. Therefore, based on the spectral clustering algorithm and the difference equation model, the fastest prediction speed and the best prediction result can be obtained, and the problem of PM2.5 concentration prediction can be effectively solved. The research can provide decision support for local air pollution early warning and urban integrated management.

TI  - Use and Costs of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Non-Ulcerated T1b Melanoma: Analysis of a Population-Based Registry
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The utility of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for non-ulcerated T1b melanoma is debated and associated costs are poorly characterized. Prior work using institutional registries may overestimate the incidence of nodal positivity in this population. Objective The aim of this study was to estimate the use of SLNB, positivity prevalence, and procedural costs in patients with non-ulcerated T1b melanoma using a population-based registry. Methods We identified patients with clinically node-negative, non-ulcerated melanoma 0.8-1.0 mm thick (T1b according to the 8th edition standard of the American Joint Committee on Cancer) in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database from 2010 to 2016. The prevalence of SLNB procedures and positive sentinel nodes were calculated. Factors associated with SLNB and sentinel node positivity were assessed using logistic regression. Medicare reimbursement costs and patient out-of-pocket expenses for SLNB and wide local excision (WLE) versus WLE alone were estimated. Results Among 7245 included patients, 3835(53%) underwent SLNB, 156 (4.1%, 95% confidence interval 3.5-4.7) of whom had a positive SLNB. Younger age, >1 mitosis per mm(2), female sex, and truncal tumor location were associated with higher odds of positivity. The estimated SLNB cost to identify one patient with stage III disease was $71,700 (range $54,648-$83,172). Out-of-pocket expenses for a Medicare patient were estimated to be $652 for a WLE and SLNB and $79 for a WLE alone. Conclusions In this population-based study, only 4% of selected non-ulcerated T1b patients had a positive SLNB, which is lower than prior reports. At the population level, SLNB is associated with high costs per prognostic information gained.

TI  - Preoperative Nomogram for Predicting Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis Risk in Breast Cancer: A Potential Application on Omitting Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is feasible for breast cancer (BC) patients with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes; however, complications develop in some patients after surgery, although SLN metastasis is rarely found. Previous predictive models contained parameters that relied on postoperative data, thus limiting their application in the preoperative setting. Therefore, it is necessary to find a new model for preoperative risk prediction for SLN metastasis to help clinicians facilitate individualized clinical decisions.Materials and MethodsBC patients who underwent SLN biopsy in two different institutions were included in the training and validation cohorts. Demographic characteristics, preoperative tumor pathological features, and ultrasound findings were evaluated. Multivariate logistic regression was used to develop the nomogram. The discrimination, accuracy, and clinical usefulness of the nomogram were assessed using Harrell's C-statistic and ROC analysis, the calibration curve, and the decision curve analysis, respectively.ResultsA total of 624 patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled, including 444 in the training cohort and 180 in the validation cohort. Young age, high BMI, high Ki67, large tumor size, indistinct tumor margins, calcifications, and an aspect ratio >= 1 were independent predictive factors for SLN metastasis of BC. Incorporating these parameters, the nomogram achieved a robust predictive performance with a C-index and accuracy of 0.92 and 0.85, and 0.82 and 0.80 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The calibration curves also fit well, and the decision curve analysis revealed that the nomogram was clinically useful.ConclusionsWe established a nomogram to preoperatively predict the risk of SLN metastasis in BC patients, providing a non-invasive approach in clinical practice and serving as a potential tool to identify BC patients who may omit unnecessary SLN biopsy.

TI  - Spatial dependence between training and test sets: another pitfall of classification accuracy assessment in remote sensing
T2  - MACHINE LEARNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial autocorrelation is inherent to remotely sensed data. Nearby pixels are more similar than distant ones. This property can help to improve the classification performance, by adding spatial or contextual features into the model. However, it can also lead to overestimation of generalisation capabilities, if the spatial dependence between training and test sets is ignored. In this paper, we review existing approaches that deal with spatial autocorrelation for image classification in remote sensing and demonstrate the importance of bias in accuracy metrics when spatial independence between the training and test sets is not respected. We compare three spatial and non-spatial cross-validation strategies at pixel and object levels and study how performances vary at different sample sizes. Experiments based on Sentinel-2 data for mapping two simple forest classes show that spatial leave-one-out cross-validation is the better strategy to provide unbiased estimates of predictive error. Its performance metrics are consistent with the real quality of the resulting map contrary to traditional non-spatial cross-validation that overestimates accuracy. This highlight the need to change practices in classification accuracy assessment. To encourage it we developped Museo ToolBox, an open-source python library that makes spatial cross-validation possible.

TI  - Expansion and hazard risk assessment of glacial lake Jialong Co in the central Himalayas by using an unmanned surface vessel and remote sensing
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) are a severe hazard in the Himalayas. Glacial lake expansion and the corresponding volume increase play major roles in GLOFs as well as climate change. Furthermore, mass movement and dam conditions play a major role in the GLOF initiation process. Recently, because of global warming, glacial lakes in the central Himalayas have been expanding rapidly. Owing to a lack of systematic assessment and meticulous field surveys, people living downstream are at great risk of GLOFs. Comprehensive investigations and assessment of the relationships among lake expansion, lake dam conditions, and GLOF risk are urgently needed. In this study, we surveyed Jialong Co, a typical end-moraine dammed lake in Poiqu River in the central Himalayas by using Landsat and Sentinel satellite images from the past 32 years, field work, and depth measurements using an unmanned surface vessel on August 28, 2020. The results showed that Jialong Co had experienced slow-quick-slow expansion, increasing in area from 0.13 +/- 0.03 to 0.60 +/- 0.02 km(2). The lake bathymetric map revealed that the lake volume was (3.75 +/- 0.38) x 10(7) m(3) in 2020. Lake expansion occurred in the area from which the mother glacier retreated, indicating a close connection between the lake and its mother glacier and revealing that topography controlled the lake expansion process. Furthermore, thorough field work revealed that outlet dynamics and external water erosion are vulnerable elements in the disaster chain that initiate and affect the GLOF hazard of Jialong Co. Overall, this case study could help scholars understand the expansion mechanism of end-moraine dammed lakes and aid in hazard assessment of glacial lakes in the central Himalayas.

TI  - Improved YOLOv3 model for vehicle detection in high-resolution remote sensing images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vehicle detection is an important method for understanding high-resolution remote sensing images. Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based methods have improved many computer vision tasks and have achieved state-of-the-art results in many object detection datasets. Object detection of remote sensing images has been radically changed by the introduction of DCNN. Considering correlation between the scale distribution of objects and spatial resolution of remote sensing images, we propose an improved vehicle detection method based on a YOLOv3 model. A multi-scale clustering anchor box generation algorithm is proposed to obtain the anchor box parameters that match the resolution of each layer of the feature pyramid of model. This allows us to get more accurate anchor parameters. Focal loss is introduced into the default loss function to reduce the weight of negative samples, which were easily classified, that focus the model training process on samples that are difficult to classify. For the imbalance problem of positive and negative samples in the detection method based on the prior anchor box, focal loss is used to focus the model training process on samples that are difficult to classify. The experiment is performed on a dataset consisting of remote sensing images obtained from Worldview-3, and the results show that compared with the basic YOLOv3 algorithm, the average accuracy of vehicle detection is improved by 8.44%. The accuracy of vehicle detection of high-resolution remote sensing images is significantly improved while maintaining the speed of single-stage target detection. This approach is tested on an xView dataset consisting of remote sensing images obtained from Worldview-3. In addition, through using the proposed method, the average precision of vehicle detection increased by 8.44%. The experimental results show that the proposed method can be used for object detection in high-resolution remote sensing images effectively, and this method can significantly improve the performance of the model without sacrificing inference speed.

TI  - Modeling Acceleration and Deceleration Rates for Two-Lane Rural Highways Using Global Positioning System Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Several past studies developed acceleration/deceleration rate models as a function of a single explanatory variable. Most of them were spot speed studies with speeds measured at specific locations on curves (usually midpoint of the curve) and tangents to determine acceleration and deceleration rates. Fewer studies adopted an estimated value of 0.85 m/s(2) for both deceleration and acceleration rates while approaching and departing curves, respectively. In this study, instrumented vehicles with a high-end GPS (global positioning system) device were used to collect the continuous speed profile data for two-lane rural highways. The speed profiles were used to locate the speeds at the beginning and end of deceleration/acceleration on the successive road geometric elements to calculate the deceleration/acceleration rate. The influence of different geometric design variables on the acceleration/deceleration rate was analysed to develop regression models. This study also inspeced the assumption of constant operating speed on the horizontal curve. The study results indicated that mean operating speeds measured at the point of curvature (PC) or point of tangency (PT), the midpoint of curve (MC), and the end of deceleration in curve were statistically different. Acceleration/deceleration rates as a function of different geometric variables improved the accuracy of models. This was evident from model validation and comparison with existing models in the literature. The results of this study highlight the significance of using continuous speed profile data to locate the beginning and end of deceleration/acceleration and considering different geometric variables to calibrate acceleration/deceleration rate models.

TI  - Clinical relevance of a degree of extracapsular extension in a sentinel lymph node in breast cancer patients: a single-centre study
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In some breast cancer (BC) patients, an examination of lymph nodes dissected during sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) demonstrates a presence of metastatic lesions and extracapsular extension (ECE) in a SLN. This study aimed to evaluate clinical relevance of ECE in BC patients. This is a retrospective analysis of 891 patients with cancer metastases to SLN, referred to supplementary axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), hospitalized between Jan 2007 and Dec 2017. Clinical and epidemiological data was evaluated. Long-term treatment outcomes were analysed. In 433 (48.6%) patients, cancer metastases were limited to the SLN (group I), in 61 (6.8%) patients the SLN capsule was exceeded focally (<= 1 mm-group II). In 397 (44.6%) patients, a more extensive ECE was found (>1 mm-group III). Metastases to non-sentinel lymph nodes (nSLNs) were diagnosed in 27.0% patients from group I, 44.3% patients from group II and in 49.6% patients from group III. No statistically significant differences were observed in long-term treatment outcomes for compared groups. The presence of ECE is accompanied by a higher stage of metastatic lesions in the lymphatic system. The differences in this respect were statistically significant, when compared to the group of ECE(-) patients. ECE, regardless of its extent, did not impact the long-term treatment results. ECE remains an indication for supplementary ALND and for other equivalent cancer treatment procedures, regardless of ECE size.

TI  - Quantifying the effects of land use and model scale on water partitioning and water ages using tracer-aided ecohydrological models
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying how vegetation mediates water partitioning at different spatial and temporal scales in complex, managed catchments is fundamental for long-term sustainable land and water management. Estimations from ecohydrological models conceptualising how vegetation regulates the interrelationships between evapotranspiration losses, catchment water storage dynamics, and recharge and runoff fluxes are needed to assess water availability for a range of ecosystem services and evaluate how these might change under increasing extreme events, such as droughts. Currently, the feedback mechanisms between water and mosaics of different vegetation and land cover are not well understood across spatial scales, and the effects of different scales on the skill of ecohydrological models needs to be clarified. We used the tracer-aided ecohydrological model EcH(2)O-iso in an intensively monitored 66 km(2) mixed land use catchment in northeastern Germany to quantify water flux-storage-age interactions at four model grid resolutions (250, 500, 750, and 1000 m). This used a fusion of field (including precipitation, soil water, groundwater, and stream isotopes) and remote sensing data in the calibration. Multicriteria calibration across the catchment at each resolution revealed some differences in the estimation of fluxes, storages, and water ages. In general, model sensitivity decreased and uncertainty increased with coarser model resolutions. Larger grids were unable to replicate observed streamflow and distributed isotope dynamics in the way smaller pixels could. However, using isotope data in the calibration still helped constrain the estimation of fluxes, storage, and water ages at coarser resolutions. Despite using the same data and parameterisation for calibration at different grid resolutions, the modelled proportion of fluxes differed slightly at each resolution, with coarse models simulating higher evapotranspiration, lower relative transpiration, increased overland flow, and slower groundwater movement. Although the coarser resolutions also revealed higher uncertainty and lower overall model performance, the overall results were broadly similar. The study shows that tracers provide effective calibration constraints on larger resolution ecohydrological modelling and help us understand the influence of grid resolution on the simulation of vegetation-soil interactions. This is essential in interpreting associated uncertainty in estimating land use influence on large-scale "blue" (ground and surface water) and "green" (vegetation and evaporated water) fluxes, particularly for future environmental change.

TI  - Differences and similarities between the later-Wittgenstein's philosophy of religion and the Islamic mystical tradition
T2  - ASIAN PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite all fundamental divergences, the similarities formed between some interpretations of the later-Wittgenstein's philosophy of religion and the tradition of Islamic Mysticism (Sufism), can yet be philosophically recognized. These basic analogies are as follows: 1) The inextricability of belief and practice and the priority of practice over knowledge 2) The characterization of the core religious beliefs as the primal ground of man's perception and understanding, in contrast to the view that considers fundamental religious beliefs as theoretical conclusions derived from purely rational courses of reflection 3) A new practice-laden narrative of religious realism. Given that, one can even shed a new Wittgensteinian light on even the most abstract and metaphysical elements of the mystical worldview. If fundamental religious beliefs are interpreted not as metaphysical doctrines but as a set of descriptions arising from a specific form of practical life, then the ability to see a sort of transcendent and sacred unity in the whole universe will be based on a way of purposive engagement and wayfaring in the natural and social world.

TI  - Assimilation of Doppler radar radial wind data in the GRAPES mesoscale model with observation error covariances tuning
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Review
AB  - The accurate estimation of observation error statistics for high-density remote-sensing data is a fundamental step toward optimally utilizing such data, including radar data, for operational numerical weather prediction. Based on the high-resolution (3 x 3 km) GRAPES model together with the three-dimensional variational assimilation system (GRAPES_3DVAR) developed by the China Meteorological Administration, a set of assimilation processes for radar radial wind data is designed. First, a scheme is proposed to guarantee the quality of radar radial wind data by correcting the velocity ambiguity for the data. The observation error covariances of the radar data in the GRAPES_3DVAR assimilation system are re-estimated by using a diagnostic method based on analysis residuals, showing that the re-estimated radial wind observation error covariances increase with altitude. An optimal regularization parameter is selected by the L-curve method to constrain the radar observations that were assimilated using inaccurate observation error covariances. Furthermore, to verify the assimilation effects of the refined radial velocity observation error covariances and the constrained observations by the regularization parameter on the analysis and forecasting, a numerical study is carried out on typhoon Yunque, which occurred on 3 August 2018. The results show that the modified Doppler radar wind data assimilation using the re-estimated radial velocity observation error covariances enhances the wind analysis field and the water vapour transport, and accordingly obtains better short-term precipitation estimates. The radar wind data assimilation results of using the constrained observations also indicate an enhanced wind analysis field and water vapour transport, which leads to better short-term precipitation estimates.

TI  - Development and validation of nomograms for predicting axillary non-SLN metastases in breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph node macro-metastases: a retrospective analysis of two independent cohorts
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIt is reported that appropriately 50% of early breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) micro-metastases could not benefit from axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or breast-conserving surgery with whole breast irradiation. However, whether patients with 1-2 positive SLN macro-metastases could benefit from ALND remains unknown. The aim of our study was to develop and validate nomograms for assessing axillary non-SLN metastases in patients with 1-2 positive SLN macro-metastases, using their pathological features alone or in combination with STMs.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed pathological features and STMs of 1150 early breast cancer patients from two independent cohorts. Best subset regression was used for feature selection and signature building. The risk score of axillary non-SLN metastases was calculated for each patient as a linear combination of selected predictors that were weighted by their respective coefficients.ResultsThe pathology-based nomogram possessed a strong discrimination ability for axillary non-SLN metastases, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.727 (95% CI: 0.682-0.771) in the primary cohort and 0.722 (95% CI: 0.653-0.792) in the validation cohort. The addition of CA 15-3 and CEA can significantly improve the performance of pathology-based nomogram in the primary cohort (AUC: 0.773 (0.732-0.815) vs. 0.727 (0.682-0.771), P<0.001) and validation cohort (AUC: (0.777 (0.713-0.840) vs. 0.722 (0.653-0.792), P<0.001). Decision curve analysis demonstrated that the nomograms were clinically useful.ConclusionThe nomograms based on pathological features can be used to identify axillary non-SLN metastases in breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive SLN. In addition, the combination of STMs and pathological features can identify patients with patients with axillary non-SLN metastases more accurately than pathological characteristics alone.

TI  - Sub-pixel registration of multi-resolution imagery by correlation matching of the bathymetry-related features
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral imaging plays a significant role in coastal mapping and monitoring applications. For tasks involving the integration of multiple overlapped images, precise co-registration of the multisource satellite images is a crucial preliminary step. However, due to the limited terrestrial area and insufficient landscape features, the traditional methods become less efficient or even invalid in offshore island environments. This study addresses the problem by exploring the feasibility of using bathymetry information for geometric registration of satellite imagery. Instead of using the ground control points (GCPs) or extracting the tie points from the landscape features, the band ratio values are extracted from the multispectral images and are subsequently matched between different images through a correlation-based similarity measure. By searching the optimum correlation within the positioning uncertainty radius, the translation between two satellite images is estimated. Thus, the geometric inconsistency between the multispectral images of different sources and resolutions is effectively reduced. This result is obtained by using the ample bathymetry features without the aid of the GCPs and the in-situ bathymetry data. The experimental results using GeoEye-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat-8 images at Ganquan Island show that for an island setting with a limited terrestrial area, the developed method achieves sub-pixel registration accuracy (less than 2 m) in planimetry. The effect of the nonlinearity and outliers are accounted for using the Spearman correlation measure. The improvement in image alignment enables the integration of multispectral images of different sources and resolutions for producing an accurate and consistent interpretation for coastal comparative and synergistic applications.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of Water Quality Indicators in Small Lakes Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Data: Lake Bloomington and Evergreen Lake, Central Illinois, USA
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake water quality issue related to algal blooms is a serious problem in basins with abundant agricultural lands, causing harmful effects to freshwater ecosystems and decreasing water quality for human uses. Remote sensing methods have been used to monitor water quality of large lakes and coastal areas; however, few studies have been conducted to understand spectral properties of small lakes. This research explores applicability of Sentinel-2 satellite in understanding spatiotemporal patterns of water quality of two small-sized reservoirs, Lake Bloomington and Evergreen Lake, Central Illinois. We tested the feasibility of Sentinel-2 satellite data for monitoring algal blooms by comparing and calibrating multiple satellite algorithms (e.g., Bottom-of-Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance, Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI), and band ratios) against lake water quality indicator variables (e.g., chlorophyll-a, turbidity, secchi depth) obtained from water sample analysis in the laboratory or field measurements. The regression models performed better for Evergreen Lake than Lake Bloomington. Comparison of chlorophyll-a and turbidity with satellite reflectance values showed that suspended sediments contribute to the turbidity in the case of Lake Bloomington, while the algae contribute to the turbidity in Evergreen Lake. Using regression models, water quality indicator maps were created, showing the spatial pattern of algae in the lakes, generally, showing heterogeneous chlorophyll-a distribution, lower in downstream and higher in upstream areas. The study confirmed suitability of Sentinel-2 data for monitoring water quality of less turbid small-sized lake.

TI  - Crop specific algorithms trained over ground measurements provide the best performance for GAI and fAPAR estimates from Landsat-8 observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of Green Area Index (GAI) and fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR) from decametric satellites was investigated in this study using a large database of ground measurements over croplands. It covers six main crop types including rice, corn, wheat and barley, sunflower, soybean and other types of crops. Ground measurements were completed using either digital hemispherical cameras, LAI-2000 or AccuPAR devices over sites representative of a decametric pixel. Sites were spread over the globe and the data collected at several growth stages concurrently to the acquisition of Landsat-8 images. Several machine learning techniques were investigated to retrieve GAI and fAPAR from the Landsat-8 top of canopy reflectance values, either using empirical or simulated calibration databases and generic or crop-type specific algorithms.Results show that using the six Landsat-8 bands together provided the best estimates of GAI and fAPAR. Machine learning techniques trained over a dataset simulated by the PROSAIL model provided less accurate estimates of GAI and fAPAR as compared to machine learning techniques trained over the ground data collected and applied over a similar dataset (best-case scenario). All machine learning techniques performed similarly when calibrated on PROSAIL simulations. The Gaussian process regression (GPR) was the best performing machine learning technique as compared to artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine regression (SVM) and as compared to NDVI simple model when calibrated over the ground dataset in the best-case scenario. However, the performance of the GPR trained over ground data is notably degraded when applied to crop types excluded from the calibration (worst-case scenario), and models based on simulations performs similarly of even better. Furthermore, training the GPR over specific crop types was performing slightly better than training over all the crop types together if at least 100 well distributed data points were available in the training dataset. Similar conclusions were obtained for the other machine learning techniques, with crop specific empirical models providing slightly better performances with a few exceptions. Finally, GAI was estimated by GPR with a RMSE varying between 0.45 and 1.19 and fAPAR with RMSE varying between 0.07 and 0.15 depending on the crop type.

TI  - Lymph nodal radiotherapy in breast cancer: what are the unresolved issues?
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTICANCER THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the gold standard in invasive breast cancer. Axillary dissection (ALND) is controversial in some presentations.Areas covered: Key questions were formulated and explored focused on four different scenarios in adjuvant axillary radiation management in early and locally advanced breast cancer. Answers to these questions were searched in MEDLINE, PubMed from June 1946 to August 2020. Clinical trials, retrospective studies, international guidelines, meta-analysis, and reviews were explored.Expert opinion: Analysis according to biological disease characteristics is necessary to establish the impact of ALND avoidance in unexpectedly positive SLNB (pN1) in cN0 patients. A low-risk probability of axillary recurrence was observed if axillary radiotherapy (ART) or ALND were offered without impact on outcomes. Adjuvant RNI in pT1-3 pN1 treated with mastectomy or BCS should be proposed in unfavorable disease and risk factors. In ycN0 after NACT, SLNB can be offered in selected cases or ALND should be performed. After SLNB post-NACT (ypN1), ALND and adjuvant radiotherapy are mandatory.

TI  - Convolutional neural networks for water segmentation using sentinel-2 red, green, blue (RGB) composites and derived spectral indices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-real time water segmentation with medium resolution satellite imagery plays a critical role in water management. Automated water segmentation of satellite imagery has traditionally been achieved using spectral indices. Spectral water segmentation is limited by environmental factors and requires human expertise to be applied effectively. In recent years, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN's) for water segmentation has been successful when used on high-resolution satellite imagery, but to a lesser extent for medium resolution imagery. Existing studies have been limited to geographically localized datasets and reported metrics have been benchmarked against a limited range of spectral indices. This study seeks to determine if a single CNN based on Red, Green, Blue (RGB) image classification can effectively segment water on a global scale and outperform traditional spectral methods. Additionally, this study evaluates the extent to which smaller datasets (of very complex pattern, e.g harbour megacities) can be used to improve globally applicable CNNs within a specific region. Multispectral imagery from the European Space Agency, Sentinel-2 satellite (10 m spatial resolution) was sourced. Test sites were selected in Florida, New York, and Shanghai to represent a globally diverse range of waterbody typologies. Region-specific spectral water segmentation algorithms were developed on each test site, to represent benchmarks of spectral index performance. DeepLabV3-ResNet101 was trained on 33,311 semantically labelled true-colour samples. The resulting model was retrained on three smaller subsets of the data, specific to New York, Shanghai and Florida. CNN predictions reached a maximum mean intersection over union result of 0.986 and F1-Score of 0.983. At the Shanghai test site, the CNN's predictions outperformed the spectral benchmark, primarily due to the CNN's ability to process contextual features at multiple scales. In all test cases, retraining the networks to localized subsets of the dataset improved the localized region's segmentation predictions. The CNN's presented are suitable for cloud-based deployment and could contribute to the wider use of satellite imagery for water management.

TI  - Geology of the Chang'e-5 landing site: Constraints on the sources of samples returned from a young nearside mare
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extraterrestrial materials collected by sample return exploration missions have advanced our understanding of planetary formation and evolution in a profound manner. This is achieved through sophisticated laboratory sample analyses with very high precision and accuracy that are difficult to obtained by orbital or surface landing/roving explorations. Moreover, the well-known geographical location and geological context of returned samples enable the sample measurements to be fully interpreted and mapped into the entire planetary context (in contrast to meteorites where the geological context is missing). Planetary scientists have been endeavoring to collect and returned samples from extraterrestrial bodies, despite the significant costs involved.In December 2020, China's Chang'e-5 mission successfully landed in and returned lunar samples from the northeastern Oceanus Procellarum in the western lunar nearside maria. The mare basalt at the landing site has been dated to be similar to 1-2 Ga through crater population studies, much younger than any basalts in the present lunar sample collections and among the youngest maria on the global Moon (e.g., Hiesinger et al., 2011). The Chang'e-5 sample will provide an unprecedented opportunity to characterize the late-stage lunar volcanism.To fully explore the scientific potential of the Chang'e-5 returned samples and assist the on-going sample analyses and interpretations, we present an in-depth investigation of the geology of the specific Chang'e-5 landing site and the nearby vicinity using high-resolution remote sensing data sets. We characterize the detailed geological context, topography, morphology, morphometry, chemical and mineralogical composition of the local landing area. These geological characterizations lead us to identify a sequence of four geological events, including mare volcanism, tectonism, impact cratering and ejecta deposition, that have potentially affected and been recorded in the returned samples. Compositional and geochronological measurements of the Chang'e-5 samples would reconstruct a detailed regional geological evolution model of the landing area. Furthermore, most of the inferred ages of these geological events lie in the age gap of the Apollo/Luna samples. Precise determination of these ages through radiogenic isotope analyses would be invaluable in narrowing down the uncertainties of the lunar cratering chronology function and improve our understanding of the geological history of the entire Moon.

TI  - A two-step mapping of irrigated corn with multi-temporal MODIS and Landsat analysis ready data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and reliable information about irrigated croplands is important for crop water stress analysis and studies of water, energy, and food security. This study mapped irrigated and non-irrigated corn at 30 m resolution for the state of Nebraska using a two-step multi-temporal image classification of MODIS and Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD). Starting from the drought year of 2012, when there was a high contrast between irrigated and non-irrigated fields, we first conducted image classification using the 250 m MODIS multi-temporal NDVI data. Training pixels were automatically derived, based on counties with predominant irrigated and non-irrigated cornfields. The MODIS-derived irrigated vs. non-irrigated map was further spatially filtered to generate training data covering the entire Nebraska to support automated Landsat ARD classification, footprint-by-footprint. Three classification algorithms of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were implemented to classify all available Landsat ARD images within the growing season (i.e. May to November). Given the issues of scanline corrector (SLC) error and cloud contamination, the provisional Landsat-based classifications were finally gap-filled to generate a seamless statewise irrigation map guided by decreasing cross-validation accuracy. Pixel-wise accuracy assessments showed similar overall accuracies of 89.6%, 89.3%, and 90.0% for MLP, RF, and SVM, respectively. They are 3-6% higher than a commonly used gap-filing procedure based on valid (cloud free) pixel count for growing season images. The estimated areas of irrigated corn from Landsat-based mapping were consistent with the 2012 USDA county level census data (R-2 = 0.97 and RMSE = 37.70 km(2)). Using the 2012 Landsat-derived irrigation map and the USDA's annual Cropland Data Layer as inputs, we further developed training data for annual irrigation mapping between 2013 and 2018. Pixel-wise assessment of the 2016 map showed reasonable overall accuracies of 78.4-79.6% for three classification algorithms. The annual maps yielded R-2 of 0.94-0.98 and RMSE values of 37.70-57.62 km(2) for various mapping years compared with USDA county statistics. These results suggest that our proposed two-step analytical method has a high potential for automated annual irrigation mapping at 30 m spatial resolution (especially for the arid and semi-arid western U.S.), providing clear field boundaries and irrigation frequency information that are vitally important for accurate agricultural water use analysis.

TI  - Estimation of precipitation intensity based on small wisely network (SW-Net)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation estimation with high spatial and temporal resolution is very important for monitoring floods and natural disasters. At present, a couple of quantitative precipitation estimation products and research methods can successfully estimate precipitation at one hourly temporal resolution. In this study, a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was proposed to estimate the precipitation intensity based on the hyperspectral satellite FengYun-4/Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (FY-4A), and the temporal resolution is reduced to half an hour. Firstly, the importance of different channels and channel differences for precipitation intensity estimation was determined by ablation experiments. Secondly, compared with the existing model Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks-Convolutional Neural Networks (PERSIANN-CNN) and U-Net. The experimental results show that Small Wisely Network (SW-Net) provides more accurate precipitation intensity estimation, compared with PERSIANN-CNN (U-Net) in the same spatial and temporal resolutions. SW-Net outperformed PERSIANN-CNN (U-Net) by 5.9439% (5.6298%) and 6.3600 (5.8400) percentage points in the loss value and Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU), demonstrating the better feature extraction performance of the model. Furthermore, the False Alarm Ratio (FAR) of precipitation estimation with respect to Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (GPM-IMERG), for SW-Net was lower than that of PERSIANN-CNN (U-Net) by 49.2132% (49.4302%), showing the higher accuracy of proposed model.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) isolated tumor cells (ITCs) in otherwise stage I/II endometrioid endometrial cancer: To treat or not to treat?
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. To assess associations between treatment and recurrence-free survival (RFS) among patients with isolated tumor cells (ITCs) in sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) and otherwise stage I/II endometrioid endometrial cancer (EC).Methods. A multi-institutional retrospective study of patients with SLN ITCs (<200 cells and < 0.2 mm) was performed. Only patients with otherwise stage I/II EC, endometrioid histology, and no evidence of micro-or macrometastases were included. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate associations between treatment, tumor characteristics, and RFS.Results. 175 patientswere included. Median follow up timewas 31 months. 39% stage IB and 12% stage II disease. 76 (43%) received no adjuvant therapy or vaginal brachy therapy only (NAT/VBT), 21 (12%) had external beam radiation (EBRT), and 78 (45%) received chemotherapy +/- radiation. Patients who received chemotherapy more often had tumors with deep myoinvasion, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), and higher grade. Nine (5.1%) patients recurred; 5 distant, 3 retroperitoneal, and 1 vaginal. Extra-vaginal recurrences were similar in patients with or without chemotherapy (5.2% vs 3.8%, p = 0.68). After controlling for stage, LVSI and grade, chemotherapy and EBRT were not associated with RFS (HR = 0.63, 95%CI 0.11-3.52, and HR = 0.90, 95%CI 0.22-3.61, respectively). Type of lymph node dissection and ITC detection method were not associated with RFS.Conclusions. Risk of retroperitoneal and/or distant recurrence is low (4.6%) for patients with stage I/II endometrioid EC and ITCs in SLNs regardless of treatment. Our preliminary data suggests that adjuvant therapy may not be significantly associated with RFS. However, longer follow-up time and a larger sample size are needed before definitive recommendations regarding adjuvant therapy for patients with EC and only ITCs in SLN can be made.

TI  - 'Good stories get lost in bureaucracy!' Cultural biases and information for co-production
T2  - PUBLIC MONEY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is about evidencing the social value of co-produced public services. We use Mary Douglas's theory of cultural variation to frame conflicting assumptions about what kinds of information count as good and reliable. With its emphasis on active participation, equality and mutual decision-making, co-production fits what Douglas called an 'egalitarian' worldview. It aligns well with local, contextual, experiential forms of information such as storytelling. Yet in present-day public services, alternatives favour individual choice, hierarchical rules, or chance outcomes. It is comfortable but ineffective to share only information that meets the preferences of one worldview and fails to respond to others.

TI  - CNN-based burned area mapping using radar and optical data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN), a deep learning method widely applied in remote sensing-based studies in recent years, for burned area (BA) mapping combining radar and optical datasets acquired by Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 on-board sensors, respectively. Combining active and passive datasets into a seamless wall-to-wall cloud cover independent mapping algorithm significantly improves existing methods based on either sensor type. Five areas were used to determine the optimum model settings and sensors integration, whereas five additional ones were utilised to validate the results. The optimum CNN dimension and data normalisation were conditioned by the observed land cover class and data type (i.e., optical or radar). Increasing network complexity (i.e., number of hidden layers) only resulted in rising computing time without any accuracy enhancement when mapping BA. The use of an optimally defined CNN within a joint active/passive data combination allowed for (i) BA mapping with similar or slightly higher accuracy to those achieved in previous approaches based on Sentinel-1 (Dice coefficient, DC of 0.57) or Sentinel-2 (DC 0.7) only and (ii) wall-to-wall mapping by eliminating information gaps due to cloud cover, typically observed for opticalbased algorithms.

TI  - Insight into the May 2015 summit inflation event at Kilauea Volcano, Hawai'i
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We use ground and space geodetic data to study surface deformation at Kilauea Volcano from January to September 2015. This period includes an episode of heightened activity in April and May 2015 that culminated in a magmatic intrusion beneath the volcano's summit. The data set consists of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), tilt, visual and seismic time series along with 25 descending and 15 ascending acquisitions of the Sentinel-1 satellite. We identify four different stages of surface deformation and volcanic activity, which we attribute to pressure changes and the movement of magma in response to an imbalance between magma supply and withdrawal in the shallow plumbing system, eventually leading to an intrusion beneath the summit area. In particular, we model the deformation as due to pressure changes in two subsurface magma bodies: the Halema'uma'u Reservoir (HMMR) and South Caldera Reservoir (SCR). The SCR was best described by an ellipsoidal source at 2.8 (2.65-3.07 at 95% confidence) km depth below the south caldera region. The HMMR was modeled as a point source located just east of Halema'uma'u crater at 1.5 (0.95-2.62) km depth. We suggest that a short-term increase in the magma supply rate to the volcano is a potential mechanisms for the intrusion, although other factors, like the filling of available void space or a reduced efficiency of magma transport through the volcano's East Rift Zone, may also play a role.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Accuracy of computerized tomography in the preoperative evaluation of metastases in primary vulvar cancer ? A population-based study
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To investigate the impact of a preoperative CT on surgical decision making in primary vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) and the accuracy of detecting inguinal lymph node metastases (LNM). Secondly to assess prevalence and consequences of incidental findings and comorbidity using a CT.Methods. This population-based study comprised of surgically treated patients with primary VSCC, at a regional tertiary center, using the Swedish Quality Registry for Gynecological Cancer for identification, and medical records were reviewed. Results from the preoperative CT was compared with the histological analysis from the lymphadenectomy in the total cohort and between tumor size <4 cm versus >_4 cm. Results. In total 134 women had undergone CT before sentinel node (SN) biopsy (n = 83) or inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL) (n = 51). Fiftyone patients (38%) had groin LNM. Accuracy of CT in detecting groin LNM was 76%; sensitivity 43% and specificity 96%. Positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were 88% and 73% respectively. In tumors <4 cm (n = 87), sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 17%, 95%, 57% and 75% and in tumors >_4 cm (n = 47) 67%, 100%, 100% and 69% respectively. CT altered surgical method from SN biopsy to IFL in only two cases. Incidental findings led to extra follow-up resulting in a benign diagnosis in 22 patients and major important findings in five patients.Conclusion. In primary VSCC, a preoperative abdominal-inguinal CT is of limited value for surgical decision making. In tumors <4 cm, it may be omitted due to low diagnostic accuracy and disturbing incidental findings.(c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - High-risk early-stage oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma, when free margins are not enough: Critical review
T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Review
AB  - Oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) is a quite peculiar disease from an anatomical and biological standpoint. An increasing amount of literature highlights the existence of a small subset of T1-T2N0 OTSCC, properly resected on a margin-dependent basis, which conversely proved higher than expected rates of loco-regional/distant failure and disease-specific mortality. These specific high-risk tumors might not have a margin-dependent disease and could possibly benefit from a more aggressive upfront loco-regional treatment, especially addressing the so-called T-N tract. Widespread adoption of a histopathological risk model would allow early recognition of these high-risk diseases and, consequently, intensification of the traditional treatment strategies in that specific niche. We reviewed the available knowledge trying to shed light on the potential determinants of the dismal prognosis of these high-risk OTSCC, with special reference to the role of overlooked T-N tract involvement and possible alternatives in terms of elective neck management and risk stratification.

TI  - A Multifeature TDAO-AIR Clutter Classification Approach for Inshore Ambiguity Identification and Suppression With Azimuth Multichannel SAR System
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the inshore region, the azimuth ambiguity of land clutter is the main factor, which reduces the clutter suppression performance for the multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system. To address this problem, we propose a multifeature tensor discriminant alternating optimization and affine invariant Riemannian (TDAO-AIR) classification approach. First, the correlation coefficient between channels is obtained to characterize the normalized SAR image amplitude. Next, multilook interferometric processing is performed to reduce the effect of Speckle noise and acquire multilook interferometric complex images. At the same time, we extract the correlation coefficient gradient and the multilook interferometric phase gradient in different spatial directions to characterize the spatial structure. Next, we construct a feature tensor (FT), including correlation coefficient between channels, multilook interferometric phase, and spatial structural gradient information for each range-Doppler unit (RDU). The TDAO algorithm is proposed to extract the core FT (CFT) by optimizing the objective function and getting the projection matrix. Then, the CFT is unfolded along the feature dimension, and the feature covariance matrix (FCM) is constructed for each RDU. With the AIR distance measure, the inshore region is divided into different clutter regions. Finally, in the azimuth ambiguous clutter region, independent and identically distributed (IID) training samples are selected to estimate the clutter covariance matrix (CCM), and robust adaptive clutter suppression is performed in the SAR image domain. The experiments on simulated and real measured data by TerraSAR-X demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately identify and suppress the azimuth ambiguity in the inshore region.

TI  - Disrupting landscape: Enacting zones of socio-material entanglement for alternative futures
T2  - EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Emerging discussions frame sites of extraction as 'zones of entanglement', and this article considers the condition of mine closure and the decision-making processes around post-mining landscape planning as one of these zones. Focusing on the recently closed Leigh Creek coal mine in South Australia, this article compares the transformation of a specific area of the mining lease by nonhumans with the community consultation processes that occurred during the mine's closure. Drawing from Karen Barad's theory of Agential Realism with the concepts of `interaction' and `intra-action', this comparison considers the way in which discursive frameworks create enclosures that prevent individual community members from enacting their ambitions for the post-mining landscape. Framing nonhumans as agentic actors this paper presents their landscape transformation as an example of what can happen if actors act both below the threshold of company awareness and from within their own worldview. It similarly explores what happens if actors reject or are unable to engage in the dominant discourses that restrict final landscape possibilities. This paper proposes that actors using distributed agency to enact sociomaterial landscape change presents a methodological alternative to individualistic forms of landscape planning embedded within risk management and economic viability frameworks.

TI  - Rapidly declining surface and terrestrial water resources in Central Asia driven by socio-economic and climatic changes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A systematic understanding of the dynamics of surface water resources and terrestrial water storage (TWS) is extremely important for human survival in Central Asia (CA) and maintaining the balance of regional ecosystems. Although several remote sensing products have been used to map surface water, the spatial resolution of some of them (hundreds of meters) is not sufficient to identify small surface water bodies, with monitoring data only being available for a few years or less. Thus, long-term continuous monitoring of surface water dynamics has not yet been achieved. To address this, we used all available Landsat images and the adjacent-years interpolation method to describe the dynamics of surface water in CA with a 30-m spatial resolution during 1990-2019. Subsequently, based on the multiple stepwise regression model, the climatic changes and human activity drivers affecting the surface water were systematically assessed. The permanent surface water areas (PSWA) of downstream countries with water scarcity decreased over time. The PSWA of Kazakhstan continues to decline at a maximum rate of 1189 km(2)/a. Additionally, human activities represented by population and reservoir areas are the dominant drivers affecting surface water resources in CA. The relationship between TWS and PSWA in CA and the constraints on social and economic development provided by the available water resources are discussed. The findings demonstrate that more than one-third of the croplands in CA are suffering from declining SWAs and TWS. The water crisis in CA has intensified, and the spatial mismatch between water and land resources is expected to remain one of the biggest challenges for future social and economic development in CA. Our dataset and findings provide high-precision surface water dynamics data that could be valuable for mitigating the water crisis in CA and provide a current scientific reference for achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - Who says "yes" to science without ethics? Acceptance of the violation of ethical norms due to scientific reasons in the context of empathy, systemizing, and the scientistic worldview
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a tension between scientific motivation for discoveries or broadening knowledge and compliance with ethical standards. What psychological factors are associated with recognizing scientific research as ethically unacceptable is of interest. The level of acceptance of the violation of ethical norms due to scientific reasons, empathy, systematization, and scientistic worldview was measured in 350 participants. A lower level of empathy and higher levels of systematization and the scientistic worldview were associated with a higher approval of the violation of ethics in scientific research. Male participants were also more willing to accept the violation of ethical norms due to scientific reasons than female participants. The above variables explained about 20% of the variance of the level of acceptance of the violation of ethical norms due to scientific reasons. Such acceptance was not related to age or the education level of the participants.

TI  - Diagnostic value of indocyanine green fluorescence guided sentinel lymph node biopsy in vulvar cancer: A systematic review
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLN) helps define lymph node status, a major prognostic factor in vulvar cancer. The aim of the current systematic review was to assess the use of indocyanine green (ICG) coupled with near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging in SLN mapping in vulvar cancer in terms of technique used, feasibility and accuracy.Data sources. We performed a systematic review using bibliographic citations from PubMed, Clinical Trials.gov, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases. MeSH terms for SLN, ICG and vulvar cancer were combined and restricted to the English language. The final search was performed on May 28, 2020. The primary outcome was to determine if the use of ICG alone in detecting SLN in womenwith vulvar canceris as accurate as the gold standard dual labeling technique.Results. Of the 34 studies initially identified, 13 were included for analysis. The SLN detection rate with ICG and NIR fluorescence ranged from 89.7 to 100%. No studies demonstrated the superiority of other detection techniques compared to ICG and NIR imaging. Lower SLN detection rates were found in studies with the most metastatic lymph nodes. No consensus was reached concerning the optimal use of ICG in terms of: injection timing or site; concentrations or volume of ICG; or use of human serum albumin or hybrid tracer. No adverse events were reported.Conclusion. ICG for SLN mapping appears to be safe in women with vulvar cancer with a detection rate similar to the current techniques. A large prospective randomized controlled study with optimization of the technique is necessary to homogenize current practice and determine the true value of ICG in vulvar cancer. PROSPERO ID.

TI  - Ultrastaging protocol in sentinel lymph node for apparent early stage ovarian cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. The objective of the present study is to determine the role of sentinel lymph node (SLN) ultrastaging in apparent early-stage ovarian cancer.Methods. We previously demonstrated the feasibility of SLN in early-stage ovarian cancer in a pilot study and in a clinical trial (NCT03452982). The SLN of the 30 patients involved in both were processed following an ultrastaging protocol. The cost of ultrastaging processing was also reported.Results. A SLN was detected in up to 91.3% and 90% in the pelvic and para-aortic region, respectively. In all cases, a SLNwas detected at least in one field, pelvic or para-aortic. Themean time from injection to SLN resection was 53.3 +/- 20.3 min. Two of 30 (6.6%) patients had a contralateral SLN in the para-aortic field, but no patients had contralateral SLN within the pelvic field after injection. The mean number of harvested SLN was 2.1 +/- 1.4 (range: 0-5) and 2.7 +/- 1.5 (range: 0-7) in the pelvic and para-aortic region, respectively. Two patients were upgraded to stage IIIA1 because of lymph node metastasis. In the first case, based on single sections and haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) examination, a pelvic SLN micrometastasis (1 mm) was found on the first H&E section. By using the ultrastaging protocol, the size of the metastasis was increased to 2.1 mm (macrometastasis). In the same patient, the ultrastaging study of the inframesenteric para-cava SLNs found isolated tumour cells in the subcapsular and interfollicular lymph nodes sinus in one of the two SLN harvested (in one of the sections at the fourth and fifth ultrastage levels). The other upstaged case was a para-aortic macrometastasis in a patient in whom the SLN was not identified in the para-aortic field because of the absence of migration from the infundibulo-pelvic stump injection.The cost of ultrastaging in each patient depended on the total number of SLN retrieved, averaging 96.8 (sic) (range: 0-230.5) and 124.5 (sic) (range: 0-322.7(sic)) for pelvic and para-aortic SLN, respectively.Conclusions. A uniformprotocol for ultrastaging is essential for lower-volumemetastasis detection and to provide reproducible information between upcoming studies, as evidence about SLN in ovarian cancer is growing.
