TI  - Outlier Reconstruction of NDVI for Vegetation-Cover Dynamic Analyses
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) contains important data for providing vegetation-cover information and supporting environmental analyses. However, understanding long-term vegetation cover dynamics remains challenging due to data outliers that are found in cloudy regions. In this article, we propose a sliding-window-based tensor stream analysis algorithm (SWTSA) for reconstructing outliers in NDVI from multitemporal optical remote-sensing images. First, we constructed a tensor stream of NDVI that was calculated from clear-sky optical remote-sensing images corresponding to seasons on the basis of the acquired date. Second, we conducted tensor decomposition and reconstruction by SWTSA. Landsat series remote-sensing images were used in experiments to demonstrate the applicability of the SWTSA. Experiments were carried out successfully on the basis of data from the estuary area of Salween River in Southeast Asia. Compared with random forest regression (RFR), SWTSA has higher accuracy and better reconstruction capabilities. Results show that SWTSA is reliable and suitable for reconstructing outliers of NDVI from multitemporal optical remote-sensing images.

TI  - Comparing satellites and vegetation indices for cover crop biomass estimation
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cost-share programs based on measures of participation rather than performance are available to farmers who plant cover crops. However, cover crops only provide significant ecological benefits like reduced nutrient loss when adequate biomass is established. The purpose of this study was to determine whether satellite imagery can effectively estimate cover crop biomass in fields with diverse species composition, and whether increased spatial resolution and satellite imaging frequency can increase biomass estimation accuracy. Aboveground biomass samples of 1 m(2) were collected for 86 sites within 26 agricultural fields containing unique cover crop species composition to assess biomass production. In-field sensors were used to measure normalized difference vege-tation index (NDVI) and groundcover percentage. Three satellites (Landsat-8 [30 m resolution], Sentinel-2 [10 m resolution], and PlanetScope [3 m resolution]) were used to calculate eight vegetation indices (VIs) for com-parison with cover crop biomass. Multiple linear regression, correlation coefficients, and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to perform hierarchical clustering to rank VIs calculated from each satellite for biomass estimation accuracy. Satellites predicted cover crop biomass at the field level very accurately (r(2) up to 0.79), demonstrating the potential of large-scale biomass estimation at relatively low cost compared to in-field sam-pling. All satellite-VI pairs estimated biomass more accurately than the in-field sensors. Performance of VIs varied by satellite, but each satellite had at least one VI that performed very well for both site-level and field-averaged data. When using PlanetScope or Landsat-8 imagery, the perpendicular vegetation index provided the most accurate cover crop biomass estimation on a per-site basis and ratio vegetation index performed best using Sentinel-2 imagery. PlanetScope was the only satellite to provide useable imagery for every site due to increased revisit period; however, its increased spatial resolution did not increase estimation accuracy overall compared to Landsat-8 or Sentinel-2.

TI  - NON-RELIGIOUS INFLUENCE OF THE UKRAINIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH OF THE MOSCOW PATRIARCHATE ON UKRAINIAN SOCIETY
T2  - OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON RELIGION IN EASTERN EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the study is provided by the Russian military invasion of Ukraine, more specifically, the hybrid nature of the war that Russia has been waging against Ukraine since 2014. The use of information technologies along with military force, among other things, provides for the involvement of the churches of the Moscow Patriarchate as an additional tool for the spread of destructive ideological influence in Ukraine. Attention to the non-religious influence of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP) on Ukrainian society is being updated against the background of the ideological confrontation between the Russian and Ukrainian worldview systems in the religious plane. The article presents the factors initiating the distribution of the Orthodox Patriarchate in independent Ukraine, highlights the elements of fundamental differences for Ukraine between the Orthodox Church of the Ukraine (OCU) and the UOC-MP, and considers the actual ways to eliminate problems associated with the functioning of the UOC-MP in Ukraine during the current Russian-Ukrainian war. In addition, some facts of collaborationism carried out by representatives of the Moscow Patriarchate in Ukraine since the annexation of Crimea and the territories of Donbass since 2014 have been studied. A parallel is drawn between the facts of cooperation with the invaders during the full-scale war of 2022 and the statements of Russian priests who give a public assessment of Russian military operations in Ukraine.

TI  - Pragmatization of Narrative in Wittgenstein's Later Philosophy: A Modern Perspective
T2  - ORGANON F
M3  - Article
AB  - The main views on the nature of narrative in Wittgenstein's later philosophy are analyzed. It is shown how, realizing the research narrative, he paid attention to the linguistic means of expression of our thoughts, reference to the actual reality, the logical component of argumentation. It is shown that in order to place worldview ac-cents more clearly and strengthen the expressive effect of thought, Wittgenstein pragmatized the narrative, in particular, used meta-phors, images of learning, took into account the historico-cultural context. It is important for him to show that the form of the narrative influences what meanings the interlocutor will comprehend. Through a system of micro-and macro-narratives, Wittgenstein intended to express his opinion as clearly as possible, although he made the reader an active participant in the narrative. The thinker did not deviate from the analytico-scientific standards of philosophizing, although he showed that the relevant analysis of the narrative is significantly complicated by the ambiguities of its interpretation, the uniqueness of human experience and the identity of each narrator's value system. It is argued that a pragmatic approach to narrative analysis signifi-cantly expands the research methodology of the analytic thinker and, accordingly, makes it possible to deepen our understanding of reality and human existence, as well as more clearly define the specifics of their knowledge.

TI  - Relative Merits of Optimal Estimation and Non-Linear Retrievals of Sea-Surface Temperature from MODIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We compared the results of an Optimal Estimation (OE) based approach for the retrieval of the skin sea surface temperature (SSTskin) with those of the traditional non-linear sea surface temperature (NLSST) algorithm. The retrievals were from radiance measurements in two infrared channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the NASA satellite Aqua. The OE used a reduced state vector of SST and total column water vapor (TCWV). The SST and atmospheric profiles of temperature and humidity from ERA5 provided prior knowledge, and we made reasonable assumptions about the variance of these fields. An atmospheric radiative transfer model was used as the forward model to simulate the MODIS measurements. The performances of the retrieval approaches were assessed by comparison with in situ measurements. We found that the OESST reduces the satellite-in situ bias, but mostly for retrievals with an already small bias between in situ and the prior SST. The OE approach generally fails to improve the SST retrieval when that difference is large. In such cases, the NLSST often provides a better estimate of the SST than the OE. The OESST also underperforms NLSST in areas that include large horizontal SST gradients.

TI  - Source Parameters and Slip Distribution of the 2019 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 5.8 Mirpur (Pakistan) Earthquake Inferred from the Corrected InSAR Observations
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - On 24 September 2019, an Mw 5.8 earthquake occurred on the Mangla-Samwal anticline near Mirpur city, Pakistan. Because the seismogenic fault is hidden and the near-field seismic data are scarce, the magnitude and slip distribution of this earthquake are not determined. Furthermore, due to small deformation and significant atmospheric noise in the coseismic interferograms, it is difficult to accurately determine source parameters and slip distribution using the original single ascending and descending Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar observations. In this article, we used Sentinel-1A satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar data to generate 60 ascending and 56 descending coseismic interferograms and performed atmospheric error correction including Kriging interpolation correction and displacement stacking to obtain more accurate coseismic displacement fields for the 2019 Mw 5.8 Mirpur earthquake. Considering the local geological structures, focal mechanism solutions, and the optimal fault parameters obtained from the coseismic displacement inversion, we determine that the strike and dip of the fault of the 2019 Mirpur earthquake are 296.3 degrees and 4.0 degrees, respectively. Based on this fault model, the fault plane was extended to 12.0 km long and 11.0 km wide and divided into subfaults of 1.0 x 1.0 km2. We inverted the coseismic displacement fields to obtain slip distribution on the fault plane. Slip is mainly distributed at a depth of 4.7 similar to 5.0 km, with a maximum of 0.95 m at a depth of 4.88 km. The slip distribution shows that this earthquake was a thrust event with right-lateral strike-slip components, which is consistent with the focal mechanism solution from the U.S. Geological Survey. The estimated geodetic moment is about 7.14 x 1017 N center dot m, equivalent to Mw 5.8.

TI  - Large-Scale Surface Water Mapping Based on Landsat and Sentinel-1 Images
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water is a highly dynamical object on the earth's surface. At present, satellite remote sensing is the most effective way to accurately depict the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of surface water on a large scale. In this study, a region-adaptive random forest algorithm is designed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) for automatic surface water mapping by using data from multi-sensors such as Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI, and Sentinel-1 SAR images as source data, and China as a case study region. The visual comparison of the mapping results with the original images under different landform areas shows that the extracted water body boundary is consistent with the water range in the image. The cross-validation with the JRC GSW validation samples shows a very high precision that the average producer's accuracy and average user's accuracy of water is 0.933 and 0.998, respectively. The average overall accuracy and average kappa is 0.966 and 0.931, respectively. The independent verification results of lakes with different areas also prove the high accuracy for our method, with a maximum average error of 3.299%. These results show that the method is an ideal way for large-scale surface water mapping with a high spatial-temporal resolution.

TI  - Local Persistent Ionospheric Positive Responses to the Geomagnetic Storm in August 2018 Using BDS-GEO Satellites over Low-Latitude Regions in Eastern Hemisphere
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the ionospheric disturbance responses over low-latitude regions by using total electron content from Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites of the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), ionosonde data and Swarm satellite data, during the geomagnetic storm in August 2018. The results show that a prominent total electron content (TEC) enhancement over low-latitude regions is observed during the main phase of the storm. There is a persistent TEC increase lasting for about 1-2 days and a moderately positive disturbance response during the recovery phase on 27-28 August, which distinguishes from the general performance of ionospheric TEC in the previous storms. We also find that this phenomenon is a unique local-area disturbance of the ionosphere during the recovery phase of the storm. The enhanced f(o)F(2) and h m F-2 of the ionospheric F2 layer is observed by SANYA and LEARMONTH ionosonde stations during the recovery phase. The electron density from Swarm satellites shows a strong equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) crest over the low-latitude area during the main phase of storm, which is simultaneous with the uplift of the ionospheric F2 layer from the SANYA ionosonde. Meanwhile, the thermosphere O/N-2 ratio shows a local increase on 27-28 August over low-latitude regions. From the above results, this study suggests that the uplift of F layer height and the enhanced O/N-2 ratio are possibly main factors causing the local-area positive disturbance responses during the recovery phase of the storm in August 2018.

TI  - Inversion Estimation of Soil Organic Matter in Songnen Plain Based on Multispectral Analysis
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2A multi-spectral remote sensing image data underwent high-efficiency differential processing to extract spectral information, which was then matched to soil organic matter (SOM) laboratory test values from field samples. From this, multiple-linear stepwise regression (MLSR) and partial least square (PLSR) models were established based on a differential algorithm for surface SOM modeling. The original spectra were subjected to basic transformations with first- and second-derivative processing. MLSR and PLSR models were established based on these methods and the measured values, respectively. The results show that Sentinel-2A remote sensing imagery and SOM content correlated in some bands. The correlation between the spectral value and SOM content was significantly improved after mathematical transformation, especially square-root transformation. After differential processing, the multi-band model had better predictive ability (based on fitting accuracy) than single-band and unprocessed multi-band models. The MLSR and PLSR models of SOM had good prediction functionality. The reciprocal logarithm first-order differential MLSR regression model had the best prediction and inversion results (i.e., most consistent with the real-world data). The MLSR model is more stable and reliable for monitoring SOM content, and provides a feasible method and reference for SOM content-mapping of the study area.

TI  - Remote Prediction of Oilseed Rape Yield via Gaofen-1 Images and a Crop Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fast and accurate prediction of crop yield at the regional scale is of great significance to food policies or trade. In this study, a new model is developed to predict the yield of oilseed rape from high-resolution remote sensing images. In order to derive this model, the ground experiment and remote sensing data analysis are carried out successively. In the ground experiment, the leaf area index (LAI) of four growing stages are measured, and a regression model is established to predict yield from ground LAI. In the remote sensing analysis, a new model is built to predict ground LAI from Gaofen-1 images where the simple ratio vegetation index at the bolting stage and the VARIgreen vegetation index at the flowering stage are used. The WOFOSTWOrld FOod STudy (WOFOST) crop model is used to generate time-series ground LAI from discontinuous ground LAI, which is calibrated coarsely with the MODerate resolution imaging spectroradiometer LAI product and finely with the ground-measured data. By combining the two conclusive formulas, an estimation model is built from Gaofen-1 images to the yield of oilseed rape. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified in Wuxue City, Hubei Province from 2014 to 2019, with the pyramid bottleneck residual network to extract oilseed rape planting areas, the proposed model to estimate yields, and the China statistical yearbooks for comparison. The validation shows that the prediction error of the proposed algorithm is less than 5.5%, which highlights the feasibility of our method for accurate prediction of the oilseed rape yield in a large area.

TI  - Forensic Hydrology: A Complete Reconstruction of an Extreme Flood Event in Data-Scarce Area
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - On 18 September 2020, the Karditsa prefecture of Thessaly region (Greece) experienced a catastrophic flood as a consequence of the IANOS hurricane. This intense phenomenon was characterized by rainfall records ranging from 220 mm up to 530 mm, in a time interval of 15 h. Extended public infrastructure was damaged and thousands of houses and commercial properties were flooded, while four casualties were recorded. The aim of this study was to provide forensic research on a reconstruction of the flood event in the vicinity of Karditsa city. First, we performed a statistical analysis of the rainfall. Then, we used two numerical models and observed data, either captured by satellites or mined from social media, in order to simulate the event a posteriori. Specifically, a rainfall-runoff CN-unit hydrograph model was combined with a hydrodynamic model based on 2D-shallow water equations model, through the coupling of the hydrological software HEC-HMS with the hydrodynamic software HEC-RAS. Regarding the observed data, the limited available gauged records led us to use a wide spectrum of remote sensing datasets associated with rainfall, such as NASA GPM-IMREG, and numerous videos posted on social media, such as Facebook, in order to validate the extent of the flood. The overall assessment proved that the exceedance probability of the IANOS flooding event ranged from 1:400 years in the low-lying catchments, to 1:1000 years in the upstream mountainous catchments. Moreover, a good performance for the simulated flooding extent was achieved using the numerical models and by comparing their output with the remote sensing footage provided by SENTINEL satellites images, along with the georeferenced videos posted on social media.

T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of land use land cover has become increasingly significant with the availability of remote sensing data. The main objective of this study is to delineate geohazard-prone areas using semi-automatic classification technique and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in Bhutan. An open-source, semi-automatic classification plugin tools in QGIS software enabled efficient and rapid conduct of land cover classification. Band sets 2-8, 8A, and 11-12 are utilized and the virtual colour composites have been used for the clustering and creation of training samples or regions of interest. An iterative self-organizing data analysis technique is used for clustering and the image is classified by a minimum distance algorithm in the unsupervised classification. The Random Forest (RF) classifier is used for the supervised classification. The unsupervised classification shows an overall accuracy of 85.47% (Kappa coefficient = 0.71) and the RF classifier resulted in an accuracy of 92.62% (Kappa coefficient = 0.86). A comparison of the classification shows a higher overall accuracy of the RF classifier with an improvement of 7.15%. The study highlights 35.59% (512,100 m(2)) of the study area under the geohazard-prone area. The study also overlaid the major landslide polygons to roughly validate the landslide hazards.

TI  - Statistical Survey of Arase Satellite Data Sets in Conjunction With the Finnish Riometer Network
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - During disturbed geomagnetic conditions, the energetic particles in the inner magnetosphere are known to undergo precipitation loss due to interaction with various plasma waves. This study, investigates the energetic particle precipitation events statistically using coordinate observations from the ground riometer network and the inner-magnetospheric satellite mission, Arase. We have compared cosmic noise absorption (CNA) data obtained from the Finnish ground riometer network located in the auroral/sub-auroral latitudes with the comprehensive data set of omnidirectional electron/proton flux and plasma waves in ELF/VLF frequency range from the Arase satellite during the overpass intervals. The study period includes one and a half years of data between March 2017 and September 2018 covering Arase conjunctions with the riometer stations from all magnetic local time sectors. The relation between the plasma flux/waves observed at the satellite with the riometer absorptions are investigated statistically for CNA (absorption >0.5 dB) and non-CNA (absorption <0.5 dB) cases separately. During CNA events, Arase observed elevated electron flux in the medium energy range (2-100 keV), and plasma wave activity in the whistler-mode frequency range (0.5-3 kHz) of the spectra. Our study provides an estimate of the statistical dependence of the electron flux and plasma wave observations at Arase with the ground reality of actual precipitation.

TI  - Remotely sensed time series of rapid terrace formation: Laguna del Viedma valley (Patagonia)
T2  - ANDEAN GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Patagonian Andes were affected by a range of geophysical drivers of landscape incision during the Last Glacial Interglacial Transition and Early Holocene. Deciphering drivers of river system response during this period is complex, and magnitudes and timescales of landscape change are poorly constrained. Herein, a remotely sensed time series of modern terrace formation is investigated from the Laguna del Viedma valley as a modern analogue of Late Quaternary landscape evolution in Patagonia. The aim of the research was to constrain the timing of terrace formation following lake level fall of the Laguna del Viedma over a 35 year period from 1985-2019. The objectives were to: 1) use satellite imagery from 1985-2019 to document glacier and lake changes in the study area; 2) map landforms of the Laguna del Viedma valley; and 3) analyse terrace elevations. In total seven terrace surfaces were distinguished, with the oldest four pre-dating the ALOS PALSAR DEM (February 2000) used. Landform evidence shows the highest, and vegetated, T1 terrace surface (+40-75 m) grades to the highest lake level and was likely the elevation of the valley floor during Holocene neoglacials. Viedma glacier recession then led to a phase of lake regressions/transgressions with an overall trend of lake level fall. The DEM shows similar to 20 m incision from the 1985 floodplain level (T3) to the T4 level floodplain by 2000. This constrains a minimum rate of incision of 1.33 m/yr, however, the satellite time series demonstrates rapid T3 terrace formation, with evidence for mass movements contributing to lateral terrace erosion by 1986. The implications of the data are discussed within the context of the Late Quaternary palaeohydrology of Patagonia where lake level falls of 10s to 100s of metres occurred within many large river systems of the Patagonian Andes from 42-52 degrees S. The data herein demonstrate that base level falls from sudden lake drainage events were likely a major driver of rapid landscape change in Patagonia during deglaciation.

TI  - Detection of Flood Extent Using Sentinel-1A/B Synthetic Aperture Radar: An Application for Hurricane Harvey, Houston, TX
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing number of flood events combined with coastal urbanization has contributed to significant economic losses and damage to buildings and infrastructure. Development of higher resolution SAR flood mapping that accurately identifies flood features at all scales can be incorporated into operational flood forecasting tools, improving response and resilience to large flood events. Here, we present a comparison of several methods for characterizing flood inundation using a combination of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing data and machine learning methods. We implement two applications with SAR GRD data, an amplitude thresholding technique applied, for the first time, to Sentinel-1A/B SAR data, and a machine learning technique, DeepLabv3+. We also apply DeepLabv3+ to a false color RGB characterization of dual polarization SAR data. Analyses at 10 m pixel spacing are performed for the major flood event associated with Hurricane Harvey and associated inundation in Houston, TX in August of 2017. We compare these results with high-resolution aerial optical images over this time period, acquired by the NOAA Remote Sensing Division. We compare the results with NDWI produced from Sentinel-2 images, also at 10 m pixel spacing, and statistical testing suggests that the amplitude thresholding technique is the most effective, although the machine learning analysis is successful at reproducing the inundation shape and extent. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of flood inundation mapping at unprecedented resolutions and its potential for use in operational emergency hazard response to large flood events.

TI  - Field Data Collection Methods Strongly Affect Satellite-Based Crop Yield Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield estimation from satellite data requires field observations to fit and evaluate predictive models. However, it is not clear how much field data collection methods matter for predictive performance. To evaluate this, we used maize yield estimates obtained with seven field methods (two farmer estimates, two point transects, and three crop cut methods) and the "true yield" measured from a full-field harvest for 196 fields in three districts in Ethiopia in 2019. We used a combination of nine vegetation indices and five temporal aggregation methods for the growing season from Sentinel-2 SR data as yield predictors in the linear regression and Random Forest models. Crop-cut-based models had the highest model fit and accuracy, similar to that of full-field-harvest-based models. When the farmer estimates were used as the training data, the prediction gain was negligible, indicating very little advantage to using remote sensing to predict yield when the training data quality is low. Our results suggest that remote sensing models to estimate crop yield should be fit with data from crop cuts or comparable high-quality measurements, which give better prediction results than low-quality training data sets, even when much larger numbers of such observations are available.

TI  - Detection and Transmission of <i>Proteus mirabilis</i> in Immunodeficient Mice
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The exclusion of opportunistic pathogens is important for protecting animal health and ensuring desired research outcomes in highly immunodeficient mice. Proteus mirabilis has been associated with gastrointestinal tract lesions, septicemia, pyelonephritis, splenomegaly, and hepatitis and can influence select mouse models. To inform health-surveillance practices after we experienced difficulty in excluding P. mirabilis from our mouse colony, we aimed to determine the likelihood of detecting P. mirabilis-positive immunocompromised (SRG), immunovague (Fbn1(+/-)), and immunocompetent (CD1) colony mice through culture and PCR testing; to evaluate transmission via 2 sentinel-based approaches (direct contact and indirect dirty-bedding transfer); and to further characterize associated pathology. We hypothesized that immunocompromised mice would be better detectors and transmitters of P. mirabilis. Multiple logistic regression models were used for analysis and included PCR copy number, repeated testing, age, sex, and antibiotic-treated (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) diet as covariates. Repeated testing over 10 wk showed that P. mirabilis-colonized immunocompromised colony mice were 95 times more likely than immunocompetent mice to test positive by culture and 30 times more likely by PCR assay. Sentinel mice were 15 times more likely to test positive by PCR assay for P. mirabilis when exposed by direct contact compared with dirty bedding and 18 times more likely to test positive when exposed to positive immunocompromised as compared with immunocompetent colony mice. After 10 wk of exposure, 3.8% of dirty-bedding sentinel PCR tests were positive, as compared with 30.7% of contact sentinels. Only immunocompromised mice on antibiotic diet (37.5%) developed lesions of the urogenital tract and abdominal cavity consistent with known pathology of P. mirabilis. Our findings suggest that PCR testing of dirty-bedding sentinels alone is not sufficient for the detection of P. mirabilis in mouse colonies. Direct-contact sentinels and testing of colony mice-especially if immunocompromised-with adjunct culture may facilitate successful bioexclusion.

TI  - Comparing the Use of Red-Edge and Near-Infrared Wavelength Ranges for Detecting Submerged Kelp Canopy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Kelp forests are commonly classified within remote sensing imagery by contrasting the high reflectance in the near-infrared spectral region of kelp canopy floating at the surface with the low reflectance in the same spectral region of water. However, kelp canopy is often submerged below the surface of the water, making it important to understand the effects of kelp submersion on the above-water reflectance of kelp, and the depth to which kelp can be detected, in order to reduce uncertainties around the kelp canopy area when mapping kelp. Here, we characterized changes to the above-water spectra of Nereocystis luetkeana (Bull kelp) as different canopy structures (bulb and blades) were submerged in water from the surface to 100 cm in 10 cm increments, while collecting above-water hyperspectral measurements with a spectroradiometer (325-1075 nm). The hyperspectral data were simulated into the multispectral bandwidths of the WorldView-3 satellite and the Micasense RedEdge-MX unoccupied aerial vehicle sensors and vegetation indices were calculated to compare detection limits of kelp with a focus on differences between red edge and near infrared indices. For kelp on the surface, near-infrared reflectance was higher than red-edge reflectance. Once submerged, the kelp spectra showed two narrow reflectance peaks in the red-edge and near-infrared wavelength ranges, and the red-edge peak was consistently higher than the near-infrared peak. As a result, kelp was detected deeper with vegetation indices calculated with a red-edge band versus those calculated with a near infrared band. Our results show that using red-edge bands increased detection of submerged kelp canopy, which may be beneficial for estimating kelp surface-canopy area and biomass.

TI  - Surface Water Dynamics from Space: A Round Robin Intercomparison of Using Optical and SAR High-Resolution Satellite Observations for Regional Surface Water Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change, increasing population and changes in land use are all rapidly driving the need to be able to better understand surface water dynamics. The targets set by the United Nations under Sustainable Development Goal 6 in relation to freshwater ecosystems also make accurate surface water monitoring increasingly vital. However, the last decades have seen a steady decline in in situ hydrological monitoring and the availability of the growing volume of environmental data from free and open satellite systems is increasingly being recognized as an essential tool for largescale monitoring of water resources. The scientific literature holds many promising studies on satellite-based surface-water mapping, but a systematic evaluation has been lacking. Therefore, a round robin exercise was organized to conduct an intercomparison of 14 different satellite-based approaches for monitoring inland surface dynamics with Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 imagery. The objective was to achieve a better understanding of the pros and cons of different sensors and models for surface water detection and monitoring. Results indicate that, while using a single sensor approach (applying either optical or radar satellite data) can provide comprehensive results for very specific localities, a dual sensor approach (combining data from both optical and radar satellites) is the most effective way to undertake largescale national and regional surface water mapping across bioclimatic gradients.

TI  - Calibration and Validation of Polarimetric ALOS2-PALSAR2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - PALSAR2 polarimetric distortion matrix is measured using corner reflectors deployed in the Amazonian forest. The Amazonian forest near the geomagnetic equator provides ideal sites for the assessment of L-band PALSAR2 antenna parameters, at free Faraday rotation. Corner reflectors (CRs) deployed at free Faraday rotation provide accurate estimation of antenna cross-talks in contrast to the biased measurements obtained with CRs deployed at significant Faraday rotation. The extended Freeman-Van Zyl calibration method introduced and validated for ALOS-PALSAR calibration is used for the assessment of PALSAR-2 calibration parameters. Six datasets collected over the Amazonian rainforests (with CRs) are used to assess PALSAR-2 distortion matrix for five beams (FP6-3 to FP6-7) with incidence angle varying from 25 degrees to 40 degrees. It is shown that the PALSAR2 antenna is highly isolated with very low cross-talks (lower than -40 dB). Finally, the impact of a significant Faraday rotation on antenna cross-talk measurements using CR is discussed.

TI  - A Prototype for Remote Monitoring of Ocean Heat Content Anomalies
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To overcome challenges with observing ocean heat content (OHC) over the entire ocean, we propose a novel approach that exploits the abundance of satellite data, including data from modern satellite geomagnetic surveys such as Swarm. The method considers a novel combination of conventional in situ (temperature and pressure) as well as satellite (altimetry and gravimetry) data with estimates of ocean electrical conductance (depth-integrated conductivity), which can potentially be obtained from magnetic observations (by satellite, land, seafloor, ocean, and airborne magnetometers). To demonstrate the potential benefit of the proposed method, we sample model output of an ocean state estimate to reflect existing observations and train a machine learning algorithm [Generalized Additive Model (GAM)] on these samples. We then calculate OHC everywhere using information potentially derivable from various global satellite coverage-including magnetic observations-to gauge the GAM's goodness of fit on a global scale. Inclusion of in situ observations of OHC in the upper 2000 m from Argo-like floats and conductance data each reduce the root-mean-square error by an order of magnitude. Retraining the GAM with recent ship-based hydrographic data attains a smaller RMSE in polar oceans than training the GAM only once on all available historical ship-based hydrographic data; the opposite is true elsewhere. The GAM more accurately calculates OHC anomalies throughout the water column than below 2000 m and can detect global OHC anomalies over multiyear time scales, even when considering hypothetical measurement errors. Our method could complement existing methods and its accuracy could be improved through careful ship-based campaign planning.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The purpose of this manuscript is to demonstrate the potential for practical implementation of a remote monitoring method for ocean heat content (OHC) anomalies. To do this, we sample data from a reanalysis product primarily because of the dearth of observations below 2000 m depth that can be used for validation and the fact that full-depth-integrated electrical seawater conductivity data products derived from satellite magnetometry are not yet available. We evaluate multiple factors related to the accuracy of OHC anomaly estimation and find that, even with hypothetical measurement errors, our method can be used to monitor OHC anomalies on multiyear time scales.

TI  - Evaluation of Land Surface Phenology for Autumn Leaf Color Change Based on Citizen Reports across Japan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Autumn foliage color is an important phenological characteristic associated with climate and appeals to populations as a cultural ecosystem service (CES). Land surface phenology (LSP) analyzed using time-series remotely sensed imagery can facilitate the monitoring of autumn leaf color change (ALCC); however, the monitoring of autumn foliage by LSP approaches is still challenging because of complex spatio-temporal ALCC patterns and observational uncertainty associated with remote sensing sensors. Here, we evaluated the performance of several LSP analysis approaches in estimation of LSP-based ALCCs against the ground-level autumn foliage information obtained from 758 sightseeing (high CES) sites across Japan. The ground information uniquely collected by citizens represented ALCC stages of greening, early, peak, late, and defoliation collected on a daily basis. The ALCC was estimated using a second derivative approach, in which normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), kernel normalized difference vegetation index (kNDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), and green red vegetation index (GRVI) were applied based on MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD09A1 with four (Beck, Elmore, Gu, and Zhang) double logistic smoothing methods in 2020. The results revealed inconsistency in the estimates obtained using different analytical methods; those obtained using EVI with the Beck model estimated the peak stage of the ALCC relatively well, while the estimates obtained using other indices and models had high discrepancies along with uncertainty. Our study provided insights on how the LSP approach can be improved toward mapping the CESs offered by autumn foliage.

TI  - A state-space model for stock assessment of cod (Gadus morhua) stock in NAFO Subdivision 3Ps.
T2  - Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat Research Document
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper describes the development of a state-space model (HYBRID) for the stock assessment of Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) Subdivision 3Ps cod stock. The HYBRID model fits to the DFO RV survey (1983-2005,2007-19) as well as the following additional survey time series: the I FREMER (Institut Francais de Recherche pour ('Exploitation de la Mer, English: French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea) ERHAPS (Evaluation des Ressources Halieutiques de la region 3PS) survey (1978-91), the Groundfish Enterprise Allocation Committee (GEAC) survey (1998-2005), and the sentinel gillnet and line-trawl surveys (1995-2018). The HYBRID model also fits to fisheries data with the expectation that the model can separate fishing mortality from natural mortality. Fisheries catch-at-age is fit using continuation ratio logits, and the fisheries landings are fit via censored likelihood. The use of censored likelihood for fitting landings allows the inclusion of expert opinion on reliability of landings throughout the model time series. The HYBRID model presented here starts in 1959, which is the first year for which landings data are available. The HYBRID model allows exploration of different forms for parameterization of time-varying fisheries selectivity, natural mortality, and approaches for estimation of catch-at-age data. The model formulations also differ depending on the survey series used in fitting the model. Seventeen model formulations are presented. Alternate formulations based on fishing mortality included: 1. a logistic flat topped or dome selectivity with time-blocks 2. SAM (State-space Assessment Model, Nielsen and Berg, 2014) style Multivariate Normal random walk 3. a separable age-year correlated process for fishing mortality rate (F) similar to NCAM (Cadigan 2016), and 4. option to break the processes for F in years where important events (like a moratorium) have impacted the fishery. Alternate formulation based on natural mortality included: 1. invariant natural mortality across age and years, and 2. time-varying natural mortality related to fish condition. The different model formulations are compared and evaluated on the basis of AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) values and their performance in retrospective analyses. The meeting concluded that time-varying natural mortality is an important consideration for modelling the dynamics of 3Ps cod and selecting a population model for this stock. Following the evaluations of the alternate model formulations, model formulations 11 which includes fit to sentinel data series, has F modelled using an MVN Random walk with year break for the moratorium, and has time-varying natural mortality rate (M) was considered to have utility as an assessment model for 3Ps cod stock assessment.

TI  - Translating Molecules into Imaging-The Development of New PET Tracers for Patients with Melanoma
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Melanoma is a deadly disease that often exhibits relentless progression and can have both early and late metastases. Recent advances in immunotherapy and targeted therapy have dramatically increased patient survival for patients with melanoma. Similar advances in molecular targeted PET imaging can identify molecular pathways that promote disease progression and therefore offer physiological information. Thus, they can be used to assess prognosis, tumor heterogeneity, and identify instances of treatment failure. Numerous agents tested preclinically and clinically demonstrate promising results with high tumor-to-background ratios in both primary and metastatic melanoma tumors. Here, we detail the development and testing of multiple molecular targeted PET-imaging agents, including agents for general oncological imaging and those specifically for PET imaging of melanoma. Of the numerous radiopharmaceuticals evaluated for this purpose, several have made it to clinical trials and showed promising results. Ultimately, these agents may become the standard of care for melanoma imaging if they are able to demonstrate micrometastatic disease and thus provide more accurate information for staging. Furthermore, these agents provide a more accurate way to monitor response to therapy. Patients will be able to receive treatment based on tumor uptake characteristics and may be able to be treated earlier for lesions that with traditional imaging would be subclinical, overall leading to improved outcomes for patients.

TI  - Biomass Assessment and Carbon Sequestration in Post-Fire Shrublands by Means of Sentinel-2 and Gaussian Processes
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this contribution, we assessed the biomass and carbon stock of a post-fire area covered by a young oak coppice of Quercus pyrenaica Willd. associated with shrubs, mainly of Cistus laurifolius L. This area was burned during the fire event of Chequilla (Guadalajara, Spain) in 2012. Sentinel-2 imagery was used together with our own forest inventories in 2020 and machine learning methods to assess the total biomass of the area. The inventory includes plots of total dry weight ranging between 6 and 14 Mg center dot ha(-1) with individuals up to 8 years old. Nonlinear, nonparametric Gaussian process regression methods were applied to link reflectance values from Sentinel-2 imagery with total shrub biomass. With a reduced inventory of only 32 plots covering 136 ha, the total biomass could be assessed with a root-mean-square error of 1.36 Mg center dot ha(-1) and a bias of -0.04 Mg center dot ha(-1), getting a relative error between 9.8% and 20.4% for the gathered biomass. This is a rather good estimation considering the little effort and time invested; thus, the suggested methodology is very suitable for forest monitoring and management.

AB  - The aim of this article is to show how the institution of a social order depends on the role of the heritage concept (patrimoni) as a logical operator, in a Catalan Pyrenean valley high-ly reliant on the heritagization of local resources. This will permit to understand how the reproduction of the social order is inextricably linked to the reinterpretation of the world-wide in which the essential local concept of heritage (patrimoni) is inscribed, as well as the means by which the discourse about the reality, what should happen and what shouldn't, is embedded in a worldview understood as the patrimony of a social group.

TI  - Vulvar Cancer: 2021 Revised FIGO Staging System and the Role of Imaging
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Primary vulvar malignancy is a rare gynecological neoplasm constituting 5-8% of cases. Considering the prognostic capability of staging, FIGO has introduced the revised 2021 staging for vulvar cancer. We review the etiopathogenesis revised 2021 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification and emphasize imaging in the staging of vulvar cancer. Vulvar cancer is a rare gynecological malignancy. It constitutes 5-8% of all gynecologic neoplasms, and squamous cell carcinoma is the most common variant. This article aims to review the etiopathogenesis revised 2021 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification and emphasize imaging in the staging of vulvar cancer. The staging has been regulated by FIGO since 1969 and is subjected to multiple revisions. Previous 2009 FIGO classification is limited by the prognostic capability, which prompted the 2021 revisions and issue of a new FIGO classification. Although vulvar cancer can be visualized clinically, imaging plays a crucial role in the staging of the tumor, assessing the tumor extent, and planning the management. In addition, sentinel lymph node biopsy facilitates the histopathological staging of the draining lymph node, thus enabling early detection of tumor metastases and better survival rates.

TI  - Development of Spatial Model for Food Security Prediction Using Remote Sensing Data in West Java, Indonesia
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The food crisis is a problem that the world will face. The availability of growing areas that continues to decrease with the increase in food demand will result in a food crisis in the future. Good planning is needed to deal with future food crises. The absence of studies on the development of spatial models in estimating an area's future food status has made planning for handling the food crisis suboptimal. This study aims to predict food security by integrating the availability of paddy fields with environmental factors to determine the food status in West Java Province. Food status modeling is done by integrating land cover, population, paddy fields productivity, and identifying the influence of environmental factors. The land cover prediction will be developed using the CA-Markov model. Meanwhile, to identify the influence of environmental factors, multivariable linear regression (MLR) was used with environmental factors from remote sensing observations. The data used are in the form of the NDDI (Normalized Difference Drought Index), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), land surface temperature (LST), soil moisture, precipitation, altitude, and slopes. The land cover prediction has an overall accuracy of up to 93%. From the food status in 2005, the flow of food energy in West Java was still able to cover the food needs and obtain an energy surplus of 6.103 Mcal. On the other hand, the prediction of the food energy flow from the food status in 2030 will not cover food needs and obtain an energy deficit of up to 13,996,292.42 Mcal. From the MLR results, seven environmental factors affect the productivity of paddy fields, with the determination coefficient reaching 50.6%. Thus, predicting the availability of paddy production will be more specific if it integrates environmental factors. With this study, it is hoped that it can be used as planning material for mitigating food crises in the future.

TI  - Estimating Aboveground Biomass of Two Different Forest Types in Myanmar from Sentinel-2 Data with Machine Learning and Geostatistical Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of spatially explicit forest aboveground biomass (AGB) provides an essential basis for sustainable forest management and carbon sequestration accounting, especially in Myanmar, where there is a lack of data for forest conservation due to operational limitations. This study mapped the forest AGB using Sentinel-2 (S-2) images and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) based on random forest (RF), stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) and Kriging algorithms in two forest reserves (Namhton and Yinmar) in Myanmar, and compared their performance against AGB measured by the traditional methods. Specifically, a suite of forest sample plots were deployed in the two forest reserves, and forest attributes were measured to calculate the plot-level AGB based on allometric equations. The spectral bands, vegetation indices (VIs) and textures derived from processed S-2 data and topographic parameters from SRTM were utilized to statistically link with field-based AGB by implementing random forest (RF) and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) algorithms. Followed by an evaluation of the algorithmic performances, RF-based Kriging (RFK) models were employed to determine the spatial distribution of AGB as an improvement of accuracy against RF models. The study's results showed that textural measures produced from wavelet analysis (WA) and vegetation indices (VIs) from Sentinel-2 were the strongest predictors for evergreen forest reserve (Namhton) AGB prediction and spectral bands and vegetation indices (VIs) showed the highest sensitivity to the deciduous forest reserve (Yinmar) AGB prediction. The fitted models were RF-based ordinary Kriging (RFOK) for Namhton forest reserve and RF-based co-Kriging (RFCK) for Yinmar forest reserve because their respective R-2, whilst the RMSE values were validated as 0.47 and 24.91 AGB t/ha and 0.52 and 34.72 AGB t/ha, respectively. The proposed random forest Kriging framework provides robust AGB maps, which are essential to estimate the carbon sequestration potential in the context of REDD+. From this particular study, we suggest that the protection/disturbance status of forests affects AGB values directly in the study area; thus, community-participated or engaged forest utilization and conservation initiatives are recommended to promote sustainable forest management.

TI  - A Study on the Dynamic Effects and Ecological Stress of Eco-Environment in the Headwaters of the Yangtze River Based on Improved DeepLab V3+Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The headwaters of the Yangtze River are a complicated system composed of different eco-environment elements. The abnormal moisture and energy exchanges between the atmosphere and earth systems caused by global climate change are predicted to produce drastic changes in these eco-environment elements. In order to study the dynamic effect and ecological stress in the eco-environment, we adapted the Double Attention Mechanism (DAM) to improve the performance of the DeepLab V3+ network in large-scale semantic segmentation. We proposed Elements Fragmentation (EF) and Elements Information Content (EIC) to quantitatively analyze the spatial distribution characteristics and spatial relationships of eco-environment elements. In this paper, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) we established sample sets based on "Sentinel-2" remote sensing images using the interpretation signs of eco-environment elements; (2) the mAP, mIoU, and Kappa of the improved DeepLab V3+ method were 0.639, 0.778, and 0.825, respectively, which demonstrates a good ability to distinguish the eco-environment elements; (3) between 2015 and 2021, EF gradually increased from 0.2234 to 0.2394, and EIC increased from 23.80 to 25.32, which shows that the eco-environment is oriented to complex, heterogeneous, and discontinuous processes; (4) the headwaters of the Yangtze River are a community of life, and thus we should build a multifunctional ecological management system with which to implement well-organized and efficient scientific ecological rehabilitation projects.

TI  - R-IMNet: Spatial-Temporal Evolution Analysis of Resource-Exhausted Urban Land Based on Residual-Intelligent Module Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The transformation of resource-exhausted urban land is an urgent problem for sustainable urban development in the world today. Obtaining the urban land use type and analyzing the changes in their land use can lead to better management of the relationship between economic development and resource utilization. In this paper, a residual-intelligent module network was proposed to solve the problems of low classification accuracy and missing objects edge information in traditional computer classification methods. The classification of four Landsat-TM/OLI images from 1993-2020 for Jiaozuo city (the first batch of resource-exhausted cities in China) was realized by this method. The results (overall accuracy was 98.61%, in 2020 images) were better than the comparison models (support vector machine, 2D-convolutional neural network, hybrid convolution networks; overall accuracy was 87.12%, 96.16%, 98.46%, respectively) and effectively reduced the loss of information on the edge of the ground objects. On this basis, six main land use types were constructed by combining field surveys and other methods. The characteristics and driving forces of spatial-temporal change in land use were explored from the aspect of social, economic and policy factors. The results showed that from 1993 to 2020 the cultivated land, forest land, water body and other land types in the study area decreased by 690.97 km(2), 57.54 km(2), 47.04 km(2) and 59.43 km(2), respectively. The construction land and bare land increased by 839.38 km(2) and 15.57 km(2), respectively. The transfer of land use types was mainly from cultivated land to construction land, with a cumulative conversion of 920.95 km(2) within 27 years. The driving forces of land use in the study area were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and regression analysis. The spatial-temporal evolution of land use types was affected by policy changes, the level of social development and the adjustment in the economy, industry and agriculture structure. The investment in fixed assets and per capita net income in rural areas were the top two influencing factors and their cumulative contribution rate was 94.62%. The findings of this study can provide scientific reference and theoretical support for land use planning, land reclamation in mining areas, ecological protection and sustainable development in Jiaozuo and other resource-exhausted cities in the world.

TI  - Influence of Open-Pit Coal Mining on Ground Surface Deformation of Permafrost in the Muli Region in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is the largest mid-to low latitude and high-altitude permafrost. Open-pit coal mining and other activities have caused serious damage to the alpine ecological environment and have accelerated the degradation of permafrost on the QTP. In this study, the influence of open-pit coal mining on the time series ground surface deformation of the permafrost in the Muli region of the QTP was analyzed from 19 January 2018 to 22 December 2020 based on Landsat, Gaofen, and Sentinel remote sensing data. The primary methods include human-computer interactive visual interpretation and the small baseline subsets interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) method. The results showed that the spatial distribution of displacement velocity exhibits a considerably different pattern in the Muli region. Alpine meadow is the main land use/land cover (LULC) in the Muli region, and the surface displacement was mainly subsidence. The surface subsidence trend in alpine marsh meadows was obvious, with a subsidence displacement velocity of 10-30 mm/a. Under the influence of changes in temperature, the permafrost surface displacement was characteristics of regular thaw subsidence and freeze uplift. Surface deformation of the mining area is relatively severe, with maximum uplift displacement velocity of 74.31 mm/a and maximum subsidence displacement velocity of 167.51 mm/a. Open-pit coal mining had resulted in the destruction of 48.73 km(2) of natural landscape in the Muli region. Mining development in the Muli region had increased the soil moisture of the alpine marsh meadow around the mining area, resulting in considerable cumulative displacement near the mining area and the acceleration of permafrost degradation.

TI  - Monitoring and Analysis of Ground Surface Settlement in Mining Clusters by SBAS-InSAR Technology
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we use the small baseline set technology and the early geological hazard identification method based on the selection of Permanent Scatter (PS) and Distributed Scatter (DS) points to carry out the research on surface deformation monitoring caused by underground activities in mining cluster areas. We adopted the Small Baseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) technique to process Sentinel-1A SAR images over the research area from March 2017 to May 2021. The deformation estimation technology based on the robustness of PS points and DS points can be used for early identification of high-density surface subsidence in a large area of mines. The surface subsidence information can be obtained quickly and accurately, and the advantages of using InSAR technology to monitor long-time surface subsidence in complex mining cluster areas was explored in this study. By comparing the monitoring data of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) ground monitoring equipment, the accuracy error of large-scale surface settlement information is controlled within 8 mm, which has high accuracy. Meanwhile, according to the spatial characteristics of cluster mining areas, it is analyzed that the relationship between adjacent mining areas through groundwater easily leads to regional associated large-area settlement changes. Compared with the D-InSAR (Differential InSAR) technology applied in mine monitoring at the early stage, this proposed method can monitor a large range of long time series and optimize the problem of decoherence to some extent in mining cluster areas. It has important reference significance for early monitoring and early warning of subsidence disaster evolution in mining intensive areas.

TI  - Resolving and Predicting Neighborhood Vulnerability to Urban Heat and Air Pollution: Insights From a Pilot Project of Community Science
T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat and air pollution, two environmental threats to urban residents, are studied via a community science project in Los Angeles, CA, USA. The data collected, for the first time, by community members, reveal the significance of both the large spatiotemporal variations of and the covariations between 2 m air temperature (2mT) and ozone (O-3) concentration within the (4 km) neighborhood scale. This neighborhood variation was not exhibited in either daily satellite observations or operational model predictions, which makes the assessment of community health risks a challenge. Overall, the 2mT is much better predicted than O-3 by the weather and research forecast model with atmospheric chemistry (WRF-Chem). For O-3, diurnal variation is better predicted by WRF-Chem than spatial variation (i.e., underestimated by 50%). However, both WRF-chem and the surface observation show the overall consistency in describing statistically significant covariations between O-3 and 2mT. In contrast, satellite-based land surface temperature at 1 km resolution is insufficient to capture air temperature variations at the neighborhood scale. Community engagement is augmented with interactive maps and apps that show the predictions in near real time and reveals the potential of green canopy to reduce air temperature and ozone; but different tree types and sizes may lead to different impacts on air temperature, which is not resolved by the WRF-Chem. These findings highlight the need for community science engagement to reveal otherwise impossible insights for models, observations, and real-time dissemination to understand, predict, and ultimately mitigate, urban neighborhood vulnerability to heat and air pollution.Plain Language Summary Heat waves and air pollution events can often occur at the same time, posing a dual threat to the public health in many urban neighborhoods. However, at or within the neighborhood scale (a couple of kilometers or less), few measurements have been taken via community engagement and little is known quantitatively about the covariation of ozone and temperature. Here, we present a summer pilot project of community science that involved similar to 1,000 (including similar to 750 K-12 students) people to study urban heat and ozone pollution in various neighborhoods in Los Angeles, CA. We summarize the methods and findings of the community engagement. Precious data collected by the community members reveals large spatial variations of ozone and temperature at the neighborhood scale, which are not resolved in the current generation of the operational (hourly) air quality forecast predictions or satellite data products. However, with observations suggesting the significant impact of canopy on air temperature and model's reliable performance in predicting observed strong ozone-temperature covariations, we suggest that green space has the potential to simultaneously mitigate the community's vulnerability to high temperature and air pollution. Future work is needed, especially via community engagement in other urban areas, to study ozone, temperature, and vegetation nexus.

TI  - Optimization of Numerical Methods for Transforming UTM Plane Coordinates to Lambert Plane Coordinates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid transformation from UTM (Universal Transverse Mecator) projection to Lambert projection helps to realize timely merging, inversion, and analysis of high-frequency partitioned remote sensing images. In this study, the transformation error and the efficiency of the linear rule approximation method, the improved linear rule approximation method, the hyperbolic transformation method, and the conformal transformation method were compared in transforming the coordinates of sample points on WGS84 (The World Geodetic System 1984)-UTM zonal projections to WGS84-Lambert projection coordinates. The effect of the grid aspect ratio on the coordinate transformation error of the conformal transformation method was examined. In addition, the conformal transformation method-based error spatial pattern of the sample points was analyzed. The results show that the conformal transformation method can better balance error and efficiency than other numerical methods. The error of the conformal transformation method is less affected by grid size. The maximum x-error is less than 0.36 m and the maximum y-error is less than 1.22 m when the grid size reaches 300 km x 300 km. The x- and y-error values decrease when square grids are used; namely, setting the grid aspect ratio close to 1 helps to weaken the effect of increasing grid area on the error. The dispersion of the error distribution and the maximum error of sample points both decrease relative to their minimum distance to the grid edge and stabilize at a minimum distance equal to 70 km. This study can support the rapid integration of massive remote sensing data over large areas.

TI  - A Novel Bayes Approach to Impervious Surface Extraction from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface as an evaluation indicator of urbanization is crucial for urban planning and management. It is necessary to obtain impervious surface information with high accuracy and resolution to meet dynamic monitoring under rapid urban development. At present, the methods of impervious surface extraction are primarily based on medium-low-resolution images. Therefore, it is of theoretical and application value to construct an impervious surface extraction method that applies to high-resolution satellite images and can solve the shadow misclassification problem. This paper builds an impervious surface extraction model by Bayes discriminant analysis (BDA). The Gaussian prior model is incorporated into the Bayes discriminant analysis to establish a new impervious surface extraction model (GBDA) applicable to high-resolution remote sensing images. Using GF-2 and Sentinel-2 remote sensing images as experimental data, we discuss and analyze the applicability of BDA and GBDA in impervious surface extraction of high-resolution remote sensing images. The results showed that the four methods, SVM, RF, BDA and GBDA, had OA values of 91.26%, 94.91%, 94.64% and 97.84% and Kappa values of 0.825, 0.898, 0.893 and 0.957, respectively, in the extraction results of GF-2. In the results of effective Sentinel-2 extraction, the OA values of the four methods were 87.94%, 91.79%, 92.19% and 93.51% and the Kappa values were 0.759, 0.836, 0.844 and 0.870, respectively. Compared with the support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and BDA methods, GBDA has significantly improved the extraction accuracy. GBDA enhances the robustness and generalization ability of the model and can improve the shadow misclassification phenomenon of high-resolution images. The model constructed in this paper is highly reliable for extracting impervious surfaces from high-resolution remote sensing images, exploring the application value of Bayes discriminant analysis in impervious surface extraction and providing technical support for impervious surface information of high spatial resolution and high quality.

TI  - Ambient Formaldehyde over the United States from Ground-Based (AQS) and Satellite (OMI) Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates formaldehyde (HCHO) over the U.S. from 2006 to 2015 by comparing ground monitor data from the Air Quality System (AQS) and a satellite retrieval from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Our comparison focuses on the utility of satellite data to inform patterns, trends, and processes of ground-based HCHO across the U.S. We find that cities with higher levels of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions, including primary HCHO, exhibit larger HCHO diurnal amplitudes in surface observations. These differences in hour-to-hour variability in surface HCHO suggests that satellite agreement with ground-based data may depend on the distribution of emission sources. On a seasonal basis, OMI exhibits the highest correlation with AQS in summer and the lowest correlation in winter. The ratios of HCHO in summer versus other seasons show pronounced seasonal variability in OMI, likely due to seasonal changes in the vertical HCHO distribution. The seasonal variability in HCHO from satellite is more pronounced than at the surface, with seasonal variability 20-100% larger in satellite than surface observations. The seasonal variability also has a latitude dependency, with more variability in higher latitude regions. OMI agrees with AQS on the interannual variability in certain periods, whereas AQS and OMI do not show a consistent decadal trend. This is possibly due to a rather large interannual variability in HCHO, which makes the small decadal drift less significant. Temperature also explains part of the interannual variabilities. Small temperature variations in the western U.S. are reflected with more quiescent HCHO interannual variability in that region. The decrease in summertime HCHO in the southeast U.S. could also be partially explained by a small and negative trend in local temperatures.

TI  - Modeling and Assessment of Vegetation Water Content on Soil Moisture Retrieval via the Synergistic Use of sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As an indispensable surface parameter, soil moisture is of great significance for analyzing global water cycle, establishing the hydrological model and assessing drought. Due to differences in the capability of establishing vegetation water content (VWC) models based on different vegetation indices, the influence of the different VWC models on retrieval accuracy has not been effectively assessed. Therefore, the suitability of vegetation parameters obtained from different VWC models established by different vegetation indices for accurate soil moisture retrieval requires further investigation. In this study, the different VWC models were established by different vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2 data and compared. Based on the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar and Sentinel-2 data, combined with microwave scattering models, the impact of different VWC models on the accuracy of soil moisture retrieval was investigated using the Look Up Table algorithm. The results indicate that, an exponential relationship between the measured VWC and different vegetation indices was obtained in the growth cycle of winter wheat, except for quadratic relationship of Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index vegetation index. Compared with other VWC models, higher accuracy of VWC could be retrieved using NDWI1, and the short-wave infrared band located at 1610 nm achieved higher accuracy than the band located at 2190 nm. With respect to all VWC models, the combination of near-infrared and short-wave infrared bands was more suitable for VWC retrieval. When the contribution of soil scattering exceeded that of vegetation scattering, the results of soil moisture retrieval with different VWC models established by vegetation indices exhibit no discernible difference, regardless of the differences that occurred in VWC itself.

TI  - Fitting Nonlinear Equations with the Levenberg-Marquardt Method on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Google Earth Engine (GEE) has been widely used to process geospatial data in recent years. Although the current GEE platform includes functions for fitting linear regression models, it does not have the function to fit nonlinear models, limiting the GEE platform's capacity and application. To circumvent this limitation, this work proposes a general adaptation of the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method for fitting nonlinear models to a parallel processing framework and its integration into GEE. We compared two commonly used nonlinear fitting methods, the LM and nonlinear least square (NLS) methods. We found that the LM method was superior to the NLS method when we compared the convergence speed, initial value stability, and the accuracy of fitted parameters; therefore, we then applied the LM method to develop a nonlinear fitting function for the GEE platform. We further tested this function by fitting a double-logistic equation with the global leaf area index (LAI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data to the GEE platform. We concluded that the nonlinear fitting function we developed for the GEE platform was fast, stable, and accurate in fitting double-logistic models with remote sensing data. Given the generality of the LM algorithm, we believe that the nonlinear function can also be used to fit other types of nonlinear equations with other sorts of datasets on the GEE platform.

TI  - Retrieval of the Leaf Area Index from MODIS Top-of-Atmosphere Reflectance Data Using a Neural Network Supported by Simulation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI), a key parameter used to characterize the structure and function of the vegetation canopy, is crucial to simulations of the carbon, nitrogen, and water cycles of Earth's system. In this paper, a neural network (NN) method coupled with vegetation canopy and atmospheric radiative transfer (RT) simulations is proposed to realize LAI retrieval without prior data support and complex atmospheric corrections. The look-up table (LUT) of the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and associated input variables was simulated by 6S (6S simulation) based on the top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance LUT simulated by PROSAIL. This was then used to train the NN to obtain the LAI inversion model. This method has been successfully applied to MODIS L1B data (MOD021KM), and the LAI retrieval of the vegetation canopy was realized. The estimated LAI was compared with the MODIS LAI (MOD15A2H) using mid-latitude summer data from 2000 to 2017 in the DIRECT 2.0 ground database. The experiments indicated that the LAI retrieved by the TOA reflectance (r = 0.7852, RMSE = 0.5191) was not much different from the LAI retrieved by the TOC reflectance (r = 0.8063, RMSE = 0.7669), and the accuracy was better than the MODIS LAI (r = 0.7607, RMSE = 0.8239), which proves the feasibility of this method.

TI  - Simulation of water and carbon coupling of the Pearl River basin based on the WaSSI model
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Watershed water and carbon cycles are closely linked through plant photosynthesis and evapotranspiration (ET). Simulation of coupled water-carbon cycles at the watershed scale is important for the comprehensive management of water and carbon resources. By improving the WaSSI (water supply stress index) eco-hydrological model, we established and verified a water-carbon coupling simulation model for the Pearl River Basin in south China (WaSSI-PRB). The Pearl River Basin was divided into 1715 watersheds. The simulations of three watercarbon flux parameters, such as runoff, ET and gross primary productivity (GPP), were verified with 1980-2004 as the calibration period and 2005-2016 as the validation period. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) and the coefficient of determination (R-2) of the simulated runoff at the controlling hydrological stations of Xijiang, Beijiang and Dongjiang were greater than 0.80 during calibration period and greater than 0.75 during validation period. Compared with MODIS, PML, SSEBop, VPM and other large-scale remote sensing data products, WASSI-PRB showed a better performance in capturing the spatiotemporal variations of ET and GPP. In general, WaSSI-PRB model had good applicability in the study area, and could be used as an effective tool to quantitatively analyze water-carbon balance and their responses to environmental changes in the Pearl River Basin.

TI  - Evaluating the Effectiveness of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models Combined Time-Series Satellite Data for Multiple Crop Types Classification over a Large-Scale Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate extraction of crop cultivated area and spatial distribution is essential for food security. Crop classification methods based on machine learning and deep learning and remotely sensed time-series data are widely utilized to detect crop planting area. However, few studies assess the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning algorithm integrated time-series satellite data for identifying multiple crop type classification over a large-scale region. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning models in crop classification and provide a framework for large-scale multiple crop type classification based on time-series of satellite data. The time-series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and NaE (combined NDVI and EVI) were adopted as input features, and four widely used machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and their integration (Stacking) were compared to examine the performance of multiple crop types (i.e., wheat, corn, wheat-corn, early rice, and early rice-late rice) classification in the North China Plain. The performance of two types of deep learning classifiers: the One-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (Conv1D) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), were also tested. The results showed that the NaE feature performed best among three input features, and the Stacking model produced the highest accuracy (77.12%) compared to other algorithms.

TI  - Comparison of the Spatial and Temporal Variability of Cloud Amounts over China Derived from Different Satellite Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Various cloud cover products have been developed over the past few decades, but their uncertainties have not been sufficiently assessed, especially at a regional scale, which is vital for the application of satellite products to climate studies. In this study, we compare the spatial-temporal variability of the cloud amount over China from the 11 datasets provided by the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) cloud assessment project at a horizontal resolution of 1 degrees x 1 degrees from the 1980s to 2000s, using the site data as a reference. The differences among these datasets are quantified in terms of the standard deviations and the correlation coefficients between different datasets. Most of the datasets show a similar spatial distribution of total cloud amounts (TCAs), but their magnitudes differ. The standard deviations of the annual, winter, and summer mean TCA are approximately 9-18% for the regional mean TCAs over the four typical regions of China, including the northwestern region (NW), northeastern region (NE), Tibetan Plateau region (TP), and southern China region (SC), with the largest standard deviations of 13-18% in the TP. By analyzing the factors that influence the satellite inversion data, such as the observation instrument, inversion algorithm, and observation time, we found that the difference caused by the observation instrument or algorithm is greater than the effect of the observation time, and the satellite cloud datasets with better recognition capability for cloud types show lower uncertainties when compared with the station observation. In terms of seasonal cycle, except HIRS and MODIS-ST, most satellite datasets can reproduce the observed seasonal cycle with the largest TCA in summer and the smallest TCA in autumn and winter. For the interannual variation, ISCCP-D1, MODIS-CE, and MODIS-ST are most consistent with the site data for the annual mean TCA, and two of the remaining datasets (PATMOSX and TOVSB) show more consistent temporal variations with the site observation in summer than in winter, especially over NW and NE regions. In general, MODIS-CE shows the best performance in reproducing the spatial pattern and interannual variation of TCA amongst the 11 satellite datasets, and PATMOSX, MODIS-ST, CALIPSO-GOCCP, and CALIPSO-ST also show relatively good performance.

T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Jingyuan County is one of the main production areas of Lycium barbarum L., an important cash crop in Northwest China. It is important to quickly and accurately obtain the information about planting structure and spatial distribution of L. barbarum for local agricultural adjustment and regional economic sustainability. Based on Sentinel-2A image data and object-oriented classification method, a random forest classifier was established, with the planting information of L. barbarum being extracted using spectral and textural features. The results showed that the random forest classification combined spectral features with textural features had the highest accuracy. The overall accuracy was 88.14%, the Kappa coefficient was 0.81, and the user accuracy of wolfberry was 81.03%. The planting area of L. barbarum in Jingyuan was 297.12 km(2), characterized by large-scale concentrated and sporadic distribution. The planting bases in several towns, including Jing' an, Wuhe, Dongsheng and Beitan, were the main distribution sites. In addition, Sentinel-2A was good at effectively extracting scattered planted L. barbarum. Our results provided support for the adjustment of planting structure and development and utilization of L. barbarum in Jingyuan County. The method used here provided reference for remote sensing monitoring of L. barbarum in a large area.

T2  - Pakistan Journal of Scientific and Industrial Research Series A-Physical Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - The existing fresh water resources are insufficient to fulfill the water requirements for different uses such as drinking, agriculture irrigation and for industrialization purposes. Present study carried out for the identification of groundwater potential zones by using Geographical Information System and Remote Sensing Techniques in the district Chakwal, a water scarce area lying in the Pothohar region of Punjab province, Pakistan. The land-use/land cover, geology, rainfall, drainage density and slope data have been incorporated to identify groundwater potential zones. Freely available landsat satellite data for landuse/landcover classification and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for the extraction of slope, drainage network have been used. However, available geological maps for the study area were incorporated as an input raster layers in analyses. Weighted Overlay analyses were performed to produce the resultant map showing the spatial distribution pattern of ground water potential. Results showed the water potential zones as; (i) unsuitable area=2756 sq.km, (ii) moderately suitable area=3256 sq.km and (iii) suitable land=3256 sq.km. North side of the district shows better water potential in comparison to the south of study area. This can be due to hard rocks in the south of study area causing inference in ground water recharge. The present highlights the usefulness of processed remote sensing satellite data and GIS techniques used for the production of ground water potential zone map.

TI  - Dual Influence of Climate Change and Anthropogenic Activities on the Spatiotemporal Vegetation Dynamics Over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau From 1981 to 2015
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and human activities have already caused degradation in a large fraction of vegetation on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Many studies report that climate variability instead of overgrazing has been the primary cause for large-scale vegetation cover changes on the QTP, for example, Lehnert et al., 2016, . However, it remains unclear how human activities (mainly livestock grazing) regulate vegetation dynamics under climate change. This paper takes the AVHRR/GIMMS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an indicator to analyze the growth status of vegetation zones in the QTP, which has highly sensitive to climate change. The spatiotemporal dynamics of vegetation growth between 1981 and 2015 were analyzed. The dual effects of climate change and human activities were examined by correlation analyses of data from 87 meteorological stations and economic statistical data of the QTP. Results show that: (a) The vegetation in central and southwestern QTP with high altitudes was improving due to the warm-humid climate trend. An increase in temperature and a reduction in the harsh frigid climate at high altitudes due to global warming has resulted in expansions of the vegetated areas, with the NDVI showing a concordant increase. (b) The degraded areas were mainly confined to the northern and eastern QTP, which have high human and livestock population densities. In comparison to gently changing climate regimes, anthropogenic activities such as chronic concentration of population and livestock in the valleys with a less harsh climate exerts a much stronger pressure on vegetation. The study indicates that the anthropogenic pressures are much more intensive than the impact of climate change and are critical for the conservation and sustainable management of the QTP vegetation.

TI  - Climate-induced fire regime amplification in Alberta, Canada
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Acting as a top-down control on fire activity, climate strongly affects wildfire in North American ecosystems through fuel moisture and ignitions. Departures from historical fire regimes due to climate change have significant implications for the structure and composition of boreal forests, as well as fire management and operations. In this research, we characterize the relationship between trends in climate and fire regime characteristics, for a study area predominantly in Alberta, Canada. We examined trends of fire and climate in northwestern boreal forests using time series analysis of downscaled historical annual climate, fire history (1970-2019), and fire severity (the impacts of wildfire on plants and organic biomass; 1985-2018). We represented fire severity using the relativized burn ratio (RBR) calculated from multispectral Landsat imagery. The climate of the study area has significantly warmed and dried over the past 50 years. Over the same period the annual number of large wildfires, area burned, and fire sizes in the study area significantly increased. Furthermore, the likelihood, area, and number of extreme short-interval reburns (<= 15 years between fires; 1985-2019) also significantly increased. During the study period, the portion of forested unburned islands within fire perimeters significantly declined, and fire severity (RBR) increased in open conifer and mixedwood forests. These fire regime changes are significantly correlated with annual climate variability, and a path analysis supports the hypothesis that annual climate patterns have led to fire regime shifts. The increasing fire activity in this region has implications for forest ecology and habitat availability, as the disruption of the fire regime is likely to alter forest recovery. Managers may face increasing challenges to fire suppression if the observed trends of increasing hotter and drier annual climate in the study area persist, driving extreme fire activity.

TI  - Physiographic Controls on Landfast Ice Variability from 20 Years of Maximum Extents across the Northwest Canadian Arctic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landfast ice is a defining feature among Arctic coasts, providing a critical transport route for communities and exerting control over the exposure of Arctic coasts to marine erosion processes. Despite its significance, there remains a paucity of data on the spatial variability of landfast ice and limited understanding of the environmental processes' controls since the beginning of the 21st century. We present a new high spatiotemporal record (2000-2019) across the Northwest Canadian Arctic, using MODIS Terra satellite imagery to determine maximum landfast ice extent (MLIE) at the start of each melt season. Average MLIE across the Northwest Canadian Arctic declined by 73% in a direct comparison between the first and last year of the study period, but this was highly variable across regional to community scales, ranging from 14% around North Banks Island to 81% in the Amundsen Gulf. The variability was largely a reflection of 5-8-year cycles between landfast ice rich and poor periods with no discernible trend in MLIE. Interannual variability over the 20-year record of MLIE extent was more constrained across open, relatively uniform, and shallower sloping coastlines such as West Banks Island, in contrast with a more varied pattern across the numerous bays, headlands, and straits enclosed within the deep Amundsen Gulf. Static physiographic controls (namely, topography and bathymetry) were found to influence MLIE change across regional sites, but no association was found with dynamic environmental controls (storm duration, mean air temperature, and freezing and thawing degree day occurrence). For example, despite an exponential increase in storm duration from 2014 to 2019 (from 30 h to 140 h or a 350% increase) across the Mackenzie Delta, MLIE extents remained relatively consistent. Mean air temperatures and freezing and thawing degree day occurrences (over 1, 3, and 12-month periods) also reflected progressive northwards warming influences over the last two decades, but none showed a statistically significant relationship with MLIE interannual variability. These results indicate inferences of landfast ice variations commonly taken from wider sea ice trends may misrepresent more complex and variable sensitivity to process controls. The influences of different physiographic coastal settings need to be considered at process level scales to adequately account for community impacts and decision making or coastal erosion exposure.

TI  - Prediction of Fine Particulate Matter Concentration near the Ground in North China from Multivariable Remote Sensing Data Based on MIV-BP Neural Network
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and industrialization lead to severe air pollution in China, threatening public health. However, it is challenging to understand the pollutants' spatial distributions by relying on a network of ground-based monitoring instruments, considering the incomplete dataset. To predict the spatial distribution of fine-mode particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution near the surface, we established models based on the back propagation (BP) neural network for PM2.5 mass concentration in North China using remote sensing products. According to our predictions, PM2.5 mass concentrations are affected by changes in surface reflectance and the dominant particle size for different seasons. The PM2.5 mass concentration predicted by the seasonal model shows a similar spatial pattern (high in the east but low in the west) influenced by the terrain, but shows high value in winter and low in summer. Compared to the ground-based data, our predictions agree with the spatial distribution of PM2.5 mass concentrations, with a mean bias of +17% in the North China Plain in 2017. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients (R) of the four seasons' instantaneous measurements are always above 0.7, indicating that the seasonal models primarily improve the PM2.5 mass concentration prediction.

However, effective distinction between cloudy and clear-sky data is still an essential prerequisite for the assimilation of microwave observations. Cloud detection over the Tibetan Plateau has long been a challenge owing to the influence of low temperatures, terrain height, surface vegetation, and inaccurate background fields. Based on the variations in the response characteristics of different channels of AMSU-A to clouds, five AMSU-A window and low-peaking channels (channels 1-4 and 15) are chosen to establish a cloud detection index. Combined with the existing MHS cloud detection index, a cloud detection scheme over the Tibetan Plateau is proposed. Referring to VISSR-II (Stretched Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer-II) and CALIPSO (The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) cloud classification products, the detection rate of cloudy data and the rejection rate of clear-sky data under different cloud index thresholds are evaluated. Results show that the new cloud detection scheme can identify more than 80% of cloudy data on average, but this decreases to 72% for area with terrain higher than 5 km, and the false deletion rate remains stable at 45%. The detection rates of mixed clouds and cumulonimbus are higher than 90%, but it is lower than 50% for altostratus with an altitude of about 7-8 km. Comparative analysis shows that the new method is more suitable for areas with terrain higher than 700 m. Based on the cloud detection results, the effects of terrain height on the characteristics of observation error and bias are also discussed for AMSU-A channels 5 and 6.

TI  - Impact of P-Chloroaniline on Oxidative Stress and Biomacromolecules Damage in the Clam <i>Ruditapes philippinarums</i>: A Simulate Toxicity Test of Spill Incident
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - As a hazardous chemical, p-chloroaniline (PCA) shows intensive adsorption and accumulation after entering the aquatic ecosystem, which can be enriched in organisms and cause damage. With the objective of achieving an integrated and mechanistic view of the toxic effects of PCA in the marine sentinel organism Ruditapes philippinarum, Manila clams were exposed to different concentration of PCA (0.5, 2 and 5 mg/L) for 15 days. Focusing on the gills, first targeting the toxic and digestive gland, the metabolic detoxification organ, we detected dose- and time-related changes inantioxidase activities and biomacromolecular damages in treated clams. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and glutathione (GSH) contents were significantly induced, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased at the beginning of exposure and then decreased. The malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein methylation (PC) contents which represent lipid peroxidation and carbonylation of proteins, increased first with exposure time and then decreased in the digestive gland. DNA strand break levels were consistently higher than those in the control group. The digestive gland showed more sensitivity to the stress of PCA than the gills. GST and MDA in the gill and GST, GSH, SOD, DNA strand break level in the digestive gland showed significant correlation with PCA exposure, which indicated that these parameters can be used as sensitive biomarkers to indicate toxic effects from chloraniline leakage.

TI  - An Observational Analysis of a Persistent Extreme Precipitation Event in the Post-Flood Season over a Tropical Island in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Featuring unique tropical land-sea contrast and mesoscale terrain, Hainan Island in China is endowed with active mesoscale convections of special regional characteristics. Persistent extreme precipitation events (PEPs) during the post-flood season, triggered by multi-scale interactions among mid-latitude and tropical weather systems, exhibit notable mesoscale features, long duration and high rainfall rates with low forecasting performance. This study is motivated by a failure to forecast a PEP in two stages with distinct characteristics and predictabilities, in the post-flood season over Hainan Island on 16-18 October 2020. Based on multiple sources of remote sensing and high-resolution rain gauge records, detailed observational analyses were conducted using a flow decomposition method. Water vapor divergence (WVD) and its three components were used to investigate the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of two stages with distinct characteristics and predictabilities during this PEP. Decomposed moisture components can be used to determine how and to what extent large- and sub-synoptic scale moisture convergence contributes to PEPs in the tropics, under similar synoptic backgrounds. Joint applications of multiple sources of remote sensing data and flow decomposed WVD are proposed to further assist predicting PEPs in terms of rainfall location and evolution.

TI  - A General Spline-Based Method for Centerline Extraction from Different Segmented Road Maps in Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Road centerline extraction is the foundation for integrating the segmented road map from a remote sensing image into a geographic information system (GIS) database. Considering that existing approaches tend to have a decline in performance for centerline and junction extraction when segmented road structures are irregular, this paper proposes a novel method which models the road network as a sequence of connected spline curves. Based on this motivation, the ratio of cross operators is firstly proposed to detect direction and width features of roads. Then, road pixels are divided into different clusters by local features using three perceptual grouping principles (i.e., direction grouping, proximity grouping, and continuity grouping). After applying a polynomial curve fitting on each cluster using pixel coordinates as observation data, the internal control points are determined according to the adjacency relation between clusters. Finally, road centerlines are generated based on spline fitting with constraints. We test our approach on segmented road maps which were obtained previously by machine recognition, or manual extraction from real optical (WorldView-2) and synthetic aperture radar (TerraSAR-X, Radarsat-2) images. Depending on the accuracy of the input segmented road maps, experimental results from our test data show that both the completeness and correctness of extracted centerlines are over 84% and 68% for optical and radar images, respectively. Furthermore, experiments also demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method, in contrast to existing methods for gaining smooth centerlines and precise junctions.

TI  - Improved Forest Canopy Closure Estimation Using Multispectral Satellite Imagery within Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The large area estimation of forest canopy closure (FCC) using remotely sensed data is of high interest in monitoring forest changes and forest health, as well as in assessing forest ecological services. The accurate estimation of FCC over the regional or global scale is challenging due to the difficulty of sample acquisition and the slow processing efficiency of large amounts of remote sensing data. To address this issue, we developed a novel bounding envelope methodology based on vegetation indices (BEVIs) for determining vegetation and bare soil endmembers using the normalized differences vegetation index (NDVI), modified bare soil index (MBSI), and bare soil index (BSI) derived from Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 image within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, then combined the NDVI with the dimidiate pixel model (DPM), one of the most commonly used spectral-based unmixing methods, to map the FCC distribution over an area of more than 90,000 km(2). The key processing was the determination of the threshold parameter in BEVIs that characterizes the spectral boundary of vegetation and soil endmembers. The results demonstrated that when the threshold equals 0.1, the extraction accuracy of vegetation and bare soil endmembers is the highest with the threshold range given as (0, 0.3), and the estimated spatial distribution of FCC using both Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images were consistent, that is, the area with high canopy density was mainly distributed in the western mountainous region of Chifeng city. The verification was carried out using independent field plots. The proposed approach yielded reliable results when the Landsat 8 data were used (R-2 = 0.6, RMSE = 0.13, and 1-rRMSE = 80%), and the accuracy was further improved using Sentinel-2 images with higher spatial resolution (R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 0.09, and 1-rRMSE = 86%). The findings demonstrate that the proposed method is portable among sensors with similar spectral wavebands, and can assist in mapping FCC at a regional scale while using multispectral satellite imagery.

TI  - Identification of Urban Functional Areas Based on the Multimodal Deep Learning Fusion of High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images and Social Perception Data
T2  - BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the basic spatial unit of urban planning and management, it is necessary to know the distribution status of urban functional areas in time. Due to the complexity of urban land use, it is difficult to identify the urban functional areas using only remote sensing images. Social perception data can provide additional information for the identification of urban functional areas. However, the sources of remote sensing data and social perception data differ, with some differences in data forms. Existing methods cannot comprehensively consider the characteristics of these data for functional area identification. Therefore, in this study, we propose a multimodal deep learning method with an attention mechanism to fully utilize the data features of these two modalities and apply it to the recognition of urban functional areas. First, the pre-processed remote sensing images, points of interest, and building footprint data are divided into block-based target units of features by the road network. Next, the remote sensing image features and social perception data features of the target unit are extracted separately using a two-branch convolutional network. Finally, features are extracted sequentially along two separate dimensions, being channel and spatial, to generate an attention weight map for the identification and classification mapping of urban functional areas. The model framework was finally applied to the Ningbo dataset for testing, and the recognition accuracy was above 93%. The experimental results deduce, as a whole, that the prediction performance of the deep multimodal fusion model framework with an attention mechanism is comparatively superior to other traditional methods. It can provide a reference for the classification of urban land use and provide data support for urban planning and management.

TI  - Explaining Unsaturated Fatty Acids (UFAs), Especially Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA) Content in Subcutaneous Fat of Yaks of Different Sex by Differential Proteome Analysis
T2  - GENES
M3  - Article
AB  - Residents on the Tibetan Plateau intake a lot of yak subcutaneous fat by diet. Modern healthy diet ideas demand higher unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), especially polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content in meat. Here, the gas chromatography (GC) and tandem mass tag (TMT) proteomic approaches were applied to explore the relationship between the proteomic differences and UFA and PUFA content in the subcutaneous fat of yaks with different sex. Compared with male yaks (MYs), the absolute contents of UFAs, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and PUFAs in the subcutaneous fat of female yaks (FYs) were all higher (p < 0.01); the relative content of MUFAs and PUFAs in MY subcutaneous fat was higher, and the value of PUFAs/SFAs was above 0.4, so the MY subcutaneous fat is more healthy for consumers. Further studies showed the transcriptional regulation by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARD) played a key role in the regulation of UFAs, especially PUFA content in yaks of different sex. In FY subcutaneous fat, the higher abundance of the downstream effector proteins in PPAR signal, including acyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), elongation of very-long-chain fatty acids protein 6 (ELOVL6), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid-binding protein (FABP1), very-long-chain (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratase 3 (HACD3), long-chain fatty acid CoA ligase 5 (ACSL5) and acyl-CoA-binding protein 2 (ACBP2), promoted the UFAs' transport and synthesis. The final result was the higher absolute content of c9-C14:1, c9-C18:1, c9,c12-C18:2n-6, c9, c12, c15-C18:3n-3, c5, c8, c11, c14, c17-C20:5n-3, c4, c7, c10, c13, -c16, c19-C22:6n-3, UFAs, MUFAs and PUFAs in FY subcutaneous fat. Further, LPL, FABP1, HACD3, ACSL1 and ACBP2 were the potential biomarkers for PUFA contents in yak subcutaneous fat. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms associated with UFA contents in yak subcutaneous fat.

TI  - PM<sub>2.5</sub> Exposure and Health Risk Assessment Using Remote Sensing Data and GIS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing personal exposure risk from PM2.5 air pollution poses challenges due to the limited availability of high spatial resolution data for PM2.5 and population density. This study introduced a seasonal spatial-temporal method of modeling PM2.5 distribution characteristics at a 1-km grid level based on remote sensing data and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The high-accuracy population density data and the relative exposure risk model were used to assess the relationship between exposure to PM2.5 air pollution and public health. The results indicated that the spatial-temporal PM2.5 concentration could be simulated by MODIS images and GIS method and could provide high spatial resolution data sources for exposure risk assessment. PM2.5 air pollution risks were most serious in spring and winter, and high risks of environmental health hazards were mostly concentrated in densely populated areas in Shanghai-Hangzhou Bay, China. Policies to control the total population and pollution discharge need follow the principle of adaptation to local conditions in high-risk areas. Air quality maintenance and ecological maintenance should be carried out in low-risk areas to reduce exposure risk and improve environmental health.

TI  - Forest Fire Monitoring and Positioning Improvement at Subpixel Level: Application to Himawari-8 Fire Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are among the biggest threats to forest ecosystems and forest resources, and can lead to ecological disasters and social crises. Therefore, it is imperative to detect and extinguish forest fires in time to reduce their negative impacts. Satellite remote sensing, especially meteorological satellites, has been a useful tool for forest-fire detection and monitoring because of its high temporal resolution over large areas. Researchers monitor forest fires directly at pixel level, which usually presents a mixture of forest and fire, but the low spatial resolution of such mixed pixels cannot accurately locate the exact position of the fire, and the optimal time window for fire suppression can thus be missed. In order to improve the positioning accuracy of the origin of forest fire (OriFF), we proposed a mixed-pixel unmixing integrated with pixel-swapping algorithm (MPU-PSA) model to monitor the OriFFs in time. We then applied the model to the Japanese Himawari-8 Geostationary Meteorological Satellite data to obtain forest-fire products at subpixel level. In this study, the ground truth data were provided by the Department of Emergency Management of Hunan Province, China. To validate the positioning accuracy of MPU-PSA for OriFFs, we applied the model to the Himawari-8 satellite data and then compared the derived fire results with fifteen reference forest-fire events that occurred in Hunan Province, China. The results show that the extracted forest-fire locations using the proposed method, referred to as forest fire locations at subpixel (FFLS) level, were far closer to the actual OriFFs than those from the modified Himawari-8 Wild Fire Product (M-HWFP). This improvement will help to reduce false fire claims in the Himawari-8 Wild Fire Product (HWFP). We conducted a comparative study of M-HWFP and FFLS products using three accuracy-evaluation indexes, i.e., Euclidean distance, RMSE, and MAE. The mean distances between M-HWFP fire locations and OriFFs and between FFLS fire locations and OriFFs were 3362.21 m and 1294.00 m, respectively. The mean RMSEs of the M-HWFP and FFLS products are 1225.52 m and 474.93 m, respectively. The mean MAEs of the M-HWFP and FFLS products are 992.12 m and 387.13 m, respectively. We concluded that the newly proposed MPU-PSA method can extract forest-fire locations at subpixel level, providing higher positioning accuracy of forest fires for their suppression.

TI  - Long-Term Spatiotemporal Patterns and Evolution of Regional Heat Islands in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous development of urbanization, the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon is becoming increasingly prominent. Especially with the development of various large urban agglomerations and the shrinking distance between cities, the regional thermal environment has attracted extensive attention. Therefore, we used Modis land surface temperature (LST) data and employed least squares, standard deviation and spatial autocorrelation analysis methods to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns and characteristics of summer daytime regional urban heat islands (RHI) in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration. Our results indicated that the relative land surface temperature (RLST) in the southeastern part of BTH with a relatively high level of urbanization showed a significant and continuous upward trend. With the continuous development of the level of urbanization in the southeast, the center of gravity (GC) of RHI gradually moved to the southeast, and the development direction of RHI changed from northwest-southeast to northeast-southwest. The area transfer of RHI was concentrated in no change and little change, indicating that the evolution trend of RHI was relatively stable. The high-high aggregation areas were mainly located in the more developed areas in the southeast. In addition, the methods and results of this study can provide reasonable and effective insights into the future development and planning of the BTH.

TI  - The Development of A Rigorous Model for Bathymetric Mapping from Multispectral Satellite-Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Models for bathymetry retrieval from multispectral images have not considered the errors caused by tidal fluctuation. A rigorous bathymetric model that considers the variation in tide height time series, including the tide height calculation and instantaneous tide height correction at the epoch of satellite flight into the bathymetric retrieval model, is proposed in this paper. The model was applied on Weizhou Island, located in Guangxi Province, China, and its accuracy verificated with four check lines and seven checkpoints. A scene from the Landsat 8 satellite image was used as experimental data. The reference ("true") water depth data collected by a RESON SeaBat 7125 multibeam instrument was used for comparison analysis. When satellite-derived bathymetry is compared, it is found that maximum absolute error, mean absolute error, and RMSE have decreased 54, 45, and 30% relative to that of the traditional model in the entire test field. The accuracy of the water depths retrieved by our model increased 30 and 56% when validated using four check lines and seven checkpoints, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the model proposed in this paper can effectively improve the accuracy of bathymetry retrieved from Landsat 8 images.

TI  - Divergent Hydrological Responses to Forest Expansion in Dry and Wet Basins of China: Implications for Future Afforestation Planning
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Afforestation to control soil erosion has been implemented throughout China over the past few decades. The long-term hydrological effects, such as total water yield and baseflow, of this large-scale anthropogenic activity remain unclear. Using six decades of hydrologic observations and remote sensing data, we explore the hydrological responses to forest expansion in four basins with contrasting climates across China. No significant change in runoff was found for the period 1970-2012 for the cold and dry Hailar River Basin in northeastern China. However, both forest expansion and reduced precipitation contributed to the runoff reduction after afforestation since the late 1990s. Similarly, afforestation and drying climate since the mid-1990s induced a significant decrease in runoff for the Weihe River Basin in semi-arid northwestern China. In contrast, the two wet basins in the humid southern China, Ganjiang River Basin and Dongjiang River Basin, showed insignificant changes in total runoff during their study periods. However, the baseflow in the winter dry seasons in these two watersheds significantly increased since the 1950s. Our results highlight the long-term variable effects of forest expansion and local climatic variability on basin hydrology in different climatic regions. This study suggests that landuse change in the humid study watersheds did not cause dramatic change in river flow and that region-specific afforestation policy should be considered to deal with forestation-water quantity trade-off. Conclusions from this study can help improve decision-making for ecological restoration policies and water resource management in China and other countries where intensive afforestation efforts are taking place.

TI  - Oasis sustainability assessment in arid areas using GRACE satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An oasis is an important habitat for humans, plants, and wildlife in arid desert areas. The sustainability of an oasis is crucial for a smooth regional ecological functioning and healthy economic development. However, the overexploitation of groundwater will result in unsustainable oasis development. Due to the lack of long-term groundwater monitoring data, the impact of groundwater level changes on the sustainability of an oasis has not been studied extensively. In the present study, we used the ground water storage anomaly (GWSA) in combination with the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) for the rapid identification of oasis sustainability, which has been tested and evaluated in Hotan and Qira oasis located in arid areas. The results showed that (1) the GWSA is a suitable and reliable indicator for trend change analysis in small-scale oasis and, (2) additionally, M-K test results for long-term trend change of GWSA showed a positive correlation with water resource carrying capacity (WRCC). These results suggest that GWSA can be used as a reliable index for the rapid assessment of oasis sustainability status in arid areas. Moreover, the potential applicability of GRACE satellite data in evaluating the groundwater sustainability in arid areas lacking proper data has also been proved in this study. These findings have provided a foundation to evaluate the sustainability status of an oasis and set a reference point to formulate future policies for the oasis.

TI  - Runoff Estimation in the Upper Reaches of the Heihe River Using an LSTM Model with Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Runoff estimations play an important role in water resource planning and management. Many accomplishments have been made in runoff estimations based on data recorded at meteorological stations; however, the advantages of the use of remotely sensed data in estimating runoff in watersheds for which data are lacking remain to be investigated. In this study, the MOD13A2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), TRMM3B43 precipitation (P), MOD11A2 land-surface temperature (LST), MOD16A2 evapotranspiration (ET) and hydrological station data were used as data sources with which to estimate the monthly runoff through the application of a fully connected long short-term memory (LSTM) model in the upstream reach of the Heihe River basin in China from 2001 to 2016. The results showed that inputting multiple remote sensing parameters improved the quality of runoff estimation compared to the use of rain gauge observations; an increase in R-2 from 0.91 to 0.94 was observed from the implementation of this process, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) showed an improvement from 0.89 to 0.93. The incorporation of rain gauge data as well as satellite data provided a slight improvement in estimating runoff with a respective R-2 value of 0.95 and NSE value of 0.94. This indicates that the LSTM model based on remote sensing data has great potential for runoff estimation, and data obtained by remote sensing technology provide an alternative approach for estimating runoff in areas for which available data are lacking.

TI  - Automatic Extraction of Mountain River Surface and Width Based on Multisource High-Resolution Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The extraction of high-resolution geomorphic information from remote sensing images is a key technology for supporting mountain river research. Extracting small rivers (width < 90 m) from complex backgrounds based on satellite images remains a challenging issue. In this research, we propose an improved random forest (RF) algorithm, RF-ANN (artificial neural network), by using neural networks and thermal infrared data for the extraction of river surfaces. We also develop an automated river width extraction (ARWE) method based on the central axis transformation algorithm and centerline automatic correction algorithm for the automatic extraction of the river widths across the whole basin. We chose the Huangfuchuan River Basin on the Loess Plateau, China, as a case study area. Chinese GF-1 and ZY-3 satellite images were implemented as the primary data source. We extracted the bankfull river surface and river widths of the Huangfuchuan River by using these two improved methods. The results show that the RF-ANN method has a total river surface extraction accuracy of 94.7%, and the extracted river surfaces cover more than 85% of the order 3 DEM river network. By implementing high-resolution DEM and thermal infrared data, RF-ANN effectively eliminates the disturbance of shadows of mountains and other features, which ensures the high accuracy of the extracted widths. It was verified that the maximum and minimum river widths that can be extracted in the Huangfuchuan River Basin are 297.4 m and 6.1 m, respectively. The overall error of river width extraction is 0.97 m, which is less than half of the pixel length of remote sensing images. The R-2 and root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimated river width values are 0.99 and 1.49, respectively. For tiny rivers with widths narrower than 10 m, the error of river width extraction is 10.9%. The error of thin rivers whose widths range from 10 to 30 m is 4.9%. For small rivers ranging from 30 to 90 and rivers wider than 90 m, the error is 1.1% and 0.6%, respectively. The new approach provides an effective method for extracting the surface and width of mountain rivers in topographically complex regions by using high-resolution satellite images, which may provide a database for estimating river carbon emissions and related research in fluvial morphology and water resource management.

TI  - Collusion-free for Cloud Verification toward the View of Game Theory
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, clients can outsource lots of complex and abundant computation, e.g., Internet of things (IoT), tasks to clouds by the "pay as you go" model. Outsourcing computation can save costs for clients and fully utilize the existing cloud infrastructures. However, it is hard for clients to trust the clouds even if blockchain is used as the trusted platform. In this article, we utilize the verification method as SETl@home by only two rational clouds, who hope to maximize their utilities. Utilities arc defined as the incomes of clouds when they provide computation results to clients. More specifically, one client outsources two jobs to two clouds and each job contains n tasks, which include k identical sentinels. Two clouds can either honestly compute each task or collude on the identical sentinel tasks by agreeing on random values. If the results of identical sentinels are identical, then client regards the jobs as correctly computed without verification. Obviously, rational clouds have incentives to deviate by collusion and provide identical random results for a higher income. We discuss how to prevent collusion by using deposits, e.g., bit-coins. Furthermore, utilities for each cloud can be automatically assigned by a smart contract. We prove that, given proper parameters, two rational clouds will honestly send correct results to the client without collusion.

TI  - Impact of BRDF Spatiotemporal Smoothing on Land Surface Albedo Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo, as a key parameter determining the partition of solar radiation at the Earth's surface, has been developed into a satellite-based product from various Earth observation systems to serve numerous global or regional applications. Studies point out that apparent uncertainty can be introduced into albedo retrieval without consideration of surface anisotropy, which is a challenge to albedo estimation especially from observations with fewer angular samplings. Researchers have begun to introduce smoothed anisotropy prior knowledge into albedo estimation to improve the inversion efficiency, or for the scenario of observations with signal or poor angular sampling. Thus, it is necessary to further understand the potential influence of smoothed anisotropy features adopted in albedo estimation. We investigated the albedo variation induced by BRDF smoothing at both temporal and spatial scales over six typical landscapes in North America using MODIS standard anisotropy products with high quality BRDF inversed from multi-angle observations in 500 m and 5.6 km spatial resolutions. Components of selected typical landscapes were assessed with the confidence of the MCD12 land cover product and 30 m CDL (cropland data layer) classification maps followed by an evaluation of spatial heterogeneity in 30 m scale through the semi-variogram model. High quality BRDF of MODIS standard anisotropy products were smoothed in multi-temporal scales of 8 days, 16 days, and 32 days, and in multi-spatial scales from 500 m to 5.6 km. The induced relative and absolute albedo differences were estimated using the RossThick-LiSparseR model and BRDFs smoothed before and after spatiotemporal smoothing. Our results show that albedo estimated using BRDFs smoothed temporally from daily to monthly over each scenario exhibits relative differences of 11.3%, 12.5%, and 27.2% and detectable absolute differences of 0.025, 0.012, and 0.013, respectively, in MODIS near-infrared (0.7-5.0 mu m), short-wave (0.3-5.0 mu m), and visible (0.3-0.7 mu m) broad bands. When BRDFs of investigated landscapes are smoothed from 500 m to 5.6 km, variations of estimated albedo can achieve up to 36.5%, 37.1%, and 94.7% on relative difference and absolute difference of 0.037, 0.024, and 0.018, respectively, in near-infrared (0.7-5.0 mu m), short wave (0.3-5.0 mu m), and visible (0.3-0.7 mu m) broad bands. In addition, albedo differences caused by temporal smoothing show apparent seasonal characteristic that the differences are significantly higher in spring and summer than those in autumn and winter, while albedo differences induced by spatial smoothing exhibit a noticeable relationship with sill values of a fitted semi-variogram marked by a correlation coefficient of 0.8876. Both relative and absolute albedo differences induced by BRDF smoothing are demonstrated to be captured, thus, it is necessary to avoid the smoothing process in quantitative remote sensing communities, especially when immediate anisotropy retrievals are available at the required spatiotemporal scale.

TI  - Extraction of Broad-Leaved Tree Crown Based on UAV Visible Images and OBIA-RF Model: A Case Study for Chinese Olive Trees
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chinese olive trees (Canarium album L.) are broad-leaved species that are widely planted in China. Accurately obtaining tree crown information provides important data for evaluating Chinese olive tree growth status, water and fertilizer management, and yield estimation. To this end, this study first used unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images in the visible band as the source of remote sensing (RS) data. Second, based on spectral features of the image object, the vegetation index, shape, texture, and terrain features were introduced. Finally, the extraction effect of different feature dimensions was analyzed based on the random forest (RF) algorithm, and the performance of different classifiers was compared based on the features after dimensionality reduction. The results showed that the difference in feature dimensionality and importance was the main factor that led to a change in extraction accuracy. RF has the best extraction effect among the current mainstream machine learning (ML) algorithms. In comparison with the pixel-based (PB) classification method, the object-based image analysis (OBIA) method can extract features of each element of RS images, which has certain advantages. Therefore, the combination of OBIA and RF algorithms is a good solution for Chinese olive tree crown (COTC) extraction based on UAV visible band images.

TI  - Water Body Super-Resolution Mapping Based on Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis and Multiscale Spatio-Temporal Dependence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water body mapping is an effective way to monitor dynamic changes in surface water, which is of great significance for water resource management. Super-resolution mapping is a valid method to generate high-resolution dynamic water body maps from low-spatial-resolution images. However, the accuracy of existing super-resolution mapping methods is not high due to the low accuracy of fraction images and the insufficiency of spatial pattern information. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a spectral similarity scale-based multiple-endmember spectral mixture analysis (SSS-based MESMA) and a multiscale spatio-temporal dependence method based on super-resolution mapping (MESMA_MST_SRM) for water bodies. SSS-based MESMA allows different coarse pixels to have different endmember combinations, which can effectively improve the accuracy of spectral unmixing and then improve the accuracy of fraction images. Multiscale spatio-temporal dependence adopts both pixel-based and subpixel-based spatial dependence. In this study, eight different types of water body mappings derived from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Google Earth images were employed to test the performance of the MESMA_MST_SRM method. The results of the eight experiments showed that compared with the other four tested methods, the overall accuracy (OA) value, as well as the overall distribution and detailed information of the water map generated by the MESMA_MST_SRM method, were the best, indicating the great potential and efficiency of the proposed method in water body mapping.

TI  - Stand Canopy Closure Estimation in Planted Forests Using a Geometric-Optical Model Based on Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy closure, which is the ratio of the vertical projection area of the crowns to the area of forest land, can indicate the growth and tending situation of a forest and is of great significance for forest management planning. In this study, a geometric-optical model (GOST model) was used to simulate the canopy gap fraction of a forest. Then, a canopy closure estimation method using the gap fraction was discussed. In this study, three typical planted forest farms (the Mengjiagang (MJG), Gaofeng (GF), and Wangyedian (WYD) forest farms) containing the most commonly planted tree species in the north and south regions of China were selected, and field measurements were executed. The results show that the gap fraction (Pvg-c) had a higher correlation with the average projected area of the tree crowns, and the relationship was an exponential function, with R-2 and RMSE values of 0.5619 and 0.0723, respectively. Finally, the applicability and accuracy of this method were evaluated using line transects, and a fisheye camera measured the canopy closure. The accuracy of the canopy closure estimated by the Pvg-c was 86.69%. This research can provide a reference for canopy closure estimation using a geometric-optical model.

TI  - A Characteristics Set Computation Model for Internal Wavenumber Spectra and Its Validation with MODIS Retrieved Parameters in the Sulu Sea and Celebes Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quasi-linear or nonlinear interactions among different ocean motions dominate the system internal structure and appearance feature presented in spatial and temporal evolution. However, deficiency of the characteristics set computation model for internal wavenumber spectra proves to be a serious barrier to derive interaction mechanisms of internal waves with large or small scale ocean motions. In this study, a characteristics set computation model for internal wavenumber spectra is proposed for complicated offshore environments. The refraction of current shear instability, bottom topography and the reflection at surface and bottom are attentively considered in the complicated characteristics inlaid scheme. Model results are validated with MODIS retrieved internal wave parameters in the Sulu Sea and Celebes Sea. This original characteristics set computation model for internal wavenumber spectra can be used widely and can further improve the understandings of generation, dissipation, nonlinear wave-wave interaction and mixing process of internal waves.

TI  - The Potential of Sentinel-1A Data for Identification of Debris-Covered Alpine Glacier Based on Machine Learning Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave remote sensing is one of the main approaches to glacier monitoring. This paper provides a comparative analysis of how different types of radar information differ in identifying debris-covered alpine glaciers using machine learning algorithms. Based on Sentinel-1A data, three data suites were designed: A backscattering coefficient (BC)-based data suite, a polarization decomposition parameter (PDP)-based data suite, and an interference coherence coefficient (ICC)-based data suite. Four glaciers with very different orientations in different climatic zones of the Tibetan Plateau were selected and classified using an integrated machine learning classification approach. The results showed that: (1) The boosted trees and subspace k-nearest neighbor algorithms were optimal and robust; and (2) the PDP suite (63.41-99.57%) and BC suite (55.85-99.94%) both had good recognition accuracy for all glaciers; notably, the PDP suite exhibited better rock and debris recognition accuracy. We also analyzed the influence of the distribution of glacier surface aspect on the classification accuracy and found that the more asymmetric it was about the sensor orbital plane, the more difficult it was for the BC and PDP suites to recognize the glacier, and a large slope could further reduce the accuracy. Our results suggested that during the inventory or classification of large-scale debris-covered alpine glaciers, priority should be given to polarization decomposition features and elevation information, and it is best to divide the glaciers into multiple subregions based on the spatial relationship between glacier surface aspect and radar beams.

TI  - A Novel Machine Learning-Based Gap-Filling of Fine-Resolution Remotely Sensed Snow Cover Fraction Data by Combining Downscaling and Regression
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based remotely sensed observations of snow cover fraction (SCF) can have data gaps in spatially distributed coverage from sensor and orbital limitations. We mitigate these limitations in the example fine-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data by gap-filling using auxiliary 1-km datasets that either aid in downscaling from coarser-resolution (5 km) MODIS SCF wherever not fully covered by clouds, or else by themselves via regression wherever fully cloud covered. This study's prototype predicts a 1-km version of the 500-m MOD10A1 SCF target. Due to noncollocatedness of spatial gaps even across input and auxiliary datasets, we consider a recent gap-agnostic advancement of partial convolution in computer vision for both training and predictive gap-filling. Partial convolution accommodates spatially consistent gaps across the input images, effectively implementing a two-dimensional masking. To overcome reduced usable data from noncollocated spatial gaps across inputs, we innovate a fully generalized three-dimensional masking in this partial convolution. This enables a valid output value at a pixel even if only a single valid input variable and its value exist in the neighborhood covered by the convolutional filter zone centered around that pixel. Thus, our gap-agnostic technique can use significantly more examples for training (similar to 67%) and prediction (similar to 100%), instead of only less than 10% for the previous partial convolution. We train an example simple three-layer legacy super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) to obtain downscaling and regression component performances that are better than baseline values of either climatology or MOD10C1 SCF as relevant. Our generalized partial convolution can enable multiple Earth science applications like downscaling, regression, classification, and segmentation that were hindered by data gaps.

TI  - A Method for Classifying Complex Features in Urban Areas Using Video Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification of optical satellite-derived remote sensing images is an important satellite remote sensing application. Due to the wide variety of artificial features and complex ground situations in urban areas, the classification of complex urban features has always been a focus of and challenge in the field of remote sensing image classification. Given the limited information that can be obtained from traditional optical satellite-derived remote sensing data of a classification area, it is difficult to classify artificial features in detail at the pixel level. With the development of technologies, such as satellite platforms and sensors, the data types acquired by remote sensing satellites have evolved from static images to dynamic videos. Compared with traditional satellite-derived images, satellite-derived videos contain increased ground object reflection information, especially information obtained from different observation angles, and can thus provide more information for classifying complex urban features and improving the corresponding classification accuracies. In this paper, first, we analyze urban-area, ground feature characteristics and satellite-derived video remote sensing data. Second, according to these characteristics, we design a pixel-level classification method based on the application of machine learning techniques to video remote sensing data that represents complex, urban-area ground features. Last, we conduct experiments on real data. The test results show that applying the method designed in this paper to classify dynamic, satellite-derived video remote sensing data can improve the classification accuracy of complex features in urban areas compared with the classification results obtained using static, satellite-derived remote sensing image data at the same resolution.

TI  - Every drop matters: combining population-based and satellite data to investigate the link between lifetime rainfall exposure and chronic undernutrition in children under five years in rural Burkina Faso
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is projected to induce extreme and irregular rainfall patterns in the West African Sahel region, affecting household food security and income. Children are among the worst affected population groups. Previous studies focusing on rainfall irregularities in specified periods have revealed how child health and nutritional status are impacted, especially in rural settings. However, the aggregated effect of rainfall over a lifetime on chronic child undernutrition remains poorly understood. We conducted a multilevel regression using a 2017 household survey from rural Burkina Faso containing 12 919 under-five-year-old children and their corresponding household rainfall data. The rainfall data originated from the Climate Hazards Infrared Precipitation with Stations monthly dataset with a native resolution of 4.8 km (0.05 degrees). We show that an increase in rainfall below 75 mm monthly average tends to produce poor nutritional outcomes (regression coefficient = -0.11***; 95% CI = -0.13, -0.10; p < 0.001) in rural Burkina Faso children. We found a consistent negative relationship between different sex and household wealth groups, but not age groups. Vulnerable younger children were more affected by the adverse effects of increased rainfall, while older children seemed to handle it better. Our methodological approach tracing the impact of rainfall over children's lifetimes makes a meaningful contribution to the portfolio of tools for studying the complex relationship between climate change and health outcomes. Our work confirms that rainfall is a risk factor for chronic child undernutrition, highlighting the need for adaptation strategies that boost household and community resilience to counteract the harmful impacts of climate change on child nutritional status.

TI  - Identifying the Impacts of Climate Change and Human Activities on Vegetation Cover Changes: A Case Study of the Yangtze River Basin, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a useful indicator to characterize vegetation development and land use which can effectively monitor changes in ecological environments. As an important area for ecological balance and safety in China, understanding the dynamic changes in land cover and vegetation of the Yangtze River Basin would be crucial in developing effective policies and strategies to protect its natural environment while promoting sustainable growth. Based on MODIS-NDVI data and meteorological data from 2000 to 2019, the temporal and spatial distribution of vegetation coverage in the Yangtze River Basin during the past 20 years were characterized, and the impacts of human activities and climate change were quantitatively evaluated. We drew the following research conclusions: (1) From 2000 to 2019, the vegetation cover of the Yangtze River Basin presented a fluctuating inter-annual growth trend. Except for the Taihu Lake sub-basin, the vegetation cover in other sub-basins showed an upward trend. (2) The vegetation cover exhibited a spatial distribution pattern of "high in the middle and low in the east and west", with the multi-year average value of NDVI being 0.5153. (3) Areas with improved vegetation cover were significantly larger than the areas with degraded foliage. The central region has stronger overall trend of change than the east, and the east is stronger than the west. These vegetation cover changes are largely related to anthropogenic activities. (4) Vegetation cover changes due to precipitation and temperature exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity. While both temperature and precipitation influenced vegetation cover, the temperature was the leading climate factor in the area. (5) Anthropogenic and climate factors jointly promoted the change of vegetation cover in the Yangtze River Basin. Human activities contributed 79.29%, while climate change contributed 20.71%. This study could be used in subsequent studies analyzing the influencing factors affecting long-term vegetation cover in large-scale watersheds.

TI  - Smartphone Digital Photography for Fractional Vegetation Cover Estimation
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate ground measurements of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) are key for characterizing ecosystem functions and evaluating remote sensing products. The increasing performance of cameras equipped in smartphones opens new opportunities for extensive FVC measurement through citizen science initiatives. However, the wide field of view (FOV) of smartphone cameras constitutes a key source of uncertainty in the estimation of vegetation parameters, which has been largely ignored. We designed a practical method to characterize the FOV of smartphones and improve the FVC estimation. The method was assessed in a mountainous forest based on the comparison with in situ fisheye photographs. After the FOV correction, the agreement of smartphone and fisheye FVC estimates highly improved: root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.103 compared to 0.242 of the original smartphone FVC estimates without considering the FOV effect, mean difference of 0.074 versus 0.213, and coefficient of determination R2 of 0.719 versus 0.353. Smartphone cameras outperform traditional fisheye cameras: the overexposure and low vertical resolution of fisheye photographs introduced uncertainties in FVC estimation while the insensitivity to exposure and high spatial resolution of smartphone cameras make photograph acquisition and analysis more automatic and accurate. The smartphone FVC estimates highly agree with the GF-1 satellite product: RMSE = 0.066, bias = 0.007, and R2 = 0.745. This study opens new perspectives for the validation of satellite products.

TI  - Patterns of unplanned hospital admissions among people with dementia: from diagnosis to the end of life
T2  - AGE AND AGEING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background hospitalisations are sentinel events for people with dementia. How patterns of unplanned hospital admissions change among people with dementia after diagnosis is relatively unknown. Objective to describe patterns of unplanned hospital admissions of people with dementia from diagnosis until death/study end. Methods retrospective cohort study using mental healthcare provider data of people diagnosed with dementia in London, UK (1995-2017), linked to mortality and hospital data. The primary outcome was the rate of unplanned hospital admissions after diagnosis until death/study end. We calculated the cumulative incidence of unplanned hospital admissions. The rates of unplanned hospital admissions and the percentage of time spent as an inpatient were stratified by time from first dementia diagnosis. Results for 19,221 people with dementia (61.4% female, mean age at diagnosis 81.0 years (standard deviation, SD 8.5)), the cumulative incidence of unplanned hospital admissions (n = 14,759) was 76.8% (95% CI 76.3%-77.3%). Individuals remained in the study for mean 3.0 (SD 2.6) years, and 12,667 (65.9%) died. Rates and lengths of unplanned hospital admissions remained relatively low and short in the months after the dementia diagnosis, increasing only as people approached the end of life. Percentage of time spent as an inpatient was <3% for people who were alive at the study end but was on average 19.6 and 13.3% for the decedents in the last 6 and 12 months of life, respectively. Conclusions the steep rise in hospitalisations before death highlights the need for improved community care and services for people with dementia who are approaching the end of life.

TI  - Inferring Land Conditions in the Tumen River Basin by Trend Analysis Based on Satellite Imagery and Geoinformation
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to map the land condition within the area of the Tumen River Basin (TRB), located on the Sino-North Korean border, using trend analysis of environmental factors. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) trends over the past 30 years were analyzed to identify areas that have undergone degradation, restoration, and/or a transition. Landsat NDVI and LST were obtained using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Erosion was also gauged over the same period using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Our results showed that only 0.3% of the land within the TRB underwent change that can be characterized as statistically significant within the study period. We therefore infer that land degradation may not be a major concern in the study area. Areas with a significant upward trend of soil loss accounted for 0.8% of the basin's footprint and were mainly distributed upstream of North Korea. However, more than 80% of the area was found to be suffering from water stress, 10% of these areas were statistically significant and most were located downstream.

TI  - Research on Automatic Identification Method of Terraces on the Loess Plateau Based on Deep Transfer Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid, accurate extraction of terraces from high-resolution images is of great significance for promoting the application of remote-sensing information in soil and water conservation planning and monitoring. To solve the problem of how deep learning requires a large number of labeled samples to achieve good accuracy, this article proposes an automatic identification method for terraces that can obtain high precision through small sample datasets. Firstly, a terrace identification source model adapted to multiple data sources is trained based on the WorldView-1 dataset. The model can be migrated to other types of images for terracing extraction as a pre-trained model. Secondly, to solve the small sample problem, a deep transfer learning method for accurate pixel-level extraction of high-resolution remote-sensing image terraces is proposed. Finally, to solve the problem of insufficient boundary information and splicing traces during prediction, a strategy of ignoring edges is proposed, and a prediction model is constructed to further improve the accuracy of terrace identification. In this paper, three regions outside the sample area are randomly selected, and the OA, F1 score, and MIoU averages reach 93.12%, 91.40%, and 89.90%, respectively. The experimental results show that this method, based on deep transfer learning, can accurately extract terraced field surfaces and segment terraced field boundaries.

TI  - A Neural Network Method for Retrieving Sea Surface Wind Speed for C-Band SAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the Ocean Projection and Extension neural Network (OPEN) method, a novel approach is proposed to retrieve sea surface wind speed for C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR). In order to prove the methodology with a robust dataset, five-year normalized radar cross section (NRCS) measurements from the advanced scatterometer (ASCAT), a well-known side-looking radar sensor, are used to train the model. In situ wind data from direct buoy observations, instead of reanalysis wind data or model results, are used as the ground truth in the OPEN model. The model is applied to retrieve sea surface winds from two independent data sets, ASCAT and Sentinel-1 SAR data, and has been well-validated using buoy measurements from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and the ASCAT coastal wind product. The comparison between the OPEN model and four C-band model (CMOD) versions (CMOD4, CMOD-IFR2, CMOD5.N, and CMOD7) further indicates the good performance of the proposed model for C-band SAR sensors. It is anticipated that the use of high-resolution SAR data together with the new wind speed retrieval method can provide continuous and accurate ocean wind products in the future.

TI  - Assessment of MODIS Surface Temperature Products of Greenland Ice Sheet Using In-Situ Measurements
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based data have promoted the research progress in polar regions under global climate change, meanwhile the uncertainties and limitations of satellite-derived surface temperatures are widely discussed over Greenland. This study validated the accuracy of ice surface temperature (IST) from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) over the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS). Daily MODIS IST was validated against the observational surface temperature from 24 automatic weather stations (AWSs) using the mean bias (MB), the root mean square (RMSE), and the correlation coefficient (R). The temporal and spatial variability over the GrIS spanning from March 2000 to December 2019 and the IST melt threshold (-1 degrees C) were analyzed. Generally, the MODIS IST was underestimated by an average of -2.68 degrees C compared to AWSs, with cold bias mainly occurring in winter. Spatially, the R and RMSE performed the better accuracy of MODIS IST on the northwest, northeast, and central part of the GrIS. Furthermore, the mean IST is mainly concentrated between -20 degrees C and -10 degrees C in summer while between -50 degrees C and -30 degrees C in winter. The largest positive IST anomalies (exceeds 3 degrees C) occurred in southwestern GrIS during 2010. IST shows the positive trends mainly in spring and summer and negative in autumn and winter.

TI  - Severe Biomass-Burning Aerosol Pollution during the 2019 Amazon Wildfire and Its Direct Radiative-Forcing Impact: A Space Perspective from MODIS Retrievals
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An extreme biomass burning event occurred in the Amazonian rainforest from July through September 2019 due to the extensive wildfires used to clear the land, which allowed for more significant forest burning than previously occurred. In this study, we reclustered the clear-sky ambient aerosols to adapt the black carbon (BC) aerosol retrieval algorithm to Amazonia. This not only isolated the volumetric fraction of BC (f(bc)) from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol data, but also facilitated the use of aerosol mixing and scattering models to estimate the absorption properties of smoke plumes. The retrieved MODIS aerosol dataset provided a space perspective on characterizing the aerosol changes and trends of the 2019 pollution event. A very high aerosol optical depth (AOD) was found to affect the source areas continuously, with higher and thus stronger aerosol absorption. These pollutants also affected the atmosphere downwind due to the transport of air masses. In addition, properties of aerosols emitted from the 2019 Amazonian wildfire events visualized a significant year-to-year enhancement, with the averaged AOD at 550 nm increased by 150%. A 200% increase in the aerosol-absorption optical depth (AAOD) at 550 nm was recognized due to the low single-scattering albedo (SSA) caused by the explosive BC emissions during the pollution peak. Further simulations of aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) showed that the biomass-burning aerosols emitted during the extreme Amazonian wildfires event in 2019 forced a significant change in the radiative balance, which not only produced greater heating of the atmospheric column through strong absorption of BC, but also reduced the radiation reaching the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface level. The negative radiative forcing at the TOA and surface level, as well as the positive radiative forcing in the atmosphere, were elevated by similar to 30% across the whole of South America compared to 2018. These radiative effects of the absorbing aerosol could have the ability to accelerate the deterioration cycle of drought and fire over the Amazonian rainforest.

TI  - Surface Wave Developments under Tropical Cyclone Goni (2020): Multi-Satellite Observations and Parametric Model Comparisons
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Multi-satellite observations to jointly analyze extreme surface wind and wave properties can now be readily obtained to study tropical cyclone (TC) events. Developing over the Philippine Sea, TC Goni was one of the most powerful TCs in 2020. Constrained by Sentinel-1/RadarSat-2 SAR and CFOSAT SCAT satellite data, wind field in the intense TC region is reconstructed. Significant wave height measurements are further obtained from altimeters on-board the CFOSAT, Jason-3, and Sentinel-3A, B satellites. The directional wave spectrum information can be derived from the CFOSAT SWIM off-nadir radar measurements. Using a simplified 2D parametric model and derived self-similar analytical solutions, the measured surface wave amplification in the right-hand TC sector, relative to its propagation direction, is well captured and interpreted. For TC Goni, observed and predicted waves reach 8 m and wavelengths larger than 200 m, leaving the TC inner region in the forward and forward-left direction. In the far TC zone, swell attenuates and superposes with wind waves, not necessarily aligned, to give observed significant wave height values. Multi-satellite data together with simplified parametric model outputs open new perspectives to more precisely study and predict surface waves generated by moving and rapidly evolving TCs for different scientific and practical purposes. Over the Philippine Sea, the tropical cyclone (TC) Goni reaches category 5 on 29-31 October 2020. Multi-satellite observations, including CFOSAT SWIM/SCAT and Sentinel-1 SAR data, are jointly analyzed to assess the performances of a parametric model. Recently developed to provide a fast estimation of surface wave developments under rapidly evolving TCs, this full 2D parametric model (KYCM) and its simplified self-similar solutions (TC-wave geophysical model function (TCW GMF)) are thoroughly compared with satellite observations. TCW GMF provides immediate first-guess estimates, at any location in space and time, for the significant wave height, wavelength, and wave direction parameters. Moving cyclones trigger strong asymmetrical wave fields, associated to a resonance between wave group velocity and TC heading velocity. For TC Goni, this effect is well evidenced and captured, leading to extreme waves reaching up to 8 m, further outrunning as swell systems with wavelengths about 200-250 m in the TC heading direction, slightly shifted leftwards. Considering wind field constrained with very highly resolved Sentinel-1 SAR measurements and medium resolution CFOSAT SCAT data, quantitative agreements between satellite measurements and KYCM/TCW GMF results are obtained. Far from the TC inner core (similar to 10 radii of maximum wind speed), the superposition of outrunning swell systems and local wind waves estimates leads to Hs values very close to altimeter measurements. This case study demonstrates the promising capabilities to combine multi-satellite observations, with analytical self-similar solutions to advance improved understandings of surface wave generation under extreme wind conditions.

TI  - Fluvial Depositional Systems of the African Humid Period: An Analog for an Early, Wet Mars in the Eastern Sahara
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - A widely hypothesized but complex transition from widespread fluvial activity to predominantly aeolian processes is inferred on Mars based on remote sensing data observations of ancient landforms. However, the lack of analysis of in situ martian fluvial deposits hinders our understanding of the flow regime nature and sustainability of the martian fluvial activity and the hunt for ancient life. Studying analogs from arid zones on Earth is fundamental to quantitatively understanding geomorphic processes and climate drivers that might have dominated during early Mars. Here we investigate the formation and preservation of fluvial depositional systems in the eastern Sahara, where the largest arid region on Earth hosts important repositories of past climatic changes. The fluvial systems are composed of well-preserved single-thread sinuous to branching ridges and fan-shaped deposits interpreted as deltas. The systems' configuration and sedimentary content suggest that ephemeral rivers carved these landforms by sequential intermittent episodes of erosion and deposition active for 10-100s years over similar to 10,000 years during the late Quaternary. Subsequently, these landforms were sculpted by a marginal role of rainfall and aeolian processes with minimum erosion rates of 1.1 +/- 0.2 mm/yr, supplying similar to 96 +/- 24 x 10(10) m(3) of disaggregated sediment to adjacent aeolian dunes. Our results imply that similar martian fluvial systems preserving single-thread, short distance source-to-sink courses may have formed due to transient drainage networks active over short durations. Altogether, this study adds to the growing recognition of the complexity of interpreting climate history from orbital images of landforms.

TI  - POSSIBILITIES OF THE INFLUENCE OF A "SYNERGISTIC" APPROACH TO VARIOUS TEACHING METHODS IN THE PROCESS OF ORGANIZING TEACHING AND LEARNING WITH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS"
T2  - REVISTA CONRADO
M3  - Article
AB  - Efforts are being made to use more modern opportunities for the correct organization of the upbringing of the younger generation, especially high school students. It should be noted that teaching and learning at school is of great importance at the basis of the achievements of science in recent years. Experts' research suggests that innovation are needed to deliverquality education. There is a strong need for a "synergetic" approach to teaching and learning to improve the quality of education. Because, this approach not only brings innovation to education, but also allows you to bring together all areas of science and make better use of them. Synergetics itself is not only new to science, but can also create better conditions for it for innovation. Taking into account the age of the children, their worldview, the subjects they studied and the education they received, we can say that in the formation of these relations, first of all, teachers, and then students bear a serious responsibility. In this sense, conditions are created for teachers to make fuller use of the possibilities of "synergetics" in teaching and learning.

TI  - Urban Sprawl and COVID-19 Impact Analysis by Integrating Deep Learning with Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely information on land use, vegetation coverage, and air and water quality, are crucial for monitoring and managing territories, especially for areas in which there is dynamic urban expansion. However, getting accessible, accurate, and reliable information is not an easy task, since the significant increase in remote sensing data volume poses challenges for the timely processing and analysis of the resulting massive data volume. From this perspective, classical methods for urban monitoring present some limitations and more innovative technologies, such as artificial-intelligence-based algorithms, must be exploited, together with performing cloud platforms and ad hoc pre-processing steps. To this end, this paper presents an approach to the use of cloud-enabled deep-learning technology for urban sprawl detection and monitoring, through the fusion of optical and synthetic aperture radar data, by integrating the Google Earth Engine cloud platform with deep-learning techniques through the use of the open-source TensorFlow library. The model, based on a U-Net architecture, was applied to evaluate urban changes in Phoenix, the second fastest-growing metropolitan area in the United States. The available ancillary information on newly built areas showed good agreement with the produced change detection maps. Moreover, the results were temporally related to the appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 (commonly known as COVID-19) pandemic, showing a decrease in urban expansion during the event. The proposed solution may be employed for the efficient management of dynamic urban areas, providing a decision support system to help policy makers in the measurement of changes in territories and to monitor their impact on phenomena related to urbanization growth and density. The reference data were manually derived by the authors over an area of approximately 216 km(2), referring to 2019, based on the visual interpretation of high resolution images, and are openly available.

TI  - Digital Soil Mapping of Soil Organic Matter with Deep Learning Algorithms
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital soil mapping has emerged as a new method to describe the spatial distribution of soils economically and efficiently. In this study, a lightweight soil organic matter (SOM) mapping method based on a deep residual network, which we call LSM-ResNet, is proposed to make accurate predictions with background covariates. ResNet not only integrates spatial background information around the observed environmental covariates, but also reduces problems such as information loss, which undermines the integrity of information and reduces prediction uncertainty. To train the model, rectified linear units, mean squared error, and adaptive momentum estimation were used as the activation function, loss/cost function, and optimizer, respectively. The method was tested with Landsat5, the meteorological data from WorldClim, and the 1602 sampling points set from Xinxiang, China. The performance of the proposed LSM-ResNet was compared to a traditional machine learning algorithm, the random forest (RF) algorithm, and a training set (80%) and a test set (20%) were created to test both models. The results showed that the LSM-ResNet (RMSE = 6.40, R-2 = 0.51) model outperformed the RF model in both the roots mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2), and the training accuracy was significantly improved compared to RF (RMSE = 6.81, R-2 = 0.46). The trained LSM-ResNet model was used for SOM prediction in Xinxiang, a district of plain terrain in China. The prediction maps can be deemed an accurate reflection of the spatial variability of the SOM distribution.

TI  - Precipitation Microphysics of Tropical Cyclones over Northeast China in 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs) in Northeast China are rare because of the region's high latitude (>40 degrees N). In 2020, Northeast China was affected by three TCs within half a month-the first time on record. We used the Global Precipitation Measurement orbital dataset to study the precipitation microphysics during the TC period in Northeast China in 2020 (2020-TC), and during September in this region from 2014 to 2019 (hereafter September 2014-September 2019). FY-4A was used to provide cloud top height (CTH). The results show that, compared with September 2014-September 2019, the 2020-TC precipitation has stronger precipitation ice productivity, weaker deposition efficiency, stronger riming, and stronger coalescence processes. The storm top height (STH), CTH, and the difference between the two (CTH-STH) are indicative of the near-surface droplet size distribution (DSD), but there are differences: STH and CTH-STH both correlate significantly with mean mass-weighted drop diameter, whereas only the positive correlation between CTH and normalized drop concentration parameter passes the significance test. These results reveal for the first time the precipitation microphysics of landfalling TCs in Northeast China, and allow discussion of the validity of convective intensity indicators from the perspective of DSD.

TI  - Urbanization Level in Chinese Counties: Imbalance Pattern and Driving Force
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization level is a key indicator for socioeconomic development and policy making, but the measurement data and methods need to be discussed further due to the limitation of a single index and the availability and accuracy of statistical data. China is urbanizing rapidly, but the urbanization level at the county scale remains a mystery due to its complexity and lack of unified and effective measurement indicators. In this paper, we proposed a new urbanization index to measure the Chinese urbanization level at the county scale by integrating population, land, and economic factors; by fusing remote sensing data and traditional demographic data, we investigated the multi-dimensional unbalanced development patterns and the driving mechanism from 1995 to 2015. Results indicate that: The average comprehensive urbanization level at the Chinese county scale has increased from 31.06% in 1995 to 45.23% in 2015, and the urbanization level in the permanent population may overestimate China's urbanization process. There were significant but different spatial and temporal dynamic patterns in population, land, and economic levels as well as at a comprehensive urbanization level. The comprehensive urbanization level shows the pattern of being high in the south-east and low in the north-west, divided by "Hu line". The urbanization of registered populations presents high in the northern border and the eastern coastal areas, which is further strengthened over time. Economic urbanization based on lighting data presents high in the east and low in the west. Land urbanization based on remote sensing data shows high in the south and low in the north. The registered population urbanization level is lower than economic and land urbanization. County urbanization was driven by large population size, reasonable industrial structure, and strong government capacity; 38% and 59% of urbanization levels can be regarded as the key nodes of the urbanization process. When the urbanization rate is lower than 38%, the secondary industry plays a strong role in powering urbanization; when the urbanization rate is higher than 38% but less than 59%, the promotion effect of the tertiary industry is more obvious, and the secondary industry is gradually weakened. When the urbanization rate exceeds 59%, the tertiary industry becomes the major driver.

TI  - Alpine vegetation responses to snow phenology in the Chinese Tianshan mountainous region
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating the interrelation between snow and vegetation is essential to explain the response of alpine ecosystems to climate change. Based on the MOD10A1 daily cloud-free snow product and MOD13A1 NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) data, this study analysed the spatial and temporal patterns of snow phenology including snow onset date, snow end date, snow cover days, and vegetation phenology including the start of growing season, the end of growing season and the length of growing season in the Chinese Tianshan Mountainous Region (CTMR) from 2002 to 2018, and then investigated the snow phenological effects on the vegetation phenology among different ecogeographic zones and diverse vegetation types. The results indicated that snow onset date was earlier at higher elevations and later at lower elevations, while snow end date showed opposite spatial distribution characteristics. The end of growing season occurred later on the northwest slope of the CTMR and the Yili Valley. The earliest end of growing season was in the middle part of the CTMR. A long growing season was mainly distributed along the northern slope and the Yili Valley, while a short growing season was concentrated in the middle part of the CTMR. The response of vegetation phenology to changes in snow phenology varied among vegetation types and ecogeographic zones. The effect of snow phenology on vegetation phenology was more significant in IID5 (Yili Valley) than in the other ecogeographic zones. A negative correlation was observed between the start of growing season and snow end date in nearly 54.78% of the study area, while a positive correlation was observed between the start of growing season and the snow end date in 66.85% of the study area. The sensitivity of vegetation phenology to changes in snow cover varied among different vegetation types. Snow onset date had the greatest effect on the start of growing season in the four vegetation cover types (alpine meadows, alpine steppes, shrubs, and alpine sparse vegetation), whereas the snow cover days had the least impact. Snow end date had the greatest impact on the end of growing season in the alpine steppes and shrub areas. The study results are helpful for understanding the vegetation dynamics under ongoing climate change, and can benefit vegetation management and pasture development in the CTMR.

TI  - Validation and Improvement of COCTS/HY-1C Sea Surface Temperature Products
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In oceanographic study, satellite-based sea surface temperature (SST) retrieval has always been the focus of researchers. This paper investigates several multi-channel SST retrieval algorithms for the thermal infrared band, and evaluates the accuracy of the COCTS/HY-1C SST products. NEAR-GOOS in situ SST data are utilized for validation and improvement, and a three-step matching procedure including geographic location screening, cloud masking, and homogeneity check is conducted to match in situ SST data with satellite SST data. Two improvement schemes, including nonlinear regression and regularization iteration, are proposed to improve the accuracy of the COCTS/HY-1C SST products and the typical application scenarios and the algorithm characteristics of these two schemes are discussed. The standard deviation of residual between retrieved SST and measured SST for these two data improvement algorithms, which are considered as the main indexes for assessment, result in an improvement of 13.245% and 14.096%, respectively. In addition, the generalization ability of the SST models under two data improvement methods is quantitatively compared, and the factors affecting the model accuracy are also carefully evaluated, including the in situ data acquisition method and measurement time (day/night). Finally, future works about SST retrieval with COCTS/HY-1C satellite data are summarized.

TI  - An Extended Watershed-Based AHP Model for Flood Hazard Estimation: Constraining Runoff Converging Indicators via MFD-Derived Sub-Watershed by Maximum Zonal Statistical Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods threaten the sustainable development of areas with a high probability of hazard. A typical analytic hierarchy process (pixel-based AHP) based flood hazard estimation method may ignore the similar threat caused by neighborhood cells at the sub-watershed scale. This study proposed an extended watershed-based Zonal Statistical AHP for flood hazard estimation: Constraining converging related indicators by the sub-watersheds (WZSAHP-RC) model to improve this gap. Before calculating the flood hazard index, the proposed model uses the sub-watershed derived by the multiple flow direction method as a based unit to calculate the maximum zonal statistical value of runoff converging indicators. Moreover, taking the Chaohu basin of Anhui in China as the case study, the validation flooding ground-truthing was constructed from GF-3, and Landsat OLI images of the flood event from 20 July to 24 July 2020, which is the biggest flood recorded by the Zhongmiao station, which recorded a new water level, 0.82 m higher than the historical record. Compared with the validation, the results indicated the proposed method could improve the correct ratio by 38% (from 22% to 60%) and the fit ratio by 17% (from 18% to 35%) when considering the predicted flood hazard levels of "High" and "Very High" as flooded areas. Moreover, the flood hazard map derived by WZSAHP-RC demonstrated greater consistency in the flooded districts filtered by Baidu News than the pixel-based AHP. It revealed that considering two- or even multi-dimensional homogeneity may help to improve the accuracy of flood hazard maps on a catchment scale.

TI  - Assessment and Improvement of Urban Resilience to Flooding at a Subdistrict Level Using Multi-Source Geospatial Data: Jakarta as a Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban resilience to natural disasters (e.g., flooding), in the context of climate change, has been becoming increasingly important for the sustainable development of cities. This paper presents a method to assess the urban resilience to flooding in terms of the recovery rate of different subdistricts in a city using all-weather synthetic aperture radar imagery (i.e., Sentinel-1A imagery). The factors that influence resilience, and their relative importance, are then determined through principal component analysis. Jakarta, a flood-prone city in Indonesia, is selected as a case study. The resilience of 42 subdistricts in Jakarta, with their gross domestic product data super-resolved using nighttime-light satellite images, was assessed. The association between resilience levels and influencing factors, such as topology, mixtures of religion, and points-of-interest density, were subsequently derived. Topographic factors, such as elevation (coefficient = 0.3784) and slope (coefficient = 0.1079), were found to have the strongest positive influence on flood recovery, whereas population density (coefficient = -0.1774) a negative effect. These findings provide evidence for policymakers to make more pertinent strategies to improve flood resilience, especially in subdistricts with lower resilience levels.

TI  - Land-Greening Hotspot Changes in the Yangtze River Economic Belt during the Last Four Decades and Their Connections to Human Activities
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial patterns of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) changes in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) and their potential causes during the last four decades remain unclear. To clarify this issue, this study firstly depicts the spatial patterns of the NDVI changes using global inventory modelling and mapping studies (GIMMS) NDVI data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data. Secondly, the Mann-Kendall test, regression residual analysis and cluster analysis are used to diagnose the potential causes of the NDVI changes. The results show that the regional mean NDVI exhibited an uptrend from 1982 to 2019, which consists of two prominent uptrend periods, i.e., 1982-2003 and 2003-2019. There has been a shift of greening hotspots. The first prominent greening trend from 1982 to 2003 mainly occurred in the eastern agricultural area, while the second prominent greening uptrend from 2003 to 2019 mainly occurred at the junction of Chongqing, Guizhou and Yunnan. The greening trend and shift of greening hotspots were slightly caused by climate change, but mainly caused by human activities. The first greening trend was closely related to the agricultural progress, and the second greening trend was associated with the rapid economic development and implementation of ecology restoration policies.

TI  - SFRE-Net: Scattering Feature Relation Enhancement Network for Aircraft Detection in SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aircraft detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a challenging task due to the discreteness of aircraft scattering characteristics, the diversity of aircraft size, and the interference of complex backgrounds. To address these problems, we propose a novel scattering feature relation enhancement network (SFRE-Net) in this paper. Firstly, a cascade transformer block (TRsB) structure is adopted to improve the integrity of aircraft detection results by modeling the correlation between feature points. Secondly, a feature-adaptive fusion pyramid structure (FAFP) is proposed to aggregate features of different levels and scales, enable the network to autonomously extract useful semantic information, and improve the multi-scale representation ability of the network. Thirdly, a context attention-enhancement module (CAEM) is designed to improve the positioning accuracy in complex backgrounds. Considering the discreteness of scattering characteristics, the module uses a dilated convolution pyramid structure to improve the receptive field and then captures the position of the aircraft target through the coordinate attention mechanism. Experiments on the Gaofen-3 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of SFRE-Net with a precision rate of 94.4% and a recall rate of 94.5%.

TI  - Impact of ethanol-gasoline implementation on vehicle emission based on remote sensing test
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The vehicle exhaust remote sensing system was used to quantify the carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), and nitrogen oxide (NO) concentrations of vehicles before and after the ethanol-gasoline implementation. The purpose was to investigate gasoline vehicle emissions for two distinct periods: before and after the ethanol-gasoline implementation. A comprehensive vehicle emission remote sensing data set collected in 2018 and 2019. The remote sensing test data was screened for duplicate vehicles in both two years. The average emission concentration of HC-CO-NO showed a continuous downward trend after ethanol-gasoline implementation. The three pollutant emission factors of small passenger cars are all lower than those of light trucks. Overall, the HC-CO-NO emission factors obtained through remote sensing tests have a small range of variation. From the results of the two-year test data, the emission levels of the 10% worst emission vehicles have shown a certain reduction compared with before the ethanol-gasoline implementation. Compared with random test errors of dynamometer emission test and portable emission measurement system, statistical results based on remote sensing test big data are more accurate.

TI  - Interpretation of the Spatiotemporal Evolution Characteristics of Land Deformation in Beijing during 2003-2020 Using Sentinel, ENVISAT, and Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1930s, due to the rapid development of the city and the increase of population, the demand from Beijing residents for water resources has gradually increased. Land deformation in the Beijing Plain is a serious issue. In order to warn of, and mitigate, disasters, it is urgently necessary to obtain the latest rate, extent, and temporal evolution of land subsidence in Beijing. Firstly, the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of land deformation in Beijing during 2003-2020 were unveiled using the time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique and two different satellite datasets, sentinel-1a/1b and ENVISAT ASAR. By means of combining calibration of InSAR results with the global positioning system (GPS), we studied the evolutionary process of long-term land subsidence in Beijing. The precision of our InSAR annual subsidence results is less than 10 mm. Land subsidence in Beijing is unevenly distributed, and so five main land subsidence zones were monitored. The time-series results showed that the rate of land subsidence rate continued to increase from 2003 to 2015, but has gradually shown a slowing trend from 2015 to 2020. Further, we used the quadratic polynomial fitting method to interpolate the time-series deformation results from 2010 to 2015, and compared these with GPS. The results demonstrated that although the InSAR observation method is not strictly registered with GPS in time, its deformation trend is consistent. In addition, the calibrated long time-series was consistent with the three deformation stages of land subsidence evolution in Beijing. Finally, we analyzed the deformation information obtained by InSAR technology in combination with land use type data, precipitation and groundwater data. The results demonstrated that the central area is mostly stable, and land deformation in the northeast is obvious and uneven. In addition, land use type and precipitation have little influence on land subsidence. Changes in land subsidence were closely related to changes in groundwater level, and seasonal variations in deformation correlated with precipitation.

TI  - Surface Deformation of Expansive Soil at Ankang Airport, China, Revealed by InSAR Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ankang Airport is constructed on an expansive soil-fill platform in Shaanxi Province, Central China. Since its completion in 2020, it has suffered surface deformation caused by the consolidation and settlement of the fill layer and instability of the expansive soil slope. Exploring the special deformation law of expansive soil regions by remote sensing and analyzing the deformation characteristics of airports in mountainous areas have always been key issues in related disaster research. Based on the intensity and phase observation data of 37 Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar images, this study obtained the spatio-temporal distribution of the deformation of Ankang Airport from May 2020 to October 2021. First, phase optimization was performed on the original interferograms. Second, the persistent scatterer synthetic aperture radar interferometry (PS-InSAR) method was applied to extract the surface deformation information of Ankang Airport, and the accuracy was evaluated. Finally, the singular spectrum analysis method was introduced to jointly analyze the deformation information obtained by the InSAR technology in combination with geological and climatic data. The results show that the excavation area of Ankang Airport was basically stable, the filling area had obvious surface and uneven deformation, and the expansive soil fill slope exhibits deformation characteristics strongly related to slope, rainfall, and fill depth. The deformation was mainly caused by consolidation and settlement, supplemented by the expansion and shrinkage deformation of the expansive soil.

TI  - A Continuous Change Tracker Model for Remote Sensing Time Series Reconstruction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is hard for current time series reconstruction methods to achieve the balance of high-precision time series reconstruction and explanation of the model mechanism. The goal of this paper is to improve the reconstruction accuracy with a well-explained time series model. Thus, we developed a function-based model, the CCTM (Continuous Change Tracker Model) model, that can achieve high precision in time series reconstruction by tracking the time series variation rate. The goal of this paper is to provide a new solution for high-precision time series reconstruction and related applications. To test the reconstruction effects, the model was applied to four types of datasets: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), gross primary productivity (GPP), leaf area index (LAI), and MODIS surface reflectance (MSR). Several new observations are as follows. First, the CCTM model is well explained and based on the second-order derivative theorem, which divides the yearly time series into four variation types including uniform variations, decelerated variations, accelerated variations, and short-periodical variations, and each variation type is represented by a designed function. Second, the CCTM model provides much better reconstruction results than the Harmonic model on the NDVI, GPP, MSR, and LAI datasets for the seasonal segment reconstruction. The combined use of the Savitzky-Golay filter and the CCTM model is better than the combinations of the Savitzky-Golay filter with other models. Third, the Harmonic model has the best trend-fitting ability on the yearly time series dataset, with the highest R-Square and the lowest RMSE among the four function fitting models. However, with seasonal piecewise fitting, the four models all achieved high accuracy, and the CCTM performs the best. Fourth, the CCTM model should also be applied to time series image compression, two compression patterns with 24 coefficients and 6 coefficients respectively are proposed. The daily MSR dataset can achieve a compression ratio of 15 by using the 6-coefficients method. Finally, the CCTM model also has the potential to be applied to change detection, trend analysis, and phenology and seasonal characteristics extractions.

TI  - A New Spatial-Temporal Depthwise Separable Convolutional Fusion Network for Generating Landsat 8-Day Surface Reflectance Time Series over Forest Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat has provided the longest fine resolution data archive of Earth's environment since 1972; however, one of the challenges in using Landsat data for various applications is its frequent large data gaps and heavy cloud contaminations. One pressing research topic is to generate the regular time series by integrating coarse-resolution satellite data through data fusion techniques. This study presents a novel spatiotemporal fusion (STF) method based on a depthwise separable convolutional neural network (DSC), namely, STFDSC, to generate Landsat-surface reflectance time series at 8-day intervals by fusing Landsat 30 m with high-quality Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 500 m surface reflectance data. The STFDSC method consists of three main stages: feature extraction, feature fusion and prediction. Features were first extracted from Landsat and MODIS surface reflectance changes, and the extracted multilevel features were then stacked and fused. Both low-level and middle-level features that were generally ignored in convolutional neural network (CNN)-based fusion models were included in STFDSC to avoid key information loss and thus ensure high prediction accuracy. The prediction stage generated a Landsat residual image and is combined with original Landsat data to obtain predictions of Landsat imagery at the target date. The performance of STFDSC was evaluated in the Greater Khingan Mountains (GKM) in Northeast China and the Ziwuling (ZWL) forest region in Northwest China. A comparison of STFDSC with four published fusion methods, including two classic fusion methods (FSDAF, ESTARFM) and two machine learning methods (EDCSTFN and STFNET), was also carried out. The results showed that STFDSC made stable and more accurate predictions of Landsat surface reflectance than other methods in both the GKM and ZWL regions. The root-mean-square-errors (RMSEs) of TM bands 2, 3, 4, and 7 were 0.0046, 0.0038, 0.0143, and 0.0055 in GKM, respectively, and 0.0246, 0.0176, 0.0280, and 0.0141 in ZWL, respectively; it can be potentially used for generating the global surface reflectance and other high-level land products.

TI  - WaterSmart-GIS: A Web Application of a Data Assimilation Model to Support Irrigation Research and Decision Making
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation is the primary consumer of freshwater by humans and accounts for over 70% of all annual water use. However, due to the shortage of open critical information in agriculture such as soil, precipitation, and crop status, farmers heavily rely on empirical knowledge to schedule irrigation and tend to excessive irrigation to ensure crop yields. This paper presents WaterSmart-GIS, a web-based geographic information system (GIS), to collect and disseminate near-real-time information critical for irrigation scheduling, such as soil moisture, evapotranspiration, precipitation, and humidity, to stakeholders. The disseminated datasets include both numerical model results of reanalysis and forecasting from HRLDAS (High-Resolution Land Data Assimilation System), and the remote sensing datasets from NASA SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The system aims to quickly and easily create a smart, customized irrigation scheduler for individual fields to relieve the burden on farmers and to significantly reduce wasted water, energy, and equipment due to excessive irrigation. The system is prototyped here with an application in Nebraska, demonstrating its ability to collect and deliver information to end-users via the web application, which provides online analytic functionality such as point-based query, spatial statistics, and timeseries query. Systems such as this will play a critical role in the next few decades to sustain agriculture, which faces great challenges from climate change and increased natural disasters.

TI  - Comprehensive Precipitable Water Vapor Retrieval and Application Platform Based on Various Water Vapor Detection Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric water vapor is one of the important parameters for weather and climate studies. Generally, atmospheric water vapor can be monitored by some techniques, such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), radiosonde (RS), remote sensing and numerical weather forecast (NWF). However, the comprehensive retrieval and application of precipitable water vapor (PWV) using multi techniques has been hardly performed before, which becomes the focus of this study. A comprehensive PWV retrieval and application platform (CPRAP) is first established by combing the ground-based (GNSS), space-based (Fengyun-3A, Sentinel-3A) and reanalysis-based (the fifth-generation reanalysis dataset of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting, ERA5) techniques. Additionally, its applications are then extended to drought and rainfall monitoring using the CPRAP-derived PWV. The statistical result shows that PWV derived from ground-based GNSS has high accuracy in China, with the root mean square (RMS), Bias and mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.15, 0.05 and 1.65 mm, respectively, when the RS-derived PWV is regarded as the reference. In addition, the accuracy of PWV derived from the space-based (FY-3A and Sentinel-3A) techniques technique is also validated and the RMS, Bias and MAE of a Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) onboard Fengyun-3A (FY-3A) and an Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3A are 4.46/0.56/3.61 mm and 2.95/0.01/1.37 mm, respectively. Then, the performance of ERA5-derived PWV is evaluated based on GNSS-derived and RS-derived PWV. The result also shows good accuracy of ERA5-provided PWV with the averaged RMS, Bias and MAE of 1.86/0.11/1.48 mm and 0.90/-0.05/1.51 mm, respectively. Finally, the PWV data derived from the established CPRAP are further used for drought and rainfall monitoring. The applied results reveal that the calculated the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) using the CPRAP-derived PWV can monitor the drought and the correlation coefficient ranges from 0.83 to 0.9 when compared with the SPEI. Furthermore, in this paper correlation analysis between PWV derived from the CPRAP and rainfall, and its potential for rainfall monitoring was also validated. Such results verify the significance of the established CPRAP for weather and climate studies.

TI  - Multi-Component Passivators Regulate Heavy Metal Accumulation in Paddy Soil and Rice: A Three-Site Field Experiment in South China
T2  - TOXICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To fulfill sustainability principles, a three-site field experiment was conducted to screen suitably mixed passivators from lime + biochar (L + C, 9000 kgha(-1) with a rate of 1:1) and lime + biochar + sepiolite (L + C + S, 9000 kg ha(-1) with a rate of 1:1:1), in Yuecheng (YC), Zhuji (ZJ), and Fuyang (FY), where there are typical contaminated soils, in South China. Treated with passivators in soil, DTPA-extractable Cd, Cr and Pb in soil were decreased by 9.87-26.3%, 37.2-67.5%, and 19.0-54.2%, respectively; Cd, Cr, and Pb in rice were decreased by 85.9-91.5%, 40.0-76.5%, and 16.4-45.4%, respectively; and these were followed by slightly higher efficacy of L + C + S than L + C. The differences between L + C and L + C + S mainly lie in soil microbial communities, enzymes, and fertility. In YC, treatment with L + C + S increased microbial carbon and activities of urease (EC3.5.1.5) and phosphatase (EC3.1.3.1) by 21.0%, 85.5%, and 22.3%; while treatment with L + C decreased microbial carbon and activities of phosphatase and sucrose (EC3.2.1.26) by 1.31%, 34.9%, and 43.4%, respectively. Moreover, the treatment of FY soils with L + C + S increased microbial carbon and activities of urease, phosphatase, and sucrase by 35.4%, 41.6%, 27.9%, and 7.37%; and L + C treatment only increased the microbial carbon and the activity of phosphatase by 3.14% and 30.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the organic matter and available nitrogen were also increased by 8.8-19.0% and 7.4-14.6% with L + C + S treatments, respectively. These suggested that the combination of L + C + S stimulated the growth of soil microbial communities and increased the activity of soil enzymes. Therefore, the L + C + S strategy can be a practical and effective measure for safe rice production as it was more suitable for the remediation of heavy metals in our experimental sites.

TI  - Genomic and Phenotypic Diversity of Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae Isolates from Bacteremia in China: A Multicenter Epidemiological, Microbiological, and Genetic Study
T2  - ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) isolates are recognized as one of the most severe threats to public health. However, the population structure and genetic characteristics of CPE isolates among bloodstream infections (BSIs) are largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, in this study, we included patients with clinically significant BSIs due to Enterobacterales isolates, recruited from 26 sentinel hospitals in China (2014-2015). CPE isolates were microbiologically and genomically characterized, including their susceptibility profiles, molecular typing, phylogenetic features, and genetic context analysis of carbapenemase-encoding genes. Of the 2569 BSI Enterobacterales isolates enrolled, 42 (1.6%) were carbapenemase-positive. Moreover, among the 2242 investigated isolates, 1111 (49.6%) extendedspectrum 13-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates were identified in Escherichia coli (E. coli), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis), and Klebsiella oxytoca. Whole genome sequencing analysis showed the clonal spread of K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-2-producing K. pneumoniae sequence type (ST) 11 and New Delhi metallo-13-lactamase (NDM)-5-producing E. coli ST167 in our collection. Plasmid analysis revealed that carbapenemase-encoding genes were located on multiple plasmids. A high prevalence of biofilm-encoding type 3 fimbriae clusters and yesiniabactin-associated genes was observed in K. pneumoniae isolates. This work demonstrates the high prevalence of ESBLs and the wide dissemination of CPE among BSI isolates in China, which represent real clinical threats. Moreover, our findings first illustrate a more comprehensive genome scenario of CPE isolates among BSIs. The clonal spread of KPC2-producing K. pneumoniae ST11 and NDM-5-producing E. coli ST167 needs to be closely monitored. (C) 2020 THE AUTHORS.

TI  - Monitoring Potential Geological Hazards with Different InSAR Algorithms: The Case of Western Sichuan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the number of geological disasters in Sichuan Province has significantly increased due to the influence of earthquakes and extreme climate, as well as the disturbance to the geological environment by human activities. Thus, geological disaster monitoring is particularly important, which can provide some scientific basis for disaster prevention and reduction. In this paper, the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology was introduced to monitor potential geological hazards, taking parts of Dujiangyan City, Wenchuan County, and Mao County in Sichuan Province, China as examples. Firstly, the data such as Sentinel-1A Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans (TOPS) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and Precision Orbit Determination (POD) precise orbit ephemerides from 2018 to 2020, high-resolution optical satellite images and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were collected. Secondly, the Differential InSAR (D-InSAR), Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR), Small Baseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR), Offset-Tracking, and Distributed Scatterer InSAR (DS-InSAR) algorithms were used to invert the surface deformation of the study area. Thirdly, according to the deformation results obtained by experiments, we used GF-1 and GF-2 optical images as a reference and combine the experimental results of InSAR algorithms to delineate the areas affected by geological disasters. A total of 49 geological disaster areas were obtained, mainly including landslides, collapses, and debris flow. Through field verification, the overall accuracy rate of InSAR deformation monitoring achieved 69.23%, and the accuracy rate of new potential hazards monitoring reached 63.64%. Among all InSAR methods, the DS-InSAR method outperformed and monitored the geological disaster areas well. Finally, the study area was divided into three elevation intervals and the applicability of different InSAR algorithms in different elevation intervals was discussed.

TI  - Monitoring and Evaluation of Eco-Environment Quality Based on Remote Sensing-Based Ecological Index (RSEI) in Taihu Lake Basin, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and effective access to the spatiotemporal patterns and evolutionary trends of the regional eco-environment is key to regional environment protection and planning. Based on the Google Earth Engine platform, we use 165 Landsat images from the summer and autumn seasons (May-November) of 2000, 2010, and 2018 as data sources to calculate the RSEI, which represents the quality of the eco-environment, and then analyze the factors influencing the spatial heterogeneity of the eco-environment and the relationship between eco-environment and land-use changes based on RSEI. The results showed the following: (1) From 2000 to 2018, the overall ecological environment quality of the Taihu Lake Basin showed a stage of rapid decline (2000-2010) and a stage of slow decline (2010-2018). (2) The factors were ranked in order of their explanatory power for the spatial heterogeneity of the RSEI: land-use (0.594) > population density (0.418) > slope (0.309) > elevation (0.308) > GDP (0.304) > temperature (0.233) > precipitation (0.208). An interactive effect was found for each factor of the RSEI, which is mainly represented by a mutual enhancement. (3) From 2000 to 2010, the rapid urban expansion was the main reason for the deterioration of ecological quality. From 2010 to 2018, urban expansion slowed down, and the trend of ecological quality deterioration was effectively curbed. Therefore, promoting the intensive use of land and reducing construction land expansion are key to ensuring sustainable regional socio-economic development.

TI  - Effects of Atmospheric Heat Source on the Tibetan Plateau Vortex in Different Stages: A Case Study in June 2016
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) vortex (TPV), one of the crucial weather systems triggering rainfall, plays a key role in modulating precipitation over TP and downstream regions. The role of atmospheric heat source in TPV development is explored by a case study in June 2016, using high-resolution ERA5 reanalysis, black-body temperature (TBB) obtained from the Fengyun-2E (FY-2E) satellite, and precipitation amount from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM). The evolutions of TPV can be split into three stages, i.e., generation, development, and pre-moving-off stage. The intensity of TPV increases with fluctuations, with weaker and shallower TPV in the generation stage, strongest in the development stage and deepest in the pre-moving-off stage. Importantly, the genesis of TPV is related to the surface warming center driven by surface sensible heating while its development is primarily dependent on the latent heat of condensation. The main contributor of the latent heat of condensation is further analyzed as a vertical transport of the water vapor that promotes TPV development.

TI  - Identification of Unstable Glacier Flow in the Western Tibetan Plateau and Karakoram Using Machine Learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel method was developed for rapidly and accurately identifying unstable glacier flows, including pulse and surge events. The identification method was based on machine learning and high-frequency glacier velocities derived from short time interval Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The method was built and tested using 32 glaciers in the eastern Pamir Plateau and applied it to 13 glaciers in western Karakoram. The test results showed that the success rate of identifying speedup events was more than 90% compared to manual interpretation results derived using velocity change maps and DEM differencing. The application results showed that there were some neglected pulse events, including two pulses on the Kukuar Glacier in 2017 and 2019, one pulse on the Karambar Glacier in 2017, and one pulse on the Ghulkin Glacier in 2016. Moreover, a complete surge event with multiple scattered pulses on the Shispare Glacier in 2018-2019 was also detected. The speedup events of the Shispare Glacier indicated the possibility of mutual transformation between pulse and surge events due to the influence of glacier basal roughness. In all unstable flows occurring within the test and application areas, pulse events could be observed on the nonsurging glaciers during the active phase and quiescent phase of the surge-type glaciers, which might suggest the randomness of pulse events. Machine learning method made it possible to identify glacier speedup events in large areas with high efficiency and low manpower.

TI  - Estimation of Winter Wheat Residue Coverage Based on GF-1 Imagery and Machine Learning Algorithm
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop residue is an important component of farmland ecosystems, which is of great significance for increasing soil organic carbon, mitigating wind erosion and water erosion and conserving soil and water. Crop residue coverage (CRC) is an important parameter to characterize the number and distribution of crop residues, and also a key indicator of conservation tillage. In this study, the CRC of wheat was taken as the research object. Based on the high-resolution GF-1 satellite remote sensing imagery from China, decision tree (DT), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), random forest (RF), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR) and other machine learning algorithms were used to carry out the estimation of wheat CRC by remote sensing. In addition, the comparisons with sentinel-2 imagery data were also utilized to assess the potential of GF satellite data for CRC estimates. The results show the following: (1) Among the spectral indexes using shortwave infrared characteristic bands from sentinel-2 imagery, the dead fuel index (DFI) was the best for estimating wheat CRC, with an R-2 of 0.54 and an RMSE of 10.26%. The ratio vegetation index (RVI) extracted from visible and near-infrared characteristic bands from GF-1 data performed the best, with an R-2 of 0.46 and an RMSE of 11.39%. The spectral index extracted from GF-1 and sentinel-2 images had a significant response relationship with wheat residue coverage. (2) When only the characteristic bands from the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges were applied, the effects of the spatial resolution differences of different images on wheat CRC had to be taken into account. The estimations of wheat CRC with the high-resolution GF-1 data were significantly better than those with the Sentinel-2 data, and among multiple machine learning algorithms adopted to estimate wheat CRC, LASSO had the most stable capability, with an R-2 of 0.46 and an RMSE of 11.4%. This indicates that GF-1 high-resolution satellite imagery without shortwave infrared bands has a good potential in applications of monitoring crop residue coverage for wheat, and the relevant technology and method can also provide a useful reference for CRC estimates of other crops.

TI  - Has China's New Round of Collective Forest Reforms Reduced Forest Fragmentation? A Case Study of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The new wave of reform of collective forestland tenure (NRCFT) in China is considered an important policy for achieving sustainable management of forest resources. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of NRCFT on forest fragmentation in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region of China based on a fixed-effects model. The forest fragmentation was analyzed based on the remote sensing images of Landsat and landscape pattern indices in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2000 to 2018. The results showed that (1) The NRCFT has significantly contributed to reducing forest fragmentation. (2) The effect of economic growth on forest fragmentation showed an inverted U-shape. (3) The implementation of the Grain for Green Program (GGP) and the transformation of rural energy consumption significantly reduce the degree of forest fragmentation. This study has crucial implications for formulating policies, achieving good forest governance, and reducing forest fragmentation.

TI  - Exploring the Chemical Properties and Biological Activity of Four New Zealand Monofloral Honeys to Support the Maori Vision and Aspirations
T2  - MOLECULES
M3  - Review
AB  - Honey production and export are significant contributors to the Aotearoa New Zealand economy, generating over 400 million dollars in revenue. Its main export is manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey, which has a high commercial value due to its medicinal properties that are linked to its unique chemical composition. The compound methylglyoxal (MGO) has been identified as the main floral marker and is used as a quality indicator, often labelled as unique manuka factor (UMF). However, the high demand for manuka honey creates pressure on beekeepers and may have negative ecological consequences by favouring extensive manuka monocultures to the detriment of other native species. There are other honeys native to New Zealand, such as kamahi (Weinmannia racemosa), kanuka (Kunzea ericoides), rata (Metrosideros robusta) and rewarewa (Knightia excelsa), that also have medicinal properties; however, they are less well known in the local and global market. Indigenous Maori communities envision the production and commercialization (locally and internationally) of these honeys as an opportunity to generate income and secure a sustainable future in alignment with their worldview (Te Ao Maori) and values (tikanga Maori). Diversifying the market could lead to a more sustainable income for beekeepers and reduce pressure on Maori and the conservation land, while supporting indigenous communities to realize their vision and aspirations. This manuscript provides an extensive review of the scientific literature, technical literature and traditional knowledge databases describing the plants of interest and their traditional medicinal uses (rongoa) and the chemical properties of each honey, potential floral markers and their biological activity. For each honey type, we also identify knowledge gaps and potential research avenues. This information will assist Maori beekeepers, researchers, consumers and other stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding future research and the production, marketing and consumption of these native monofloral honeys.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Reports an error in "Can subjective perceptions of trauma differentiate between ICD-11 PTSD and complex PTSD? A cross-cultural comparison of three African countries" by Yuval Palgi, Thanos Karatzias, Philip Hyland, Mark Shevlin and Menachem Ben-Ezra (Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, 2021[Feb], Vol 13[2], 142-148). In the article, the number of participants listed in the abstract was incorrectly reported as "2,554." The correct number is "2,524." The online version of this article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2020-69781-001.) Background: The primary aim of the current study was to establish the cutoffs scores for the Subjective Traumatic Outlook (STO), a relatively new tool that examines the introspective worldview of those exposed to traumatic events. This tool was developed as a complementary scale to be used in conjunction with the observed-phenomenological measures of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) complex PTSD (CPTSD). The present study examines the predictive power of STO for distinguishing between PTSD and CPTSD in African countries. Method: A national representative (based on age and gender) sample of 2,524 participants was drawn from 3 African countries (Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana) who completed the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) and the STO. We conducted a set of analyses examining that alignment of ITQ probable PTSD and CPTSD and different STO cutoff scores. Results: Results suggest that the STO single-factor structure was stable across countries, had a strong association with PTSD and CPTSD levels, and had predictive utility in differentiating between PTSD and CPTSD. Moreover, we found that there are different cutoffs for the STO in the different countries. Conclusion: There is a strong but distinctive association between the introspective and the observed-phenomenological approaches of PTSD and CPTSD. Our findings call for more integrative approaches for the assessment of PTSD and CPTSD and suggest that there are cultural differences in STO.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes in aerosols over Bangladesh using 18 years of MODIS and reanalysis data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, combined Dark Target and Deep Blue (DTB) aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD550 nm) data the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) flying on the Terra and Aqua satellites during the years 2003-2020 are used as a reference to assess the performance of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Services (CAMS) and the second version of Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) AOD over Bangladesh. The study also investigates long-term spatiotemporal variations and trends in AOD, and determines the relative contributions from different aerosol species (black carbon: BC, dust, organic carbon: OC, sea salt: SS, and sulfate) and anthropogenic emissions to the total AOD. As the evaluations suggest higher accuracy for CAMS than for MERRA-2, CAMS is used for further analysis of AOD over Bangladesh. The annual mean AOD from both CAMS and MODIS DTB is high (> 0.60) over most parts of Bangladesh except for the eastern areas of Chattogram and Sylhet. Higher AOD is observed in spring and winter than in summer and autumn, which is mainly due to higher local anthropogenic emissions during the winter to spring season. Annual trends from 2003-2020 show a significant increase in AOD (by 0.006-0.014 year -1) over Bangladesh, and this increase in AOD was more evident in winter and spring than in summer and autumn. The increasing total AOD is caused by rising anthropogenic emissions and accompanied by changes in aerosol species (with increased OC, sulfate, and BC). Overall, this study improves understanding of aerosol pollution in Bangladesh and can be considered as a supportive document for Bangladesh to improve air quality by reducing anthropogenic emissions.

TI  - Sentinel-5P TROPOMI satellite application for NO<sub>2 </sub>and CO studies aiming at environmental valuation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Space Agency (ESA) provides opportunities for researchers on a global scale to identify gaseous pollutants using the most modern techniques of analysis by satellite images from the Sentinel-5P satellite, in the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), for the formation of current scenarios, applied to valuation environment aimed at possible improvements attributed to air quality and human health. The general objective of this manuscript is to analyze the amounts of NO2 and CO gases with Sentinel-5P TROPOMI satellite images, collected during the year 2019, and apply the environmental valuation focused on air quality pollution, in the northern region of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in the host city, Passo Fundo (southern Brazil) from 2020 to early 2021. The air quality valuation study applied the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM). The results showed that NO2 had the highest concentration with a value of 7.88e +15 Column mol/cm2. CO presented a value of 9.43e +33 Column mol/cm2. The creation of scenarios aimed at valuation for the application of improvements in atmospheric air quality the understanding of the Willingness to Pay (WTP) of the interviewees. 514 residents of the City of Passo Fundo were queried as to their WTP for clean air quality in the city. The resulting WTP values, when applied to all households in the city as a whole, yielded an average WTP value of R$1,517,478.24 and the median WTP is R$599,390.00. It is suggested that pubic policies be written to enable these, or similar, amounts to be collected annually in order to mitigate harmful pollutants, such as NO2 and CO, currently found in the air of the City of Passo Fundo.

TI  - Multi-modal fusion of satellite and street-view images for urban village classification based on a dual-branch deep neural network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid urbanization process in China, numerous urban villages have been appeared, which are surrounded by the newly-built urban blocks. Due to the high population density, poor hygiene, chaotic waste discharge, and inadequate public facilities, urban villages have many negative impacts on both urban environment and management. The objective of this study is to propose a dual-branch deep learning model for multi modal satellite and street-view data fusion to detect urban villages in Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang, which are the core cities of Jing-Jin-Ji region of China. Specifically, the proposed model consists of a satellite branch, a street-view branch and a gated-fusion module. As for the satellite branch, a Trans-MDCNN (multi-scale dilated convolutional neural network) is proposed to learn multi-level local features and global contextual features from high resolution satellite imagery, while for the street-view branch, an MVRAN (multi-view recurrent attention network) is constructed to learn and fuse multi-angle features from street-view images. A gated-fusion module is designed to aggregate the important features of the dual-branches. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model has achieved good performance with an overall accuracy (OA) of 92.61%. Ablation study shows that compared with satellite data alone, the integration of street-view images could increase the OA by about 2%. Besides, 1-D feature fusion outperforms its 2-D counterpart and the classic feature concatenation method. The proposed model also yields a better performance than other deep learning models. Finally, the dataset of this study, (SUV)-U-2 (Satellite & Street-view images for Urban Village classification), is publicly available: https://doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.01410.

TI  - A multidisciplinary approach to axillary lymph node staging with ultrasound in the setting of a highly suggestive or suspicious breast mass
T2  - CLINICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - The radiologists' role in axillary imaging in the setting of a suspicious breast mass is evolving in light of the Z0011 trial leading to expected practice variation. The purpose of our project was to generate a standardized algorithm guiding the utilization of axillary ultrasound in the setting of a highly suggestive or highly suspicious breast mass (BI-RADS 4C or 5) without a known cancer diagnosis. The algorithm was created with Z0011 practices in mind while reflecting the clinical preferences of our radiology and surgical teams. The four breast surgeons at our academic institution were individually queried regarding their preferred axillary imaging and biopsy approach. The best practices for axillary imaging were then developed in a breast imaging intradepartmental meeting. There was agreement among the surgical group that the presence of suspicious axillary lymph node (s) on ultrasound could be used for treatment planning and patient discussion but would not be used for surgical planning in most cases. They also agreed that an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of a suspicious axillary lymph node should be deferred until after surgical consultation. Discussion among our breast radiologists resulted in the consensus that axillary ultrasound in the setting of a BIRADS 4 or 5 mass should be deferred at its initial presentation unless there is palpable lymphadenopathy, suspicious lymph node on mammography, or a tumor is at least stage T3, presumably excluding them from Z0011 criteria. The decision was also made to defer biopsies of suspicious axillary lymph nodes without prior surgical consultation/discussion.

TI  - Remote sensing-based assessment of land degradation and drought impacts over terrestrial ecosystems in Northeastern Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatio-temporal assessment of water and carbon fluxes in Brazil's Northeast region (NEB) allows for a better understanding of these surface flux patterns in areas with different vegetation physiognomies. The NEB is divided into four biomes: Amazon, Cerrado, Caatinga, and Atlantic Forest. Land degradation is a growing problem, particularly in susceptible areas of the Caatinga biome, such as the seasonally dry tropical forest. Furthermore, this region has experienced climatic impacts, such as severe droughts. Due to increasing human pressure, the Caatinga's natural land cover undergoes drastic changes, making it a region particularly vulnerable to desertification. In this study, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary production (GPP) were validated in two contrasting areas, dense Caatinga and sparse Caatinga, using eddy covariance (EC) data and then investigated their behavior over 21 years (2000-2021) for the NEB. MODIS products explained around 60% of the variations in ET and GPP, showing higher accuracy in dense Caatinga, while areas of sparse Caatinga presented the lowest GPP, indicating that land degradation has reduced the photosynthetic activity of the vegetation in this area. Based on the analysis of ET and GPP over 21 years, we observed a greater dependence of the sparse Caatinga on climate variability, demonstrating a stronger resilience of dense Caatinga to climate effects. In comparison with the other biomes of the NEB region, we found lower rates of ET and GPP in the Caatinga biome, with averages similar to the Sparse Caatinga. In comparison with the other biomes in the NEB region, we found the lowest averages of ET and GPP in the Caatinga biome, similar to values found in the sparse Caatinga. In forest areas, similar to the monitored DC, they allowed the Caatinga to behave closer to the other biomes present in the region.

TI  - Azimuthal-sensitive three-dimensional HBT radius in Au-Au collisions at <i>E<sub>beam</sub></i>=1.23A GeV by the IQMD model
T2  - EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL A
M3  - Article
AB  - We used an Isospin dependent Quantum Molecular Dynamics (IQMD) model to simulate Au + Au collisions at beam energy E-beam = 1.23A GeV, which corresponds to center of mass energy root S-NN = 2.4 GeV. Firstly, we obtained reasonable rapidity and transverse mass spectra of pi(-) and pi(+) as well as "apparent" temperature parameters in comparison with the HADES data. Then by calculating three-dimensional Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) radius of same charged pion-pairs, we obtained the square difference of outward radius and sideward radius, i.e. R-out(2) - R-side(2), as well as the freeze-out volume (V-fo), which were basically consistent with the trend of HADES experimental results. The azimuthal dependence of the HBT radii was also calculated by a matrix method, and corrected by the rotation matrix. In addition, the eccentricities of the xy- and zy- planes of pion-pair emissions were also extracted for different pair transverse momentum and collision centrality, which show that the xy-eccentricity increases with pair transverse momentum as well as centrality but not for zy-eccentricity, indicating a more asymmetric transverse emission of particle-pairs with higher transverse momentum in off-central collisions.

TI  - DsTer: A dense spectral transformer for remote sensing spectral super-resolution
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - To obtain high-resolution hyperspectral data, spectral super-resolution is a popular computational imaging technique directly from high-resolution multispectral images. Besides sparse recovery, deep learning-based methods perform well in the past years for their powerful nonlinear mapping from multispectral to hyperspectral domains. However, convolutions in deep learning only focus on local information and have been blamed for the neglect of long-range relationships. Nowadays, transformer has been attracting great interest for its global attention to long-range interaction. In this study, we propose a dense spectral transformer with ResNet to achieve spectral super-resolution for multispectral remote sensing images. Combining transformer with ResNet meets the need for 3D data handling to remote sensing images as well as learning long-range relationships. Dense connection helps model exploit features from multi-level transformers. Moreover, spectral recovery results on natural data and three remote sensing data sets all prove the advantage of the proposed model. Furthermore, we also carry out classification experiments on real data to verify the dependability of the reconstructed spectra.

TI  - HMSM-Net: Hierarchical multi-scale matching network for disparity estimation of high-resolution satellite stereo images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Disparity estimation of satellite stereo images is an essential and challenging task in photogrammetry and remote sensing. Recent researches have greatly promoted the development of disparity estimation algorithms by using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) based deep learning techniques. However, it is still difficult to handle intractable regions that are mainly caused by occlusions, disparity discontinuities, texture-less areas, and re-petitive patterns. Besides, the lack of training datasets for satellite stereo images remains another major issue that blocks the usage of CNN techniques due to the difficulty of obtaining ground-truth disparities. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end disparity learning model, termed hierarchical multi-scale matching network (HMSM-Net), for the disparity estimation of high-resolution satellite stereo images. First, multi-scale cost volumes are con-structed by using pyramidal features that capture spatial information of multiple levels, which learn corre-spondences at multiple scales and enable HMSM-Net to be more robust in intractable regions. Second, stereo matching is executed in a hierarchical coarse-to-fine manner by applying supervision to each scale, which allows a lower scale to act as prior knowledge and guides a higher scale to attain finer matching results. Third, a refinement module that incorporates the intensity and gradient information of the input left image is designed to regress a detailed full-resolution disparity map for local structure preservation. For network training and testing, a dense stereo matching dataset is created and published by using GaoFen-7 satellite stereo images. Finally, the proposed network is evaluated on the Urban Semantic 3D and GaoFen-7 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that HMSM-Net achieves superior accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods, and the improvement on intractable regions is noteworthy. Additionally, results and comparisons of different methods on the GaoFen-7 dataset show that it can severs as a challenging benchmark for performance assessment of methods applied to disparity estimation of satellite stereo images. The source codes and evaluation dataset are made publicly available at https://github.com/Sheng029/HMSM-Net.

TI  - Proposal for an index of roads and structures for the mapping of non-vegetated urban surfaces using OSM and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of volunteered geographic information (VGI), such as OpenStreetMap (OSM), to assist in mapping land use and coverage together with remote sensing images is relatively recent. Most studies have used OSM to assist in sample collection for image classification or aggregated vectors of buildings, transport, and land-use and coverage as ancillary data to support mapping refinements. This study proposes a metric called the "index of roads and structures " (IRS) created on the basis of OSM data with the intention of assisting in the mapping of non-vegetated and non-aquatic urban surfaces. IRS thresholds were defined and supplemented with information derived from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) as a way of extending the restriction between urban and non-urban classes and thus achieving better mapping accuracy. To implement this study, multispectral Sentinel-2 images resampled to 10 m on the ground were processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The IRS is a raster file, in which each pixel is associated with the possibility of being inserted in an urban context; thus, the importance of this index as an aid in mapping urban areas is clear. We have demonstrated the possibility of using the IRS to map non-vegetated urban surfaces in Brazil (8.5 million square kilometers) and obtained a very high accuracy of 91.2%.

TI  - Retrieval Algorithm of Water Pollutant Concentration Based on UAV Remote Sensing Technology
T2  - MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of the society and economy, traditional water pollution monitoring methods can no longer meet the normal needs of work. Unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing technology has gradually emerged, and it has shown a development trend of multimodel and multifunction. However, the application of UAV remote sensing technology in water pollution monitoring is in its infancy and has not formed a unified method and standard. This paper introduces the disadvantages of UAV Remote Sensing Technology in water pollution monitoring and provides a way to improve the application level of UAV Remote Sensing Technology in water pollution monitoring. In order to make full use of the advantages of remote sensing monitoring technology in water ecological environment monitoring, including wide coverage, fast analysis speed, accurate and reliable monitoring results, and large amount of information, according to the spectral effect of polluted water, a remote sensing inversion model of river and lake parameters is established to determine the water quality of rivers and lakes. Concentrations of pollutants in the body are inverted and analyzed. The analysis results show that the fitting effect of the inversion model is accurate and the accuracy errors reflected by the degree of dispersion and deviation are also acceptable. The inversion results of the concentration of river and lake characteristic parameters based on the Gaofen-1 remote sensing image data are in line with the actual situation. The research results can greatly strengthen the monitoring capacity of the sewage outlet and provide reference for related research on water pollution caused by the sewage outlet.

TI  - Crop Cultivation at Wartime - Plight and Resilience of Tigray's Agrarian Society (North Ethiopia)
T2  - DEFENCE AND PEACE ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - During the 2021 conflict in Tigray (north Ethiopia), crop cultivation has been hampered by warfare. Oxen have been looted and killed, farm inputs and tools destroyed by Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers. Farmers felt vulnerable out in the open with their oxen. To produce, farmers evaluated risks involved with ploughing and organised lookouts. Overall, a large part of the land had been tilled in difficult conditions, and crops sown that require minimal management, without fertiliser, what led to low yields. True Colour Composite images, produced from Sentinel satellite imagery show that smallholder irrigation schemes were operational. There was a shift from commercial crops to cereals. The situation in western Tigray was particular, as there has been ethnic cleansing of the population and often the 2020 rainfed crops had even not been harvested. Overall, our findings show that the Tigrayan smallholder farming system is resilient, thanks to community self-organisation, combining common strategies of agrarian societies in wartime: spatio-temporal shift in agricultural activities to avoid the proximity with soldiers and shifts in crop types. Rather unique is the relying on communal aid, while the blockade of the Tigray region made that outmigration and off-farm income were no options for the farmers.

TI  - Potential of mapping dissolved oxygen in the Little Miami River using Sentinel-2 images and machine learning algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved oxygen (DO) is one of the most significant indicators of water quality in the inland water systems. Maintaining DO monitoring systems is time and money consuming since in situ DO data with high spatial and temporal resolution is needed to design appropriate coastal management plans. In this study, we mapped the spatiotemporal changes of DO in the Little Miami River (LMR) using 10-m Sentinel-2 images. We trained two machine learning algorithms - Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - to predict DO concentrations using spectral predictors derived from the satellite images. Moreover, we calculated several metrics, which include Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Amount of Variance Explained (AVE), Coefficient of Efficiency (COE), and Normalized Mean Bias (NMB) to assess the performance of the models and accuracy of the DO maps. Our results showed a good agreement between modeled and measured DO concentrations with minimal residual errors ranging between 0.201 mg/L and 0.241 mg/L. Furthermore, RF and SVM revealed to be the reliable and effective algorithms to estimate DO concentrations with bands 5 (B5, vegetation red edge) and 8 (B8, NIR) as important predictors. We found the DO concentrations in the LMR to be in good to excellent range (7.3 mg/L to 14.7 mg/L for August and 10.8 mg/L to 14.5 mg/L for October), based on the minimum criterion for warm water habitat in the Ohio Water Quality Standards (WQS). Our findings have provided spatial insight to the current status of DO and the success of the management steps taken to manage and prevent eutrophic problems in the LMR.

TI  - Reflectance spectroscopy and ASTER mapping of aeolian dunes of Shaqra and Tharmada Provinces, Saudi Arabia: Field validation and laboratory confirmation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial variability of grain sizes and mapping of aeolian dunes is important to study the sand erosion, transport, and dune movement and to understand the dune encroachment and land degradation. This study examines the grain size statistical parameters and mineralogical composition of 68 sand samples collected from 17 crescentic dunes and assesses the source and depositional environment of these dunes. The analyses of samples for grain sizes resulted that the sands are characteristics to fine with an average size of 2.28 (sic) and classified as moderately well-sorted(0.59 (sic)), mesokurtic (0.97 (sic)), and fine to coarsely skewed (0.14 (sic)). X-Ray Diffraction shows that the dunes are deposited mainly by quartz, calcite, and haematite. The occurrence of absorption features near 0.5, 0.9, and 2.22 mu m confirm the presence of such iron and aluminosilicate minerals in the dunes. The dunes of the provinces were mapped using TIR bands of ASTER satellite data by Carbonate index (CI) and Quartz index (QI). A good agreement among the results of grain size analyses, spectral measurements, mineralogical studies, and mapping of dunes with the field observations suggests that the sand deposits in the study area have a diversity of sources in the aeolian environment.

TI  - Aquifer heterogeneity controls to quality monitoring network performance for the protection of groundwater production wells
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A groundwater monitoring network surrounding a pumping well (such as a public water supply) allows for early contaminant detection and mitigation where possible contaminant source locations are often unknown. This numerical study investigates how the contaminant detection probability of a hypothetical sentinel-well monitoring network consisting of one to four monitoring wells is affected by aquifer spatial heterogeneity and dispersion characteristics, where the contaminant source location is randomized. This is achieved through a stochastic framework using a Monte Carlo approach. A single production well is considered that results in converging non-uniform flow close to the well. Optimal network arrangements are obtained by maximizing a weighted risk function that considers true and false positive detection rates, sampling frequency, early detection, and contaminant travel time uncertainty. Aquifer dispersivity is found to be the dominant parameter for the quantification of network performance. For the range of parameters considered, a single monitoring well screening the full aquifer thickness is expected to correctly and timely identify at least 12% of all incidents resulting in contaminants reaching the production well. This proportion increases to a global maximum of 96% for a network consisting of four wells and very dispersive transport conditions. Irrespective of network size and sampling frequency, more dispersive transport conditions result in higher detection rates. Increasing aquifer heterogeneity and decreasing aquifer spatial continuity also lead to higher detection rates, though these effects are diminished for networks of 3 or more wells. Statistical anisotropy has no effect on the network performance. Earlier detection, which is critical for remedial action and supply safety, comes with a significant cost in terms of detection rate, and should be carefully considered when a monitoring network is being designed.

TI  - Electronic Media and New Configurations of the Content of Modern Educational Practices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Electronic media are an integral part of modern civilization; educational practices are no exception, which should change the content orientations, structures and methodological approaches in accordance with the requirements of the educational market. This makes it relevant to find effective and successful configurations in the process of implementing modern educational practices. The purpose of the research lies in determining the basic principles of electronic media and their place in modern education, identifying the effectiveness of teaching disciplines with application of electronic media, as well as establishing the level of assessment by students of the need to involve different types of electronic media in the educational process and professional practice. The research methodology is complex; the descriptive method and methods of observation, analysis and synthesis have been used in the academic paper. The method of pedagogical experiment has become the principal one; the method of questionnaires and statistical methods have been also used. The hypothesis of the academic paper lies in the fact that the involvement of electronic media in the educational process makes it more effective and requires conceptual changes in educational practices. The result of the research manifests in the identification of new opportunities for the use of electronic media, leading to conceptual shifts in the framework of modern educational policies. In the future, it will be appropriate to consider the theoretical aspects of changing worldview models in education and the use of new media in the educational process, their effectiveness and relevance.

TI  - Global 10-m impervious surface area mapping: A big earth data based extraction and updating approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The impervious surface area is a critical component of anthropogenic environment that can be utilized as a proxy for assessing urbanization sustainability. However, there remains a lack of global high-precision product of impervious surface area, especially in the arid and semi-arid regions, due to the difficulty of human settlement extraction from remote sensing data. The complexity and variability of human settlements makes it difficult to identify and delineate impervious surfaces by using a single data source or classifier. In this paper, we employed Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical images, in conjunction with a range of ancillary datasets that were publicly available (such as nighttime light data and ecological zone information), to develop an accurate extraction and updating approach for global impervious surface area mapping across various geographical regions. We generated two high-resolution global impervious surface area (Hi-GISA) maps for 2015 and 2018 with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The resultant Hi-GISA maps not only provided a detailed distribution of human settlements in both urban and rural areas, but also helped quantitative change analysis in terms of both expansion and reduction. Conventionally, we randomly selected 3,980 and 4,354 blocks with a size of 300 m x 300 m for the respective datasets in 2015 and 2018, to compare the accuracy of our product with other products. The validation results show that the Hi-GISA data in in each year reached a R-2 higher than 0.8 and achieved a mean overall accuracy over 88%. The areal estimations demonstrated that global impervious surfaces rose from 1.27 million km(2) in 2015 to 1.29 million km(2) in 2018 with an increase of 20,000 km(2). Nearly 80% of global impervious surfaces was contributed by 20 nations led by China, USA, and Russia. At the same time, South America had experienced the most significant growth (-3.35%) among all continents, followed by Africa (similar to 2.59%). The Hi-GISA datasets provide new baseline products of global impervious surface area at 10 m resolution. These maps combined with other socioeconomic data could contribute to monitoring and analysis of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular, SDG 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3, and would also be valuable in assessing other SDG targets related to "Sustainable cities and communities ". Further development of the Hi-GISA data with a longer time series could be potentially used to examine urban sprawl and its environmental impacts.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and Formal Lymphadenectomy for Soft Tissue Sarcoma: A Single Center Experience of 86 Consecutive Cases
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Lymph node metastases (LNMs) are rare in patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS), and there is limited evidence to guide clinical management. We describe our experience with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and lymphadenectomy in STS patients. Methods A single-center, retrospective review was performed for patients with STS treated with SLNB and/or lymphadenectomy from 1994 to 2018. Clinicopathologic characteristics, multimodality treatment, regional/distant recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) were examined. Results Eighty-six patients underwent SLNB (n = 34) and/or lymphadenectomy (n = 60) for STS. The most frequent histologic subtypes were epithelioid, clear cell, and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. Eight of 34 (23.5%) patients had a positive SLNB with 5-year OS of 71.4% compared with 71.9% for those with a negative SLNB. Eight of the 26 SLN-negative patients (30.8%) eventually developed nodal recurrence (n = 2) and/or (n = 6) distant metastasis with an estimated 5-year OS of 50%. Of patients undergoing lymphadenectomy, estimated 5-year OS was 44.6% and median RFS was 12 months. Eight (13.3%) had distant disease at time of lymphadenectomy, 20 (33.3%) developed distant recurrence after lymphadenectomy, and 6 (10%) developed regional-only recurrence. Patients with regional-only recurrence after lymphadenectomy had an estimated 5-year OS of 66.7% compared with 29.1% for those who recurred distantly. Conclusions Patients with positive SLNB had similar survival to those with negative SLNB. Lymphadenectomy for isolated nodal disease is associated with poor RFS but reasonable 5-year OS when recurrence is regional-only. In STS, regional disease appears clinically distinct from distant metastatic disease and has better outcomes.

TI  - A domain adaptation neural network for change detection with heterogeneous optical and SAR remote sensing images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Heterogeneous remote sensing source-based change detection with optical and SAR data and their combined alltime and all-weather observation capability provides a reliable and promising solution for a wide range of applications. State-of-the-art supervised methods typically take a two-stage strategy that suffers from the loss of original image features and the introduction of noise on the transferred images. This paper proposes a domain adaptation-based multi-source change detection network (DA-MSCDNet) suitable to process heterogeneous optical and SAR images. DA-MSCDNet employs feature-level transformation to align inconsistent deep feature spaces in heterogeneous data. Feature space transformation and change detection are bridged within the network to encourage task communication. Experiments are conducted on two public datasets based on Sentinel-1A and Landsat-8 imagery acquired over the Sacramento, Yuba, and Sutter Counties (California, USA), and QuickBird-2 and TerraSAR-X imagery over Gloucester (UK), as well as one new large-scale dataset of Sentinel-2 and COSMOSkyMed imagery over Wuhan (China). Compared with other six supervised and unsupervised approaches, the proposed method achieves the highest performance with an average precision of 80.81%, recall of 84.39%, mIOU of 73.67% and F1 score of 82.58%, beating the state-of-the-art method with 5.42% improvements on F1 score and 10 times efficiency on training time cost on the large-scale change detection task.

TI  - Spatio-temporal pattern of urban vegetation in the central business district of the Wa municipality of Ghana
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing physical infrastructure development influences the spatial distribution of vegetation and temperature in many cities around the globe. However, in emerging cities such as Wa Municipality in Ghana and elsewhere, research attention has focused on urban expansion or urban sprawl and the impacts thereof on the peri-urban vegetation. Considering the importance of vegetation in regulating temperature, reducing windstorm, carbon sequestration and creating beauty, this paper concentrates on the threat posed by urban retrofitting activities on vegetation in open spaces in the Wa Central Business District (CBD). The study area was gridded into 1 ha plots using the Fishnet tool in ArcMap. One hundred and fifty-seven full plots and 75 plots of various sizes less than 1 ha were obtained from the fishnet gridding. One hundred and thirteen full plots were sampled for the counting of the trees. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) maps were prepared from 2014, 2017 and 2020 Landsat 8 satellite images. Point NDVI and LST values were extracted for 600 random points and used to analyze the spatial distribution using Global and Local Moran I tests. Two-sample t-test and Pearson correlation statistical tests were performed to assess the significance of any differences in the NDVI, LST and the tree density for 2014, 2017 and 2020. The results revealed that the average tree densities for 2017 and 2020 in the Wa CBD were 4 and 3 trees ha(-1), respectively which were classified as very low. The spatial distribution of the NDVI values showed low, high and insignificant clusters. The NDVI values were within the range of 0.019-0.219. The clusters of high values were found around state institutional structures, where large open spaces existed while clusters of low values were found around the market, transport stations and densely populated areas where open spaces were very few. The land surface temperature trend revealed increasing minimum and maximum values. The minimum LST values were 32 degrees C, 33 degrees C and 36 degrees C in 2014, 2017 and 2020, respectively and the maximum LST values were 36 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 40 degrees C for 2014, 2017 and 2020, respectively. It is concluded that tree density and NDVI values in the CBD are low, signifying isolated trees and patches of vegetation in the area. Also, it was revealed that as greenness reduces LST increases. The Wa Municipal Assembly and the Regional Forestry Commission should intensify public education on tree planting and maintenance in the city.

TI  - Change detection of land cover/land use dynamics in arid region of Bahawalpur District, Pakistan
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is an established geospatial technique that provides a precise method of land use and land cover evaluation at a global, regional, or local scale. The current study aims to assess the land cover and land use change of an arid region in Southern Punjab of Pakistan, i.e., Bahawalpur District. Landsat data is more consistent and pragmatic in providing historical imageries of the earth's surface for conducting such studies for the last 50 years. Satellite data employed in current research includes Landsat 5 TM for historical years of 1987, 1998, and 2009 and Landsat 8 OLI for the t year of 2020. Maximum likelihood supervised classification and change detection techniques are applied to calculate area percent change, annual dynamic rate of change in specific time intervals. Remote sensing indices normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference bareness index are also employed techniques for change detection procedures in this study. Results show that agriculture area expanded at the rate of 2.3% and barren land reduced at dynamic rate of - 0.5% from 1987 to 2020. Linear regression analysis reveals a strong correlation coefficient R-2 of 0.99 between population growth rate and agriculture growth rate with 0.03 level of significance, 0.58 between agriculture growth rate and barren land reduction rate. Vegetation and bareness index-based change detection showed a 13.4% significant decline in bareness and 16.8% increase in vegetation mostly in southern side of the district towards lesser Cholistan. Linear regression between vegetation and bareness index also showed significant correlation R-2 of 0.83 in 1987 and 0.91 in 2020. Significant land use change in this arid region is deteriorating the natural environment and arid ecosystem of the study area. Study provides a good example for local stakeholders to identify the more vulnerable parts of land use change in the district for better and sustainable land use planning.

T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on our national outpatient sentinel surveillance, we have developed a novel approach to determine respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) epidemic seasons in Germany by using RSV positivity rate and its lower limit of 95% confidence interval. This method was evaluated retrospectively on nine RSV seasons, and it is also well-suited to describe off-season circulation of RSV in near real time as observed for seasons 2020/21 and 2021/22 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prospective application is of crucial importance to enable timely actions for health service delivery and prevention.

TI  - Sensitivity analysis of CN using SCS-CN approach, rain gauges and TRMM satellite data assessment into HEC-HMS hydrological model in the upper basin of Oum Er Rbia, Morocco
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological process modelling consistency is associated with long available gauged data and reliable parameters, which is often limited. Multi-sensors and satellite-based products are considered as an alternative, especially dealing with ungauged basins. In this study, a HEC-HMS hydrological model is used to test two rainfall dataset reliability (Gauges, TRMM product). The testing period is fixed for 2000-2011 to simulate streamflow generated at upper Oum Er Rbia basin. Dealing with soil information lack in the study, we implemented SCS-CN approach in its spatially semi distributed manner, adjusting CN, and comparing streamflow obtained by interpolated gauged and average TRMM pixels values, the model was calibrated to determine its accurate CN for the study area. In the calibration phase, the analysis of CN sensitivity shows its importance on direct flow simulation and for HEC-HMS results. Moreover, the optimal value for the study area is ranging between 30 and 40. In addition, the elaborated model is showing slightly sufficient performance when using TRMM precipitation data at a daily time scale even though its overestimations during intense precipitation events. As a conclusion, the model validation results show an instability estimation for simulated daily streamflow at the upper Oum Er Rbia basin.

TI  - Effectiveness of autocidal gravid trapping and chemical control in altering abundance and age structure of <i>Aedes albopictus</i>
T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Aedes albopictus is a nuisance pest mosquito of public health importance commonly managed with adulticides and larvicides. We investigated whether adding Gravid Aedes Traps (GATs), Autocidal Gravid Ovitraps (AGOs) or In2Care traps would extend the effectiveness of chemical control methods in Wake County, North Carolina, USA, by combining barrier sprays and larval habitat management (LHM) with each trap type at suburban households. We compared these three treatment groups to untreated controls and to backyards treated only with barrier sprays and LHM. Once a week, for ten weeks, we collected adult mosquitoes at each house using lure-baited surveillance traps and dissected a portion of Ae. albopictus females to determine parity. Results Barrier sprays and LHM alone or combined with any supplemental autocidal ovitrap significantly reduced female Ae. albopictus through Week 3 post-treatment. GATs significantly extended chemical control effectiveness for the duration of the study. Compared to the untreated control, the AGO and GAT treatment groups had significant overall female Ae. albopictus reductions of 74% and 80.4%, respectively, with populations aging significantly slower at houses treated with AGOs. Conclusion This household-level study, though limited in size, observed significant reductions in nuisance Ae. albopictus when combining AGOs and GATs with chemical controls for an eight-week period. Delayed population aging in AGO-treated yards suggests that traps also could mitigate disease transmission risk. Future studies should test these control methods at the neighborhood level to evaluate large-scale effectiveness as well as assess the effect of autocidal ovitraps without chemical intervention.

TI  - A Stage in Rio De Janeiro? Ho Chi Minh's Maritime Journeying and Latin America Networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY ASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of Ho Chi Minh in Rio de Janeiro at the end of one of his early seafaring journeys is taken as an article of faith by a spectrum of opinion in Brazil today. But what is the source material that lends credence to such a view? As this article exposes, the legend originally emerged in 1968 with the publication of two pieces of writing linked with a reported encounter between Ho Chi Minh and two Communist Party of Brazil leaders in Moscow in 1924. In that year, Ho Chi Minh published a French-language typescript titled "Solidarite de Classe," relating to a violent class action in Rio de Janeiro port. Looking deeper into this obscure text - never since reprinted - the present article appraises the possibility of a Ho Chi Minh visit to Latin America as well as pointing to the deeper importance of his maritime networking, here taken as another instance of praxis in the further awakening of his socialist internationalist worldview and future direction.

TI  - Impact on Breast Cancer Survival by Surgical Facility Type Secondary to the ACOSOG Z0011 Trial
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Studies have reported differences between age, socioeconomic status, treatment facility, and tumor burden based on survival outcomes for breast cancer (BC). The goal of this study is to evaluate BC survival and mortality outcomes by facility type. To examine likely influence of evidence-based practices, these groups were then sub stratified by pre- and post-Z0011 trial. Methods This is a population-based study using the National Cancer Database of Commission on Cancer (CoC) designated centers. Intergroup comparisons of demographics were performed using chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox Hazard Ratios were used to evaluate survival differences. Multivariable regression methods were used to evaluate risk-adjusted 30- and 90-day mortality among BC patients. A difference-in-difference (DiD) analysis was used to evaluate the change of treatment over time pre- and post-Z0011 trial. Results Median survival was highest among comprehensive community facilities at 63.2 months and integrated community facilities at 62.7 months, while the lowest for community and academic facilities at 60.6 months and 61 months. Academic facilities had the lowest 30- and 90-day mortality. Community centers saw the largest improvement in overall mortality post-Z0011 trial. The benefit after the Z0011 trial was evident among community centers at the 90-day mortality period as their decrease in mortality (-1.7%) was significantly lower than the decrease of mortality among academic centers (-1.3%), P-value = .01. Conclusion While the Z0011 trial had a positive influence in both community and academic facilities, community programs benefited the most. Z0011 trial showed the most change in practice for the community centers.

TI  - A novel deep learning method for marine oil spill detection from satellite synthetic aperture radar imagery
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spill discharges from operational maritime activities like ships, oil rigs and other structures, leaking pipelines, as well as natural hydrocarbon seepage pose serious threats to marine ecosystems and fisheries. Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a unique microwave instrument for marine oil spill monitoring, as it is not dependent on weather or sunlight conditions. Existing SAR oil spill detection approaches are limited by algorithm complexity, imbalanced data sets, uncertainties in selecting optimal features, and relatively slow detection speed. To overcome these restrictions, a fast and effective SAR oil spill detection method is presented, based a novel deep learning model, named the Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN). This approach is capable of achieving fast end-to-end oil spill detection with reasonable accuracy. A large data set consisting of 15,774 labeled oil spill samples derived from 1786C-band Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 vertical polarization SAR images is used to train, validate and test the Faster R-CNN model. Our experimental results show that the proposed method exhibits good performance for detection of oil spills with wide swath SAR imagery. The Precision and Recall metrics are 89.23% and 89.14%, respectively. The average Precision is 92.56%. The effects of environmental conditions and sensor parameters on oil spill detection are analyzed. The expected detection results are obtained when wind speeds and incidence angles are between 3 m/s and 10 m/s, and 21 degrees and 45 degrees, respectively. Furthermore, the computer runtime for oil spill detection is less than 0.05 s for each full SAR image, using a workstation with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU. This suggests that the present approach has potential for applications that require fast oil spill detection from spaceborne SAR images.

TI  - Investigation on the role of aerosols on precipitation enhancement over Kerala during August 2018
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies based on satellite data and model analysis have shown that the dust over Arabian Sea correlates positively with the Indian summer monsoon. During August 2018, over a period of a few days from August 13, the state of Kerala experienced anomalous rainfall, which was followed by heavy floods. In the present study, the meteorological factors and the aerosol conditions during this event are investigated. MERRA 2 reanalysis data suggests that the dust loading over the Arabian Sea during the month of August, during which the anomalous event of rainfall took place, is the highest in the last decade. Using CALIPSO aerosol vertical profiles, OMI Absorbing Aerosol Index and the HYSPLIT back trajectory analysis, higher altitude dust transport from the arid gulf region towards the Arabian sea and near to Kerala coast is confirmed during the heavy precipitation days and even prior to that. Changes in cloud properties like Cloud Fraction (CF), Cloud Top Temperature (CTT), Cloud Water Liquid Water Path (CWLWP) and Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) with AOD variations during the period clearly indicate that there is a close relation between the aerosols and the cloud properties over the region. Observed CWLWP in the study on August 14 and 15, 2018 was 80% higher than the monthly average value. CCN concentration was increased by 23 percent during the severe rainy days of August when the CTT was about 16 K lower than the monthly mean value. Dust aerosols at altitudes of 2-4 km and further higher at 10-15 km, along with the deep convective clouds, point to the possibility of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interaction under conducive meteorological conditions. INSAT- 3D temperature profiles show an interesting enhancement of temperature (~1 K) at altitudes ~ 3 km, where elevated dust layers are noticed. This elevated heating could pave the way for moisture convergence and it is further confirmed from the INSAT derived Relative Humidity profiles. Investigation of vertical winds shows strong updrafts over the region during the period of heavy precipitation, indicative of the coexistence of moisture and CCN at higher altitudes. The study infers that the moisture built up over the region was excessive, enough to overwhelm the commonly observed semi direct effect caused by aerosols, and in contradiction, the aerosols amplify the cloud cover and precipitation over the Kerala region during the period of study. Thus the heavy dust loading over the South Eastern Arabian Sea region, near the west coast of Kerala, together with the conducive meteorological conditions and orography of the region led to intensified precipitation over Kerala during the mid of August 2018.

TI  - Development of melanoma clinical quality indicators for the Australian melanoma clinical outcomes registry (MelCOR): A modified Delphi study
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Clinical quality registries aim to identify significant variations in care and provide anonymised feedback to institutions to improve patient outcomes. Thirty-six Australian organisations with an interest in melanoma, raised funds through three consecutive Melanoma Marches, organised by Melanoma Institute Australia, to create a national Melanoma Clinical Outcomes Registry (MelCOR). This study aimed to formally develop valid clinical quality indicators for the diagnosis and early management of cutaneous melanoma as an important step in creating the registry. Methods Potential clinical quality indicators were identified by examining the literature, including Australian and international melanoma guidelines, and by consulting with key melanoma and registry opinion leaders. A modified two-round Delphi survey method was used, with participants invited from relevant health professions routinely managing melanoma as well as relevant consumer organisations. Results Nineteen participants completed at least one round of the Delphi process. 12 of 13 proposed clinical quality indictors met the validity criteria. The clinical quality indicators included acceptable biopsy method, appropriate excision margins, standardised pathology reporting, indications for sentinel lymph node biopsy, and involvement of multidisciplinary care and referrals. Conclusion This study provides a multi-stakeholder consensus for important clinical quality indicators that define optimal practice that will now be used in the Australian Melanoma Clinical Outcomes Registry (MelCOR).

TI  - Spatiotemporal Investigation of Soil Salinity Using Geospatial Techniques: A Case Study of Tehsil Toba Tek Singh
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity, being a major land degradation process in arid and semiarid regions, is spreading globally at a rate of two million hectares per year. Remote sensing data are widely used for detection and mapping of saline areas, hence was the objective of this study. Soil samples were collected from the field and analyzed in laboratory to check the salinity status. Results were interpolated and a salinity map of 2011 was developed. A satellite image of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper of this area was classified, and a land cover map was developed containing different classes. Saline areas mapped from remote sensing (58.118 square kilometers (km(2)) and field data (highly saline 61 km(2)) were compared, which showed 65% similarity between these two methods. The same was applied on Landsat Images of 1992 and 2000 to calculate the change in the saline area over this time. The results showed an increasing trend (from 43.743 km(2) in 1992 to 58.118 km(2) in 2011) in saline area. A water table map of this area was generated from water table data and correlation (R-2) between soil salinity and water table depth was calculated, which was fairly negative (R-2 = 0.7273 and R-2 = 0.6436) in moderately and highly saline categories based on electrical conductivity levels. It was concluded that remote sensing data are helpful only for detection and mapping highly saline areas (having salts on surface) and less suitable to detect where there is even slight vegetation cover.

TI  - Establishing an integrated workflow identifying and linking surface and subsurface lineaments for mineral exploration under cover: example from the Gawler Craton, South Australia
T2  - SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineral exploration in areas comprising thick and complex cover represents an intrinsic challenge. Cost- and time-efficient methods that help to narrow down exploration areas are therefore of particular interest to the Australian mining industry and for mineral exploration worldwide. Based on a case study around the Tarcoola gold mine in the regolith-dominated South Australian central Gawler Craton, we suggest an exploration targeting workflow based on the joint analysis of surface and subsurface lineaments. The datasets utilised in this study are a digital elevation model and radiometric data that represent surface signals and total magnetic intensity and gravity attributed to subsurface signals. We compare automatically and manually mapped lineament sets derived from remotely sensed data. In order to establish an integrated concept for exploration through cover based on the best-suited lineament data, we will point out the most striking differences between the automatically and manually detected lineaments and compare the datasets that represent surficial in contrast to subsurface structures. We further show how lineaments derived from surface and subsurface datasets can be combined to obtain targeting maps that help to narrow down areas for mineral exploration. We propose that target areas are represented by high lineament densities which are adjacent to regions comprising high density of lineament intersections.

TI  - Classifying surface fuel types based on forest stand photographs and satellite time series using deep learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing threat of wildfires globally, improving the availability of accurate, spatially explicit fuel type information is critical for fire behavior predictions that can support management decisions to mitigate fire hazards. Since mapping surface fuel types using airborne or spaceborne sensors relies on ground truth data from laborious field assessments, here we propose a novel proximate sensing-based approach for classifying surface fuel types from in-forest RGB photographs using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We test different configurations of deep learning models that integrate photographs of the forest stand and the forest floor as well as time series of multispectral satellite data from Sentinel-2 using long short-term memory (LSTM), and compare their performance in classifying understory and litter fuel types of Central European forests. We also investigate how ensemble approaches based on majority voting can help to improve classification results. We found that understory fuel types were classified with highest accuracy after cross-validation (0.78) using a combination of horizontal stand photos and forest floor photos. This accuracy was further improved by post-classification decision fusion of model predictions on multiple photographs of a forest stand and by considering the model's confidence in its predictions (0.85). Litter fuel type classification based on forest photographs resulted in lower overall accuracy (0.60), but using model ensemble predictions on both photographs and Sentinel-2 time series significantly improved the results (0.72). We found that the accuracy of our models was mostly limited by naturally smooth transitions between the defined fuel type classes and the co-occurrence of multiple fuel types in a photograph. This study shows that deep learning methods can provide an efficient means to assess fuel types from GNSS-located photos of forest stands as a basis for generating and validating fuel type and finally fire risk maps. The necessary data can be readily collected by forest managers or citizen scientists.

TI  - Lymph node ratio predicts efficacy of postoperative radiation therapy in nonmetastatic Merkel cell carcinoma: A population-based analysis
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background After radical resection of a nonmetastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (M0 MCC), postoperative radiation therapy (RT) is recommended as it improves survival. However, the role of RT in specific subgroups of M0 MCC is unclear. We sought to identify whether there is a differential survival benefit from RT in specific M0 MCC patient subgroups. Methods M0 MCC patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database registry were collected. The best prognostic age, tumor size, and lymph node ratio (LNR, ratio between positive lymph nodes and resected lymph nodes) cutoffs were calculated. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Results A total of 5644 M0 MCC patients (median age 77 years, 62% male) were included: 4022 (71%) node-negative (N0) and 1551 (28%) node-positive (N+). Overall, 2682 patients (48%) received RT. Age > 76.5 years, tumor size >13.5 mm, and LNR >0.215 were associated with worse OS. RT was associated with longer OS in the M0 MCC, N0, and N+ group and independently associated with a 25%, 27%, and 26% reduction in the risk for death, respectively. RT benefit on survival was increased in tumor size >13.5 mm in the N0 group and LNR >0.215 in the N+ group. No OS benefit from RT was observed in T4 tumors (N0 and N+ groups). Conclusions RT was associated with improved survival in M0 MCC, irrespective of the nodal status. LNR >0.215 is a useful prognostic factor for clinical decision-making and for stratification and interpretation of clinical trials.

TI  - Safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the oligomer modulator anle138b with exposure levels sufficient for therapeutic efficacy in a murine Parkinson model: A randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled phase 1a trial
T2  - EBIOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Synucleinopathies such as Parkinson s disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) are characterized by deposition of misfolded and aggregated alpha-synuclein. Small aggregates (oligomers) of alpha-synuclein have been shown to be the most relevant neurotoxic species and are targeted by anle138b, an orally bioavailable small molecule compound which shows strong disease-modifying effects in animal models of synucleinopathies.Methods Anle138b was studied in a single-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in healthy subjects. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1 for sentinel subjects and 1:5 for main group) to placebo or anle138b (dose range 50 mg to 300 mg per day), respectively. In addition, the effect of food on the pharmakokinetics of anle138b in healthy subjects was exam-ined in doses of 150 mg per day. Participants were randomized to treatment sequence (fed -> fasted) or (fasted -> fed). Treatment was administered orally in hard gelatine capsules containing either 10 mg or 30 mg of anle138b or excipient only. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, the secondary endpoint was pharmakokinetics. Data from all randomized individuals were evaluated. Clinicaltrials.gov-identifier: NCT04208152. EudraCT-number: 2019-004218-33.Findings Between December 17(th), 2019 and June 27(th), 2020 196 healthy volunteers were screened and 68 participants were enrolled. Of these, all completed the study per protocol. There were no major protocol deviations. Adverse events in this healthy volunteer trial were mostly mild and all fully recovered or resolved prior to discharge. From baseline to completion of the trial no medically significant individual changes were observed in any system organ class. Already at multiple doses of 200 mg, exposure levels above the fully effective exposure in the MI2 mouse Parkinson model were observed.Interpretation The favourable safety and PK profile of anle138b in doses resulting in exposures above the fully effective plasma level in a mouse Parkinson model warrant further clinical trials in patients with synucleinopathies.

TI  - Declining land for subsistence and small-scale farming in South Africa: A case study of Thulamela local municipality
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Thulamela Local Municipality, South Africa, competing land use activities such as urbanisation and subsistence farming have accelerated rapid, widespread changes in land use and land cover (LULC) with potential negative impacts on subsistence and small-scale farming, food security, and sustainable rural livelihoods. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate the decline in land available for subsistence and smallscale farming in the Thulamela Local Municipality. A post-classification comparison approach was performed using three Landsat images from 2005, 2013 and 2020 in order to quantify the spatio-temporal dynamics of LULC in the study area. The land use management system and applicable land use policies were examined to gain an understanding of the factors driving LULC. The results showed a general decline in agricultural land with a general increase in built-up areas. Land under Agricultural Fallow shrank from 26% to 8% with a 69% decline in extent while the extent of Grass reduced from 22% to 16%. The study has shown that the decline in agricultural land and its conversion to built-up areas can be attributed to ineffective land use management system, which is less protective of land for subsistence and small-scale farming in rural areas characterised customary land tenure rights. The land use scheme's generalisation of vacant and unsurveyed land as agricultural use zone makes it difficult to oppose development on productive agricultural land currently used for subsistence and small-scale farming in rural areas. Therefore, the study recommends that suitable agricultural land or land currently used for subsistence and small-scale farming should be clearly categorised as arable use zone from municipal land use schemes in order to ensure sustainable utilisation and protection of arable land for agricultural purposes. Measures should also be taken to secure tenure rights for subsistence farmers in order to curb the widespread conversion of agricultural land into built-up areas.

TI  - Techniques and Ideas. Zigzag Motif, Barbed Line, and Shaded Band in the Meso-Neolithic Bone Assemblage at Zamostje 2, Volga-Oka Region (Russia)
T2  - OPEN ARCHAEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesolithic geometric ornamentation is a part of the complex worldview of the latest hunter-gatherer societies. Questions about the functional role of the ornament in utilitarian objects - knives, daggers, arrowheads, etc. - do not have an unambiguous answer. Despite a variability of ornamental motives used, there are some stable connections between certain types of ornaments with some categories of bone tools. On the materials of the Late and Final Mesolithic layers of the wetland site Zamostje 2 (Volga-Oka region), we will consider some examples with the zigzag motif, the most numerous and heterogeneous type of ornament, as well as rarely presented motives of "ladders" and "lines with dots or eyelashes." The number of samples (120) is sufficient to draw some preliminary conclusions about the context of their application. So, the zigzag is observed on different types of tools, but its connection with sharp-piercing objects is most clearly manifested. The type of relief zigzag is inextricably related to slotted sickle-shaped tools. Zigzag is often the only decorative element on an item and is expressed by a simple or double line; less often it is included in complex compositions. Both types of zigzags and methods of application (fine engraving, scraping, relief carving, etc.) were not regulated and obviously performed different functions depending on the compositional characteristics and the raw material's type. Compositions of "ladders" located at an angle to each other are also associated with projectile weapons. Lines "with eyelashes" appear to have been a part of the standard dagger decoration.

TI  - Regional fire occurrence in Southern Africa using BFAST iterative break detection in seasonal and trend components of a MODIS time series
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is an integral part of southern African savannas, but despite being well-studied, complex relationships among fire, humans, climate and ecological systems remain poorly understood across much of the region. Analyses that provide information on fire trends in diverse regional contexts are essential for informing fire management and monitoring change. Harmonic seasonal patterns, linear time-series trends and breakpoints in fire occurrence (BFAST) were analysed for 2001-2018 in Botswana using remotely sensed fire occurrence measurements. Regional classification schemes were organized by human land-use, annual precipitation zones and vegetation communities. At the regional scale, mean annual precipitation, land-use and vegetation type influenced fire occurrence magnitude. Seasonality and variability were most clearly organized according to mean annual precipitation. Variability in seasonal and long-term fire trends were observed across the different classification schemes apart from mean annual precipitation zones above 600 mm. The methodology used effectively identified key differences in fire variability across regional classification schemes. However, the spatial resolution and classification scheme may be less effective for human land use and small fires. Overall, MODIS fire data analysed with BFAST is a promising and accessible method for analysing regional savanna fire regimes.

TI  - Retrospective cohort study of laparoscopic ICG-Guided Lymphadenectomy in gastric cancer from a Western country center
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Indocyanine green (ICG) guided lymphadenectomy has been proposed has a technique to improve the lymphadenectomy of patients with gastric cancer. Nevertheless, experience with this procedure is scarce in Western countries. Methods A retrospective analytic study in a tertiary hospital in Spain was performed, comparing patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy with (ICG cohort) and without (historic cohort) ICG guided lymphadenectomy. Results Thirty four patients were included (17 in each group). Although the number of positive nodes was similar in both groups (0.0 in the ICG cohort vs. 2 in the historic cohort, p = 0.119), the number of lymph nodes removed was higher in the ICG cohort (42.0 vs 28.0, p = 0.040). In the ICG cohort, more lymph nodes were positive for adenocarcinoma in the group of nodes that were positive for IGC (10.6% of the IGC + nodes vs. 1.9% in the ICG - nodes, p < 0.001). Conclusions ICG lymphadenectomy is a promising procedure that could improve the lymphadenectomy of patients with gastric cancer. ICG lymphadenectomy could be used to increase the number of lymph nodes removed in patients with a high-risk of nodal invasion or it could be used to reduce the surgical aggressiveness in fragile patients with a low-risk of nodal invasion.

TI  - Comparing the accuracy of two diagnostic methods for detection of light <i>Schistosoma haematobium</i> infection in an elimination setting in Wolaita Zone, South Western Ethiopia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reagent urinalysis dipstick and filtration have been recommended diagnostic methods for the detection of urogenital schistosomiasis. However, the accurate diagnosis of light infections using these methods presents a major challenge. This study evaluates the diagnosis accuracy of light infection with Schistosoma haematobium in study participants living in Wolaita Zone, an area targeted for sustainable control of Schistosomiasis, and ultimately interrupt transmission. Urine samples were collected from children and adults in surveys carried out during baseline and longitudinal sentinel site surveys conducted from 2018 to 2020. All urine samples were tested using a reagent urinalysis dipstick test (Haemastix) to detect microhaematuria with reference urine filtration technique as a proxy for S. haematobium infection. Sensitivity and specificity were determined in diagnosing urogenital schistosomiasis. Cohen's Kappa statistics was done for the agreement of these diagnostic methods. A total of 12,102 participants were enrolled in the current baseline study. Among them, 285 (2.35%) samples tested positive for microhaematuria and 21 (0.20%) positive for S. haematobium eggs. A total of 4,357 samples were examined in year 1 and year 2 using urine dipsticks, and urine filtration 172 (3.95%) and 2 (0.05%) were positive for microhaematuria and S. haematobium eggs. The reagent urinalysis dipsticks showed the highest sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing light intensity of infection,100% (95% CI:85.18-100.00) and 97.4% (95% CI: 97.10-97.60), respectively. There is a slight agreement between the two methods (Kappa = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.01-0.18). The present study revealed very low prevalence and light intensity of S. haematobium infections. The study also highlights that the dipstick test is considered a useful adjunct diagnostic tool for population-based control of urogenital schistosomiasis.

TI  - Preoperative Sonographic Prediction of Limited Axillary Disease in Patients with Primary Breast Cancer Meeting the Z0011 Criteria: an Alternative to Sentinel Node Biopsy?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To assess the accuracy of preoperative sonographic staging for prediction of limited axillary disease (LAD, one or two metastatic lymph nodes) and to identify factors associated with high prediction-pathology concordance in patients with early-stage breast cancer meeting the Z0011 criteria. Materials and Methods Patients treated between January 2015 and January 2020 were included in this retrospective, multicentric analysis of prospectively acquired service databases. The accuracy of LAD prediction was assessed separately for patients with one and two suspicious lymph nodes on preoperative sonography. Test validity outcomes for LAD prediction were calculated for both groups, and a multivariate model was used to identify factors associated with high accuracy of LAD prediction. Results Of 2059 enrolled patients, 1513 underwent sentinel node biopsy, 436 primary and 110 secondary axillary dissection. For LAD prediction in patients with one suspicious lymph node on preoperative ultrasound, sensitivity was 92% (95% CI 87-95%), negative predictive value (NPV) was 92% (95% CI 87-95%), and the false-negative rate (FNR) was 8% (95% CI 5-13%). For patients with two preoperatively suspicious nodes, the sensitivity, NPV, and FNR were 89% (95% CI 84-93%), 73% (62-83%), and 11% (95% CI 7-16%), respectively. On multivariate analysis, the number of suspicious lymph nodes was associated inversely with correct LAD prediction ([OR 0.01 (95% CI 0.01-0.93), p <= 0.01]. Conclusions Sonographic axillary staging in patients with one metastatic lymph node predicted by preoperative ultrasound showed high accuracy and a false-negative rate comparable to sentinel node biopsy for prediction of limited axillary disease.

TI  - The EORTC protocol for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) reveals a high number of nodal nevi and a strong association with nevus-associated melanoma
T2  - PATHOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The diagnosis of nodal nevi (NN) is challenging as they mimic melanoma metastases (MM), with a detection rate mostly ranging between 1% and 11% in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Herein, we assessed the incidence of NN and the association with the clinical-pathological features of primary melanoma, adopting the updated European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) protocol for SLNB. Methods: All cases of paired melanoma and SLNB were retrospectively evaluated (April 2019-May 2020). Appropriate statistical tests were adopted, with significant variables included in the logistic regression model. Results: 81 patients and a total of 186 lymph nodes (LNs) were included. Eleven patients had only NN and 4 had both NN and MM (18.5%); 29 LNs (15.6%) showed at least one NN and 12 (6.5%) showed more than one NN (a total amount of 43 NN was detected). All NN and none MM stained for p16. NN were associated with age < 60 years (p: 0.042), no ulceration (p: 0.025) and nevus-associated melanoma (NAM) (p: 0.018), with this latter being the only predictor at the logistic regression model (p: 0.022). Conclusions: The updated EORTC protocol shows a high number of NN and highlights a strong association with NAM.

TI  - A hyperspectral R based leaf area index estimator: model development and implementation using AVIRIS-NG
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral Remote Sensing (HRS) data is vital for crop growth monitoring due to availability of contiguous bands. This research work provides a new novel crop estimator model given the name "Crop Stage estimator" developed using the HRS data on an open-source R platform. The generic model structure provides an easy way to test and modify the importance of crop parameter namely Leaf Area Index to deduce crop growth stages of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) particularly during -heading, tillering and booting. Further, to know the LAI variations at different agriculture sites, the best model was implemented using the AVIRIS-NG (Airborne Visible Near-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation) hyperspectral datasets. The analysis indicates that during tillering stage the performance was found best during calibration (r = 0.66, RMSE =0.40, and Bias =-0.80) and validation (r = 0.98, RMSE =0.20, and Bias =0.12) in comparison to the ground measurements.

TI  - Forest disturbance detection in Garhwal Himalayas using MODIS NDVI time-series and BFAST model
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the BFAST model was used to decompose MODIS NDVI time-series and detect negative abrupt changes within trend during the study period (2005 to 2018). These negative abrupt changes were filtered and assigned as disturbances in the selected forest classes. The results showed that on average 15.01% of the forests were disturbed annually and 86.84% area was affected during the whole study period. The selected forests were affected the most in year 2008, 2011, and 2016. The model validation established a strong agreement between measured and estimated disturbance with 92.63% overall accuracy and kappa coefficient value of 0.86. The information about the time, extent, and impact of disturbances derived from remote sensing and GIS might be a critical tool for the degradation evaluation of forest ecosystem and also help in the development of forest management policies for sustainable development of the Himalayan region.

TI  - Predictive Ecological Land Classification From Multi-Decadal Satellite Imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological land classifications serve diverse purposes including sample stratification, inventory, impact assessment and environmental planning. While popular, data-driven classification approaches can require large training samples, frequently with limited robustness to rapid environmental change. We evaluate the potential to derive useful, durable ecological land classifications from a synthesis of multi-decadal satellite imagery and geospatial environmental data. Using random forests and multivariate regression trees, we analyze 1982-2000 Landsat Thematic Mapper (L45) and 2013-2020 Harmonized Landsat Sentinel (HLS) imagery to develop and then test the predictive skill of an ecological land classification for monitoring Mediterranean-climate oak woodlands at the recently established Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve (JLDP) near Point Conception, California. Image pixels were processed using spectral and temporal mixture models. Temporal mixture model residual scores were highly correlated with oak canopy cover trends between 2012 and 2020 (r(2) = 0.74, p << 0.001). The resulting topoclimatic-edaphic land classification effectively distinguished areas of systematically higher or lower oak dieback during 2012-2020 severe drought, with a fivefold difference in dieback rates between land classes. Our results highlight the largely untapped potential for developing predictive ecological land classifications from multi-decadal satellite imagery to guide scalable, ground-supported monitoring of rapid environmental change.

TI  - Solar array placement, electricity generation, and cropland displacement across California's Central Valley
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding agriculturally co-located solar photovoltaic (PV) installation capacity, practices, and preferences is imperative to foster a future where solar power and agriculture co-exist with limited impacts on food production. Crops and PV panels are often co-located as they have similar ideal conditions for maximum yield. The recent boom in solar photovoltaics is displacing a significant amount of cropland. The literature on agriculturally co-located PV array installations lacks important spatiotemporal details that could help inform future array installations and improve associated policies and incentive programs. This study used imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program for object-based analysis (within eCognition Developer), and from Landsat 5 TM, 7 ETM+ and 8 OLI for temporal analysis (using LandTrendr) to identify and characterize non-residential ground-mounted PV arrays in California's Central Valley installed between 2008 and 2018. This dataset includes over 210,000 individually identified panels grouped by mount and installation year into 1006 PV arrays (69% are agriculturally co-located). The most common type of mounting system is fixed-axis, and individual co-located systems tend to be small (0.34 MW). There were fewer single-axis tracking arrays, although the average capacity per system is nearly four times higher (1.20 MW). In total, the mapped arrays accounted for 3.6 GW of capacity and generated a cumulative of 32,700 GWh within the Central Valley during the study period. For the 694 identified agriculturally co-located arrays (2.1GW), significantly sub-optimal installation practices were observed in the spacing and spatial field placement of the arrays. In terms of crop conversion preferences, commodity crops (pastureland) dominated the total cumulative area converted although specialty crops (orchards) also contributed to a large number of solar installations on cropland. These results provide important details of current PV placement practices; understanding these can help to inform future practices and guide future regulations that might promote solar installations while preserving agricultural production.

TI  - Lessons for Remote Post-earthquake Reconnaissance from the 14 August 2021 Haiti Earthquake
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - On 14th August 2021, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck the Tiburon Peninsula in the Caribbean nation of Haiti, approximately 150 km west of the capital Port-au-Prince. Aftershocks up to moment magnitude 5.7 followed and over 1,000 landslides were triggered. These events led to over 2,000 fatalities, 15,000 injuries and more than 137,000 structural failures. The economic impact is of the order of US$1.6 billion. The on-going Covid pandemic and a complex political and security situation in Haiti meant that deploying earthquake engineers from the UK to assess structural damage and identify lessons for future building construction was impractical. Instead, the Earthquake Engineering Field Investigation Team (EEFIT) carried out a hybrid mission, modelled on the previous EEFIT Aegean Mission of 2020. The objectives were: to use open-source information, particularly remote sensing data such as InSAR and Optical/Multispectral imagery, to characterise the earthquake and associated hazards; to understand the observed strong ground motions and compare these to existing seismic codes; to undertake remote structural damage assessments, and to evaluate the applicability of the techniques used for future post-disaster assessments. Remote structural damage assessments were conducted in collaboration with the Structural Extreme Events Reconnaissance (StEER) team, who mobilised a group of local non-experts to rapidly record building damage. The EEFIT team undertook damage assessment for over 2,000 buildings comprising schools, hospitals, churches and housing to investigate the impact of the earthquake on building typologies in Haiti. This paper summarises the mission setup and findings, and discusses the benefits, and difficulties, encountered during this hybrid reconnaissance mission.

TI  - Dynamic detection of offshore wind turbines by spatial machine learning from spaceborne synthetic aperture radar imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to change the energy supply structure of traditional thermal power generation with excessive carbon emissions, more and more offshore wind turbines are being installed and put into operation worldwide. However, the dynamic monitoring of offshore wind turbines is still an emerging problem to be solved at a global scale. This paper proposes an effective approach for dynamic detection of offshore wind turbines by machine learning from spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 satellite data. First, the radar images are preprocessed to reduce the speckle noise and ocean wave clutter. Specifically, the time series radar data are cumulatively averaged according to the monthly interval to eliminate the influence of moving temporary objects such as ships; then, the speckle noise is suppressed using refined lee filter; the imagery affected by ocean wave clutters are also mitigated by using a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) technique. Next, representative data are carefully selected as the labeled training data set; and the random forest (RF) model is trained on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Validation demonstrates an overall accuracy of 99.99%, a producer accuracy of 100%, and an user accuracy of 94.12%. Then, mathematical morphology-based time series spatial data differentiation is proposed for monitoring the change of wind turbine. Finally, the dynamic change of the offshore wind farms in the Yellow Sea of China and the North Sea of Europe are monitored by using the proposed approach from 2015 to 2021. Cross-comparisons with ground truth data show an accuracy of 93.67% for dynamic detection of offshore wind turbines. From a large number of experimental results, it is shown that the proposed approach has the advantages of large scale monitoring and high precision, and can be used for global dynamic detection of offshore wind turbines.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Assessing degradation of lake wetlands in Bashang Plateau, China based on long-term time series Landsat images using wetland degradation index
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous monitoring of wetland dynamics and regional-scale assessment of wetland degradation are important to understand wetland ecosystem processes and to formulate restoration measures. The lake wetlands in Bashang Plateau play vital roles in providing essential resources and maintaining biodiversity in North China, while they were not fully investigated in previous studies. In addition, previous studies on wetland degradation assessment mostly relied on wetland area change every five or ten years. Continuous dynamics of wetlands was rarely considered. In this study, we developed a new wetland degradation index (WDI) to assess lake wetland degradation in Bashang Plateau based on time series Landsat imagery from 1985 to 2020 on Google Earth Engine platform. WDI integrates three indicators, namely lake shrinkage index (LSI), vegetation degradation index (VDI) and soil degradation index (SDI), which represents hydrodynamics of wetland inundation, vegetation, and soil conditions of wetlands, respectively. Different from previous research that utilized remotely sensed image to extract wetland every five or ten years, the LSI considers time-series continuous dynamics of lake water inundations and the transitions between water and non-water on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Our results showed that small lake wetlands with area less than 8 ha are dominant in Bashang Plateau. Both the number and the area of lake wetlands showed large interannual variations. The number (area) of lake wetlands reached 1715 (31,419 ha) in 1995-1996 and were only 493 (7,717 ha) in 2009-2010. The total area of the lake wetlands in 2019-2020 was only around 1/3 of that in 1995-1996. The LSI, VDI, SDI, as well as WDI demonstrate large spatial variations among the lake wetlands and within the lake wetlands. Wetlands in the western and central subregions experienced more severe degradation than those in the eastern subregion, and the edge of the wetlands normally showed more severe degradation. The resulted degradation grades are consistent with our field investigations. Among the 11 counties in Bashang Plateau, Zhangbei (ZB) county in the western subregion has the largest area with severe and very severe degradation grades. Degradation of lake wetlands was mainly associated with groundwater level declination which was induced by anthropogenic activities and economic development. The proposed WDI in this study can be widely applicable for regional-scale wetland degradation assessment using remote sensing techniques and thus further help decision making in lake wetland conservation and restoration.

TI  - Species-level tree crown maps improve predictions of tree recruit abundance in a tropical landscape
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting forest recovery at landscape scales will aid forest restoration efforts. The first step in successful forest recovery is tree recruitment. Forecasts of tree recruit abundance, derived from the landscape-scale distribution of seed sources (i.e., adult trees), could assist efforts to identify sites with high potential for natural regeneration. However, previous work revealed wide variation in the effect of seed sources on seedling abundance, from positive to no effect. We quantified the relationship between adult tree seed sources and tree recruits and predicted where natural recruitment would occur in a fragmented, tropical, agricultural landscape. We integrated species-specific tree crown maps generated from hyperspectral imagery and property ownership data with field data on the spatial distribution of tree recruits from five species. We then developed hierarchical Bayesian models to predict landscape-scale recruit abundance. Our models revealed that species-specific maps of tree crowns improved recruit abundance predictions. Conspecific crown area had a much stronger impact on recruitment abundance (8.00% increase in recruit abundance when conspecific tree density increases from zero to one tree; 95% credible interval (CI): 0.80% to 11.57%) than heterospecific crown area (0.03% increase with the addition of a single heterospecific tree, 95% CI: -0.60% to 0.68%). Individual property ownership was also an important predictor of recruit abundance: The best performing model had varying effects of conspecific and heterospecific crown area on recruit abundance, depending on individual property ownership. We demonstrate how novel remote sensing approaches and cadastral data can be used to generate high-resolution and landscape-level maps of tree recruit abundance. Spatial models parameterized with field, cadastral, and remote sensing data are poised to assist decision support for forest landscape restoration.

TI  - Non-breeding habitat selection of a sandy shore obligate shorebird
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporal partitioning of species' life history phases according to seasonal environmental variation is pervasive, yet most habitat selection studies have focused on breeding rather than non-breeding periods. Using remote-sensing data and previously collected information on occurrence, this study explores the habitat selection of a non-breeding, resident shorebird (the hooded plover Thinornis cucullatus) on southern hemisphere, high energy beaches exposed to the southern ocean (Victoria, Australia). While many beaches are used for breeding, non-breeding or both, some beaches are never used. These usage patterns may reflect site attributes, which could effectively define non-breeding habitat for the species. We identified and described differences in beachscapes between four distinct types of non-breeding habitat occupation: 1) flocking sites, 2) year-round territories, 3) breeding season only territories, and 4) sites on beaches not occupied by hooded plovers ("no bird" sites). Potentially important habitat variables (36) were measured using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and analysed using multinomial regression following variable selection (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator; LASSO). This enabled us to characterise the different site types. Flocking sites were characterised by having southerly aspects and were closer to the nearest breeding territory (hereafter 'nearest neighbour') than no bird sites, and year-round territories had closer nearest neighbours than no bird sites and typically were at southwest facing beaches. Breeding territories that were unoccupied during the non-breeding period had less available swash area, were further from nearest neighbours than year-round territories, and typically were southwest facing. No bird sites were further from nearest neighbours than occupied sites and typically were southeast facing. These differences are likely driven by social and ecological factors (i.e. foraging habitat and ecological productivity). This study has identified sites, beach types and habitat features that warrant priority protection from threats such as development, disturbance, marine pollution events and sea level rise.

TI  - Urban evapotranspiration estimation based on anthropogenic activities and modified Penman-Monteith model
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban evapotranspiration (ET) is an essential part of the hydrological cycle. A complete understanding of urban ET is necessary to understand the interaction between the atmosphere and the urban surface. However, estimating urban ET is challenging due to the influence of urban surface heterogeneity and human activities in urban areas. Therefore, this paper proposed an improved multisource parallel model (PM-urban) based on the Penman Monteith model, which is suitable for the ET estimation for the underlying surface of the city. The PM-urban model takes into account the violent human activities in the city, and its main characteristics are: (1) the anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) was included in the surface energy balance formula; (2) The building water dissipation was considered. In this paper, taking Shenzhen, one of the cities with the fastest urbanization process globally, as an example, seven urban ET maps of Shenzhen were generated using Landsat 8 images. The model was verified using pan evaporation data corrected by complementary relationships. The results showed that: (1) The ET of each land use type has the following relationship: water body > vegetation > bare soil > no building impervious surface, and the value of building water dissipation varies due to the height and type of buildings significant; (2) The PM-urban model that considers AHF is better than the original model that ignores AHF; (3) This model can describe the characteristics of urban ET well and explain the phenomenon of high water consumption in cities. Our research results provide a new perspective for calculating the urban ET, which can be applied to urban management, planning, and reducing the urban heat island effect.

TI  - Evaluation and drivers of global low-carbon economies based on satellite data
T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming is one of the largest challenges humankind is facing in this century, and how to achieve low-carbon economy has become one of the most attractive topics of global concern. However, evaluations of the low-carbon economy are insufficient due to limited methodologies and data availability. In this study, satellite data (i.e., night-time light data and net primary production) were employed to estimate the net economic output (neo), and ratio of neo to the GDP (reo), which can be used to assess the quantity and quality of worldwide low-carbon economies. Based on panel vector autoregression (pvar) analysis, we further discussed the drivers of neo and reo in global climate change mitigation towards a better low-carbon society. The results show that: (1) only France and the United Kingdom ranked within the top 10 in terms of the neo and reo in 2019, implying that they were successful in increasing both quantity and quality of low-carbon economic development; (2) the pvar analysis presented that the increase of reo granger-caused neo growth, and net primary production increment greatly helped raise the worldwide reo; (3) raising CO2 abatement policy stringency can play a major role in improving the quality of low carbon economy countries with poor quantity and quality, but it cannot significantly promote groups with high reo. Additionally, the results of this study also provided basic data, such as our calibrated global 1 x 1 km gridded night-time light data during 1992-2019 for research regarding low-carbon economy and other sustainable development issues.

TI  - Hepatitis C antibody testing among opioid agonist therapy recipients, Victoria, Australia, 2012 to 2020
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The high burden of hepatitis C among people who inject drugs in Australia underscores the need to increase testing within this population. Understanding hepatitis C screening uptake in primary care settings is therefore critical to the development of effective and targeted strategies to improve hepatitis C testing for people who inject drugs. Primary care services that prescribe OAT are well-positioned to provide hepatitis C testing among a priority population at-risk of hepatitis C. Methods: This study used linked data from 5,429 individuals attending ten clinical services participating in the Australian Collaboration for Coordinated Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance (ACCESS) who received their first recorded OAT prescription between 1 st January 2012 and 31 st December 2019. We estimated the proportion of OAT recipients who received a hepatitis C antibody test within 12 months of their first recorded OAT prescription, and the proportion of individuals tested who received a positive hepatitis C antibody test. Results: Approximately one in five individuals (17%) received a hepatitis C antibody test in the 12 months following their first recorded OAT prescription. Over half of individuals tested (56%) received a positive hepatitis C antibody test result. Hepatitis C antibody testing was higher among individuals who attended 5-8 (aOR:2.98; 95%CI:2.41-3.69) and 9 + (aOR:6.17; 95%CI:5.13-7.43) clinical consultations, were women (aOR:1.20; 95%CI:1.08-1.34) and whose first recorded OAT prescription occurred in 2017 vs. 2012 (aOR:1.39; 95%CI:1.06-1.84). Hepatitis C antibody testing was lower among individuals prescribed methadone (aOR:0.81; 95%CI:0.73-0.91), and individuals aged 60 + years vs. 18-29 years (aOR:0.67; 95%CI:0.48-0.94). Conclusion: Despite high positivity rates, hepatitis C antibody testing among individuals prescribed OAT remains low. There are opportunities for increased testing among populations exhibiting greater proportions of missed testing opportunities. Integrating routine hepatitis C screening in OAT settings will likely increase case-finding and contribute to Australia's hepatitis C elimination targets.

TI  - Pertussis surveillance results from a French general practitioner network, France, 2017 to 2020
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In France, three complementary surveillance networks involving hospitals and paediatrician practices currently allow pertussis surveillance among infants (<1 year old) and children (1-12 years old). Data on incidences among adolescents (13-17 years old) and adults (>= 18 years) are scarce. In 2017, a sentinel surveillance system called Sentinelles network, was implemented among general practitioners (GPs). Aim: The purpose of Sentinelles network is to assess pertussis incidence, monitor the cases' age distribution and evaluate the impact of the country's vaccination policy. We present the results from the first 4 years of this surveillance. Methods: GPs of the French Sentinelles network reported weekly numbers of epidemiologically or laboratory-confirmed cases and their characteristics. Results: A total of 132 cases were reported over 2017-2020. Estimated national incidence rates per 100,000 inhabitants were 17 (95% confidence interval (CI): 12-22) in 2017, 10 (95% CI: 6-14) in 2018, 15 (95% CI: 10-20) in 2019 and three (95% CI: 1-5) in 2020. The incidence rate was significantly lower in 2020 than in 2017-2019. Women were significantly more affected than men (83/132; 63% of women, p = 0.004); 66% (87/132) of cases were aged 15 years or over (median age: 31.5 years; range: 2 months-87 years). Among 37 vaccinated cases with data, 33 had received the recommended number of doses for their age. Conclusions: These results concur with incidences reported in other European countries, and with studies showing that the incidences of several respiratory diseases decreased in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results also suggest a shift of morbidity towards older age groups, and a rapid waning of immunity after vaccination, justifying to continue this surveillance.

TI  - Uncovering the Large-Scale Meteorology That Drives Continental, Shallow, Green Cumulus Through Supervised Classification
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major sources of uncertainty in climate prediction results from the limitations in representing shallow cumulus (Cu) in models. Recently, a class of continental shallow convective Cu was shown to share distinct morphological properties and to emerge globally mostly over forests and vegetated areas, thus named greenCu. Using machine-learning supervised classification, we identify greenCu fields over three regions, from the tropics to mid- and higher-latitudes, and establish a novel satellite-based data set called greenCuDb, consisting of 1 degrees x 1 degrees sized, high-resolution MODIS images. Using greenCuDb in conjunction with ERA5 reanalysis data, we create greenCu composites for different regions and reveal that greenCu are driven by similar large-scale meteorological conditions, regardless of their geographical locations throughout the world's continents. These conditions include distinct profiles of temperature, humidity and large-scale vertical velocity. The boundary layer is anomalously warm and moderately humid, and is accompanied by a strong large-scale subsidence in the free troposphere.

TI  - Time interval between diagnostic excision-biopsy of a primary melanoma and sentinel node biopsy: effects on the sentinel node positivity rate and survival outcomes
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The optimal time interval between diagnostic excision of a primary cutaneous melanoma and sentinel node (SN) biopsy is unknown. The current study sought to determine whether this interval influenced the SN-positivity rate, recurrence or survival. Methods: Data collected from 2004 to 2014 for a Dutch population-based cohort of patients with melanoma who underwent SN biopsy (SNB) within 100 days of initial diagnosis (n = 7660) and for a similarly specified cohort from a large Australian melanoma treatment centre (n = 3478) were analysed. Time to SNB was analysed continuously (in weeks) and cate-gorically (per month). The effects of SNB timing on SN-positivity were assessed using multi-variable logistic regression, and its effects on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression analyses. Advanced modelling using a multivariable Cox model with penalised splines for modelling the continuous effects of time to SNB on RFS and OS was also performed. Results: In neither the Dutch nor the Australian cohort was there a significant association between time to SNB and SN-positivity in either cohort, nor was there an impact of time to SNB on RFS or OS in either cohort. The spline-based HR curves for RFS and OS confirmed these findings. Conclusions: The time interval between diagnostic excision of a primary melanoma and SNB did not influence the SN-positivity rate or survival outcomes. This provides reassurance that neither early nor delayed definitive wide excision and SNB will adversely affect prognosis. 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Original Research Effect of the time interval between melanoma diagnosis and sentinel node biopsy on the size of metastatic tumour deposits in node-positive patients
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: This study sought to assess whether the interval between diagnostic excision-biopsy of a primary melanoma and definitive wide excision with sentinel node biopsy (SNB) influenced the size of SN metastatic deposits, which might have implications for man-agement and prognosis. Methods: Data were collected for (i) a Dutch population-based cohort of patients treated be-tween 2004 and 2014 who underwent SNB within 100 days of complete excision of their primary melanoma and who were SN-positive with known SN metastasis diameter (n Z 1027) and (ii) a cohort from a large Australian melanoma treatment centre (n = 541) who presented in the same time period. The effects of SNB timing on the size of SN metastatic deposits were analysed. Results: Dutch patients whose SNB was performed in the second or third months after diagnosis had significantly larger SN metastasis diameters than patients who had their SNB in the first month (median increases of 17% (95%CI-14, 60%, p = 0.211) and 71% (95% CI 15, 119%, p = 0.004), respectively). No significant difference in tumour diameter for early and late SNB was found in the Australian cohort. Conclusions: SN metastasis diameter became progressively greater with SN biopsy in the second and third months after primary melanoma diagnosis in the larger, population-based patient cohort. An increase in metastasis diameter was not observed in the smaller, institutional cohort, possibly due to detection of larger SN metastases by routine pre-operative ultrasound, with fine needle biopsy confirmation. These patients did not proceed to SNB and were therefore not included in the study. 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Reflectance spectra (1-5 μm) at low temperatures and different grain sizes of ammonium-bearing minerals relevant for icy bodies
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been proposed that ammonium-bearing minerals are present in a varying amount in icy planetary bodies. Their observation at the surface of large objects was related to the upwelling and cryovolcanism of ammoniated water from possible subsurface oceans forming ammonium-bearing minerals (NH4+) mixed with ice at the surface. We analyzed the temperature evolution of the near-infrared spectra of a selected number of anhydrous and hydrated ammonium-bearing minerals containing different anions and water content. Reflectance spectra were collected in the 1-4.8 mu m spectral range at cryogenic temperatures ranging from 293 K to similar to 65 K and the effect of sample's grain size between 32 and 150 mu m was also investigated at room temperature. Reflectance spectra of anhydrous samples show well-defined absorption bands in the 1-2.5 mu m range. The bands located at similar to 1.06, 1.3, 1.56, 2.02, and 2.2 mu m could be useful to discriminate these salts and their characteristics are examined in detail in this work. On the other hand, the reflectance spectra of water-rich samples show H2O fundamental absorption bands strongly overlapping the NH4+ bands, thus dominating the spectra from 1 to 2.8 mu m and fully saturating above 2.8 mu m. The position of the absorption bands changes with temperature and grain size, shifting to higher frequencies as temperature decreases. The low-temperature spectra also reveal a fine structure compared to the room temperature ones and display narrower and more defined absorption bands. Granulometry mainly affects the band depth and band area parameters. Moreover, mascagnite, salammoniac, ammonium phosphate, tschermigite, and ammonium nitrate are subjected to a reversible low-temperature phase transition, which is manifested in the spectra by a progressive growth and shift of the bands towards shorter wavelengths with an abrupt change in their depth. This new set of spectra at cryogenic temperatures can be directly compared with remote sensing data to detect the presence of ammonium-bearing minerals on the surface of icy bodies. Their identification can impact our knowledge of the internal composition and dynamics of these bodies as well as their potential habitability.

TI  - Site-specific scaling of remote sensing-based estimates of woody cover and aboveground biomass for mapping long-term tropical dry forest degradation status
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing-based approaches are important for evaluating ecosystem degradation and the efficient planning of ecosystem restoration efforts. However, the large majority of remote sensing-based degradation assessments are trend-based, implying that they can only detect degradation that occurred after medium or high-resolution satellite imagery became available. This makes them less suitable to map long-term degradation in ecosystems that have been under high human pressure since before. The main goal of this study was to develop a robust operational approach to map forest degradation status in heterogeneous landscapes with a long-standing degradation history to inform the planning of restoration interventions. We hereby use the tropical dry forests of Lambayeque, Peru, as a case study. Instead of using a trend-based assessment, we evaluated forest degradation status by comparing current woody cover (WC) and aboveground biomass (AGB) estimates obtained from remote sensing imagery with benchmark values consisting of the 95th percentile WC and AGB values inside environmentally homogenous land capability classes. Using boosted regression tree models and a combination of optical (Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel-1) data of different seasons, we mapped WC and AGB, using training data obtained through very high-resolution imagery and field measurements. Further, we aimed at assessing (i) whether the inclusion of Sentinel-1 data improves mapping accuracy in comparison to using only Sentinel-2 data, and (ii) whether the use of multi-seasonal data improves accuracy in comparison to single-season data. Models combining multi-seasonal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data resulted in the most accurate WC predictions (mean absolute error (MAE): 16%; MAE normalized by dividing by the inter-quartile range of training data: 26%) and AGB predictions (MAE: 28.6 t/ha; normalized MAE: 65%), but differences in predictive accuracy with single season models or models using only Sentinel-2 data were small. The most accurate models estimated an average WC of 41% and an average AGB of 23.4 t/ha. Average WC and AGB reduction due to degradation was 35% and 36%, respectively, indicating that these forests are highly degraded. The site-specific scaling of WC and AGB allows to efficiently estimate forest degradation status irrespective of the time when this degradation occurred, and to express degradation status against site-specific benchmarks. On the condition that there are still some areas that are sufficiently undegraded to be used as a benchmark, the approach can be used to prioritize forest restoration actions and inform targets for restoration in heterogeneous landscapes suffering the impacts of undocumented long-term degradation.

TI  - Signs of resilience in resprouting <i>Eucalyptus</i> forests, but areas of concern: I year of post-fire recovery from Australia's Black Summer of 2019-2020
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Early and ongoing monitoring of post-fire recovery dynamics is critical for understanding the ecological resilience of forests. The unprecedented scale of Australia's Black Summer of 2019-2020 poses a significant challenge for post-fire recovery monitoring. Remote sensing is the only practical way to undertake broad-scale analysis of post-fire recovery dynamics. We used Sentinel 2 satellite imagery to compare pre-fire and I -year post-fire Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR) values. A strong positive trend in the return of vegetation was indicated where post-fire values met or exceeded 80% of the pre-fire NBR value. Our assessment highlighted locations where early recovery responses were divergent from trends in the surrounding areas. Overall, there was a strong spectral recovery across the 2019-2020 south-east Australia fire extent, with more than 50% of the total burned area showing greater than 80% spectral recovery after I year. However, several areas where ecosystem resilience may be threatened were identified, including fire-sensitive ecosystems and severely drought-impacted regions. Our results demonstrated biogeographic variation in the effect of fire severity on post-fire spectral recovery, with little effect of severity on spectral recovery observed in the north-east, but much stronger effects in the south. Our study highlights further research for prioritisation as part of adaptive land management programs.

TI  - Can linguistic features extracted from geo-referenced tweets help building function classification in remote sensing?
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fusion of two or more different data sources is a widely accepted technique in remote sensing while becoming increasingly important due to the availability of big Earth Observation satellite data. As a complementary source of geo-information to satellite data, massive text messages from social media form a temporally quasi-seamless, spatially multi-perspective stream, but with unknown and diverse quality. Despite the uncontrolled quality: can linguistic features extracted from geo-referenced tweets support remote sensing tasks? This work presents a straightforward decision fusion framework for very high-resolution remote sensing images and Twitter text messages. We apply our proposed fusion framework to a land-use classification task - the building function classification task - in which we classify building functions like commercial or residential based on linguistic features derived from tweets and remote sensing images. Using building tags from OpenStreetMap (OSM), we labeled tweets and very high-resolution (VHR) images from Google Maps. We collected English tweets from San Francisco, New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C. and trained a stacked bi-directional LSTM neural network with these tweets. For the aerial images, we predicted building functions with state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures fine-tuned from ImageNet on the given task. After predicting each modality separately, we combined the prediction probabilities of both models building-wise at a decision level. We show that the proposed fusion framework can improve the classification results of the building type classification task. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use semantic contents of Twitter messages and fusing them with remote sensing images to classify building functions at a single building level.

TI  - Significant Objects: How Eudaimonic Narratives Enhance the Value of Featured Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
M3  - Article
AB  - Eudaimonic narratives, which past work identifies as stories featuring themes related to virtue and life's higher purpose, are increasingly prevalent in advertisements and marketing communications. The current research examines whether this type of narrative achieves advertiser-desired outcomes. If these outcomes are achieved, how? The results from five studies demonstrate that eudaimonic narratives enhance the value of, attitude toward, and purchase intentions for products featured in the story. This occurs because the product becomes a symbol for the meaningful theme communicated in the narrative. The effect of eudaimonic narratives on valuation is stronger when a product is central to the narrative plot and when consumers have experienced a threat to their worldview coherence; the effect disappears when people consider giving the focal product as a gift.

TI  - Automated soybean mapping based on canopy water content and chlorophyll content using Sentinel-2 images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely spatiotemporal distribution information of soybean is vital for sustainable agriculture development. However, it is challenging to establish a phenology-based automated crops mapping algorithm at large spatial domains by simply applying vegetation index temporal profile. This study developed a Phenologybased automatic Soybean mapping algorithm through combined Canopy water and Chlorophyll variations (PSCC). Three phenology-based indices were designed: the ratio of change magnitudes of vegetation index to water stress index during the late growth stage (T1), the mean concentration of chlorophyll during the whole growth period (T2), and the accumulated variations of chlorophyll before and after heading date (T3). Soybean was distinguished by lower T1 and T3 and higher T1 due to higher senescence water loss and chlorophyll content. The PSCC method was validated in Northeast China from 2017 to 2021 and in four states (Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio) of the United States (US) in 2020 using Sentinel-2 datasets. Soybean planting areas obtained by PSCC were consistent with the corresponding agricultural statistical area (R-2 > 0.83). The soybean maps were evaluated using 5702 reference data, and the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were 91.99% and 0.8338, respectively. The overall accuracy for soybean mapping was improved by 16.07% compared with using only canopy water variation. The result showed that our method could be applied to large spatial domains and multi-years without retraining. The soybean planting area in Northeast China expanded substantially 25,867 km(2) (by 89.10%) during the period 2015-2020 and decreased slightly 7,535 km(2) (by 13.73%) from 2020 to 2021. Soybean expansion occurred mainly in ever-planted regions. Northeast China contributed about 60% to the national soybean revitalization goal in 2020. This study provided information on the soybean spatiotemporal changes in Northeast China, which was significant for agricultural policymakers to formulate soybean production plans to achieve national soybean revitalization.

TI  - A novel custom optimized convolutional neural network for a satellite image by using forest fire detection
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main degradation occur in forest region is fire attack. Till now, million hectares of forest areas are burned out due to the environmental and human impact. This will severely cause a great harm to environment, wild animals and ours. To safeguard all those things, prediction is necessary for avoiding the fire allegation in advance. In this research work, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with optimized technique is designed within the layer to improve the accuracy level and reduce the error rate. This new approach is named as custom optimized CNN whereas the objective function of Antlion Optimization (ALO) is inserted inside parametric ReLU of CNN layer. The data source used in this research is Landsat satellite image with considering five different forest fire region for testing, training and validation. The experiment is processed to classify the data with custom optimized CNN which in terms it results the detection of different forest fire images. The obtained output accuracy of five different classes is compared with different other existing techniques like CNN, CNN with custom layer without optimization and MSVM to prove its efficiency.

TI  - An integrated framework to identify and map gullies in a Mediterranean region of Turkey
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This research introduces a scientific methodology to identify areas affected by gully erosion using Geographic Object Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) and Random Forest (RF) supervised machine learning. The GEOBIA and RF were applied in Besni district, which has a Mediterranean climate, of Adiyaman province in Turkey by including many factors in the model. Estimation Scale Parameter (ESPII) algorithm was used in the segmentation phase. The novelty of this study is the implementation of RF supervised classification algorithm to classify a large number of objects determined after the segmentation process, due to the large size of the study area. Therefore, open access data has been evaluated with high classification accuracy without the need for labor. Precision, Recall and F1-Score values were calculated using true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) values based on field observations and Google Earth images of the study area. The TP, TN, FP and FN values were 0.90, 0.95 and 0.92, respectively. In addition, a Kappa-index was calculated as 0.88. The gully erosion map obtained using aforementioned methodology can be used to take necessary measures to prevent further degradation and plan sustainable land uses.

TI  - Volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> layer height by TROPOMI/S5P: evaluation against IASI/MetOp and CALIOP/CALIPSO observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic eruptions eject large amounts of ash and trace gases such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the atmosphere. A significant difficulty in mitigating the impact of volcanic SO(2 )clouds on air traffic safety is that these gas emissions can be rapidly transported over long distances. The use of space-borne instruments enables the global monitoring of volcanic SO2 emissions in an economical and risk-free manner. Within the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-5p+ Innovation project, the S5P SO2 layer height (S5P+I: SO2LH) activities led to the improvements of the retrieval algorithm and generation of the corresponding near real-time S5P SO2 LH products. These are currently operationally provided, in near real-time, by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) within the framework of the Innovative Products for Analyses of Atmospheric Composition (INPULS) project. The main aim of this paper is to present its extensive verification, accomplished within the S5P+I: SO2LH project, over major recent volcanic eruptions, against collocated space-borne measurements from the IASI/Me-top and CALIOP/CALIPSO instruments as well as assess its impact on the forecasts provided by the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS). The mean difference between S5P and IASI observations for the Raikoke 2019, the Nishinoshima 2020 and the La Soufriere-St Vincent 2021 eruptive periods is similar to 0.5 +/- 3 km, while for the Taal 2020 eruption, a larger difference was found, between 3 +/- 3 km and 4 +/- 3 km. The comparison of the daily mean SO2 LH further demonstrates the capabilities of this near real-time product, with slopes between 0.8 and 1 and correlation coefficients ranging between 0.6 and 0.8. Comparisons between the S5P SO2 LH and the CALIOP/CALIPSO ash plumes revealed an expected bias at -2.5 +/- 2 km, considering that the injected SO2 and ash plume locations do not always coincide over an eruption. Furthermore, the CAMS assimilation of the S5P SO2 LH product led to much improved model output against the non-assimilated IASI LH, with a mean difference of 1.5 +/- 2 km, compared to the original CAMS analysis, and improved the geographical spread of the Raikoke volcanic plume following the eruptive days.

TI  - The clinician's guide to prevention and treatment of osteoporosis
T2  - OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disease in the USA and the world. It is a subclinical condition until complicated by fracture(s). These fractures place an enormous medical and personal burden on individuals who suffer from them and take a significant economic toll. Any new fracture in an adult aged 50 years or older signifies imminent elevated risk for subsequent fractures, particularly in the year following the initial fracture. What a patient perceives as an unfortunate accident may be seen as a sentinel event indicative of bone fragility and increased future fracture risk even when the result of considerable trauma. Clinical or subclinical vertebral fractures, the most common type of osteoporotic fractures, are associated with a 5-fold increased risk for additional vertebral fractures and a 2- to 3-fold increased risk for fractures at other sites. Untreated osteoporosis can lead to a vicious cycle of recurrent fracture(s), often resulting in disability and premature death. In appropriate patients, treatment with effective antifracture medication prevents fractures and improves outcomes. Primary care providers and medical specialists are critical gatekeepers who can identify fractures and initiate proven osteoporosis interventions. Osteoporosis detection, diagnosis, and treatment should be routine practice in all adult healthcare settings. The Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation (BHOF) - formerly the National Osteoporosis Foundation - first published the Clinician's Guide in 1999 to provide accurate information on osteoporosis prevention and treatment. Since that time, significant improvements have been made in diagnostic technologies and treatments for osteoporosis. Despite these advances, a disturbing gap persists in patient care. At-risk patients are often not screened to establish fracture probability and not educated about fracture prevention. Most concerning, the majority of highest risk women and men who have a fracture(s) are not diagnosed and do not receive effective, FDA-approved therapies. Even those prescribed appropriate therapy are unlikely to take the medication as prescribed. The Clinician's Guide offers concise recommendations regarding prevention, risk assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men aged 50 years and older. It includes indications for bone densitometry as well as fracture risk thresholds for pharmacologic intervention. Current medications build bone and/or decrease bone breakdown and dramatically reduce incident fractures. All antifracture therapeutics treat but do not cure the disease. Skeletal deterioration resumes sooner or later when a medication is discontinued-sooner for nonbisphosphonates and later for bisphosphonates. Even if normal BMD is achieved, osteoporosis and elevated risk for fracture are still present. The diagnosis of osteoporosis persists even if subsequent DXA T-scores are above - 2.5. Ongoing monitoring and strategic interventions will be necessary if fractures are to be avoided. In addition to pharmacotherapy, adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, avoidance of smoking and excessive alcohol intake, weight-bearing and resistance-training exercise, and fall prevention are included in the fracture prevention armamentarium.Where possible, recommendations in this guide are based on evidence from RCTs; however, relevant published data and guidance from expert clinical experience provides the basis for recommendations in those areas where RCT evidence is currently deficient or not applicable to the many osteoporosis patients not considered for RCT participation due to age and morbidity.

TI  - Prediction of axillary lymph node metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer by multi-omics analysis and an integrated model
T2  - ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To avoid unnecessary postoperative complications, it is essential to select breast cancer patients without axillary lymph node (LN) metastasis who might be eligible for exemption from sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). However, the lymph node metastasis (LNM) of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is difficult to predict if only considering clinical parameters. Hence, by investigating the difference between LN positive and LN negative patients, we aimed to build a multi-omics model able to better predict LNM in TNBC. Methods: A total of 445 TNBC patients with lymph node status and multi-omics data were enrolled and divided into training and validation sets. We analyzed both clinicopathological characteristics and multiomics data to search for robust biomarkers, which were used to establish a multi-omics model. Results: Compared with LN negative patients, LN positive patients had an increasing number of mutational events, while the frequencies of both amplification and deletion in somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) were lower in LN positive cases. After analyzing upregulated gene-related pathways, neutrophil-related pathways were found to be enriched in LN positive patients. Based on these omics analyses, 5 predictors were utilized to build a multi-omics model, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.790 in the training set and 0.807 in the validation set, showing a better performance than models using individual omics data. Conclusions: After analyzing the largest TNBC multi-omics cohorts, we identified the potential clinical and molecular characteristics that are related to LNM. A multi-omics model was developed and performed robustly in predicting LNM, with the potential assistance of tailoring unnecessary axillary LN management among TNBC patients.

TI  - Planning control over rural land transformation in Hong Kong: A remote sensing analysis of spatio-temporal land use change patterns
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has led to the expansive conversion of farmland to non-agricultural human settlements. Over the past decades, the rural New Territories in Hong Kong have experienced significant land use changes where agricultural land has become sites for industrial operations (known as brownfields in Hong Kong). This includes open storage for industrial recyclables and warehouses for repairs, many being unauthorized development. The existence of these industrial activities initially driven by socio-economic factors has persisted, largely due to absent or loose land use regulations. The Hong Kong government thus has successively incorporated increasingly more rural areas into the city's zoning ordinance system, but seemingly has generated marginal impact on reducing non-conforming land uses. How has rural land use transformed in response to planning controls like zoning? How have the spatial patterns of different types of brownfields changed over periods with varying land use regulation focuses? Focusing on rural areas in Hong Kong, this study aimed to examine the temporal and spatial patterns of different operational types of brownfields based on refined land use classification results generated by a support vector machines tool with remote sensing data from 2000 to 2020. Furthermore, this study analyzed the impact of zoning regulations on land use activities in terms of the transition flow, spatial concentration level, morphological characteristics, and transition probability of various land use types. The results show that, despite regulatory control over rural land and strengthened enforcement measures, brownfields continue to grow in a decentralized and fragmented fashion. Our findings suggest that exercising police power through zoning has its limitations on curbing unauthorized development; additionally, the Hong Kong government may supplement enforcement measures with alternative planning tools such as land swaps and incentive zoning.

KEYNOTE-716 assessed pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy in patients with completely resected, high-risk, stage II melanoma. We report results from the planned first and second interim analyses for recurrence-free survival. Methods In this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 study, involving 160 academic medical centres and hospitals in 16 countries (Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA), patients aged 12 years or older with newly diagnosed, completely resected stage IIB or IIC melanoma (TNM stage T3b or T4 with a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy) were recruited. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1), in blocks of four and stratified by T-category (3b, 4a, and 4b) and paediatric status (age 12-17 years vs >= 18 years), using an interactive response technology system to intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg (2 mg/kg in paediatric patients) or placebo every 3 weeks for 17 cycles or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. All patients, clinical investigators, and analysts were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed recurrence-free survival (defined as time from randomisation to recurrence or death) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (ie, all patients randomly assigned to treatment). The primary endpoint was met if recurrence-free survival was significantly improved for pembrolizumab versus placebo at either the first interim analysis (after approximately 128 patients had events) or second interim analysis (after 179 patients had events) under multiplicity control. Safety was assessed in all patients randomly assigned to treatment who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03553836, and is closed to accrual. Findings Between Sept 23, 2018, and Nov 4, 2020, 1182 patients were screened, of whom 976 were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab (n=487) or placebo (n=489; ITT population). The median age was 61 years (IQR 52-69) and 387 (40%) patients were female and 589 (60%) were male. 874 (90%) of 976 patients were White and 799 (82%) were not Hispanic or Latino. 483 (99%) of 487 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 486 (99%) of 489 in the placebo group received assigned treatment. At the first interim analysis (data cutoff on Dec 4, 2020; median follow-up of 14middot4 months [IQR 10middot2-18middot7] in the pembrolizumab group and 14middot3 months [10middot1-18middot7] in the placebo group), 54 (11%) of 487 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 82 (17%) of 489 in the placebo group had a first recurrence of disease or died (hazard ratio [HR] 0middot65 [95% CI 0middot46-0middot92]; p=0middot0066). At the second interim analysis (data cutoff on June 21, 2021; median follow-up of 20middot9 months [16middot7-25middot3] in the pembrolizumab group and 20middot9 months [16middot6-25middot3] in the placebo group), 72 (15%) patients in the pembrolizumab group and 115 (24%) in the placebo group had a first recurrence or died (HR 0middot61 [95% CI 0middot45-0middot82]). Median recurrence-free survival was not reached in either group at either assessment timepoint.At the first interim analysis, grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 78 (16%) of 483 patients in the pembrolizumab groups versus 21 (4%) of 486 in the placebo group. At the first interim analysis, four patients died from an adverse event, all in the placebo group (one each due to pneumonia, COVID-19-related pneumonia, suicide, and recurrent cancer), and at the second interim analysis, one additional patient, who was in the pembrolizumab group, died from an adverse event (COVID-19-related pneumonia). No deaths due to study treatment occurred. Interpretation Pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy for up to approximately 1 year for stage IIB or IIC melanoma resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death versus placebo, with a manageable safety profile.

TI  - Predictive factors for false negatives following sentinel lymph node biopsy in early oral cavity cancer
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Prophylactic elective neck dissection (ND) with navigation surgery using radioisotope-based sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is non-inferior to elective ND in terms of survival but has an advantage in postoperative functional disability. We conducted a subgroup analysis to identify predictive factors for false-negative (FN)-SLNB in patients with early oral cavity cancer. This study is a supplementary analysis using the dataset of a previously reported randomized clinical trial on SLN navigation surgery for oral cancers. This study investigated the association of clinical and SLN-related factors with false-negative cases in the SLNB group. From 2011 to 2016, 275 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the ND and SLNB study groups, with 134 patients assigned to the SLNB group. In the SLNB group, seven cases with negative SLNs and neck recurrences were judged as FN-SLNBs according to the general definition. The number of detected SLNs with and without adjusting for the propensity score was significantly associated with FNs in the logistic analysis. FN-SLNB was associated with the number of identified SLNs, suggesting the need for careful postoperative monitoring for neck recurrence in patients with one or two identified SLNs after acquiring sufficient experience in the identification technique.

TI  - Vegetation activity enhanced in India during the COVID-19 lockdowns: evidence from satellite data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-COronaVIrus Diseases 2019 (SARS-COVID-19) has sternly affected the entire world in terms of human health, loss of lives, and huge economic losses. However, pandemic-triggered lockdown (LD) events (as a preventive measure) have compelled to stop or reduce major economic activities, exerting positive impacts on the terrestrial environment. We deployed a variety of satellite products (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and aerosol optical depth (AOD)) along with gridded climatic dataset (temperature (TEMP), precipitation (PREC), and net radiation (NR)) to quantify the changes in vegetation activity (greenness and productivity) during the LD period over the Indian biogeographic provinces (BGPs) as compared to the average conditions over the previous three years (2017-2019). The analysis of the NDVI and SIF data revealed that vegetation greenness and productivity significantly enhanced during LD periods (by up to 37 to 55%, respectively). The influence of climatic drivers (PREC, TEMP, and NR) on vegetation activity was also investigated. We found that the enhancement in the vegetation activity (over BGPs) during the LD period was not entirely driven by the climatic parameters, and was therefore inferred to be also influenced by the LD events. Moreover, vegetation activity around the mining clusters were largely improved during the LD period (by up to 78%) over the coal mining, followed by iron ore mining (up to 63%), and stone mining (up to 41%) clusters) regions. In a nutshell, it can be deliberated that COVID-triggered preventive measures (i.e., country-level LD, travel bans, industry ban, curtail in mining capacity, among others) likely enhanced vegetation health and productivity. Thereby, regulatory measures can be seen as a viable option for improving the terrestrial environmental conditions in the context of climate change in the near future.

TI  - Integrated SAR simulation to categorize the stressed and salt-tolerant crops using Sentinel-1 data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study investigated the potential of the proposed Salt Tolerance Vegetation Index (STVI) for Sentinel-1 data (5.35 GHz) in identifying salt-tolerant and stressed crops. The STVI was simulated by integrating the products i) imaginary part of the dielectric constant, ii) above-ground biomass, and iii) plant water content arrived from the SAR models, namely DSDM-SS (Density Space Dielectric Model for soil salinity), DPSVI (Dual Polarized SAR Vegetation Index), and WCM (Water Cloud Model), respectively. The STVI mapped the crops under the categories of stressed (0 - 0.5) and salt-tolerant (0.5 - 1). The results of the STVI was theoretically validated with the Vegetation Health Index (R-2 = 0.76, Bias = -0.007, RMSE = 0.118). Further, the STVI's in-situ applicability was assessed using the accuracy assessment method with the ground truth observations. The results have shown substantial agreement with the field conditions (OA = 79%, AUC = 0.79).

TI  - Small-Scale Irregularities Within Polarization Jet/SAID During Geomagnetic Activity
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We study the spatial structure of a polarization jet/Sub-Auroral Ion Drift (PJ/SAID) based on data from the NorSat-1 and Swarm satellites during a geomagnetic storm. Observations of plasma parameters inside the PJ/SAID are obtained with NorSat-1 using a system of Langmuir probes with a nominal sampling rate of up to 1 kHz, which allowed measurements with such a high temporal resolution for the first time. A comparative analysis of plasma parameters and electron density spectra inside PJ according to the data from both satellites is presented. Our results show that fluctuations of plasma parameters inside the PJ increase at all scales with increasing geomagnetic activity. Small-scale irregularities in the PJ are measured in situ down to hundreds of meters. The role of large-scale effects in the PJ increases in comparison with the small-scale ones during high geomagnetic activity. The PJ consists of structures similar to 0.2 degrees latitude in size within which small-scale irregularities are present.

TI  - Effects of land cover type conversion on water exchange and climate change in the source area of the Yellow River
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface radiation and energy flux in the source area of the Yellow River are estimated by using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer products from 2000 to 2019 and verified through the in situ observed data. The changes in land cover type and its effect on water exchange and climate are analyzed. Results show that the latent heat estimated by Priestley-Taylor formula in the energy limited area is close to the measured value, and the root mean square error is 17.8 W m(-2). From 2000 to 2019, the daytime land surface temperature (LST) in the source area of the Yellow River mainly shows a negative change trend and decreases significantly in some areas, about - 0.2 degrees C/a. The nighttime LST shows a positive change trend, and the trend is mainly concentrated at 0-0.15 degrees C/a. The trend of average land surface temperature calculated from daytime and nighttime LST is mainly concentrated between +/- 0.05 degrees C/a, with a weak warming trend. The LST difference between day and night decreases significantly, and the variation values are mainly concentrated in the range of 0-0.3 degrees C/a. The albedo in the study area mainly shows a positive trend, and the change value is mainly concentrated between - 0.002 and 0.00 4/a . The net radiation (Rn) decreases, and the sensible heat (Hs) and latent heat (LE) show a negative trend. The change in land cover type in the source area of the Yellow River mainly occurred in 2016 and 2017. The conversion between grasslands and barren accounts for 70% of the total conversion times. The conversion between grasslands and croplands accounts for 11%. The conversion between water body and barren accounts for 5.9%. The conversion between grasslands and water body accounts for 5.1%, and the other thirty conversions of land cover type account for 8% of the total conversion times. In the dominant land cover conversion type, the mutual conversion between grasslands and barren amplifies the reduction of daytime LST, decelerates the increase in average land surface temperature, and inhibits the water exchange between land and atmosphere because the cooling effect caused by the conversion from barren to grasslands is significantly stronger than the warming effect caused by the conversion from grasslands to barren. Grassland protection is still an important task of ecological protection in the source area of the Yellow River.

TI  - Automatic Identification of Slope Active Deformation Areas in the Zhouqu Region of China With DS-InSAR Results
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Zhouqu has narrow terrain and steep mountains on both sides of the Bailong River. It is one of the most serious landslide disaster areas in China due to the fracture development of rock and complex geological conditions. To identify the slope active deformation areas (SADAs) in the region accurately, the Distributed Scatter Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DS-InSAR) technique was used based on the process of the sentinel ascending and descending orbit data. Deformation results of the region from January 2019 to February 2021 were obtained. A new method for automatically identifying SADA while accounting for radar geometric distortion was established to quickly and efficiently identify SADA from the large-scale deformation results in the region. The SADA identified by this method can eliminate the region affected by geometric distortion. Based on the method, 62 SADAs including 12 in the upstream and 50 in the downstream of Zhouqu County were identified. Compared with 12 typical landslide areas in the study area, 9 typical landslides match with the detected SADA. The SADA is mainly concentrated in the section from the downstream of Zhouqu County to Lianghekou, and statistical analysis showed that the vegetation coverage and topographic slope angle are two main reasons for this difference. At the same time, the analysis of the typical landslide time-series deformation reveals that the slope deformation activity mainly takes place during the rainy season. It has high correlation with precipitation. These results of the study provided an important reference for geological disaster prevention in the Zhouqu region.

TI  - Analysis of 22-year Drought Characteristics in Heilongjiang Province Based on Temperature Vegetation Drought Index
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Heilongjiang Province is the main grain producing region in China and an important part of Northeast China Plain, which is one of the three black soil belts in the world. The cultivated region of black soil accounts for 50.6% of the black soil region in Northeast China. Due to the obvious rise of temperature and uneven distribution of precipitation in the 20th century, it has been considered to be one of the important reasons for agricultural drought and aridity. Under the background of climate change, understanding the multiyear changes and occurrence characteristics of cultivated land drought in different agricultural regions in Heilongjiang Province is of great significance for the establishment of agricultural drought prediction and early warning system in the future, guiding agricultural high-standard farmland irrigation in different regions, promoting black soil protection, and then improving grain yield. This paper calculates the temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI) based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface temperature (TS) product data of MODIS from 2000 to 2021. Taking TVDI as the drought evaluation index, this paper studies the temporal and spatial variation distribution characteristics and occurrence frequency of drought in the whole region and four agricultural regions of Heilongjiang Province: Daxing an Mountain and Xiaoxing an Mountain (region I), Sanjiang Plain (region II), Zhangguangcai Mountains (region III), and Songnen Plain (region IV). The results show that medium drought generally occurred in Heilongjiang Province from 2000 to 2021, accounting for about 70% of the total cultivated land. The drought was severe from 2000 to 2009 and weakened from 2010 to 2021. In the 110 months of the crop growing season from 2000 to 2021, about 63.84% of the region suffered more than 60 droughts. It is found that the frequency of drought varies from region to region. More than 80 droughts occurred in the west of region IV and the middle of region II. The characteristics of region IV are large sandstorm, less precipitation, and lack of water conservancy facilities, resulting in frequent and strong drought. It is also found that the occurrence frequency, degree grade and regional distribution of drought are closely related to seasonal changes. In spring, the occurrence grade and frequency of drought in region IV are the strongest and the drought phenomenon is serious. In autumn, drought is frequent and distributed in all regions, but the grade is not strong (mainly medium drought), and the drought phenomenon is medium. It is humid in summer. Crops in Heilongjiang Province are one crop per annual. Spring drought seriously restricts the water content of crops. Long-term drought will lead to poor crop development and reduce yield. Therefore, only by clarifying the characteristics of regional time drought, monitoring accurate drought events and accurately predicting the occurrence of drought, can we guide high-standard farmland precision irrigation, improve crop yield and ensure national food security. At the same time, severe drought will affect the terrestrial ecosystem, resulting in the distribution of crops and microorganisms, and the transformation between carbon sink and carbon source.

TI  - Integration of tillage indices and textural features of Sentinel-2A multispectral images for maize residue cover estimation
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, Sentinel-2A images were used to estimate maize residue cover (MRC) using tillage indices (TIs) and textural features. A MRC estimation model based on partial least squares regression (PLSR) was constructed using different features and methods (TIs method, textural feature method, and combination method). Results showed that the normalized difference tillage index (NDTI; r:0.854; R-2: 0.729) and the simple tillage index (STI;r:0.853; R-2: 0.728) had good linear relationships with MRC. Several models involving different combinations of TI and textural feature indicators were examined in regard to their accuracy. The best performing model (r:0.885; R-2: 0.783; and RMSE = 10.63%), a combination of seven TIs and eight textural feature indicators, was selected to estimate MRC in the Songnen Plain, Northeast China. Results showed that MRC ranged from 0.05% to 95% over the study area (mean: 47%) and was generally higher in the northern and southern areas than in the central portion of the Songen Plain. From these results, the distribution of conservation tillage practices across the region was determined. These results demonstrate the spatial distribution of MRC can be monitored in a systematic way using remote sensing technologies, and this information can help guide research and outreach efforts for the emergence of more sustainable agricultural production systems.

TI  - Pumice Raft Detection Using Machine-Learning on Multispectral Satellite Imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of Earth's volcanic eruptions occur underwater, and these submarine eruptions can significantly impact large-scale Earth systems (e.g., enhancing local primary production by phytoplankton). However, detecting submarine eruptions is challenging due to their remote locations, short eruption durations, lack of sea surface signature (if eruptions do not breach the surface), and the transient nature of the surface manifestations of an eruption (e.g., floating pumice clasts, hydrothermal fluids). We can utilize global satellite imagery of 10-30 m resolution (e.g., Landsat 8, Sentinel-2) to detect new eruptions; however, the large data volumes make it challenging to systematically analyze satellite imagery globally. In this study, we address these challenges by developing a new semi-automated analysis framework to detect submarine eruptions through supervised classification of satellite images on Google Earth Engine. We train our algorithm using images from rafts produced by the August 2019 eruption of Volcano F in the Tofua Arc and present a case study using our methodology on satellite imagery from the Rabaul caldera region in Papua New Guinea. We potentially find a large number of new unreported pumice rafts (in similar to 16% of images from 2017-present). After analysis of the spatial pattern of raft sightings and ancillary geophysical and visual observations, we interpret that these rafts are not the result of a new eruption. Instead, we posit that the observed rafts represent remobilization of pumice clasts from previous historical eruptions. This novel process of raft remobilization may be common at near-shore/partially submarine caldera systems (e.g., Rabaul, Krakatau) and may have significant implications for new submarine eruption detection and volcanic stratigraphy.

TI  - High-resolution map of sugarcane cultivation in Brazil using a phenology-based method
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane is the most important source of sugar, and its cultivation area has undergone rapid expansion, replacing other crops, pastures, and forests. Brazil is the world's largest sugarcane producer and contributed to approximately 38.6 % of the world's total production in 2019. Sugarcane in Brazil can be harvested from April to December in the south-central area and from September to April in the northeast area. The flexible phenology and harvest conditions of sugarcane in Brazil make it difficult to identify the harvest area at state to country scales. In this study, we developed a phenology-based method to identify the harvest area of sugarcane in Brazil by incorporating the multiple phenology conditions into a time-weighted dynamic time warping method (TWDTW). Then, we produced annual 30 m spatial resolution sugarcane harvest maps (2016-2019) for 14 states in Brazil (over 98 % of the harvest area) based on the proposed method using Landsat-7, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 optical data. The proposed method performed well in identifying sugarcane harvest area with limited training sample data. Validations for the 2018 harvest year displayed high accuracy, with the user's, producer's, and overall accuracies of 94.35 %, 87.04 %, and 91.47 % in Brazil, respectively. In addition, the identified harvest area of sugarcane exhibited good correlations with the agricultural statistical data provided by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) at the municipality, microregion, and mesoregion levels. The 30 m Brazil sugarcane harvest maps can be obtained at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14213909 (Zheng et al., 2021).

TI  - Automatic coastline extraction through enhanced sea-land segmentation by modifying Standard U-Net
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea-land segmentation (SLS) is an essential remote sensing task for various coastal and environmental studies such as coastline extraction, coastal erosion, coastal area monitoring, and ship or iceberg detection. This study aims at improving the SLS performance by modifying the Standard U-Net (SUN) model and developing an automatic coastline extraction framework. SUN generally has an acceptable performance in many applications. However, better SLS outputs are needed for reliable coastline extraction. In our proposed framework, we firstly analyzed three different input images, including Red-Green-Blue (RGB), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Near-Infrared (NIR) images. Secondly, we modified the SUN architecture to improve the segmentation results. The main modifications are using different loss functions and two fusion methods for RGB and NIR images. The segmentation results were then passed into the subsequent automatic coastline extraction pipeline based on morphological operations and pixel connectivity analysis. The training and testing steps were accomplished utilizing a benchmark dataset of China's coastal areas. Moreover, another dataset consisting of a time series of Landsat-8 imagery from the southern Caspian Sea coastlines was collected to evaluate coastline extraction efficiency. The results indicate that the proposed modifications could effectively enhance the performance of the SUN, with the most significant improvement to the Intersection over Union (IoU) score being as high as 1.68% and 8.95% in China and Caspian Sea datasets, respectively, while outperforming other state-ofthe-art models including FC-DenseNet and DeepLabV3+.

TI  - Agricultural drought monitoring in Sri Lanka using multisource satellite data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a complex phenomenon affecting agricultural, environmental, water resources, and socio-economic systems in developing regions. Climate change is going to increase the frequency and intensity of drought events and the associated socio-economic impact, including that on the food security among marginal smallholder farmers. For timely early action, it is important to have robust drought monitoring and warning in place to determine the timely drought situation to assist end-users for the decision-making process. Spatial temporal remote sensing data provides crucial information on near real-time drought monitoring and early warning. The present study developed a composite index, i.e., Integrated Drought Severity Index (IDSI) that combines inputs from rainfall, vegetation, and temperature to determine agricultural drought progression, intensity, and frequency for entire Sri Lanka between 2001 and 2019. The study has successfully identified 10 drought events of which 2001, 2012, 2017, and 2019 reported severe droughts across the two rainy seasons, namely Yala (May-August) and Maha (October-March). We analyzed various indices meteorological drought Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and field-based rice Crop Yield Anomaly Index (CYA). It is evident from the study that the Yala season reported more drought events compared to the Maha season due to changes in monsoon onset and duration and its seasonal variability. The correlation coefficient for SPI with IDSI is 0.70 and IDSI with CYA is 0.68, which explains the reliability of drought monitoring information across Sri Lanka. In terms of sub-national drought events, the North, North Central, North Eastern, Eastern, and South Eastern Provinces which cover the majority of the dry zone of Sri Lanka and districts such as Anuradhapura, Monaragala, Polonnaruwa, Hambantota, Trincomalee, and Ampara are highly prone to agricultural drought impacting agricultural production and the vulnerable rural population. From the basin analysis, both Yan Oya and Malwathu Oya (Aruri Aru) are reported to have severe drought events, which highlights the need for timely action using satellite-derived agricultural drought monitoring to mitigate drought risks and reduce food insecurity.

TI  - Assessing the structure of coastal forested wetland using field and remote sensing data
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal Swamp Oak Forest (CSOF), a supratidal wetland community dominated by Casuarina glauca, is a widely distributed coastal ecosystem along Australia's east coast. These wetland communities are highly valuable for providing ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration. Positioned within the supratidal zone of estuaries - and often abutting upper intertidal saltmarsh and/or mangrove - CSOF may be vulnerable to salinity intrusion and increased tidal inundation due to sea-level rise. To understand spatial patterns of vegetation composition and structure in CSOF, field-based (in-situ) and remote-sensing approaches were employed on the Minnamurra floodplain, New South Wales, Australia. In-situ vegetation surveys within 23 field plots located along seaward to landward transects revealed large variations in mean tree height (2.5-13.1 m) and tree densities (100-8700 trees/ha). Unmanned Aerial Vehicles with Structure from Motion (UAV-SfM), and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) approaches returned mean plot canopy height estimates ranging between 0.1 and 12.8 m. Comparison of vegetation metrics between remote sensors (UAV-SfM and LiDAR) demonstrated similar capacities (R-2 values > 0.85) to capture CSOF vegetation height. Comparison of field and spatial metrics elucidated a moderate correlation between the datasets for maximum canopy height (R-2 > 0.6) which can be partially explained by the different spatial scales of measurement among these approaches. Canopy height, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and point density (i.e., vegetation density) estimates were each positively correlated with elevation above mean sea-level. This coincides with indications of plant stress and/or mortality at the seaward edge of CSOF, and in topographic depressions. These findings suggest physico-chemical gradients exert a strong control on CSOF vegetation structure and health, with implications for the current acceleration of sea-level rise. When combined, remote sensing and field-based datasets are useful to characterise and quantify CSOF structure and distribution and can therefore be employed in future assessments of this understudied ecosystem.

TI  - Diurnally continuous dynamics of surface urban heat island intensities of local climate zones with spatiotemporally enhanced satellite-derived land surface temperatures
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Interpretation of diurnally continuous dynamics of surface urban heat island intensities (SUHIIs) of various local climate zones (LCZs) is essential for deepening the understanding of the urban climate. However, an easily applicable method for quantifying diurnally continuous dynamics of LCZ-based SUHIIs is still lacking, and the understanding of the diurnally continuous patterns of LCZ-based SUHIIs remains largely incomplete. To alleviate these gaps, here we developed a simple yet effective method for producing diurnally continuous land surface temperatures (LSTs) of various LCZ types based on an LCZ map and MODIS LSTs. With the proposed method, we further investigated the diurnally continuous dynamics of LCZ-based SUHIIs in Nanjing, China. We obtained the following findings: First, in terms of the annual mean, the diurnal SUHII patterns among various built LCZ types were similar and had a small valley within 0-2 h after sunrise and a peak within 8-12 h after sunrise. Second, the midrise/high-rise built and heavy industry types (i.e., LCZ 4, 5, and 10) exhibited relatively high SUHIIs during a diurnal cycle and the associated daily duration with a significant SUHII (>0.5 K) was greater than 20 h. Third, the diurnal SUHII patterns in summer were analogous to the annual mean patterns for all built LCZ types, yet the patterns of several built LCZ types in winter contrasted significantly the annual mean ones. Our findings are valuable for deepening the understanding of the diurnally continuous dynamics of LCZ-based SUHIIs.

TI  - Snow water equivalent change mapping from slope-correlated synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) phase variations
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Area-based measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) are important for understanding earth system processes such as glacier mass balance, winter hydrological storage in drainage basins, and ground thermal regimes. Remote sensing techniques are ideally suited for wide-scale area-based mapping with the most commonly used technique to measure SWE being passive microwave, which is limited to coarse spatial resolutions of 25 km or greater and to areas without significant topographic variation. Passive microwave also has a negative bias for large SWE. Another method is repeat-pass synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) that allows measurement of SWE change at much higher spatial resolution. However, it has not been widely adopted because (1) the phase unwrapping problem has not been robustly addressed, especially for interferograms with poor coherence, and (2) SWE change maps scaled directly from repeat-pass interferograms are not an absolute measurement but contain unknown offsets for each contiguous coherent area. We develop and test a novel method for repeatpass InSAR-based dry-snow SWE estimation that exploits the sensitivity of the dry-snow refraction-induced InSAR phase to topographic variations. The method robustly estimates absolute SWE change at spatial resolutions of < 1 km without the need for phase unwrapping. We derive a quantitative signal model for this new SWE change estimator and identify the relevant sources of bias. The method is demonstrated using both simulated SWE distributions and a 9-year RADARSAT-2 (C-band, 5.405 GHz) spotlight-mode dataset near Inuvik, Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. SWE results are compared to in situ snow survey measurements and estimates from ERA5 reanalysis. Our method performs well in high-relief areas, thus providing complementary coverage to passive-microwave-based SWE estimation. Further, our method has the advantage of requiring only a single wavelength band and thus can utilize existing spaceborne synthetic aperture radar systems.

TI  - Assessing Model Predictions of Carbon Dynamics in Global Drylands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drylands cover ca. 40% of the land surface and are hypothesised to play a major role in the global carbon cycle, controlling both long-term trends and interannual variation. These insights originate from land surface models (LSMs) that have not been extensively calibrated and evaluated for water-limited ecosystems. We need to learn more about dryland carbon dynamics, particularly as the transitory response and rapid turnover rates of semi-arid systems may limit their function as a carbon sink over multi-decadal scales. We quantified aboveground biomass carbon (AGC; inferred from SMOS L-band vegetation optical depth) and gross primary productivity (GPP; from PML-v2 inferred from MODIS observations) and tested their spatial and temporal correspondence with estimates from the TRENDY ensemble of LSMs. We found strong correspondence in GPP between LSMs and PML-v2 both in spatial patterns (Pearson's r = 0.9 for TRENDY-mean) and in inter-annual variability, but not in trends. Conversely, for AGC we found lesser correspondence in space (Pearson's r = 0.75 for TRENDY-mean, strong biases for individual models) and in the magnitude of inter-annual variability compared to satellite retrievals. These disagreements likely arise from limited representation of ecosystem responses to plant water availability, fire, and photodegradation that drive dryland carbon dynamics. We assessed inter-model agreement and drivers of long-term change in carbon stocks over centennial timescales. This analysis suggested that the simulated trend of increasing carbon stocks in drylands is in soils and primarily driven by increased productivity due to CO2 enrichment. However, there is limited empirical evidence of this 50-year sink in dryland soils. Our findings highlight important uncertainties in simulations of dryland ecosystems by current LSMs, suggesting a need for continued model refinements and for greater caution when interpreting LSM estimates with regards to current and future carbon dynamics in drylands and by extension the global carbon cycle.

TI  - On the combined use of phenological metrics derived from different PlanetScope vegetation indices for classifying savannas in Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of savannas in Brazil is challenging since there is no consensus on the best remote sensing strategy to deal with the spatial variability of some physiognomies and the spectral similarity of others. In this study, we evaluated the performance of 12 land surface phenology (LSP) metrics calculated from 70 cloud-free PlanetScope (PS) satellite images and three vegetation indices (VIs) for Random Forest (RF) classification of eight savanna physiognomies. The 12 LSP metrics were: the start (SOS), end (EOS), length (LOS), and mean (MGS) of greening season; the mean spring (MSP) and mean autumn (MAU); the VI peak (PEAK) and trough (TRG); the positions of the peak (POP) and trough (POT); and the rates of spring green-up (RSP) and autumn senescence (RAU). These metrics were calculated from the Green-Red Normalized Difference (GRND), Enhanced vegetation Index (EVI), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). At the protected Ecological Station of ' Aguas Emendadas (ESAE) in central Brazil, we compared the LSP classification in the 2017-2018 seasonal cycle against the VI classification in the 2017 dry season using an existent reference vegetation map for accuracy assessment. Furthermore, we analyzed the performance of the individual and combined sets of VIs and their derived LSP metrics for RF classification of the savanna physiognomies. The results showed that LSP added gains of 19.3% (EVI), 13.1% (NDVI), and 5.4% (GRND) to dry-season VI classification. The overall accuracies of the individual and combined sets of VIs and their retrieved LSP metrics generated gains of 22.8% and 28.1% in relation to the dryseason EVI. In the classification combining LSP metrics, the most important ranked predictors originated from the NDVI and EVI (e.g., TRG, PEAK, MSP, MGS, and RSP). Our findings highlight the importance of the combined use of high spatial and temporal resolution data of the Planet's satellite constellation for the classification of Brazilian savannas leveraging the information retrieved from vegetation phenology. However, when dense time series of a given sensor are not available for retrieving the phenological metrics, an alternative is to use combinedly different VIs calculated in the dry season, when the frequency of cloud cover is reduced over Brazilian savanna areas.

TI  - Toward accurate mapping of 30-m time-series global impervious surface area (GISA)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important indicator of urbanization, accurate and long-term global artificial impervious surface area (ISA) monitoring is vital to biodiversity, water quality assessment, urban heat island, etc. However, the existing several 30-m global ISA datasets exhibit large inconsistencies, due to their differences in training samples and mapping methods. In this context, we proposed a global ISA mapping method by considering the inconsistency of the existing products, based on which we further generated a new 30-m global ISA dataset (GISA 2.0). Specifically, we divided the mapping area into A-Grids and M-Grids in terms of their consistency degrees. An automatic mapping method was proposed for classifying the A-Grids, by extracting training samples from the consistent regions of existing datasets. In the case of M-Grids, where the existing ISA datasets showed large inconsistency, we proposed to add manually interpreted samples, to strengthen the classification in these areas. We randomly selected over 120,000 test samples from 207 global grids. The results showed that GISA 2.0 achieved a F1-score of 0.935, better than GISA 1.0 (0.893), GAIA (0.721) and GAUD (0.809). A further assessment based on 118,822 ZY-3 test samples indicated that the overall accuracy and F1-score of GISA 2.0 outperformed the existing ones. GISA 2.0 will be freely available at irsip.whu.edu.cn/resources/resources_en_v2.php.

TI  - Livability assessment of 101,630 communities in China's major cities: A remote sensing perspective
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Some of China's major cities have entered the middle and late stages of urbanization, and the development focus of these cities has gradually shifted from outward expansion to inward renewal. The community, as the basic unit of a city, is undoubtedly the main object of urban renewal. In order to efficiently and effectively address the problems in current community construction, it is necessary to conduct a large-scale in-depth assessment of the community livability, which can directly imply the satisfaction of residents with their quality of life. This study achieved the first comprehensive livability assessment at the individual community scale for 42 major cities of China from the perspective of remotely sensed and crowd-sourced geographic information. Specifically, we produced abundant fine-grained datasets for 42 cities, including high-resolution land cover maps interpreted from Ziyuan-3 satellites (ZY-3, 2.1 m), building height, point-of-interest, and boundaries of 101,630 communities. As designed in our proposed framework, the community livability was evaluated by 5 level-1 indicators, 27 level-2 indicators and an integrated community livability index (CLI). A number of interesting findings were obtained from this assessment: (1) According to the expert questionnaires, living comfort was considered as the most important livability factor for residents with the highest weight, while the building environment was rated the least. The negative factors (e.g., the factories around the community) impacted more on livability than the positive ones. (2) Most communities in major Chinese cities were characterized by dense buildings and sparse green spaces. (3) In these cities, community security construction was severely insufficient, particularly in less developed regions. (4) Imbalanced community livability development was prevalent across cities, and simultaneously, the CLI distribution within cities also exhibited significant spatial aggregation and heterogeneity. This research is expected to reveal the status quo of community livability in China, and thus allow for targeted policy formulation.

TI  - Global Daily Actual and Snow-Free Blue-Sky Land Surface Albedo Climatology From 20-Year MODIS Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo plays a critical role in climate, hydrological and biogeochemical modeling, and weather forecasting. It is often assigned in models and satellite retrievals by albedo climatology look-up tables using land cover type and other variables; however, there are considerable differences in albedo simulations among models, which partially result from uncertainty in obsolete albedo climatology. Therefore, this study introduces a new global 500 m daily blue-sky land surface albedo climatology data set under both actual and snow-free surface conditions utilizing 20-year Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer products from Google Earth Engine. In situ measurements from 38 long-term-maintained sites were utilized to validate the accuracies of different albedo climatology datasets. The root-mean-square error, bias, and correlation coefficient of the new climatology are 0.031, -0.003, and 0.96, respectively, which are more accurate than the Global Land Surface Satellite, GlobAlbedo, and 16 model datasets. Data intercomparison suggests that ERA5 exhibits better performance than Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA2) and 14 Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects Phase 6 models. However, it contains positive biases in the snow-free season, while MERRA2 underestimates the snow albedo. Global albedo variation associated with basic surface plant functional types was also characterized, and snow impact was considered separately. Temporal variability analysis indicates that traditional climatology datasets with coarser temporal resolutions (>= 8 days) cannot capture albedo variation over areas with distinct snow seasons, especially in central Eurasia and boreal regions. These results confirm the high reliability and robustness of the new albedo climatology in model assessment, data assimilation, and satellite product retrievals.

TI  - Residential Green Space and Cognitive Function in a Large Cohort of Middle-Aged Women
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Green space can decelerate cognitive decline by supporting physical activity, psychological restoration, or reducing exposure to air pollution. However, existing studies on the association of green space with cognitive decline are limited.OBJECTIVE To examine whether residential green space was associated with cognitive function in middle-aged women.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Starting in 1989, the Nurses' Health Study II enrolled 116 429 female nurses aged 25 to 42 years residing in the US. In 2014 to 2016, 40 082 women were invited to complete an online cognitive battery. This cohort study analyzed women who had data on both green space exposure and cognitive measures. Data analysis was conducted from June to October 2021.EXPOSURES Residential exposure to green space was assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, a satellite-derived indicator of the quantity of ground vegetation. Landsat satellite data at 270-m and 1230-m buffers around each participants' residential addresses in 2013 were used.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES In 2014 to 2016, cognitive function was measured using a self-administered online battery, the Cogstate Brief Battery, consisting of 4 tasks measuring psychomotor speed, attention, learning, and working memory; 3 composite scores, averaging together all tasks, psychomotor speed/attention, and learning/working memory, were created. In addition, the study evaluated potential mediators, including air pollution, depression, and physical activity.RESULTS The analytical sample included 13 594 women, of whom B 293 (98%) were White. Mean (SD) age was 61.2 (4.6) years. In models adjusted for age at assessment, race, childhood, adulthood, and neighborhood socioeconomic status, green space was associated with higher scores on the global Cogstate composite (mean difference per IQR in green space, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.07), and psychomotor speed/attention (mean difference in score, 0.05 standard units; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.08). This difference in scores is similar to the difference observed in women 1 year apart in age in the data. By contrast, there was no association between green space and learning/working memory (mean difference, 0.0300; 95% CI, -0.0003 to 0.0500).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that increasing residential green space may be associated with modest benefits in cognition in middle-aged women.

TI  - Satellite detection of snow avalanches using Sentinel-1 in a transitional snow climate
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow avalanches endanger lives and infrastructure in mountainous regions worldwide. Consistent and accurate datasets of avalanche events are critical for improving hazard forecasting and understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of avalanche activity. Remote sensing-based identification of avalanche debris allow for the acquisition of continuous and spatially consistent avalanches datasets. This study utilizes expert manual interpretations of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite backscatter images to identify avalanche debris and compares those detections against historical field records of observed avalanches in the transitional snow climates of Wyoming and Utah, USA. We explore and quantify the ability of an expert using Sentinel-1 (a SAR satellite) images to detect avalanche debris on a dataset comprised exclusively of dry slab avalanches. This research utilized four avalanche cycles with 258 field reported avalanches. Due to individual avalanches appearing in multiple overlapping Sentinel-1 images this resulted in 506 potential detections of avalanches in our SAR images, representing the possibility of multiple detections of a single avalanche event in different images. The overall probability of detection (POD) for avalanches large enough to destroy trees or bury a car (i.e., >= D3 on the destructive size scale) was 65%. There was a significant variance in the POD among the 13 individual SAR image pairs considered (15-86%). Additionally, this study investigated the connection between successful avalanche detections and SAR-specific, topographic, and avalanche type variables. The most correlated variables with higher detection rates were avalanche path lengths, destructive size of the avalanche, incidence angles for the incoming microwaves, average path slope angle, and elapsed time between the avalanche and a Sentinel-1 satellite image acquisition. This study provides a quantification of the controlling variables in the likelihood of detecting avalanches using Sentinel-1 backscatter temporal change detection techniques, as specifically applied to a transitional snow climate.

TI  - <i>phenofit</i>: An R package for extracting vegetation phenology from time series remote sensing
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived vegetation indices (VIs) provide a way to analyse vegetation phenology over decades globally. However, these data are often contaminated by different kinds of optical noise (e.g. cloud, cloud shadow, snow, aerosol), making accurate phenology extraction challenging. We present an open-source state-of-the-art R package called phenofit$$ phenofit $$ to extract vegetation phenological information from satellite-derived VIs. phenofit$$ phenofit $$ adopts state-of-the-art phenology extraction methods, such as a weight updating function for reducing optical noise contamination, a growing season division function for separating the VI time series into different vegetation cycles, and rough and fine fitting functions for reconstructing VI time series. They work together to make phenology extraction from frequently contaminated VIs easier and more accurate. Compared against other widely used phenology extraction tools, for example, TIMESAT$$ \mathrm{TIMESAT} $$ and phenopix$$ phenopix $$, phenofit$$ phenofit $$ provides flexible input and output options, a practical growing season division function, rich curve fitting and phenology extraction functions, and robust performance under different kinds of optical noise. In addition to working with VIs from mesoscale satellites (e.g. MODIS and AVHRR), phenofit$$ phenofit $$ can also reconstruct vegetation time series and extract phenology using other sources, such as VIs from high-resolution optical satellites (e.g. Sentinel-2 and Landsat) and radar satellites (e.g. Sentinel-1), vegetation greenness indices from digital cameras and gross primary production estimations from eddy-covariance sites. As such, phenofit$$ phenofit $$ can contribute to the study of ecological process dynamics and assist in effective modelling of global change impacts on vegetation, as caused by climate variability and human intervention. Code and data of case studies are available at (Kong, 2022a).

TI  - Remote sensing and machine learning based framework for the assessment of spatio-temporal water quality in the Middle Ganga Basin
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the dynamics of water quality in any water body is vital for the sustainability of our water resources. Thus, investigating spatio-temporal changes of dominant water quality parameters (WQPs) in any study is indeed critical for proposing the appropriate treatment for the water bodies. Traditionally, concentrations of WQPs have been measured through intensive fieldwork. Additionally, many studies have attempted to retrieve concentrations of WQPs from satellite images using regression-based methods. However, the relationship between WQPs and satellite data is complex to be modeled accurately by using simple regression-based methods. Our study attempts to develop a machine learning model for mapping the concentrations of dominant optical and non-optical WQPs such as electrical conductivity (EC), pH, temperature (Temp), total dissolved solids (TDS), silicon dioxide (SiO2), and dissolved oxygen (DO). In this context, a remote sensing framework based on the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regressor with optimized hyper parameters (HPs) to quantify concentrations of different WQPs from the Landsat-8 satellite imagery is developed. We evaluated six years of satellite data stretching spatially from upstream to downstream Ankinghat to Chopan (20 stations under Central Water Commission (CWC), Middle Ganga Basin) for characterizing the trends of dominant physico-chemical WQPs across the four clusters identified in our previous study. Through the developed XGBoost and MLP regression models between measured WQPs and the reflectance of the pixels corresponding to the sampling stations, a significant coefficient of determination (R-2) in the range of 0.88-0.98 for XGBoost and 0.72-0.97 for MLP were generated, with bands B1-B4 and their ratios more consistent. Indeed, these findings indicate that from a small number of in-situ measurements, we can develop reliable models to estimate the spatio-temporal variations of physico-chemical and biological WQPs. Therefore, models generated from Landsat-8 could facilitate the environmental, economic, and social management of any waterbody.

TI  - Glacial equilibrium line-based relationship for paleoclimate reconstructions (Sierra Nevada, USA)
T2  - QUATERNARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We use PRISM climatic data (1981-2010) and Landsat images (2012-2013) to establish an empirical relationship linking annual temperature and precipitation to the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of glaciers in the Sierra Nevada (36-41 degrees N, California, USA). For this, we determined the present-day ELAs of 57 glaciers and the local 0 degrees C isotherms elevation Iso(0), averaged over the 1981-2010 period. The difference, for each glacier, is Y, the normalized snowline altitude (Y = ELA - Iso(0)). We then empirically calibrated a logarithmic relationship between this normalized snowline altitude and mean annual precipitation using data from partially covered glaciers. Our calibration is statistically distinct from that previously established for the tropical and midlatitude Andes (Fox and Bloom [1994], Journal of Geography (Chigaku Zasshi), 103, 867-885; Condom et al. [2007], Global and Planetary Change, 59, 189-202). This new relationship for North America is an easy-to-use tool to permit paleoclimatic reconstructions from paleo-ELAs. For a specific paleoglacial site, paleotemperature can be computed knowing the paleoprecipitation range, and vice versa. We also performed a test showing that, if precipitation is well known, the uncertainty associated with paleotemperature is about 1 degrees C (1 sigma).

AB  - In shifting environments common to peace and conflict research, methodological grounding is rooted in the fluctuating roles undertaken by the researcher through time and space as one seeks a worldview that is experienced by research participants. This article introduces a side-by-side methodological approach, which developed through research of cross-community interaction amongst ice hockey supporters in Belfast. Influenced by qualitative research that sought to access local voices, this article moves from conceptual guidance and planning into the stands of the SSE Arena, where interviews were conducted with the person in the seat beside the researcher during ice hockey games. In doing so, this immersive methodology offers a contribution to unearthing unheard voices in this oft-studied region through the opportunity to make connection that was unscripted, aided by the informality of the research setting and the limited face-to-face interaction.

TI  - Automatic delineation of cracks with Sentinel-1 interferometry for monitoring ice shelf damage and calving
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the evolution of ice shelf damage such as crevasses and rifts is important for a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling the breakup of ice shelves and for improving predictions about iceberg calving and ice shelf disintegration. Nowadays, the previously existing observational gap has been reduced by the Copernicus Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mission that provides a continuous coverage of the Antarctic margins with a 6 or 12 d repeat period. The unprecedented coverage and temporal sampling enables, for the first time, a year-round systematic monitoring of ice shelf fracturing and iceberg calving, as well as the detection of precursor signs of calving events. In this paper, a novel method based on SAR interferometry is presented for an automatic detection and delineation of active cracks on ice shelves. Propagating cracks cause phase discontinuities that are extracted automatically by applying a Canny edge detection procedure to the spatial phase gradient derived from a SAR interferogram. The potential of the proposed method is demonstrated in the case of Brunt Ice Shelf, Antarctica, using a stack of 6 d repeat-pass Sentinel-1 interferograms acquired between September 2020 and March 2021. The full life cycle of the North Rift is monitored, including the rift detection, its propagation at rates varying between 0.25 and 1.30 km d(-1), and the final calving event that gave birth to the iceberg A74 on 26 February 2021. The automatically delineated cracks agree well with the North Rift location in Landsat 8 images and with the eventual location of the ice shelf edge after the iceberg broke off. The strain variations observed in the interferograms are attributed to a rigid-body rotation of the ice about the expanding tip of the North Rift in response to the rifting activity. The extent of the North Rift is captured by SAR interferometry well before it becomes visible in SAR backscatter images and a few days before it could be identified in optical images, hence highlighting the high sensitivity of SAR interferometry to small variations in the ice shelf strain pattern and its potential for detecting early signs of natural calving events, ice shelf fracturing and damage development.

TI  - Utility of a Model for Predicting the Risk of Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients With Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - JAMA DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE A neural network-based model (i31-GEP-SLNB) that uses clinicopathologic factors (thickness, mitoses, ulceration, patient age) plus molecular analysis (31-gene expression profiling) has become commercially available to guide selection for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in cutaneous melanoma, but its clinical utility is not well characterized.OBJECTIVE To determine if use of the i31-GEP-SLNB model is associated with clinical benefit when used to select patients for SLN biopsy.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This decision-analytic study used data derived from a published external validation study of the i31-GEP-SLNB prediction model. Participants included patients with primary cutaneous melanoma.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas the net benefit associated with using the i31-GEP-SLNB model for SLN biopsy selection compared with other selection strategies (SLN biopsy for all patients and SLN biopsy for no patients) at a 5% risk threshold. Analyses were stratified by American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) T category. The reduction in the number of avoidable SLN biopsies and relative utility were also calculated.RESULTS Compared with other SLN biopsy selection strategies, use of the i31-GEP-SLNB model had greater net benefit for patients with T1b (+0.012), T2a (+0.002), and T2b melanoma (+0.002) but not for those with high-risk T1a (-0.003) disease. The improvement in relative utility was +22% in patients with T1b, +1% in T2a, and +2% in T2b melanoma. Compared with SLN biopsy for all patients, use of the model would equate to a 23% decrease in SLN biopsies among patients with T1b disease without an SLN metastasis with no increase in the number of patients with an SLN metastasis left untreated; among patients with T2a and T2b melanoma, the net decrease in avoidable biopsies compared with SLN biopsy for all was 3% and 4%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this decision-analytic study suggest that i31-GEP SLNB has significant potential for risk-stratifying patients with T1b melanoma if using a 5% risk threshold; its role among patients with T1a and T2 melanoma or using other risk thresholds requires further study. A prospective validation study confirming the added clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of i31-GEP-SLNB compared with free clinicopathologic-based prediction models is needed in patients with T1b melanoma.

TI  - Monitoring urbanization and environmental impact in Kigali, Rwanda using Sentinel-2 MSI data and ecosystem service bundles
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization in developing countries often results in uncontrolled urban growth. In order to support sustainable urban development, reliable and up-to-date information on urban land cover changes and their environmental impact is needed. In this study, we aim at evaluating the potential of Sentinel-2 (S-2) Multi-spectral Instrument (MSI) data for urban land cover change monitoring and for analyzing resulting impacts on Ecosystem Services (ES) provision in Kigali, Rwanda. Land cover classification into eight distinct urban classes (84% overall accuracies, 0.8 Kappa) was performed on data from 2016 and 2021 using a hybrid approach combining Random Forest with a U-Net-based impervious surface segmentation that improved the delineation of urban areas. The bi-temporal land cover maps were then analyzed regarding landscape structure using Landscape Metrics (LM). Ecosystem service bundles were derived for both years and their changes were summarized. Service providing areas were further evaluated in terms of changes in spatial attributes and structure of patches. ES were aggregated into eight bundles and grouped into provisioning, regulating and supporting services. The bundles were further analyzed using a matrix spatially linking landscape units with service supply and demand budgets. The results illustrated that three urban development scenarios can be distinguished including infill through housing and infrastructures development in core urban areas, urban sprawl in fringe zones and the development of urban patches at distant locations intercepted by cropland. The results revealed that the changes in LM negatively affected ES supply mainly through a decrease in cropland and forest. The expansion of built-up areas resulted in a high demand for provisioning and regulating services, especially food and water provision, surface runoff mitigation and erosion control. This is the first study demonstrating that detailed monitoring of urbanization and resulting environmental impacts can be performed with open access S-2 MSI data in Sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, the framework developed in this study has the potential to be transferred to other Sub-Saharan cities.

TI  - Correlates of persistence in remnant populations of two Critically Endangered cockatoos
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A challenge with species that have disappeared from most of their range is to identify the correlates of local persistence. With species decimated by trade, site-specific trapping risk is hard to capture by remotely accessed predictors. The recently split yellow-crested cockatoo Cacatua sulphurea and citron-crested cockatoo C. citrinocristata have undergone catastrophic declines due to habitat loss and especially trapping, and are now extinct in much of their former range across Indonesia. Of 144 sites on 30 islands known to contain the species in 1950, only 76 on 27 islands did so in 2017-2019, with many of the other 68 experiencing extinctions between 1985 and 2000. We compared socio-ecological conditions such as forest cover and loss, human population density and infrastructure, and protected area status between the occupied and unoccupied sites, using 'random forests' within decreasing time intervals 1950-2015. Populations on Sulawesi and West Nusa Tenggara were more likely to become extinct than those on Sumba, Timor-Leste and small remote islands. Sites retaining cockatoos had high proportions of tree cover, low road density and low human densities. The relative importance of these factors changed little over time, but road density and human density became respectively more and less important in recent years. The examination of local conditions at 'false negative' sites (where cockatoos survived contrary to model predictions) showed that, particularly in recent years, cockatoo survival has been promoted by site-specific protection due to traditional beliefs, NGO activities, dedicated individual residents and local topographic barriers. Some of these local influences add complexity to the task of conserving cockatoo strongholds, but also offer exciting possibilities for low-cost conservation prescriptions tailored to individual sites. Studies combining field and remotely sensed data, and examining false negative sites for beneficial location-specific conditions, have broad application for the conservation of taxa with once-large ranges.

TI  - Determining the onset of autumn grass senescence in subtropical sour-veld grasslands using remote sensing proxies and the breakpoint approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on the onset of autumn grass senescence in subtropical grasslands is essential for ascertaining the duration of poor forage quality. It is well-established that during senescence, grass leaves lose their nutrients to the rooting systems; which affects the quality and quantity of forage resources. The timing of the onset of autumn grass senescence is critical in determining the potential lifespan through which the provision of quality forage can be sustained in a grazing area. However, objective and robust methods for estimating the onset of autumn grass senescence at a rangeland scale are limited. Hence, this study sought to characterize the onset of autumn senescence in mesic subtropical sour-veld grasslands using remotely sensed data. Ten monthly vegetation indices were generated from the Sentinel 2 data and used as proxies to explain the onset of autumn grass senescence. The performance of the proxies was validated using the corresponding field-measured monthly grass chlorophylls. Results showed that the Chlorophyll Red-Edge (CHL-RED-EDGE) and the Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDVI705) were the most important proxies for characterizing the autumn grass senescence. In addition, monthly (i.e., January to June) mean values of the two best proxies were fitted in a piecewise linear regression model with a breakpoint approach to determine the start of the autumn grass senescence. The first proxy (i.e., NDVI705) predicted that the grass in the study area starts senescing on day number +/- 98 of the year (R-2 = 0.97, RMSE = 0.024) while the second (i.e., CHL-RED-EDGE) suggested day number +/- 106 of the year (R-2 = 0.96, RMSE = 0.052). Overall, this study demonstrated the value of remote sensing proxies in estimating the autumn grass senescence and in determining its onset. These results provide a basis for understanding the impact of autumn senescence on foraging resource provision in rangeland ecosystems.

TI  - Decadal Variability of Satellite-Derived Air-Sea CO<sub>2</sub> Flux in Southwestern Part of the Bay of Bengal
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the relationship between atmospheric and oceanic carbon cycles necessitates measuring geographical and temporal variations of surface water partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)). The seasonal pCO(2) maps have been developed using MODIS-derived SST and chlorophyll for four different seasons to calculate air-sea flux of CO2 at basin scale. Summer in 2017 had the lowest pCO(2) value (263 mu atm), whereas monsoon season in 2016 had the highest (553 mu atm). From 2010 to 2019, atmospheric pCO(2) level fluctuated from 371 to 396 mu atm with progressive growth of atmospheric pCO(2) at 2.5 mu atm year(-1). The inter-annual CO2 flux ranged between - 3.58 and 3.64 mmol C m(-2) day(-1). Significant negative CO2 flux (- 3.58 mmol C m(-2) day(-1)) was observed in 2015 premonsoon, indicating that the Bay of Bengal was a net sink for atmospheric CO2, while served as a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere in 2013 monsoon season with a significant positive flux of CO2 (3.64 mmol C m(-2) day(-1)) to the atmosphere. The annual CO2 sink was active in 2015 (- 1.17 mmol C m(-2) day(-1)) which showed increased trend from 2014 to 2018 with a range of - 1.17 to - 0.26 mmol C m(-2) day(-1). The Bay of Bengal was found to be a substantial CO2 contributor to the atmosphere in 2013 (3.64 mmol C m(-2) day(-1)) and 2012 (3.27 mmol C m(-2) day(-1)). In this context, the southwest Bay of Bengal serves as a net sink of atmospheric pCO(2) during summer season on an annual scale, and a weak sink during postmonsoon and premonsoon seasons, while served as a strong source of CO2 to the atmosphere during monsoon season from 2010 to 2019 with super saturation of CO2.

TI  - An effective superpixel-based graph convolutional network for small waterbody extraction from remotely sensed imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Small waterbodies sustain susceptible ecosystems and are influenced by variable dynamics associated with human activities and environmental disturbances. Although remote sensing has displayed efficiency in mapping surface waterbodies on a regular basis, the identification of small waterbodies such as ponds or irrigation ditches remains a challenge, as small waterbodies are often confused with other low-reflectivity surfaces. In this study, a superpixel-based graph convolutional network (GCN) for small waterbody extraction (SG-waterNet) is proposed. Specifically, the SG-waterNet method includes a new object-based representation of an image called a superpixel graph. The superpixel graph contains compact spectral and contextual information and can be exploited by the GCN. A deep GCN architecture is used to efficiently preserve small waterbody features and detect surface waterbodies with high completeness and correctness. We tested the proposed approach on a frequently used open-access Gaofen Image Dataset (GID) and Gaofen-1 image from Hubei Province in China (a total of 11,660 km(2) for research). The extraction accuracy of SG-waterNet for small waterbodies (< 2 ha) was between 84.31% and 89.77% at the five evaluation sites, and the method extracted waterbodies 300 m2 and larger with high confidence. Compared with six state-of-the-art methods, SG-waterNet exhibited significant sensitivity to small waterbodies (especially smaller than 100 m(2)) and detected small waterbody boundaries with the highest completeness and correctness. The average accuracy improvement achieved with SG-waterNet at the evaluation sites ranged from 11.10% to 13.87%. The proposed method is a significant advancement in small waterbody monitoring and can provide promising and practical solutions for real-world applications.

T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is a fundamental physiological variable for research in the ecological, agricultural, and global change fields. In this study, we produced a 35-year (1984-2018) high-resolution (3 h, 10 km) global gridded PAR dataset using an effective physical-based model. The main inputs of the model were the latest International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) H-series cloud products, MERRA-2 aerosol data, ERA5 surface routine variables, and MODIS and CLARRA-2 albedo products. Our gridded PAR product was evaluated against surface observations measured at 7 experimental stations of the SURFace RADiation budget network (SURFRAD), 42 experimental stations of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), and 38 experimental stations of the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN). Instantaneous PAR was validated against SURFRAD and NEON data; mean bias errors (MBE) and root mean square errors (RMSE) were, on average 5.8 and 44.9 W m(-2), respectively, and the correlation coefficient (R) was 0.94 at the 10 km scale. When upscaled to 30 km, the errors were markedly reduced. Daily PAR was validated against SURFRAD, NEON, and CERN data, and the RMSEs were 13.2, 13.1, and 19.6 W m(-2,) respectively, at the 10 km scale. The RMSEs were slightly reduced when upscaled to 30 km. Compared with the well-known global satellite-based PAR product of the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), our PAR product was found to be a more accurate dataset with higher resolution. This new dataset is now available at https://doi.org/10.11888/RemoteSen.tpdc.271909 (Tang, 2021).

TI  - Accelerating advances in landscape connectivity modelling with the ConScape library
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasingly precise spatial data (e.g. high-resolution imagery from remote sensing) allow for improved representations of the landscape network for assessing the combined effects of habitat loss and connectivity declines on biodiversity. However, evaluating large landscape networks presents a major computational challenge both in terms of working memory and computation time. We present the ConScape (i.e. "connected landscapes") software library implemented in the high-performance open-source Julia language to compute metrics for connected habitat and movement flow on high-resolution landscapes. The combination of Julia's 'just-in-time' compiler, efficient algorithms and 'landmarks' to reduce the computational load allows ConScape to compute landscape ecological metrics-originally developed in metapopulation ecology (such as 'metapopulation capacity' and 'probability of connectivity')-for large landscapes. An additional major innovation in ConScape is the adoption of the randomized shortest paths framework to represent connectivity along the continuum from optimal to random movements, instead of only those extremes. We demonstrate ConScape's potential for using large datasets in sustainable land planning by modelling landscape connectivity based on remote-sensing data paired with GPS tracking of wild reindeer in Norway. To guide users, we discuss other applications, and provide a series of worked examples to showcase all ConScape's functionalities in Supplementary Material. Built by a team of ecologists, network scientists and software developers, ConScape is able to efficiently compute landscape metrics for high-resolution landscape representations to leverage the availability of large data for sustainable land use and biodiversity conservation. As a Julia implementation, ConScape combines computational efficiency with a transparent code base, which facilitates continued innovation through contributions from the rapidly growing community of landscape and connectivity modellers using Julia.

TI  - What Are Group Level Traits and How Do They Evolve?
T2  - INTEGRATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cultural traits are seldom atomic, are distributed over multiple social domains, and undergo differential selection. This makes it important to study the nature and evolution of these traits from a global viewpoint. This paper considers group level cultural traits-what sort of traits are there, how do they evolve, and what is the relationship between cultural traits and their representation in individual worldviews. While not providing a concise theory, important aspects of cultural traits are elaborated and directions of further research indicated. Group level traits arising from individual biological traits are distinguished from those that are intrinsic to a group. The latter are formative of individual worldviews and are emotionally salient for group members. Children are saturated with culture from birth, it provides the scaffolding for their developing worldviews. Affective links between cultural ideas, social behavior, and material elements of culture develop so that the affordances in perceived situations carry biases influencing behavior toward culturally acceptable responses. Intrinsic traits are not, however, acted on directly by group level selection; rather, this selection acts on the behavior of group members and only indirectly on intrinsic cultural ideas through social exchange processes between group members.

TI  - A recommender system-inspired cloud data filling scheme for satellite-based coastal land use classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Filling missing data in cloud-covered areas of satellite imaging is an important task to improve data quantity and quality for enhanced earth observation. Traditional cloud filling studies focused on continuous numerical data such as temperature and cyanobacterial concentration in the open ocean. Cloud data filling issues in coastal imaging have not been studied to the author's knowledge because of the complex landscape. Inspired by the success of data imputation methods in recommender systems that are designed for online shopping, the present study explored their application to satellite cloud data filling tasks. A numerical experiment was designed and conducted for a Landsat dataset with a range of synthetic cloud covers to examine the performance of different data filling schemes. The recommender system-inspired matrix factorization algorithm called Funk-SVD showed superior performance in computational accuracy and efficiency for the task of recovering landscape types in a complex coastal area than the traditional data filling scheme of DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) and the deep learning method of Datawig. Funk-SVD achieved the best filling accuracy and reached a speed comparable to DINEOF and much faster than deep learning. A theoretical framework was created to analyze the error propagation in DINEOF and found the algorithm needs to be modified to converge to the ground truth. The present study showed that Funk-SVD has great potential to enhance cloud data filling performance and connects the fields of recommender systems and cloud filling to promote the improvement and sharing of useful algorithms.

TI  - Live in same region, respond differently: Canine and human response to pollutants in placental accumulation
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Their presence in the environment is particularly concerning in cases of fetal exposure, which is the most vulnerable period of life for both human and animals who share the same environment. Placenta, as a sample collected using noninvasive methods to screen EDCs, is a good indicator for potential fetal exposure. Although recent studies indicate that companion animal may correspond to human exposure, species-specific anatomo-morphological and metabolic differences are controversial. In this study, placenta samples of 60 women and 25 dogs living and giving birth within the same region were evaluated for the presence of PCB, OCP, PBDE, and PAH residues; where, sociodemographic factors were also assessed to identify the possible sources. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method was validated for the matrix, and among 45 screened and targeted pollutants, only 18 were found in human placentas. While the most frequently detected pollutants were DDTs, followed by PAHs and PCBs in decreasing order, the pollutants with the highest concentrations were PAHs, followed by PCBs and DDTs. Only five of the target contaminants were detected in the dog placentas. These results indicate that; as dogs have different bioaccumulation capacities and higher excretion rates than humans, the life-long effects of exposure to endocrine compound and possible consequences related to adverse health outcomes are expected to vary and concentrations cannot be directly correlated.

TI  - First documentation of plastic ingestion in the arctic glaucous gull (<i>Larus hyperboreus</i>)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic wildlife is facing multiple stressors, including increasing plastic pollution. Seabirds are intrinsic to marine ecosystems, but most seabird populations are declining. We lack knowledge on plastic ingestion in many arctic seabird species, and there is an urgent need for more information to enable risk assessment and monitoring. Our study aimed to investigate the occurrence of plastics in glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus) breeding on Svalbard. The glaucous gull is a sentinel species for the health of the arctic marine ecosystem, but there have been no studies investigating plastic occurrence in this species since 1994. As a surface feeder and generalist living in an area with high human activity on Svalbard, we expected to find plastic in its stomach. We investigated for plastic >1 mm and documented plastic ingestion for the first time in glaucous gulls, with a frequency of occurrence of 14.3% (n = 21). The plastics were all identified as user plastics and consisted of polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS). Our study provides new quantitative and qualitative data on plastic burden and polymer type reported in a standardized manner establishing a reference point for future research and monitoring of arctic gulls on national and international levels.

TI  - Radar remote sensing-based inversion model of soil salt content at different depths under vegetation
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Excessive soil salt content (SSC) seriously affects the crop growth and economic benefits in the agricultural production area. Prior research mainly focused on estimating the salinity in the top bare soil rather than in deep soil that is vital to crop growth. For this end, an experiment was carried out in the Hetao Irrigation District, Inner Mongolia, China. In the experiment, the SSC at different depths under vegetation was measured, and the Sentinel-1 radar images were obtained synchronously. The radar backscattering coefficients (VV and VH) were combined to construct multiple indices, whose sensitivity was then analyzed using the best subset selection (BSS). Meanwhile, four most commonly used algorithms, partial least squares regression (PLSR), quantile regression (QR), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme learning machine (ELM), were utilized to construct estimation models of salinity at the depths of 0???10, 10???20, 0???20, 20???40, 0???40, 40???60 and 0???60 cm before and after BSS, respectively. The results showed: (a) radar remote sensing can be used to estimate the salinity in the root zone of vegetation (0-30 cm); (b) after BSS, the correlation coefficients and estimation accuracy of the four monitoring models were all improved significantly; (c) the estimation accuracy of the four regression models was: SVM > QR > ELM > PLSR; and (d) among the seven sampling depths, 10???20 cm was the optimal inversion depth for all the four models, followed by 20???40 and 0???40 cm. Among the four models, SVM was higher in accuracy than the other three at 10???20 cm (R2P = 0.67, RMSEP = 0.12%). These findings can provide valuable guidance for soil salinity monitoring and agricultural production in the arid or semi-arid areas under vegetation.

T2  - COMMUNICABLE DISEASES INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza is a common cause of acute respiratory infection, and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. This report summarises the epidemiology of hospitalisations with laboratory-confirmed influenza during the 2019 influenza season.The Influenza Complications Alert Network (FluCAN) is a sentinel hospital-based surveillance program that operates at sites in all jurisdictions in Australia. Cases were defined as patients hospitalised at any of the 17 sentinel hospitals with influenza confirmed by nucleic acid detection. Data were also collected on a frequency matched control group of influenza-negative patients admitted with acute respiratory infection.During the period 1 April to 31 October 2019 (the 2019 influenza season), there were 4,154 patients admitted with confirmed influenza to one of 17 FluCAN sentinel hospitals. Of these, 44% were elderly (>= 65 years), 21% were children (< 16 years), 7.7% were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, 1.7% were pregnant and 73% had chronic comorbidities. Most admissions were due to influenza A infection (85%). Estimated vaccine coverage was 75% in the elderly, 49% in non-elderly adults with medical comorbidities, and 27% in young children (< 5 years). The estimated vaccine effectiveness in the target adult population was 42% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 36%, 49%).There were a larger number of hospital admissions detected with confirmed influenza in this national observational surveillance system in 2019 than in 2018.

TI  - Synergic use of neural networks model and remote sensing algorithms to estimate water clarity indicators in Khanpur reservoir, Pakistan
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater reservoirs are limited and facing issues of over-exploitation, climate change effects and poor maintenance which have serious consequences for water quality. Developing countries face the challenge of collecting in situ information on ecological status and water quality of these reservoirs due to constraints of cost, time and infrastructure. In this study, a practical method of retrieval of two water clarity indicators, total suspended matter and secchi disk depth, using Sentinel-2 satellite data is adopted for preliminary assessment of water quality and trophic conditions in Khanpur reservoir, Pakistan. The study explores the synergy of utilizing two independent models, i.e., case 2 regional coast color analytical neural network model and semiempirical remote sensing algorithms to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of water clarity patterns in the dammed reservoir, in the absence of ground measurements. The drinking water quality and trophic state of the reservoir water is determined based purely on satellite measurements. Out of the five months studied, the reservoir water has high turbidity and poor eutrophic status in three months. The results from both computational models are compared, which exhibit a high degree of statistical agreement. The study demonstrates the effective utilization of relevant analytical and semiempirical methods on satellite data to map water clarity indicators and understand their dynamics in both space and time. This solution is particularly useful for regions where routine ground sampling and observation of environmental variables are absent.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: Lake Beseka, EthiopiaStudy focus: Lake Beseka has been expanding despite climatic and other relevant variables remaining largely the same over time. In this study, we applied an integrated approach based on multi-source datasets-Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Landsat thermal band data, precipitation, and physicochemical and isotope water quality data-to understand the processes that govern the lake surface area expansion with a focus on the volcano-tectonic process. New hydrological insights for the region: Our findings show the following: (1) overall annual rainfall trend showed a declining trend, suggesting that rainfall is not the main source of water that led to the expansion of the lake; (2) recent vertical deformation rates reveal high subsidence rates on areas bordering the lake to the north, west, and southwest that are dissected by an echelon of fissures and faults, and physicochemical and isotopic water quality analysis from previous studies reveal dilution of the lake water by a new source of water in these parts; and (3) the thermal data analysis showed high land surface temperature values to the north of the lake, where a recent swarm of earthquakes were detected. We attributed the lake surface area growth to two processes: groundwater influx into the lake surface facilitated by active volcano-tectonic processes and volcano-tectonic-induced subsidence that creates favorable conditions for the water to expand to new areas.

TI  - Vegetation-memory effects and their association with vegetation resilience in global drylands
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation memory describes the effect of antecedent environmental and ecological conditions on the present ecosystem state and has been proposed as an important proxy for vegetation resilience. In particular, strong vegetation memory has been identified in dryland regions, but the factors underlying the spatial patterns of vegetation memory remain unknown. We aim to map the components and drivers of vegetation memory in dryland regions using state-of-the-art climate reanalysis data and refined approaches to identify vegetation-memory characteristics across dryland regions worldwide. Using a framework which distinguishes between intrinsic and extrinsic ecological memory, we show that (i) intrinsic memory is a much stronger component than extrinsic memory in the majority of dryland regions and (ii) climate reanalysis datasets change the detection of extrinsic vegetation memory in some global dryland regions. Synthesis. Our study offers a global picture of the vegetation response to two climate variables using satellite data, information which is potentially relevant for mapping components and properties of vegetation responses worldwide. However, the large differences in the spatial patterns in intrinsic vegetation memory in our study compared to previous analyses show the overall sensitivity of this component to the initial choice of extrinsic predictor variables. As a result, we caution against using the oversimplified link between intrinsic vegetation-memory and vegetation recovery rates at large spatial scales.

TI  - The value of preoperative sentinel lymph node contrast-enhanced ultrasound for breast cancer: a large, multicenter trial
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The study conducted a multicenter study in China to explore the learning curve of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), the feasibility of using this technique for the localization of SLNs and lymphatic channels (LCs) and its diagnostic performance for lymph node metastasis. Method Nine hundred two patients with early invasive breast cancer from six tertiary class hospitals in China were enrolled between December 2016 and December 2019. Each patient received general ultrasound scanning and SLN-CEUS before surgery. The locations and sizes of LCs and SLNs were marked on the body surface based on observations from SLN-CEUS. These body surface markers were then compared with intraoperative blue staining in terms of their locations. The first 40 patients from each center were included in determining the learning curve of SLN-CEUS across sites. The remaining patients were used to investigate the diagnostic efficacy of this technique in comparison with intraoperative blue staining and pathology respectively. Result The ultrasound doctor can master SLN-CEUS after 25 cases, and the mean operating time is 22.5 min. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of SLN-CEUS in diagnosing lymph node metastases were 86.47, 89.81, 74.90, and 94.97% respectively. Conclusion Ultrasound doctors can master SLN-CEUS with a suitable learning curve. SLN-CEUS is a feasible and useful approach to locate SLNs and LCs before surgery and it is helpful for diagnosing LN metastases.

TI  - Mexican agricultural frontier communities differ in forest dynamics with consequences for conservation and restoration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest regrowth is key to achieve restoration commitments, but a general lack of understanding when it occurs and how long secondary forests persist hampers effective upscaling. We quantified spatiotemporal forest dynamics in a recently colonized agricultural frontier in southern Mexico, and tested how temporal variation in climate, and cross-community variation in land ownership, land quality and accessibility affect forest disturbance, regrowth and secondary forest persistence. We consistently found more forest loss than regrowth, resulting in a net decrease of 45% forest cover (1991-2016) in the study region. Secondary forest cover remained relatively constant while secondary forest persistence increased, suggesting that farmers are moving away from shifting cultivation. Temporal variation in disturbance was explained by annual variation in climatic variables and key policy and market interventions. We found large differences in forest characteristics across communities, and these were explained by differences in land ownership and soil quality. Forests were better conserved on communal land, while secondary forest was more persistent when farms were larger and soil quality is better. At the pixel-level both old forest and secondary forests were better represented on low-quality lands indicating agricultural concentration on productive land. Both old forest and secondary forest were less common close to the main road, where secondary forests were also less persistent. We demonstrate the suitability of timeseries analyses to quantify forest disturbance and regrowth and we analyse drivers across time and space. Communities differ in forest dynamics, indicating different possibilities, needs and interests. We warrant that stimulating private land ownership may cause remaining forest patches to be lost and that conservation initiatives should benefit the whole community. Forest regrowth competes with agricultural production and ensuring farmers have access to restoration benefits is key to restoration success.

TI  - Capability assessment of Sentinel-1 data for estimation of snow hydrological potential in the Khanabad watershed in the Hindu Kush Himalayas of Afghanistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The water resource in arid countries like Afghanistan is mainly dependent upon the rivers driven by snowmelt runoff. The Khanabad watershed in Afghanistan contributes significantly to the river network system in this country. This study investigates the role of freely available Sentinel-1 dual polarimetric and interferometric SAR data to determine snow hydrological potential in the Khanabad watershed. The objectives of this study are to assess the Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) estimates derived from the Sentinel-1 data with respect to field observations and ERA5-Reanalysis data for February and March 2019. The snow depth and snow density estimates are derived using the interferometric and polarimetric methods to determine the SWE. The snow depth is determined using differential interferometry with snow-free scenes and snow-covered scenes acquired by Sentinel-1 data. The density is empirically modeled using the permittivity estimates derived from bi-temporal VV-channel Sentinel-1 data corresponding to snow-covered scenes. The comparison between the SWE results observed from Sentinel-1 data with respect to field observations showed high agreement determined by the overall correlation of 0.877 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 37 mm. The higher RMSE was attributed to the uncertainties introduced by the presence of liquid water content in the March 2019 dataset.

TI  - Loci for prediction of penicillin and tetracycline susceptibility in <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>: a genome-wide association study
T2  - LANCET MICROBE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Neisseria gonorrhoeae poses an urgent public health threat because of increasing antimicrobial resistance; however, much of the circulating population remains susceptible to historical treatment regimens. Point-of-care diagnostics that report susceptibility could allow for reintroduction of these regimens, but development of such diagnostics has been restricted to ciprofloxacin, for which susceptibility can be predicted from a single locus. We aimed to define genetic variants associated with susceptibility to penicillin and tetracycline.Methods We collected publicly available global whole-genome sequencing data (n=12045) from clinical N gonorrhoeae isolates, with phenotypic resistance data for penicillin (n=6935), and tetracycline (n=5727). Using conditional genome-wide association studies, we defined genetic variants associated with susceptibility to penicillin and tetracycline. We excluded isolates that could not be classified as either susceptible or resistant. To validate our results, we assembled 1479 genomes from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project, for which urethral specimens are collected at sentinel surveillance sites across the USA. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of susceptibility-associated alleles using Clinical & laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints for susceptibility and non-resistance in both the global and validation datasets.Findings In our conditional penicillin genome-wide association study, the presence of a genetic variant defined by a non-mosaic penA allele without an insertion at codon 345 was associated with penicillin susceptibility and had the highest negative effect size (B) of significant variants (p=5.0x10(-14), beta -2.5). In combination with the absence of bla(TEM), this variant predicted penicillin susceptibility with high specificity (99.8%) and modest sensitivity (36.7%). For tetracycline, the wildtype allele at rpsJ codon 57, encoding valine, was associated with tetracycline susceptibility (p=5. 6x10(-1)(6), beta -1.6) after conditioning on the presence of tetM. The combination of rpsJ codon 57 allele and tetM absence predicted tetracycline susceptibility with high specificity (97.2%) and sensitivity (88.7%).Interpretation As few as two genetic loci can predict susceptibility to penicillin and tetracycline in N gonorrhoeae with high specificity. Molecular point-of-care diagnostics targeting these loci have the potential to increase available treatments for gonorrhoea. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Thermal conductivity of polar firn
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The vast Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets are covered by many tens of meters of polar firn, which is snow that is years to centuries old and has experienced significant metamorphism. Both ice-sheet modeling and decoding satellite data require knowledge of the thermal conductivity of polar firn with depth, yet direct measurements are not available for depths below the top several meters. We present the first direct measurements of the effective thermal conductivity of polar firn over depths down to 48 m. A custom guarded hot plate has been designed and constructed, and validation of this device using materials of known thermal conductivity is presented. Using the validated device, measurements were made on firn core samples spanning depths from 4 to 48 m from an undisturbed site near the South Pole, Antarctica. Results show that the thermal conductivity of polar firn at South Pole increases with depth and with density. The thermal conductivity of polar firn from the surface to 48 m depth is well-explained as a function of density by the relationship k(firn)(rho) = 0.144 e(0.00308 center dot rho) and as a function of depth by the relationship k(firn)(z) = 0.536 e(0.0144 center dot z). The associated thermal diffusivities range from 19.0 to 28.5 m(2) a(-1).

TI  - A Case Study of the Relationship Between Vegetation Coverage and Urban Heat Island in a Coastal City by Applying Digital Twins
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - While urban vegetation affects the urban thermal environment directly, the effects of different plant layouts and vegetation cover on urban microclimate regulation are different. This study has applied digital technologies to advance urban environmental research and forestry analysis. With a focus on a coastal city located on the eastern coast of the North Temperate Zone as a study area, this study collected the Landsat archive satellite remote sensing image data covering the study area in 2000-2020 and analyzed the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of vegetation coverage, land surface temperature, and urban heat island (UHI) ratio index. The study results included the following findings: (1) The area of high fractional vegetation cover (FVC) (0.8-1.0) in the study area is increasing. Those areas are located in the mountain forests in the near-coastal area. The lowest temperature was also detected in the mountain area. (2) The distance from the coastline causes a negative correlation between land surface temperature and FVC. The land surface temperature in the regions with a distance of more than 25 km from the coastline decreases obviously with increasing FVC in summer. However, the correlation between the land surface temperature and FVC showed a slight change in the winter period. (3) UHI ratio index decreases along with the area of high FVC (H-FVC) area. The influence of ocean climate on seasons is different, which results in the reduced effect of the H-FVC area and differences in the UHI ratio index. (4) The distance from the coastline should be considered as an important factor in the forestry development planning of the coastal cities.

TI  - Half-Connecting Theory: Developing African Psychology Theory in a "Radical Beginnings" Direction
T2  - JOURNAL OF BLACK PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In existential philosophy, "radical beginnings" refers to the task of uncovering the earliest, constitutive moments of a phenomenon's existence. In this article, the author develops African psychology in a radical beginnings direction by using the theory of half-connecting (HCT) to trace the origins of the African and European worldviews to the earliest stages of human development, particularly to the unconscious and physical bodies of people. It is found that the differences and tensions between the worldviews are traceable to their original and intimate relationship. It is also found that African and European worldviews do not operate only in obvious instances involving race and racism but in everything humans create, including in the technologies and infrastructures in the background of everyday life. Finally, the author discusses how HCT can help therapists expand their understanding of the sources of mental and behavioral distress, which may incite new, creative thinking around how disorders are treated.

TI  - The Temporal-Based Forest Disturbance Monitoring Analysis: A Case Study of Nature Reserves of Hainan Island of China From 1987 to 2020
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbance monitoring can provide scientific data for the decision making and management of nature reserves. LandTrendr algorithm has been applied to identify forest disturbances on a long-time scale through appropriate segmentation and linear fitting. In this study, 23 nature reserves were detected using LandTrendr during 1987-2020, and the vegetation loss was quantified by years and pixel numbers. The results illustrated that (1) most disturbances occurred in the 1990s and early 21st century. (2) From the spatial distribution of forest loss, the area of forest vegetation disturbance in the coastal zone was larger than the protected area in the internal Hainan Island, the area disturbed in the coastal zone protected area was 97.12 km(2), and the area disturbed in the internal area of Hainan Island protected area was 63.02 km(2). (3) In terms of different levels of nature reserves, the disturbed area of national nature reserves was 28.39 km(2) and the total disturbed area of provincial nature reserves was 131.75 km(2). (4) In terms of different types of nature reserves, forest ecological nature reserves had the largest disturbed area of 102.96 km(2), followed by marine coastal nature reserves with a disturbed area of 36.99 km(2), wildlife nature reserves with a disturbed area of 10.22 km(2), and wild plant nature reserves with the smallest disturbed area of 9.96 km(2). The results are hoped to provide scientific support and data for the management and planning of nature reserves in Hainan Island.

TI  - Comprehensive Analysis of a Dust Storm by a Lidar Network Combined With Multiple Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to improve the accuracy of dust storm prediction and reduce the damage and losses by a dust storm event, it is necessary to conduct an in-depth study on the same. The data of the national air quality stations, backward trajectories generated by the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT), and the lidar network data from Wuwei, Baiyin, and Dingxi were used to study a large-scale dust storm event that occurred from 12 to 14 May 2019. This study explores the cause of the dust storm and physical characteristics of dust aerosols in three-dimensional space, as well as its impact on air quality. Results show that the dust storm was caused by the eastward movement of the East Asian trough and affected most cities in northern China from northwest to southeast. Consequently, the air quality deteriorated seriously, especially over the Hexi Corridor. The hourly peak concentrations of PM10 in Wuwei and Baiyin were close to 3,000 mu g center dot m(-3). The observations from the lidar network show that the dust intensities were similar at different cities, and their extinction coefficients were close. However, the depolarization ratio varied with sources and the physical characteristics of dust particles. According to the simulation results of extinction coefficients and particle concentrations, due to the impact of dust transported at high altitudes, the concentration of particles in Dingxi did not decrease with the increase in altitude. The particle concentrations from ground-based monitoring were lower than those of Baiyin and Wuwei, while particle concentrations above 0.3 km were higher than those of Baiyin and Wuwei.

TI  - Detection and characterization of coastal tidal wetland change in the northeastern US using Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal tidal wetlands are highly altered ecosystems exposed to substantial risk due to widespread and frequent land-use change coupled with sea-level rise, leading to disrupted hydrologic and ecologic functions and ultimately, significant reduction in climate resiliency. Knowing where and when the changes have occurred, and the nature of those changes, is important for coastal communities and natural resource management. Large-scale mapping of coastal tidal wetland changes is extremely difficult due to their inherent dynamic nature. To bridge this gap, we developed an automated algorithm for DEtection and Characterization of cOastal tiDal wEtlands change (DECODE) using dense Landsat time series. DECODE consists of three elements, including spectral break detection, land cover classification and change characterization. DECODE assembles all available Landsat observations and introduces a water level regressor for each pixel to flag the spectral breaks and estimate harmonic time-series models for the divided temporal segments. Each temporal segment is classified (e.g., vegetated wetlands, open water, and others - including unvegetated areas and uplands) based on the phenological characteristics and the synthetic surface reflectance values calculated from the harmonic model coefficients, as well as a generic rule-based classification system. This harmonic model-based approach has the advantage of not needing the acquisition of satellite images at optimal conditions (i.e., low tide status) to avoid underestimating coastal vegetation caused by the tidal fluctuation. At the same time, DECODE can also characterize different kinds of changes including land cover change and condition change (i.e., land cover modification without conversion). We used DECODE to track status of coastal tidal wetlands in the northeastern United States from 1986 to 2020. The overall accuracy of land cover classification and change detection is approximately 95.8% and 99.8%, respectively. The vegetated wetlands and open water were mapped with user's accuracy of 94.6% and 99.0%, and producer's accuracy of 98.1% and 93.5%, respectively. The cover change and condition change were mapped with user's accuracy of 68.0% and 80.0%, and producer's accuracy of 80.5% and 97.1%, respectively. Approximately 3283 km(2) of the coastal landscape within our study area in the northeastern United States changed at least once (12% of the study area), and condition changes were the dominant change type (84.3%). Vegetated coastal tidal wetland decreased consistently (similar to 2.6 km(2) per year) in the past 35 years, largely due to conversion to open water in the context of sea-level rise.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundNeedle tract metastasis is a rare complication following percutaneous procedures for malignancy. Case SummaryThis report describes a 49-year-old female with a lump on her right breast. Mass core needle biopsy showed the specimen was an invasive carcinoma, and mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. What is special about this case was that the patient reported a history of lung cancer and the position of the breast mass was the puncture site of computed tomography-guided core needle biopsy for lung cancer. Immunostaining of paraffin specimen findings indicated the breast mass as a result of lung carcinoma metastasis. The patient's medical history indicated that the malignant tumor in the breast was a core needle tract pulmonary metastasis. The patient underwent the examination and received therapy based on the lung cancer metastasis principle. At 9 months from breast surgery, the patient is alive, in good condition, and with stability of the disease. ConclusionsThis patient was misdiagnosed. Careful medical history review and multidisciplinary team discussions are important, especially for patients with a history of cancer or invasive operation.

TI  - Stronger conservation promotes mangrove biomass accumulation: Insights from spatially explicit assessments using UAV and Landsat data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Chinese mangroves have been recovered in area over the past two decades from previous declining trend, and about half of existing mangroves are still in their young growth stage. This provides a unique opportunity to assess mangrove conservation by examining the growth dynamics of young mangroves over different conservation periods. However, we are currently short of effective assessment tools for spatially explicit quantification of mangrove conservation effects. To fill up this gap, we proposed a novel remote sensing approach using readily available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Landsat enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data to assess the spatial evolution of aboveground biomass (AGB) of young mangroves. With the space-for-time hypothesis, the approach implemented with an empirical EVI-height-AGB equation was tested in four subtropical estuarine mangroves in the southeastern coast of China. The results indicated: (a) the UAV-based Structure from Motion (SfM) technology served as an effective and low-cost means for capturing the spatial heterogeneity of mangrove canopy heights; (b) a maximum stand age of 15 years could be used to define the young growth stage of mangroves, for which the EVI-height relationships could be described by exponential equations without suffering significant spectral saturation effects; (c) mangrove forests had overall faster annual AGB accumulation during the young growth stage over the post-2000 versus pre-2000 conservation period. This study is one of the first attempts to develop a remote sensing approach for quantifying spatially explicit AGB accumulation rates of young mangroves. It highlights the practicability and advantage of the UAV-SfM technology and confirms that stronger conservation efforts promote mangrove AGB accumulation over the past two decades. The developed EVIheight-AGB framework fueled with readily available UAV and Landsat data provides a unique tool for assessing mangrove conservation effects from landscape to regional scales.

M3  - Article
AB  - Rangeland management requires frequent and accurate estimation of aboveground vegetation biomass (AGB) as a proxy of forage production. However, traditional methods for AGB measurement are time-consuming and only provide a low number of spatiotemporal measurements. Newly developed remote sensing platforms such as UAVs and new generation satellites allow unprecedented large-scale and frequent monitoring of rangeland vegetation that is typically produced in marginal lands characterized by high surface heterogeneity. This study used highresolution UAV data and the new multi-spectral VEN mu S satellite to monitor AGB production for two consecutive years in a Mediterranean and semiarid grassland rangeland in Israel. We then studied the effects of grazing intensity and precipitation along the growing season on AGB. Data were collected from two long-term ecological research sites with plots under controlled grazing pressures (i.e., no grazing, moderate, and intensive grazing). We used high-spatial-resolution UAV imagery for land cover classification in order to mask different levels of mixed pixels in the VEN mu S satellite images along the growing season. A support vector regression model (SVM) for satellitebased AGB estimation was developed using more than 600 ground-truth AGB measurements collected during 2019-2020. The effect of the percentage cover for mixed pixel removal was examined. The results showed an improvement in the prediction model by 35% and reduced the RMSE by half for the support vector machine regression model's best prediction. The best AGB prediction results were achieved by including satellite pixels with over 50% vegetation cover. For the first time in Eastern Mediterranean rangelands, our study illustrates the benefits of highintegrated remote sensing data (i.e., satellite and UAV) for generating more accurate AGB estimations even in highly heterogeneous ecosystems in terms of surface cover. Such an approach can provide crucial and better information for sustainable rangeland management under varying spatiotemporal and climatic conditions.

TI  - Assessment of forest cover loss and impacts on ecosystem services: Coupling of remote sensing data and people?s perception in the dry deciduous forest of West Bengal, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest loss is one of the major environmental issues and is threatening livelihoods across the world. Understanding the drivers of forest cover loss in the different forest cover densities and its impacts on ecosystem services are relevant for sustainable management of the forest ecosystem. Extensive studies exploring topics related to spatial-temporal deforestation, little is known regarding quantitative forest loss by individual disturbance driver and people's perceptions of forest loss's impacts on provisioning ecosystem services. The present study focused on trends and patterns of forest loss by forest disturbance drivers in the different forest cover densities and its impacts on provisioning ecosystem services integrated with remote sensing data and local people's perceptions in the dry deciduous forest of West Bengal. This study employs stratified probability sampling approach using time series Landsat data on Google Earth Engine platform to quantify forest loss between 2006 and 2020 in the different pre-disturbance forest cover densities by forest disturbance drivers. Structured household interviews were used to examine local people's perceptions about forest cover loss and its impacts on ecosystem services. We found that 68.463% of forest area is cleared by disturbance drivers between 2006 and 2020. Annual rate of forest clearing is increasing trend and dominating in dense forests, followed by medium forests and open forests. Logging and agricultural clearing was the most dominant drivers over space and time. Overall 73.92% of households perceived decline in the availability of provisioning ecosystem services. Wild foods and medicinal plants were the most affected ecosystem services followed by livestock feed, construction materials and fuel wood. This study may help to the regional assessment of gross forest loss by individual disturbance driver, and its impacts on provisioning ecosystem services for supporting decision making to sustainable forest management.

T2  - Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Gastric cancer is one of the most common gastrointestinal malignancies, and the incidence and mortality of gastric cancer remain high in China. In recent years, with the rapid popularization of laparoscopic technology, fluorescent laparoscopic technology is increasingly getting mature, providing a new method for accurate clinical tracing of lymph nodes and prediction of tumor metastasis lymph nodes. A large number of scientific research experiments and clinical trials have shown that, laparoscopic lymph node diagnosis technology based on the fluorescent indocyanine green (ICG) can significantly improve the efficiency of lymphadenectomy and prediction accuracy of lymph node metastasis, and can reveal a more accurate scope of lymphadenectomy in gastric cancer for surgeons, so as to avoid excessive adenectomy as well as iatrogenic injuries on patients. Although the status of the technology in gastric cancer surgery mentioned above continues improving, the overall operation process details of ICG fluorescence imaging, standardized fluorescence detecting equipment, and postoperative pathological examination process still need to be further optimized.
AB  - 近年来，随着腹腔镜技术的推广普及，荧光腹腔镜技术日益成熟，为精准临床示踪胃周淋巴结及预测癌细胞转移淋巴结提供了新的方法。大量文献证明，基于吲哚菁绿（ICG）的荧光腹腔镜辅助淋巴结诊疗技术能够显著提高淋巴结清扫效率，提升转移淋巴结的预判准确率，为胃肠外科医生提供更精准化的胃癌淋巴引流区清扫范围，从而避免了过度清扫及发生医源性损伤。虽然该技术在胃癌手术中的重要性不断提升，但ICG荧光显像的整体操作流程细节、标准化荧光探测设备乃至术后病理检查规范，尚有待进一步完善。未来仍需开展大样本、多中心、前瞻性随机对照研究，为明确荧光腹腔镜胃癌根治术淋巴结清扫的临床意义，提供更高级别的证据支持。.

TI  - Today's Mistakes and Tomorrow's Wisdom horizontal ellipsis in the Management of T1b Barrett's Adenocarcinoma
T2  - VISCERAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Given the limitation that endoscopic resection only enables local intraluminal treatment without lymphadenectomy, the standard treatment of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) with invasion of the submucosa (T1b) has long been surgical esophageal resection. However, in recent literature, the risk of lymph node metastases (LNM) associated with T1b EAC appears to be lower than previously assumed, and endoscopic management is increasingly being considered a valid and less invasive alternative to surgery. Summary: Surgical esophageal resection performed after radical endoscopic resection of T1b EAC often does not show any residual tumor or LNM in the resected specimen. Given the morbidity and mortality associated with surgical esophageal resection, endoscopic management with strict surveillance protocols has been more widely applied provided that the initial tumor was radically removed by endoscopic resection, reserving surgery for those cases where the additional risk of surgical esophageal resection is justified. These are the cases where intraluminal recurrent neoplasia is found that cannot be retreated endoscopically or cases with locoregional LNM detected during follow-up. In the future, selection of patients who can safely be managed endoscopically and those who may benefit from additional surgery after endoscopic resection of T1b EAC may become more tailored, using risk prediction calculators or sentinel node navigated surgery. Key Messages: Management of patients with T1b EAC is shifting from surgical treatment to less invasive endoscopic treatment strategies, including watchful waiting approaches. The risk of LNM of T1b EAC appears to be lower than long assumed. In the future, management of T1b EAC may become more individualized based on tools to predict LNM risk per patient case.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Single scattering albedo (SSA) is a leading contributor to the uncertainty in aerosol radiative impact assessments. Therefore accurate information on aerosol absorption is required on a global scale. In this study, we have applied a multi-satellite algorithm to retrieve SSA (550 nm) using the concept of critical optical depth. Global maps of SSA were generated following this approach using spatially and temporally collocated data from Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on board Terra and Aqua satellites. Limited comparisons against airborne observations over India and surrounding oceans were generally in agreement within +/- 0.03. Global mean SSA estimated over land and ocean is 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. Seasonal and spatial distribution of SSA over various regions are also presented. Sensitivity analysis to various parameters indicate a mean uncertainty around +/- 0.044 and shows maximum sensitivity to changes in surface albedo. The global maps of SSA, thus derived with improved accuracy, provide important input to climate models for assessing the climatic impact of aerosols on regional and global scales.

TI  - Alpine marmot (<i>Marmota marmota</i>) distribution evolution under climate change: The use of species distribution models at a local scale in the western Pyrenees massif (France)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Alpine marmot (Marmota marmota) is a social mammal living in mountainous grassland areas and has the particularity to hibernate in winter. Recent studies on a population in the French Alps found that climate change is affecting Alpine marmot population dynamics and might impact their overall distribution in the future. Using Species Distribution Models (SDMs), the effect of climate change on Alpine marmot's future distribution was investigated at a local scale, in the western part of the Pyrenean massif (New-Aquitaine region, France). This scale was chosen as an appropriate action scale for the conservation strategy for the species. Three climatic scenarios were used (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5) over three future 30-year periods (2021-2050, 2040-2070, 2071-2100) to predict the short- to long-term potential distribution of the target species. The results are consistent with naturalistic knowledge of the species ' ecological needs in terms of variable importance and response type. Mean maximum temperature in winter, standard-deviation of daily temperature in winter, along with the median rainfall amount in summer were the three most important climatic variables. Predictions under the two most pessimistic climate scenarios showed potential large habitat loss. In the long term, for RCP 4.5, an estimated habitat loss of 18% was predicted. In the case of RCP 8.5, a higher impact was predicted, with a 54% habitat loss. Our results show that high impact due to climate change can be expected at a long term. In addition, if winter climatic conditions are important for marmot survival through hibernation, drought in summer might be one of the drivers of future population dynamic and distribution. Our findings can be applied for other species living in grassland mountainous environments and for which access to food resources in summer is essential, facilitating the conservation of target areas.

TI  - Spatial Pattern and Dynamic Change of Vegetation Greenness From 2001 to 2020 in Tibet, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the cold climate and dramatically undulating altitude, the identification of dynamic vegetation trends and main drivers is essential to maintain the ecological balance in Tibet. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), as the most commonly used greenness index, can effectively evaluate vegetation health and spatial patterns. MODIS-NDVI (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-NDVI) data for Tibet from 2001 to 2020 were obtained and preprocessed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. The Theil-Sen median method and Mann-Kendall test method were employed to investigate dynamic NDVI changes, and the Hurst exponent was used to predict future vegetation trends. In addition, the main drivers of NDVI changes were analyzed. The results indicated that (1) the vegetation NDVI in Tibet significantly increased from 2001 to 2020, and the annual average NDVI value fluctuated between 0.31 and 0.34 at an increase rate of 0.0007 year(-1); (2) the vegetation improvement area accounted for the largest share of the study area at 56.6%, followed by stable unchanged and degraded areas, with proportions of 27.5 and 15.9%, respectively. The overall variation coefficient of the NDVI in Tibet was low, with a mean value of 0.13; (3) The mean value of the Hurst exponent was 0.53, and the area of continuously improving regions accounted for 41.2% of the study area, indicating that the vegetation change trend was continuous in most areas; (4) The NDVI in Tibet indicated a high degree of spatial agglomeration. However, there existed obvious differences in the spatial distribution of NDVI aggregation areas, and the aggregation types mainly included the high-high and low-low types; and (5) Precipitation and population growth significantly contributed to vegetation cover improvement in western Tibet. In addition, the use of the GEE to obtain remote sensing data combined with time-series data analysis provides the potential to quickly obtain large-scale vegetation change trends.

TI  - Identifying Rice Crop Flooding Patterns Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In India, the majority of the population relies heavily on rice as it is their primary source of nutrition. Rice crop yield productivity depends on seasonal variations and mainly depends on hydrological conditions. Long-term water clogging in rice fields for an extended period causes crop flooding and reduces production in terms of quality and quantity. This study deals with the identification of rice crop fields and their flooding due to surface irrigation using Sentinel-1 SAR data. The identification of rice fields was attempted by classifying the image data using a random forest algorithm. For crop flooding analysis, the temporal backscatter of the corresponding fields has been extracted from SAR data and local thresholding is used. The temporal analysis of the SAR backscattering showed a similar tendency in terms of crop growth. The overall accuracy of rice crop classification for VH and VV is 97.30% and 92.24% with RMSE errors of 0.0143 and 0.0145, respectively, obtained at the peak stage of the crop. From the crop flooding analysis, it is observed that crop fields have been flooded at the growth stage due to surface irrigation and rainfall. We identified crop flooding even at the crop mature stage. In the analysis, it has been observed that the flooding is not due to irrigation water but is due to the precipitation water.

M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass meadows are virtual blue carbon ecosystems facing a dramatic decline on a global scale. Tracking the status and trends of seagrass meadows, which is still pending on large scales, is an emerging priority for their conservation and restoration. Here, we develop a semi-automatic procedure to identify and map seagrass meadows. Using Sentinel-2 data in Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, a map is generated, showing a total of 11113.4 ha of seagrass meadows in coastal China in 2020. There exists the largest extent (6450.3 ha) in the coast of the South China Sea, while the second area (3909.5 ha) is in the Yellow Sea-Bohai Sea, and the seagrass meadows in the East China Sea cover about 753.6 ha. Our results provide the baseline data of seagrass meadows distribution in coastal China, and this study can be of reference for mapping seagrass meadows on a broader or even global scale.

TI  - Male breast cancer: a Singapore perspective
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare, representing <1% of all breast cancers. Treatment recommendations have been extrapolated from trial data of female breast cancer patients. This study aims to report our institutional experience of MBC across a 20 year period, analyse the survival outcome and prognosis of this group against female breast cancer patients treated at the same centre. Methods Clinical, histopathological, treatment and survival data of male and female breast cancer patients treated between Jan 1999 and July 2019 at Singapore General Hospital and National Cancer Centre Singapore were identified and analysed. Results Fifty-seven male patients were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 63 years. Majority had invasive ductal carcinoma (86%) and presented at an early disease stage: 70.2% presented as Tis/T1/T2 and 49.1% had no axillary nodal involvement. 84.2% had a simple mastectomy with either a sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary clearance. The median follow up was 5.69 years for males and 5.83 years for females. The median survival was 11.86 years for males and 16.3 years for females. At 5 years, overall survival (OS) was 69.9% (52.3-82.1%) and disease free survival (DFS) was 62.9% (44.9-76.5%) for males compared with OS 83.8% (83.21-84.39%) and DFS 74.5% (73.91-75.09%) for females. Conclusion MBC remains understudied. Our institutional data indicates that good long term survival in South-East Asian patients can be achieved with treatment protocols that are similar to female breast cancer. More prospective studies are required.

TI  - Nutrient levels, trophic status and land-use influences on streams, rivers and lakes in a protected floodplain of Uruguay
T2  - LIMNOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use intensification impacts freshwater ecosystems in many agricultural landscapes, including the Rio de la Plata grasslands in Southeastern South America. We evaluated water chemistry of rivers, streams and lakes associated with a protected river-floodplain in the Queguay River basin in Uruguay. From 2019-2021, we measured phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) forms, dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity and other chemical parameters; basin-scale land-use via Sentinel satellite imagery; and trophic status based on nutrient concentrations and Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Results highlighted low nutrient concentrations in the Queguay rivers, indicating this watershed as a national reference for evaluating eutrophication in Uruguay. Levels of total nitrogen (TN) in rivers averaged 430-510 mu g/L and total phosphorus (TP) averaged 44-51 mu g/L, classifying them as oligotrophic-mesotrophic systems. Streams ranged in TP from 51 to 97 mu g/L and in TN from 545 to 701 mu g/L, suggesting meso- to eutrophic states according to TP levels, and potential anthropogenic eutrophication in smaller basins with crop cover > 25%. Floodplain lakes are a conservation target within the protected area and had TP averaging 74-109 mu g/L, suggesting eutrophic-hypereutrophic states based on TP and potential external nutrient inputs. The positive correlation between basin-scale crop cover and mean TP and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations suggested that land-cover plays a role in nutrient levels of fluvial and lotic systems. This study establishes a baseline for water chemistry in lakes and fluvial ecosystems in the Queguay River basin within an extensive agricultural region of the La Plata River Grasslands. By providing the first time series dataset of water chemistry for this area, we fill a major geographical gap regarding the limnological attributes of freshwater ecosystems in northwestern Uruguay. Results highlight the value of the Queguay basin for freshwater habitat conservation, and the vulnerability of these systems to land cover changes and nutrient loading from external sources.

T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite geoidal data over the Elan Bank region in Antarctica could be demarcated with the surroundings and confirmed as continental lithosphere. It has been observed that the satellite geoidal map can well demarcate the continental margin region near the Indian coastal region using high-resolution geoid/gravity data. This also helps determine the nature of the lithospheric plate over the Elan Bank. A large portion of land got detached from the Indian plate during the transition processes between the continental and oceanic crust that were originally created by rifting. Satellite geoidal mapping is a comparatively new technique for crust delineation, offshore exploration and tectonics-related studies.

M3  - Article
AB  - Kerala experienced extremely heavy rainfall from 8th to 11th August 2019, which caused a widespread flood throughout the state and disrupted thousands of lives as well as a substantial amount of property. The novel approach of utilising the observed and merged satellite rainfall products along with remotely sensed optical and microwave images was applied to monitor the event. The results indicated vast inundation in Wayanad, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Malappuram, Palakkad, and Alappuzha districts on 10th August. A departure of 217% from normal rainfall for Palakkad and 123% for the whole state in the month of August were observed. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical datasets were successfully used to generate flood extent maps which can be advantageous for planners and governing bodies to control flood incidents over the region.

TI  - Holocene ice-free strait followed by dynamic Neoglacial fluctuations: Hornsund, Svalbard
T2  - HOLOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - The recession of the Hornbreen-Hambergbreen glaciers (Hornsund, Svalbard) will lead to the formation of a strait between the Greenland and Barents Seas within a few decades. We provide evidence for the earlier existence of this strait, in the Early-Middle Holocene and presumably since 1.3 ka cal. BP until glacier advance 0.7 +/- 0.3 ka or earlier. Radiocarbon dating of mollusc shells from the ground moraines in the Hornbreen forefield indicate the existence of the marine environment at the contemporary glacierized head of Hornsund since 10.9 ka cal. BP or earlier due to glacier retreat. The gap in the radiocarbon dates between 3.9 and 1.3 ka cal. BP and the published results of Be-10 exposure dating on Treskelen suggest the strait's closure after glacier advance in the Neoglacial. Subsequent re-opening occurred around 1.3 ka cal. BP, but according to Be-10 dates from Treskelen, the strait has again been closed since ca. 0.7 +/- 0.3 ka or earlier. The oldest known surge of Hornbreen occurred around 1900. Analysis of Landsat satellite images, morphometric indicators characterizing the glacier frontal zones and previous studies indicate one surge of Hambergbreen (1957-1968) and five re-advances of Hornbreen in the 20th century (after 1936, between 1958 and 1962, in 1986-1990, 1998-1999, 2011). While the warmer Holocene intervals might be a benchmark for the effects of future climate change, glacier dynamics in post-Little Ice Age climate warming seems to be an analogue of glacier retreats and re-advances in the earlier periods of the Holocene.

TI  - The capability of Sentinel-2 image and FieldSpec3 for detecting lithium-containing minerals in central Iran
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To date, there are very few studies about the spectroscopy of lithium-containing minerals (LCMs) in the scientific community. The main objective of this study is to investigate the capability of Sentinel-2 image and FieldSpec3 spectro-radiometer in terms of mapping five important LCMs, including spodumene, lepidolite, amblygonite, petalite, and eucryptite. Therefore, first the FieldSpec3 spectro-radiometer was used to create the spectral curves of the LCMs. Then, accurate spectral analysis and comparison of the studied LCMs were performed using The Spectral Geologist (TSG) and the Prism software. These two software can show even slight difference in absorption features of different LCMs, which can discriminate and identify these minerals. Lithium-bearing rocks show absorption features at similar to 365, similar to 2200, and similar to 2350 nm and reflective features at similar to 550-770 nm. These features are consistent with Sentinel-2 bands. Therefore, the created spectral curves were utilized for calibration of Sentinel-2 optical image to detect and map the potential zones of the rock units containing minerals mentioned above in a part of the central Iranian terrane. By using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier module, the potential areas were demarcated. Out of the five LCMs, petalite and spodumene showed more extensive coverage in the study area. Generally speaking, the largest concentration of those LCMs can be seen in southern and centraleastern parts of the study area. The comparison between spectral curves of reference and classified minerals confirmed the high capability of Sentinel-2 image for LCMs mapping. ASTER image classification results also confirmed the presence of the LCMs, but it cannot distinguish the LCMs type successfully.

TI  - Multi-influencing factor (MIF) and RS-GIS-based determination of agriculture site suitability for achieving sustainable development of Sub-Himalayan region, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is the primary source of income in the Sub-Himalayan Jalpaiguri District; therefore, identifying the optimal use of existing agricultural land is crucial. The primary objective of this study is to identify potential agricultural sites in the Jalpaiguri District for the sustainable development of the region. About eleven parameters have been considered using the multi-influencing technique in combination with remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system to delineate and model potential agriculture sites. The final agriculture suitability map was created using the 'Weighted Overlay technique,' and the final output can be categorized into five classes, i.e., highly suitability (424.3 km(2)), moderately suitability (1191.8 km(2)), marginally suitable (1141.4 km(2)), currently not suitable (567.1 km(2)), and permanently not suitable (60.8 km(2)). Besides, the results have been thoroughly verified using Google Earth images, in comparison with Landsat 8 output, and field visits using GPS to increase the reliability of the results. The finding reveals potential outcomes for agricultural activity; however, building a sustainable management strategy and resilient farming practices should be adopted to boost the region's agricultural output. Farmers, regional planners, and government officials can use the current agriculture suitability map to make comprehensive judgments for the region, such as determining the potential for agriculture sites, improving agricultural growth, and promoting self-reliant local economies.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Identification of Built-Up Areas Based on the Consistently High Heat-Radiating Surface in the Kolkata Metropolitan Area
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The consequences of rapid industrialization and urbanization are the conversion of natural surfaces into semi-impervious built-up features. In the context of rapid urbanization, the present work captures the temporally consistent high heat-radiating surface features through the Land Surface Temperature (LST)-derived novel thermal index, called the Spatio Temporal Thermal Consistency Index (STTCI). The index was derived from the time-series Landsat 5 TM and 8 OLI & TIRS data from 1990 to 2010 and from 2015 to 2020, respectively, at the five-yearly interval and applied over the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA). The correlation coefficient between field-collected and image-based LST came to be 0.89 for 2020. The LST results revealed an increasing trend in the mean LST values, i.e., from 19.53 degrees C to 23.56 degrees C in the KMA from 1990 to 2020, respectively. The minimum and maximum temperatures also increased about 4 degrees C and 7 degrees C, respectively, in this period. The novel STTCI was compared with the selected thermal built-up indices. The results showed that the STTCI outperformed all the other selected thermal built-up indices when correlated with the concerned image-based LST information (r > 0.95). The accuracy values for identifying built-up areas were assessed for all the indices. The STTCI showed the highest accuracy mostly over 90% with kappa values mostly > 0.85. Finally, STTCI-based built-up area extraction was performed and it was estimated that the built-up areas increased from 389.88 sq. Km to 789.57 sq. Km from 1990 to 2020.

T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent times, due to advancement in satellite sensor technology and acquisition of very high resolution image data (0.3-1 m), high-resolution elevation models can be generated using satellite photogrammetry. High-resolution and precise digital elevation model (DEM) is an essential requirement for many applications like city modelling, terrain modelling, population estimation, resources estimation, visibility analysis, solar energy calculation, etc. Using high-resolution DEM and digital terrain model (DTM), heights of objects (buildings and trees) over the earth can be extracted for various applications. For visualization purpose, ortho image, building shapes with height information and important geographic information system information are used. This study mainly discusses the generation of high-resolution DEM from satellite stereo data, and processing of DEM and DTM. It also discusses extraction and validation of building heights using reference ground control points and visualization of highly accurate three-dimensional city model over the study area. This has been carried out using indigenous copyrighted software 'Generation of virtual 3D city model' of Space Applications Centre/Indian Space Research Organisation.

TI  - Evaluation of low-resolution remotely sensed datasets for burned area assessment within the wildland-urban interface
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of wildfires are often intensified within the wildland-urban interface (WUI) where built structures intermingle with wildland vegetation. Because fire impacts in the WUI are high, detailed fire occurrence information is especially valuable to fire scientists and risk managers. While it is known that burned area datasets with coarse spatial resolution frequently underestimate burned area due to the omission of small fires, the extent to which they do so has not been quantified in states such as Oklahoma in the south-central United States. Here, we explore how much burned area low-resolution datasets miss, where they miss burned area, and how different datasets detect burned area within the wildland-urban interface in Oklahoma, USA. We compare the MODIS MCD64A1 burned area product, the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) product and a higher-resolution dataset developed using Sentinel-2 imagery and find that the lowresolution datasets underestimate burned area by approximately 46% and were unable to detect major hotspots of fire occurrence. Overall, our study provides an estimate of the extent to which large-scale, low-resolution burned area datasets underestimate the number and distribution of small fires in Oklahoma.

TI  - Link between monsoon rainfall variability and agricultural drought in the semi-arid region of Maharashtra, India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The monsoon rainfall variability in semi-arid regions affects all economic activities in general and agricul-ture in particular. The present study, therefore, ana -lyses monsoon rainfall variability and its connection with El Ni??o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and agriculture in the semi-arid region of Maharashtra, India during 1980???2014. Li-near correlation and regression analysis were carried out to evaluate the role of ENSO and IOD in rainfall variability. The standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized cropped productivity index (SCPI) and standardized crop area index (SCAI) were used to compare the agro-meteorological variability. The de-pendency of agricultural cropped area on rainfall was verified using satellite data (NDVI). The El Ni??o events and positive phase of IOD were mainly respon-sible for below-average rainfall over the study region. This highlights the need to incorporate the ENSO and IOD for precise forecasting of monsoon rainfall. Rain-fall variability (up to 33%) over the study basins caus-es meteorological droughts and eventually results in agricultural droughts. The agricultural productivity of rainfed as well as irrigated crops was significantly affected by rainfall variability. Particularly, during the severe meteorological droughts (1985???86, 2002???03 and 2012), agricultural productivity and cropped area were significantly reduced. Under the future climate change scenario, a rise in temperature will further add to the already difficult agricultural water man-agement challenge. Therefore, agronomists and water resources managers have to design a judicial plan which can mitigate the water scarcity and sustain agricultural yield even in warming conditions.

TI  - Application of the Machine-Learning Model to Improve Prediction of Non-Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis Status Among Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPerforming axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is the current standard option after a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN). However, whether 1-2 metastatic SLNs require ALND is debatable. The probability of metastasis in non-sentinel lymph nodes (NSLNs) can be calculated using nomograms. In this study, we developed an individualized model using machine-learning (ML) methods to select potential variables, which influence NSLN metastasis. Materials and MethodsCohorts of patients with early breast cancer who underwent SLN biopsy and ALND between 2012 and 2021 were created (training cohort, N 157 and validation cohort, N 58) for the development of the nomogram. Three ML methods were trained in the training set to create a strong predictive model. Finally, the multiple iterations of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression method were used to determine the variables associated with NSLN status. ResultsFour independent variables (positive SLN number, absence of lymph node hilum, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and total number of SLNs harvested) were combined to generate the nomogram. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.759 was obtained in the entire set. The AUC values for the training set and the test set were 0.782 and 0.705, respectively. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test of the model fit accuracy was identified with p = 0.759. ConclusionThis study developed a nomogram that incorporates ultrasound (US)-related variables using the ML method and serves to clinically predict the non-metastatic status of NSLN and help in the selection of the appropriate treatment option.

TI  - Initial topography matters in drainage divide migration analysis: Insights from numerical simulations and natural examples
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The stability of drainage divides is widely used for tectonic reconstruction. A drainage divide migrating from the high-uplift side towards the geometric center is usually thought to indicate a decrease of uplift asymmetry in a mountain belt. However, counterexamples exist. To explore this, we firstly use numerical simulation to reveal a phenomenon of drainage divide migration, in which the main drainage divide of a mountain belt migrates from the edge of the high-uplift side towards the geometric center in response to the initiation of asymmetric uplift. We then take the Xizhou Shan horst in North China as a natural example to show the pattern of divide migration found in the numerical simulation. We use three methods to measure the stability of the main drainage divide in the Xizhou Shan based on the ALOS digital elevation model. Results show that most segments of the divide are migrating southeastward. We further analyze the stable location of the main drainage divide in response to the tilt of the horst. Results reveal that the main drainage divide is migrating from the edge of the high-uplift side towards the geometric center to achieve a new steady state in response to the Late-Cenozoic asymmetric uplift. We conclude that not all drainage divides migrating towards the geometric center indicate a decrease of uplift asymmetry. Moreover, we proposed two different patterns of divide migration in response to the asymmetric uplift, which indicate that the migration of a drainage divide is controlled by both the initial position and the final stable position.

TI  - Vegetation Dynamics and its Response to Climate Change in the Yellow River Basin, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important ecological corridor, the Yellow River basin (YRB) is crucial for the eco-environmental security and sustainable socio-economic development of China. Systematic studies on the spatiotemporal evolution of vegetation cover and the response of vegetation dynamics to climate change in the YRB at different timescales are lacking. Utilizing a long-term remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and gridded climate dataset, we examined the spatiotemporal variability of vegetation cover and its response to climate variables in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) at multiple timescales by using the Mann-Kendall test, rescaled range analysis, and partial correlation analysis. Results indicated that the annual NDVI in the YRB decreased spatially from southeast to northwest, and peaked in August. From 1982 to 2015, the YRB experienced greening during the annual, growing season and spring, with statistically significant NDVI increases (p < 0.05) recorded in over 55% of the vegetated areas. NDVI trends should be expected to persist in the future, as evidenced by the Hurst index exceeding 0.5 in over 85% areas of the YRB. Temperature and precipitation determined the spatiotemporal pattern of vegetation cover in the YRB, and vegetation dynamics response to climatic variations varied among seasons and climatic zones. In contrast to other seasons, spring NDVI was significantly correlated with temperature, whereas winter vegetation was more vulnerable to suppression by increased precipitation. Vegetation growth was more susceptible to precipitation than to temperature in the arid and semiarid zones, while temperature dominated vegetation dynamics in the semi-humid zone, and the sunshine duration was essential for vegetation growth in high-altitude regions. The study contributes to a deeper understanding of the interrelationship between vegetation dynamics and climate change in the YRB and provides useful suggestions for the regional ecological conservation in the context of global warming.

TI  - Both real-time and long-term environmental data perform well in predicting shorebird distributions in managed habitat
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Highly mobile species, such as migratory birds, respond to seasonal and interannual variability in resource availability by moving to better habitats. Despite the recognized importance of resource thresholds, species-distribution models typically rely on long-term average habitat conditions, mostly because large-extent, temporally resolved, environmental data are difficult to obtain. Recent advances in remote sensing make it possible to incorporate more frequent measurements of changing landscapes; however, there is often a cost in terms of model building and processing and the added value of such efforts is unknown. Our study tests whether incorporating real-time environmental data increases the predictive ability of distribution models, relative to using long-term average data. We developed and compared distribution models for shorebirds in California's Central Valley based on high temporal resolution (every 16 days), and 17-year long-term average surface water data. Using abundance-weighted boosted regression trees, we modeled monthly shorebird occurrence as a function of surface water availability, crop type, wetland type, road density, temperature, and bird data source. Although modeling with both real-time and long-term average data provided good fit to withheld validation data (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, or AUC, averaged between 0.79 and 0.89 for all taxa), there were small differences in model performance. The best models incorporated long-term average conditions and spatial pattern information for real-time flooding (e.g., perimeter-area ratio of real-time water bodies). There was not a substantial difference in the performance of real-time and long-term average data models within time periods when real-time surface water differed substantially from the long-term average (specifically during drought years 2013-2016) and in intermittently flooded months or locations. Spatial predictions resulting from the models differed most in the southern region of the study area where there is lower water availability, fewer birds, and lower sampling density. Prediction uncertainty in the southern region of the study area highlights the need for increased sampling in this area. Because both sets of data performed similarly, the choice of which data to use may depend on the management context. Real-time data may ultimately be best for guiding dynamic, adaptive conservation actions, whereas models based on long-term averages may be more helpful for guiding permanent wetland protection and restoration.

TI  - Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of seasonal, annual, and consecutive farmland abandonment in China with time-series MODIS images during the period 2005-2019
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmland abandonment has substantial impacts on the environment, and its impacts vary with the duration of farmland abandonment. While consecutive and annual farmland abandonment (AFA) has been extensively studied, there is a need to investigate the spatiotemporal variation in seasonal farmland abandonment (SFA), particularly in areas where multiple-cropping practices are applied. In this study, we propose a method to monitor different types of farmland abandonment, such as SFA, AFA, and consecutive farmland abandonment (CFA), with time-series remote sensing data. The spatiotemporal pattern of farmland abandonment in mainland China from 2005 to 2019 was derived from time-series MODIS images. The overall accuracy for AFA maps was 79%-86% by comparing with MCD12Q1, and around 70% by comparing with China's Land Use/Cover Datasets. The results indicated that the total abandoned cultivable lands accounted for nearly 20% of the total cultivable lands and that SFA accounted for over 50% of the total abandoned cultivable lands in China. The total abandoned cultivable lands and total abandoned cultivable areas in mainland China did not change significantly across the study period. Moreover, the frequency of SFA gradually increased during the study period, and the frequency of CFA gradually decreased. Our study highlights that SFA accounts for a considerable proportion of the abandoned cultivable land in mainland China. SFA should be considered in related studies, as it could be a dominant type of farmland abandonment in areas where multiple cropping is practiced.

TI  - Dynamic characteristics of snow frequency and its relationship with climate change on the Tibetan plateau from 2001 to 2015
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow plays an important role in the cryosphere, due to its high surface albedo and its heat-insulation effect. Furthermore, snow strongly influences the energy exchange between land surface and atmosphere. It is one of the most widely distributed material and has the most significant seasonal and interannual variation in the global cryosphere. The total snow-cover area is about 1150 to 1260 km(2), which is about 23% of Earth's surface area. Due to its temperature sensitivity, snow also indicates climate change and has a feedback effect on climate. As an important input variable of the surface hydrological process and the energy-balance model, snow cover frequency (SCF) is central to the simulation of glacial and snow melt runoff and in the hydrologic process of downstream rivers. Accordingly, this paper studied the characteristics of SCF from 2001 to 2015, based on MOD10A2 products, and analyzed the relationship between SCF and metrological data derived from stations, in order to build a foundation for the analysis of climate change and its effects.

TI  - Generating megacity-scale building height maps without DGNSS surveyed GCPs: An open-source approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-URBAN ANALYTICS AND CITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes an open-source method for generating megacity-scale building height maps without proprietary software or Differential Global Navigation Satellite System surveyed ground control points (GCPs). We use the open-source Satellite Stereo Pipeline (S2P) software along with four scenes of 2.5m resolution Cartosat-1 data for Bengaluru to demonstrate this. Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of 5 m resolution are generated using S2P, and terrain removal is achieved using 30m SRTM data resampled to 5m. The resulting normalized DSM is calibrated and validated using 1270 GCPs. These were generated by counting the number of occupiable floors of buildings and marking zero elevation ground points. The final building height map of Bengaluru covers a total area of about 1420 km(2), and across the four scenes, has RMSE values ranging from 2.8m to 3.9m-an error of approximately one floor. Furthermore, we implemented this workflow using stereo imagery for Mumbai, and the RMSE values obtained were comparable to those for Bengaluru. Hence the method we describe is a very cost-effective way of generating megacity-scale building height maps. The height maps generated using this method can be used to better understand numerous urban characteristics including land use intensity and population distribution and can play a crucial role in urban planning and policy making.

TI  - Effect of land cover change and elevation on decadal trend of land surface temperature: a linear model with sum contrast analysis
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a significant factor in surface energy balance and global climatology studies. Land cover (LC) and elevation are two factors that affect the change of LST, and their effects depend on different geography. This study aims to demonstrate an alternative approach to examine the change of LST during 20 years (2001 to 2020) on Taiwan Island and to investigate the effect of LC change and elevation on a decadal trend of LST using a linear model that adjusting for each determinate factor. MODIS LST and LC data, as well as GMTED2010 elevation product, were downloaded available website. The natural cubic spline function was used to model annual seasonal patterns in LST. Linear regression model was used to estimate decadal change of long-term LST time series. Weighted sum contrasts linear regression was used to assess the effect of LC transformation and elevation on the decadal LST change by comparing adjusting mean of all factors. The adopted analysis method was an appropriate approach to assess categorical factors than those based on treatment contrasts, requiring specifying a control group to compare means and confidence intervals. Results showed that there was an increase in LST for most of the island. The average daytime and nighttime LST trends were 0.12 and 0.31 degrees C/decade, respectively. However, areas in the southern part of the north-south direction mountain range show a statistically significant increase in LST in both daytime and nighttime. The major landslides caused this noticeable change of surface temperature due to the catastrophic damage of typhoon Morakot in 2009. The results also revealed that the different pattern of LC change has a significant effect on daytime LST, but not on nighttime LST trends. The elevation above 600 m had affected both daytime and nighttime LSTs.

TI  - A Novel Spectral Index for Identifying Ferronickel (Fe-Ni) Laterites from Sentinel 2 Satellite Data
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Field geological mapping is the initial step of preliminary research in mining. However, in the last decades, the rapid progress of remote sensing data processing and its use for reconnaissance of geological outcrops for the purpose of locating possible mining sites gained increasing attention due to the significant time and cost savings. In this study, a new methodology, focused on mapping ferronickel (Fe-Ni) laterite deposits by using Sentinel-2 satellite data, is introduced. It describes a novel spectral index (called laterite spectral index (LSI)) that enhances laterite surface outcrops. To the best of our knowledge, LSI is the first spectral index tailored for this task, concerning minerals that are simultaneously rich in Fe and Ni. The LSI was applied on a continuum removed image by taking advantage of the spectral features present in two specific spectral areas of 490-560 nm and 842-945 nm. The entire methodology was tested and validated on four different excavation sites in eastern Central Greece based on known drillholes. In all excavation sites, the proposed LSI compared favorably with other relative spectral indices proposed in the literature for the detection of Fe-bearing minerals or Fe-oxides.

TI  - Estimating the sand saltation thresholds from Sentinel-1 SAR data in the Gobi Desert, Mongolia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial information about the sand saltation threshold is essential to quantify sand transport and dust emission. Quantitatively estimating the threshold over a wide area is challenging, however, because its main influencing factors (surface roughness elements) are unknown. Here, we explored the use of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to quantify surface roughness conditions and their temporal changes and map the threshold. Thresholds were obtained by in situ observations in dry spring periods during 2018-2020 at three year-round and eight temporary sites during natural sand and dust storms. We found a linear relationship (r = 0.91, p < 0.0001) between the SAR gamma naught VV intensity and the observed threshold where the site surface was stony or vegetated, indicating that SAR data can be used to quantify the spatial-temporal distribution of the threshold during dry periods. We then estimated thresholds from SAR data for spring 2017-2021 and found high thresholds on slopes and mountains, mainly due to stone and vegetation effects, whereas thresholds in the topographic depression varied because of changes in surface roughness conditions. Thresholds estimated from SAR data should greatly improve wide-area simulations of sand horizontal transport and dust emission fluxes by numerical dust models.

TI  - Application of the vineyard data assimilation (VIDA) system to vineyard root-zone soil moisture monitoring in the California Central Valley
T2  - IRRIGATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Efforts to apply gridded root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) products for irrigation decision-support in vineyards are currently hampered by the difficulty of obtaining RZSM products that meet required accuracy, resolution, and data latency requirements. In particular, the operational application of soil water balance modeling is complicated by the difficulty of obtaining accurate irrigation inputs and representing complex sub-surface water-flow processes within vineyards. Here, we discuss prospects for addressing these shortcomings using the Vineyard Data Assimilation (VIDA) system based on the assimilation of high-resolution (30-m) soil moisture information obtained from synthetic aperture radar and thermal-infrared (TIR) remote sensing into a one-dimensional soil water balance model. The VIDA system is tested retrospectively (2017-2020) for two vineyard sites in the California Central Valley that have been instrumented as part of the Grape Remote sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX). Results demonstrate that VIDA can generally capture daily temporal variations in RZSM for vertical depths of 30-60 cm beneath the vine row, and the assimilation of remote sensing products is shown to produce modest improvement in the temporal accuracy of VIDA RZSM estimates. However, results also reveal shortcomings in the ability of VIDA to correct biases in assumed irrigation applications-particularly during well-watered portions of the growing season when TIR-based evapotranspiration observations are not moisture limited and, therefore, decoupled from RZSM. Prospects for addressing these limitations and plans for the near-real-time operational application of the VIDA system are discussed.

TI  - Hyperspectral reconstruction method for optically complex inland waters based on bio-optical model and sparse representing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - For better use of well-performed water quality parameter estimation models and the comprehensive use of multisource remote sensing data, hyperspectral reconstruction is urgently needed in the remote sensing of optically complex inland waters. In this study, we proposed a bio-optical-based hyperspectral reconstruction (BBHR) algorithm to generate hyperspectral above-surface remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) data ranging in wavelength from 400 to 800 nm. One core advantage of the BBHR method is its in situ data independency, which theoretically renders the algorithm universal. The other advantage is its ability to reconstruct hyperspectral Rrs for the 400-800 nm spectral range, which facilitates the construction of more high accuracy chlorophyll-a concentration (Cchla) estimation models for optically complex waters. The reconstruction was tested by employing six widely used multispectral sensors: the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, (MERIS), Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (S3 OLCI), Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (S2 MSI), Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The model performance was validated by using a ASD FieldSpec spectroradiometer-measured hyperspectral dataset containing 1396 samples and a satellite-in-situ match-up dataset with 66 samples. The results show that the proposed BBHR method exhibits satisfactory performance. The average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), R2 and bias indices of the BBHR-reconstructed Rrs over all spectral bands of the six multispectral sensors were 3.27%, 8.86 x 10-4 sr-1, 0.98, and - 6.53 x 10-5 sr-1, respectively. In the field Cchla estimation experiment that contained 391 samples (mean Cchla is 25.42 +/- 16.37 mu g/L), the BBHR algorithm improved the MAPE and RMSE indices of multispectral data from 0.47 and 12.80 mu g/L to 0.42 and 10.16 mu g/L, respectively. For the satellite image match-up dataset (66 samples), the BBHR method decreased the MAPE and RMSE indices of multispectral images from 0.51 and 12.94 mu g/L to 0.32 and 8.01 mu g/L, respectively. The proposed algorithm outperformed the other two high-accuracy models in terms of spectral fidelity and Cchla estimation. In addition, the BBHR method shows great potential for the multi-source monitoring of inland water bodies. This could improve the accuracy and robustness of the reconstruction when semi-synchronized multi-source data are input and increase the consistency of multi-source data when non-synchronized multisource data are provided. Our results revealed that BBHR is a trustworthy algorithm that offers hyperspectral Rrs data and facilitates the remote monitoring of turbid inland waterbodies.

TI  - The polarization crossfire (PCF) sensor suite focusing on satellite remote sensing of fine particulate matter PM<sub>2.5</sub> from space
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Focusing on satellite remote sensing of fine particulate matter PM2.5 from space, the polarization cross -fire (PCF) strategy has been developed, which includes the PCF satellite suite and the particulate matter remote sensing (PMRS) model. Expected to be the first dedicated satellite sensor for PM2.5 remote sens -ing globally, the PCF suite is composed by the Particulate Observing Scanning Polarimeter (POSP) and the Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) together, and will be launched on board the Chinese GaoFen-5(02) satellite in 2021. Since the cross-track polarimetric measurements of POSP fully cover the multi-viewing swath of DPC, the sophisticated joint measurements could be obtained from the PCF suite in the range of 380-2250 nm including intensity and polarization, by the means of pixel matching and the cross calibration from POSP to DPC. Based on the optimal estimation inversion framework and synthetic data of PCF, the retrieval performances of key aerosol parameters are systematically investigated and assessed for the PM2.5 estimation by the PMRS model. For the design of inversion strategy for PCF, we firstly test the retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD), fine mode fraction (FMF), aerosol layer height (H) and the fine-mode real part of complex refractive index (m(r)(f)) simultaneously with surface parameters from the synthetic PCF data, and then the columnar volume-to-extinction ratio of fine particulates (VEf), the aerosol effective density (rho(f)) and the hygroscopic growth factor of fine-mode particles (f(RH)) are further obtained by the corresponding empirical relationship. The propagation errors from aerosol parameters to PM2.5 retrieval are investigated with the key procedures of PMRS model. In addition, the influences of improving calibration accuracy of PCF on PM2.5 retrievals are discussed, as well as the retrieval feasibility of PM10 by PCF strategy. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Mapping population on Tibetan Plateau by fusing VIIRS data and nighttime Tencent location-based services data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Population mapping is one of the fundamental materials for regional sustainability studies. Most scholars applied remote sensing data with excessive indicators to fit the population distribution. Nevertheless, over-complex models were lack of accuracy. This paper proposed a population model in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau as a study area; the model has consisted of Human Activity Extent and Crowd Exposure Frequency. Performed remote sensing land cover data, nighttime light data, and LBS geographic big data as candidate indicators for exploratory regression experiments eventually developed an optimal population model assembled by nighttime LBS data and nighttime light data. The model fits significantly better at the city level (R2values of 0.9922) and reduces the error compared with other studies and publicly available datasets (%RMSE values of 6.83%). For the first time, the model proposes that Crowd Exposure Frequency based on nighttime LBS data can provide effective population simulation in the global, nighttime light data gain compensation for it. Nighttime light data plays a dominant role in densely populated areas; at the same time, nighttime LBS revised its overestimation. They modified each other to make the model accuracy significantly elevated. The modelling framework allows dynamic and low-cost population estimates of ecologically vulnerable areas and thus serves sustainable regional development.

TI  - Impact of enhanced forest conditions on land surface characteristics over central India using LIS
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the nature of vegetation imply changes in land surface parameters such as surface albedo, roughness length, root depth, and surface emissivity which results in alteration of land surface conditions. This study aims to understand the effect of enhanced forest conditions on land surface states and land surface fluxes over central India during different seasons. In this study, the following simulations were carried out using Noah3.6 Land Surface Model (LSM) in Land Information System (LIS) for 5 years from May 2013 to May 2018 over the Indian region: (i) Control (Ctl) run, that represents the cropland(normal) scenario with Modis IGBP land cover map, (ii) Experimental (Exp) run, that represents enhanced forest conditions, where the cropland cover was replaced by evergreen broadleaf forest over the targeted region (central India). The results of this study indicate that when the model outputs were averaged over the targeted region, enhanced forest conditions led to increased soil moisture content as compared to the Cropland scenario due to dense cover of the surface and higher water holding capacity of the soil. Due to the canopy interception of solar radiation and increased soil moisture availability in the Exp-run, a decrease in both soil temperature and daily soil temperature range was seen as compared to Ctl-run. Net surface radiation increased during all the seasons in Exp-run as compared to Ctl-run due to a decrease of surface albedo. On conversion from cropland to the evergreen broadleaf forest, an increase in the latent heat flux was observed during all the seasons due to an increase in soil moisture and an increase in surface roughness length. A reduction in the sensible heat flux was observed during the post-monsoon season and beginning of winter season, however, for other seasons, an increase in the sensible heat flux was seen. The above behavior of sensible heat flux is due to variation of precipitation and the varying absorbed surface energy during different seasons. Furthermore, the results suggest that the effect of this enhanced forest conditions on land surface characteristics is more pronounced during the drier periods. A similar behavior of land surface characteristics due to enhanced forest conditions is observed for all the seasons during different years from 2013 to 2018.

TI  - A profile of injuries suffered by female soldiers serving in the Australian Army
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Female soldiers comprise an important component of any modern army, yet little research has been performed to investigate differences in the profiles of injuries reported by qualified female and male army personnel.Aim: The aim of this study was to compare injury rates and patterns between female and male soldiers of the Australian Regular Army (ARA).Methods: Data pertaining to all injuries reported by ARA members over a two-year period were accessed from the SENTINEL database and analysed descriptively. Findings regarding injury patterns were reported by most common location, nature, mechanism, and activity being performed at the time of injury. Injury incidence rates (IR) were calculated based on population size, and injury incidence rate ratios (IRR) comparing female and male injury rates were determined.Results: A total of 8750 injuries were recorded across the two-year time period (2018-2020) of the study (minor injuries: n = 1766 female, n = 6870 male; serious injuries: n = 19 female, n =95 male). Higher incidence rates of minor injuries were reported for female soldiers (IR =20.75 injuries/100 soldiers/year) when compared to male soldiers (IR= 13.60 injuries/100 soldiers/year), with an IRR of 1.53 [95% CI =1.46-1.60]. More serious injuries were reported at a similar rate between female (IR = 0.22/100 soldiers/year) and male soldiers (IR= 0.21/100 soldiers/year), with an IRR of 1.05 [95% CI = 0.65-1.72]. Female soldiers tended to report more ankle injuries than male soldiers who reported more knee injuries. Physical training and combat training were the most common causes of injury for both sexes.Discussion: There were subtle differences in body locations of minor injuries within female and male soldiers. Both minor and more serious injury profiles were otherwise similar between sexes. Therefore, strategies required to minimise injuries in female soldiers may be similar in many respects to strategies required for male soldiers but require some differences to account for the subtle differences in body locations of injury, and so to ensure effectiveness across all personnel.

TI  - A hybrid machine learning technique for feature optimization in object-based classification of debris-covered glaciers
T2  - AIN SHAMS ENGINEERING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Object-based features like spectral, topographic, and textural are supportive to determine debris-covered glacier classes. The original feature space includes relevant and irrelevant features. The inclusion of all these features increases the complexity and renders the classifier's performance. Therefore, feature space optimization is requisite for the classification process. Previous studies have shown a rigorous exercise in manually selecting the best combination of features to define the target class and proven to be a timeconsuming task. The present study proposed a hybrid feature selection technique to automate the selection of the best suitable features. This study aimed to reduce the classifier's complexity and enhance the performance of the classification model. Relief-F and Pearson Correlation filter-based feature selection methods ranked features according to the relevance and filtered out irrelevant or less important features based on the defined condition. Later, the hybrid model selected the common features to get an optimal feature set. The proposed hybrid model was tested on Landsat 8 images of debris-covered glaciers in Central Karakoram Range and validated with present glacier inventories. The results showed that the classification accuracy of the proposed hybrid feature selection model with a Decision Tree classifier is 99.82%, which is better than the classification results obtained using other mapping techniques. In addition, the hybrid feature selection technique has sped up the process of classification by reducing the number of features by 77% without compromising the classification accuracy.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node procedure in patients with recurrent vulvar squamous cell carcinoma: a proposed protocol for a multicentre observational study
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Standard groin treatment in recurrent vulvar cancer consists of uni- or bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL), whereas in the primary setting women with selected unifocal tumours will undergo a sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure. The SLN procedure results in fewer short and long-term sequelae compared to IFL, but some concerns must first be considered. Lymph drainage of the vulvar region can be affected by a previous surgery, which might reduce the number of detectable SLN nodes (feasibility) but increase the chance of encountering aberrant lymph drainage patterns such as bilateral SLNs in lateral tumours or SLNs at unexpected locations. Therefore, the SLN procedure potentially carries a higher risk of groin recurrence if a tumour positive node is not retrieved, but may also improve outcomes for women with aberrant drainage patterns. Since the relative benefits and drawbacks of the SLN procedure are still unclear we will investigate the safety of the SLN procedure in women with a first recurrent vulvar cancer. In a simultaneously started registration study we prospectively gather information on women with a first recurrence of vulvar cancer ineligible for the SLN procedure.Method: In this prospective multicentre observational study all women with a first recurrence of vulvar cancer will be asked to consent to the collection of information on their diagnostics, treatment and outcome, and to complete quality of life and lymph oedema questionnaires. Women with unifocal tumours smaller than 4cm and unsuspicious groin nodes will be offered the SLN procedure, with follow-up every 3 months together with imaging at 6 and 12 months when the SLN is tumour negative. The primary outcome is groin recurrence within 2 years of initial surgery. A total of 150 women with negative SLNs will be required to demonstrate safety, a stopping rule will apply and an extensive statistical analysis has been designed.Discussion: Should the SLN procedure prove feasible and safe in recurrent vulvar cancer, it will be available for implementation in clinics worldwide. The inclusion of women ineligible for the SLN procedure in the current prospective study will help to bridge knowledge gaps and define future research questions.

TI  - Subsidence of the lava flows emitted during the 2012-2013 eruption of Tolbachik (Kamchatka, Russia): Satellite data and thermal model
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We estimated the subsidence rate of the lava flow formed during the 2012-2013 eruption of Tolbachik volcano from satellite radar interferometry with using Sentinel-1 satellite images between 2017 and 2019. The maximum subsidence values were 285 mm/yr in 2017, 249 mm/yr in 2018, and 261 mm/yr in 2019. The subsidence rate increases with the flow thickness. This trend is observed for most of locations except a small area in the vicinity of the active vent where the subsidence is anomalously high. We show that the main observed trend can be well explained by a thermal compaction with a 1D mathematical model that takes into account the latent heat of crystallization, temperature dependences of physical parameters (heat capacity, thermal conductivity, density), temperature dependence of crystal concentration in the melt volume, and the percentage of uncrystallized material (glass or melt), porosity and lava layer formation rate. The much faster subsidence rates observed close to the vent can be explained by contraction of buried lava tubes that is not accounted in the thermal model.

TI  - A heterogeneous double ensemble algorithm for soybean planting area extraction in Google Earth Engine
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soybeans are one of the main crops grown in the United States. It is crucial to grasp the distribution of soybean cultivation areas for ensuring food security, eradicating hunger and adjusting crop structures. However, the traditional method of extracting soybean planting areas drains on manpower and material resources and takes a long time. The emergence of high-resolution images, such as Sentinel-2A(S2A), enables the identification of soybean at the field scale, and these images can be applied on a large scale with the support of cloud computing technology. This work proposes a heterogeneous double ensemble algorithm to extract soybean planting area. The crop type dataset from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and S2A dataset are applied in this study. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) calculated from S2A data are used to improve the classification accuracy. The proposed method consists of the following steps. Firstly, the S2A data is processed according to phenological information and spectra characteristics. Secondly, the texture features obtained by the grayscale matrix are integrated with spectral features. Thirdly, in order to remove useless features and improve the classification efficiency, only important bands are retained for the next step through feature importance analysis. Fourthly, Random Forest (RF), Classification And Regression Tree (CART), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) serve as base classifiers to train the above-mentioned features. Finally, result maps are obtained by "voting" on three classification results. In this study, three research areas, Guthrie in Iowa, Clinton in Indiana, and Cuming in Nebraska are utilized to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Numerical simulations show the increased performance of classification when using these propositions. When compared with the reference methods, the average increase of the overall accuracy obtained by the proposed algorithm is 1.4%, 3.2%, and 1.7% on the Guthrie data, Clinton data, and Cuming data respectively.

TI  - Improving neural network classification of indigenous forest in New Zealand with phenological features
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and up-to-date land cover maps inform and support effective management and policy decisions. Describing phenological changes in spectral response using time-series data may help to distinguish vegetation types, thereby allowing for more specificity within vegetation classification. In this research, we test this by classifying indigenous forest vegetation in New Zealand, using PlanetScope (PS) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellite time-series data. The study was undertaken in a podocarp forest in New Zealand's central north island, which was classified into nine land cover classes. Phenological features, based on S-2 imagery, were extracted, including the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2) and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). Google Earth Engine (GEE) harmonic analysis and TIMESAT double logistic fitting function were used to extract phenological features. Pixel-based classifications were performed using a Neural Network on six different scenarios. The accuracy of the classification scenarios was determined and the importance score for each feature was evaluated. Using only the fused PS and S-2 bands, the land cover in the study area was classified with 90.1% accuracy. Adding phenological features increased the classification accuracy to 93.1%. When combined with VIs, texture features, and a digital terrain model, the addition of phenological features increased the classification accuracy to 96.6%. Including GEE-generated phenological features resulted in better classification accuracies than TIMESAT features. In terms of feature importance evaluation, EVI2- and NDVI-generated phenological features all had high scores; the effectiveness of EVI features could potentially have been limited by the quality of the blue band. The results demonstrate that it is possible to produce a more accurate classification of New Zealand's native vegetation by using phenological features. This method offers important cost-savings as the platforms for phenological analysis are free to use.

TI  - Spatial-aware SAR-optical time-series deep integration for crop phenology tracking
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop phenology information is essential for precision farming and agricultural productivity improve-ment. In recent years, in-situ equipment on crop phenology observation has been boosted, which generates high-quality real-time pictures on capturing vegetation phenological changes. However, due to the limited number of ground sites, it is impossible to measure large-scale crop phenology with local observations. Complementary, the freely available Sentinel satellites with high revisit frequency provide an opportunity to map accurate crop phenology at an unprecedented fine spatial scale. Because of the differences in viewing angle and range, the consistency of crop phenological stages varies between satellite and ground observations. To fill the gap between satellite and ground observations, we developed a spatial-aware scheme to integrate SAR and optical time-series data for accurate crop phenology tracking. To be specific, we propose a new deep learning model called Deep-CroP framework to improve the alignment between satellite and ground observations on crop phenology. The experiment results on selected ground sites demonstrate that the proposed Deep-CroP is able to accurately identify crops phenology and narrow the discrepancies from 30+ days to as high as several days. In addition, we applied the Deep-CroP to large-scale Sentinel time-series to map spatial patterns of phenology at fine resolution imagery on two study areas (i.e., TA1 and TA2). In general, the potential of satellites time-series for ground-level crop phenology observation is verified. Also, the consistency between satellite and PhenoCam observations is expected to be further improved.

TI  - Seasonal Tropospheric Aerosol Classification Using AERONET Spectral Absorption Properties in African Locations
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to diverse aerosol sources and location, complex aerosol composition in Africa makes the regional assessment of its impact on climate limited. The single scattering albedo (SSA), absorption angstrom ngstrom exponent (AAE) and extinction angstrom ngstrom exponent in selected bands from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) level 2.0 dataset are used over ten stations in Africa to classify aerosol type based on seasons from 2000 to 2015. The multi-year AERONET data were investigated to group the sites based on the threshold limit of the aerosol properties and infer dominant aerosol type using Voronoi clustering. The aerosol incursion into the sites is investigated using the NOAA HYSPLIT model at the peak of the seasons. The results show that aerosol type depends on the source region and transportation routes, such as the case of Island stations in the Atlantic close to Sahara, with dominant aerosol type of coarse and fine non-absorbing in the two established seasons. Furthermore, a high percentage of coarse and fine absorbing particles is observed in the northeast, such as Cairo, while a low percentage of coarse with a high percentage of fine absorbing particles is found in the east. In the southern stations, fine and strong absorbing aerosols are observed. The absorption Angstrom Exponent result reveals high values (> 1.5) for the majority of the sites in the north, signifying dust dominance and low values (<= 1.45) for the southern sites signifying fine-mode aerosol with some mixed aerosols at the middle stations. The overlap in each absorption value is resolved through a clustering technique using AAE versus EAE variables. The seasonal classification method adopted provides ways to reduce ambiguity in identifying aerosol type and resolve variable aerosol populations not well represented in the region.

TI  - Clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes of malignant adenomyoepithelioma of the breast: a single institution's experience
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Malignant adenomyoepithelioma of the breast is a rare tumor and most of relevant literature consists of individual case reports. This study objective was designed to evaluate clinicopathological features and treatment outcomes of 15 cases of malignant adenomyoepithelioma at a single institute. Methods A retrospective medical record review was performed for 15 subjects confirmed with malignant adenomyoepithelioma upon postoperative pathological diagnosis at the Asan Medical Center from January 2008 to June 2018. Data regarding age at diagnosis, preoperative biopsy results, operation methods, the status of hormone receptors and HER2, and clinical outcomes were collected. Results All cases were female patients diagnosed at median age of 50 years. Preoperative core needle biopsy results showed that 40% of the cases (6 out of 15) were benign which was in discordance with the final malignant pathology report. Thirteen cases underwent wide excision with or without sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and 2 cases had total mastectomy with SLNB. Five of 11 cases (45.5%) were triple negative. Ten of 15 cases underwent postoperative radiation therapy, 3 cases underwent chemotherapy, and 5 cases underwent endocrine therapy. During median follow-up of 55 months, the 5-year overall survival rate was 87.5% and the 5-year disease free survival rate was 91.7%. Two lung metastases developed. One case showed local recurrence 3 years after surgery and radiotherapy and subsequently developed lung metastasis 1 year late. Another case developed lung metastasis one and a half years after surgery in combination with endocrine therapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusion Preoperative core needle biopsy showed inaccurate results for diagnosing malignant adenomyoepithelioma. Malignant adenomyoepithelioma has a high rate of triple negative subtype but has a relatively good prognosis although there is a risk of local and systemic recurrence.

TI  - Demystifying the evaluation of brands endorsed by religious leaders in the emerging markets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL MARKETING REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose This paper uses social identity theory to investigate the sequential mediating effects of extrinsic religiosity and perceived role of religious leaders in the impact of consumers' intrinsic religiosity on perceived value of brands endorsed by religious leaders. Design/methodology/approach This paper comprises two survey-based studies with urban consumers in two emerging markets, India (N = 303) and Indonesia (N = 150). Findings Intrinsic religiosity has a direct positive effect on extrinsic religiosity, which in turn mediates the effect of intrinsic religiosity on the perceived value of the brands endorsed by religious leaders in both India and Indonesia. However, extrinsic religiosity has a significant positive effect on the perceived value of these brands through the perceived role of religious leaders in India but not in Indonesia. Research limitations/implications Samples for both the studies are drawn from urban consumers in India and Indonesia, which also have large rural populations. Hence, future research may use both urban and rural samples from other countries to replicate our results. Practical implications The study findings may help both local and global brand managers in the emerging markets with religious societies, such as India and Indonesia, to understand how they may use endorsements by religious leaders to manage the differences in the impact of consumers' intrinsic versus extrinsic religiosity on their brand perceptions and evaluations. Originality/value This paper extends social identity theory to the international marketing context by showing that religious consumers in the emerging markets are likely to support the brands endorsed by religious leaders vis-a-vis other national or multinational brands. Thus, religious identification offers a unique sacred worldview and unlimited group membership, unlike other social groups, especially in the highly religious emerging markets.

TI  - Protecting our environment, a motivating outdoor game for proteomics!
T2  - PROTEOMICS
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The global Earth ecosystem faces many intertwined threats, primarily anthropogenic pollution, drastic reduction of wild spaces, faster spread of pathogens, and global climate warming. Ecotoxicology, the integration of toxicology and ecology, aims to describe the effects of toxicants on organisms, whether at the level of the population, the community, the ecosystem, or the biosphere. Sentinel species are employed to assess threats to life, giving advance warning of danger. In this issue of Proteomics, Wilde and collaborators (Proteomics 2022, 22, ) present a comprehensive coverage of the proteome of the crustacean Daphnia magna, a species used to evaluate aquatic pollution. This study illustrates how current shotgun proteomics technology allows straightforward quantitation of any protein for whole animals or dissected organs, making global molecular phenotyping a reality for animals. Tandem mass spectrometry operated in data-independent acquisition can be used to compare the response of sentinels to various environmental conditions. The current low number of well-annotated animal or plant genomes, the high diversity of genetic backgrounds of each species, and the paucity of knowledge about protein functions for most of the relevant sentinels pose huge challenges for data interpretation. As a result, ecology and ecotoxicology today constitute an exceptional field for proteomics.

T2  - APPLIED CATALYSIS B-ENVIRONMENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the effect of oxalate and borohydride ligands functionalization on the properties and activity of zeolite Y (ZY) supported copper nanoparticles in CO2 hydrogenation to specialty chemicals. The ZY-supported copper oxalate (CuX-ZY) and copper borohydride (CuB-ZY) catalysts exhibited a drastic difference in physicochemical properties compared to a benchmark copper supported on ZY (Cu-ZY) catalyst without any functionalization. The average Cu particle sizes are 7.74, 0.69, and 0.57 nm for Cu-ZY, CuX-ZY, and CuB-ZY, respectively. The smaller the copper oxide particle sizes, the higher the reduction temperatures to the metallic state due to strong-metal-support-interactions. The CO2 conversions (XCO2) at 270 degrees C are 28.3%, 26.4%, and 14.6%, for CuX-ZY, CuB-ZY, and Cu-ZY which aligns with the trend of basic site-strength, Cu particle sizes, and Cu dispersion of the catalysts. While methanol yield was maximum at 70.5 g(product) g(cat)(-1)center dot min(-1) over CuX-ZY, the dimethyl ether was maximum at 48.9 g(product) g(cat)(-1)center dot min(-1) over CuB-ZY. Furthermore, the oxalate and borohydride functionalization were effective in minimizing CO formation.

TI  - Characterisation of <i>Yersinia enterocolitica</i> strains isolated from wildlife in the northwestern Italian Alps
T2  - JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Yersiniosis is a zoonosis causing gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, and occasionally reactive arthritis and septicaemia. Cases are often linked to meat consumption and the most common aetiological agent is the Gram-negative bacilliform Yersinia enterocolitica bacterium. The occurrence of Yersinia spp. among wild animals has mostly been studied in wild boar, but it has seldom been in other species. Material and Methods A total of 1,868 faecal samples from animals found dead or hunted were collected between 2015 and 2018 in the Valle d'Aosta region of the northwestern Italian Alps. Alpine ibex faecal samples were collected during a health monitoring program in 2018. Bacteria were isolated via PCR and confirmed as Y. enterocolitica biochemically. Strain antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion, and the presence of virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance genes was investigated using whole-genome sequencing. Results Yersinia enterocolitica strains of biotype 1A were detected in six faecal samples from red deer (0.93%), roe deer (0.49%) and red foxes (0.7%). Strains found in beech martens (3.57%) and Alpine ibex (2.77%) belonged to biotypes 1B and 5, respectively and harboured the pYPTS01 plasmid that had only been detected in Y. pseudotuberculosis PB1/+. All the isolates were resistant to ampicillin and erythromycin. Conclusion The biovar 1A strains exhibited different virulence factors and behaved like non-pathogenic commensals. The strain from an Alpine ibex also harboured the self-transmissible pYE854 plasmid that can mobilise itself and the pYPTS01 plasmid to other strains. The beech marten could be considered a sentinel animal for Y. enterocolitica. Phenotypic resistance may account for the ability of all the strains to resist beta-lactams.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The objective of this study is to examine the association between neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) and receipt of low-value breast cancer procedures.Methods: Patients with breast cancer diagnosed between 2010 and 2016 were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. Low value procedures included: (1) axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for patients with limited nodal disease receiving breast conservation therapy (BCT); (2) contralateral prophylactic mastectomies (CPM); and (3) sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB) in patients >= 70 years old with clinically node negative early-stage hormonepositive breast cancer. The cohort was divided by nSES. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis compared the groups.Results: The study included 412 959 patients. Compared to patients in high nSES areas, residing in neighborhoods with low nSES (odd ratio [OR] 2.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0-2.42) and middle nSES (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.20-1.56) was associated with a higher probability of undergoing low value ALND. Conversely, patients in low SES neighborhoods were less likely to receive low value SLNB (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.85-0.94) or CPM than (low nSES OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.73-0.77); middle nSES OR 0.91 (0.89-0.92) those in high SES neighborhoods.Conclusion: In the SEER Program, low nSES was associated with a lower probability of low value procedures except for ALND utilization.

TI  - False-negative rate in the extended prospective TATTOO trial evaluating targeted axillary dissection by carbon tattooing in clinically node-positive breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose In clinically node-positive breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST), nodal metastases can be initially marked and then removed during surgical axillary staging. Marking methods vary significantly in terms of feasibility and cost. The purpose of the extended TATTOO trial was to report on the false-negative rate (FNR) of the low-cost method carbon tattooing. Methods The international prospective single-arm TATTOO trial included clinically node-positive breast cancer patients planned for NST from November 2017 to January 2021. For the present analysis, patients who received both the targeted procedure with or without an additional sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy and a completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) were selected. Primary endpoint was the FNR. Results Out of 172 included patients, 149 had undergone a completion ALND. The detection rate for the tattooed node was 94.6% (141 out of 149). SLN biopsy was attempted in 132 out of 149 patients with a detection rate of 91.7% (121 out of 132). SLN and tattooed node were identical in 58 out of 121 individuals (47.9%). The combined procedure, i.e. targeted axillary dissection (TAD) was successful in 147 of 149 cases (98.7%). Four out of 65 patients with a clinically node-negative status after NST had a negative TAD but metastases on ALND, corresponding to a FNR of 6.2%. All false-negative TAD procedures were performed in the first 2 years of the trial (2018-2019, p = 0.022). Conclusion Carbon tattooing is a feasible marking method for TAD with a high detection rate and an acceptably low FNR. The TATTOO trial was preregistered as prospective trial before initiation at the University of Rostock, Germany (DRKS00013169).

TI  - The accuracy of multisource evapotranspiration products and their applicability in streamflow simulation over a large catchment of Southern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: Xiang River Basin, Southern China. Study focus: Multisource ET products, namely MOD16, GLEAM and GLDAS, are evaluated for their accuracy. Furthermore, to investigate the applicability of multisource ET products in streamflow simulation, the SWAT model is calibrated with three strategies: calibration using streamflow observations (Strategy I), calibration using multisource ET (Strategy II) and calibration by incorporating them (Strategy III). Moreover, the impact of using multisource ET products at subbasin level on streamflow simulation is also investigated. New hydrological insights for the region: GLEAM tends to have the least relative uncertainty in the basin and perform the best in the comparison with CR-ET and water-balance derived ET as benchmark. Overall, Multisource ET products are alternative variables for streamflow simulation in this basin. The NSE of the simulated streamflow can reach 0.73, 0.70, 0.68 in the validation period based on calibration Strategy II with MOD16, GLEAM and GLDAS, respectively, which are slightly poorer than that based on Strategy I but still good. And the collocation of streamflow observations and GLEAM performs relatively better in Strategy III according to the three selected evaluation indices (NSE, BIAS and KGE). It should be noted that when taking the spatial information of ET products into parameter calibration, the differences of the streamflow simulation performances in the calibration and validation periods can be effectively reduced, indicating its robust performance.

TI  - Deep Species Distribution Modeling From Sentinel-2 Image Time-Series: A Global Scale Analysis on the Orchid Family
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used numerical tools that rely on correlations between geolocated presences (and possibly absences) and environmental predictors to model the ecological preferences of species. Recently, SDMs exploiting deep learning and remote sensing images have emerged and have demonstrated high predictive performance. In particular, it has been shown that one of the key advantages of these models (called deep-SDMs) is their ability to capture the spatial structure of the landscape, unlike prior models. In this paper, we examine whether the temporal dimension of remote sensing images can also be exploited by deep-SDMs. Indeed, satellites such as Sentinel-2 are now providing data with a high temporal revisit, and it is likely that the resulting time-series of images contain relevant information about the seasonal variations of the environment and vegetation. To confirm this hypothesis, we built a substantial and original dataset (called DeepOrchidSeries) aimed at modeling the distribution of orchids on a global scale based on Sentinel-2 image time series. It includes around 1 million occurrences of orchids worldwide, each being paired with a 12-month-long time series of high-resolution images (640 x 640 m RGB+IR patches centered on the geolocated observations). This ambitious dataset enabled us to train several deep-SDMs based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) whose input was extended to include the temporal dimension. To quantify the contribution of the temporal dimension, we designed a novel interpretability methodology based on temporal permutation tests, temporal sampling, and temporal averaging. We show that the predictive performance of the model is greatly increased by the seasonality information contained in the temporal series. In particular, occurrence-poor species and diversity-rich regions are the ones that benefit the most from this improvement, revealing the importance of habitat's temporal dynamics to characterize species distribution.

T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the vast potential for space-based technologies and applications in supporting governance to strengthen civil society, bolster democratic processes, and allow for socio-economic development throughout Africa. It offers a comprehensive analysis of African governance levels, existing e-governance systems, African challenges relating to e-governance adoption, and how e-governance solutions can assist in realising the continent's development goals. First, the study explores the integral role of good governance in achieving the UN Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the AU's Agenda 2063 aspirations. Subsequently, the existing African governance structures established at a continental level are described to provide an overview of the frameworks informing governance within Africa. Specific challenges that need to be overcome to ensure good governance are then addressed and the current governance levels in Africa are evaluated. An assessment of e-government readiness levels both globally and within Africa is offered through an examination of the United Nations E-Government Survey from 2018. Specific barriers to e-government, both abroad and within Africa, are then analysed along with the associated risks relating to e-government systems. It then investigates how digital divides and lack of internet connectivity within Africa can be addressed by new technologies and commitments from both terrestrial and space actors. The opportunities afforded by rapidly growing satellite constellations being deployed to increase connectivity levels and reduce the costs thereof are then analysed in detail and the various planned constellations are assessed on a technical level. Lastly, the potential for Earth Observation and remote sensing data to assist with e-governance activities across sectors including healthcare, education, agriculture, water and sanitation, and emergency responses is investigated.

TI  - Deriving potential evapotranspiration from satellite-based reference evapotranspiration, Upper Tekeze Basin, Northern Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: Zamra catchment, Upper Tekeze Basin, Northern Ethiopia. Study focus: Direct field estimates of potential evapotranspiration (PET) remain a challenge, because they are expensive and have limited spatial representativeness. An alternative is to derive PET by remote sensing as a product of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and land use-land cover (LULC) factor (Kc). The aims of this study were to: i) validate satellite-derived Daily Reference Evapotranspiration (DMETREF-ETos); ii) correct the advection-bias of DMETREF-ETos as compared to in-situ FAO Penman-Monteith ETo (FAO-ETog); and iii) convert the bias-corrected DMETREF-ETos into PET. Four ATMOS 41 weather stations were installed and 1-year daily data was used to validate the DMETREF-ETos. The wet season actual evapotranspiration from FAO Water Productivity Open-access portal (WaPOR) was used to validate PET. New hydrological insights for the region: Evaluation of DMETREF-ETos showed large underestimation biases when compared to FAO-ETog derived from in-situ weather stations, particularly in warm conditions, due to unaccounted advection-bias. The bias correction was performed as a function of near-surface air temperature obtained from ERA5-Land, merged with in-situ air temperature; the results showed substantial improvement of ETo. Finally, the daily PET was estimated by multiplying the corrected DMETREF-ETos by a spatio-temporally variable Kc, defined as linearly dependent on the NDVI obtained from Sentinel 2. This study emphasized substantial difference between ETo and PET, implying that the ETo cannot substitute PET, which in many hydrological studies is still a common practice.

TI  - Interannual variability of spring fire in southern Nepal
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nepal is highly vulnerable to climate change with increased fire occurrences and fire burned areas in recent years; therefore, we accessed the climatic drivers for its variability using fire burned areas product of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2001 and 2020. The peak fire burned areas were observed in the spring season (similar to 91%) from March to May, especially higher in the lowlands of the western and central parts. At the inter-annual timescale, low precipitation, humidity, soil moisture, and high temperature supported the existence of spring fire. Combining these factors induces drought conditions, enhancing evapotranspiration from vegetation and providing more combustible fuels. Furthermore, the El Nino phase in the central-eastern Pacific Ocean is related to the weakened westerly moisture transport and moisture divergence that creates dry and warm conditions leading to increased fire activities. Thus, this study could be helpful for preparedness, management, and policy-making to limit the multi-dimensional losses in the ecosystem and society due to fire.

T2  - ACS APPLIED NANO MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing highly sensitive and stable surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) probe systems is an actively pursued goal in sensors and diagnostics. In this study, we present silica-coated core-satellite (CS@SiO2) plasmonic nanoparticle assembly structures that potentially realize this goal. We assemble different-sized gold nanoparticles into core-satellite (CS) configurations using dithiol molecular linkers that also serve as SERS labels. Multiple hot spots in the CS structure and narrow nanogaps in each hot spot produce a significantly enhanced Raman scattering signal with an enhancement factor of similar to 8 x 10(7). Various types of molecules can be inserted into the nanogaps using the mixed self-assembled monolayers with alkanedithiol, enabling multiplex detection. Silica encapsulation of the CS nanoassemblies stabilizes the particles and makes it easy to modify the surface to attach antibodies or DNAs. Many properties of the CS@SiO2, including a wide range of optical resonances, scalability using multiple glass slides, long-term stability in ethanol, and single-particle-level sensitivity, make the material an ideal SERS probe for sensitive and multiplexed detection of diseases and viruses.

TI  - Predictive Mapping of Low-Density Juniper Stands in Prairie Landscapes of the Northern Great Plains
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Expanding distributions of native juniper species have had significant ecological and economic impacts on prairie ecosystems of the Great Plains. Juniper encroachment reduces rangeland production by decreasing herbaceous biomass and affecting natural ecosystem functions as it alters other native plant communities, microclimates, and soils. Juniper distribution maps are needed to support proactive management, but they often underestimate the extent of low-density juniper stands. Our objectives were to extend a previous juniper mapping study by 1) fitting a predictive ecological model for low-density (< 15% fractional cover) juniper stands and assessing the classification accuracy, 2) determining the habitat variables that had the strongest associations with low-density juniper, and 3) applying the model to map low-density juniper stands, where proactive management has the greatest potential for stopping further juniper encroachment. The study area included counties bordering the Missouri River in southeastern South Dakota and northeastern Nebraska covering approximately 23 00 0 km(2). Environmental predictors included seed source distance and density, as well as topography, climate, soils, and land use variables. Areas of low-density juniper were identified by visual interpretation of sample plots from digital aerial photography. We used a machine-learning approach to classify low-density juniper with the random forests algorithm. Model accuracy was high with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.884. Variables related to seed sources were the most important predictors, and precipitation, slope angle, and the local intensity of human land use also had substantial influences. A previous map based on Landsat imagery identified 209 968 acres (84 971 ha) as juniper with in the study area, and this study found an additional 430 648 acres (174 277 ha) classified as low-density juniper stands. These results can provide agencies and land managers with more accurate information about the distribution of juniper, and the underlying techniques can be extended to map woody plant encroachment in other areas.

TI  - Serra do Divisor National Park: a protected area under threat in the south-western Brazilian Amazon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas have numerous roles (such as biodiversity preservation, the development of scientific research and the sustainable use of natural resources), but they are under threat from political and economic forces. The 837 000-ha Serra do Divisor National Park (SDNP) in the south-western Brazilian Amazon combines the conservation of natural resources and the maintenance of the productive activities of c. 400 resident families. The Brazilian and Peruvian governments have proposed a road linking Acre (Brazil) to Ucayali (Peru) that would bisect the SDNP. Another threat to the SDNP is a bill proposing its downgrading to an 'environmental protection area'. This study aims to map the land cover of the SDNP and its surroundings from 1988 to 2018 and to analyse the dynamics of land-use change. Analysis of Landsat satellite images with supervised classification using the MaxVer algorithm show that, during the 30-year period, pasture showed the highest absolute land-cover gain, with 1986 ha in the interior and 7661 ha along the periphery of the SDNP. Only 1% of the park's primary forest was lost by 2018, but the proposed road and potential downgrading may result in accelerated deforestation and forest degradation in the near future.

TI  - An unmixing-based spatial downscaling fusion approach for the MODIS evapotranspiration product
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer global evapotranspiration product (MOD16 ET) has been successfully applied to mesoscale evapotranspiration (ET) monitoring, its coarse spatial resolution (500-m) cannot meet the needs of locally scaled water management and environmental change research. Based on the correlation between surface ET differences and corresponding land cover types, and spectral mixture analysis theory, we propose an unmixing-based spatial downscaling approach for the MOD16 ET (500-m) product to obtain temporally continuous high spatial resolution 16-m ET data corresponding to the spatial resolution of the Chinese GaoFen Satellite No. 1 Wide Field-of-View camera (GF-1 WFV) images. Three different landscape areas in China are selected for an experimental study. The experimental results indicate that the downscaled 16-m ET has higher spatial details in spatiotemporal patterns than the MOD16 ET (500-m) product. The MOD16 ET product's assessment of agreement indicates that the downscaled ET has high correlation and less error with the MOD16 ET product. The assessment of agreement with 29 in situ ET measurements shows that the downscaled ET has high correlation and less error with in situ ET measurements. Our downscaling method is reliable and applicable in downscaling MOD16 ET product to meet the needs of local-scale water management and environmental change research.

TI  - Urban heat island dynamics in response to land use land cover change: a case of Jimma city, southwestern Ethiopia
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper attempts to investigate the urban heat islands (UHIs) effect driven by land use land cover (LULC) change over Jimma city in southwestern parts of Ethiopia. Land surface temperature (LST) estimation at city level is essential for examining UHI effect on residents. In the present study, LULC, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) were extracted from Landsat 7 ETM + (2000) and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (2020) using geospatial technologies. This research evaluates the trends of UHI in response to LULC dynamics. Results show that the spatiotemporal coverage of vegetation has slightly declined from 12.3% in 2000 to 10.8% in 2020. Results confirmed that there is a negative relationship between vegetation coverage and mean LST. The mean LST in the city ranges between 24.5 and 26.3 degrees C in 2000 and 2020, respectively. Maximum UHI increased from 32.5 degrees C in 2000 to 34.7 degrees C in the year 2020. Maximum LST in the city is observed around built-up areas and bare land, whereas minimum temperature was recorded around vegetative and open space areas. The results of this research will be helpful for urban managers to consider the importance of urban green areas and open space in minimizing the potential impacts of UHI on city residents in the study area and beyond.

TI  - Factors influencing peri-urban growth: Empirical evidence from the Dhaka and Brisbane regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Albeit, urban encroachment to peri-urban areas is a global phenomenon, dimensions of such periurban growth vary depending on the context. There little evidence exists in the literature on the main factors effecting such variation. This study aims to explore the main factors influencing periurban growth in developing and developed country contexts. The paper investigates the influencing factors from the following four distinctive lenses: (a) Physical growth; (b) Socioeconomic status; (c) Climate change impacts; and; (d) Policy and governance. The methodological steps of the investigation include demarcating peri-urban boundaries with night-time light data, and conducting change analysis with Landsat data. By taking the Dhaka Metropolitan Development Plan area (Bangladesh) and Brisbane and its adjoining local government areas (Australia) as comparative cases, this study explores physical growth patterns in a 30-year period (between 1989 and 2019), along with implications of government policies in regulating these changes. The findings disclose that unique socioeconomic settings of a country exert significant influence on urban growth policy formulation and enforcement. This, in turn, responds to peri-urban growth differently between developing and developed countries. The insights generated from this comparative study informs policymaking, planning and monitoring circles in developing and developed country contexts.

TI  - Assessing the inundation dynamics and its impacts on habitat suitability in Poyang Lake based on integrating Landsat and MODIS observations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, serves critical ecosystem function for water regulation and biodiversity conservation. However, it experienced dramatic changes in lake inundation due to recent climate change and human activities, causing ecological and economic problems. Here, we applied a multiple-index water detection rule to integrated Landsat and MODIS products to reconstruct surface water series at 30-m and 8-day resolutions and quantified the spatiotemporal inundation dynamics in Poyang Lake over the past 20 years (2000-2019). Furthermore, their influences on habitat suitability for herbivorous birds were also assessed from the perspectives of hydroperiod and vegetation growth threshold. The significant declining trend (-26.66 km(2) yr(-1), p < 0.001) for the annual minimum water areas throughout the 20 years implied that Poyang Lake was undergoing a continuous shrinkage in the low-water season. On the monthly scale, inundation frequency (IF) decreases were more significant in September-January, most of which occurred in the alluvial delta zones near the lake center. The altered water regime after the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) might be the dominant contributor responsible for the continuous lake shrinkage during the recent low-water period. The sub-lakes suffered from spring drought rather than winter drought, triggering vegetation successions regarding the reversed trend of the well-documented xerophilization in Poyang Lake. The recent earlier and prolonged dry seasons caused an increase of suitable habitat for herbivorous birds (13.92 km(2) year(-1), p < 0.1), but triggered a potential risk of food quality degradation when the migratory waterbirds peaked in December. These results provide a clear reference for optimizing the hydrologic management and biodiversity conservation of Poyang Lake.

M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) is a major cash crop in India that needs to be monitored cautiously as it contributes significantly to the national exchequer and provides employment to over a million people mainly through sugar and renewable bioenergy production. The objective of this study is to predict the regional sugarcane crop yield for the Uttar Pradesh (UP) province using analysis-ready moderate-resolution satellite images. The four machine learning regression algorithms, namely support vector regression (SVR), gradient boosting regression (GBR), eXtreme gradient boosting regression (XGB), and random forest regression (RF), were used to train and predict the district-wise sugarcane yield in UP. Standard MODIS data products such as leaf area index (LAI), fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), evapotranspiration (ET), potential evapotranspiration (PET), latent heat flux (LE), and gross primary product (GPP) were obtained for a period of eighteen years, and their monthly average was extracted and used as features in the model. The models were trained using eighty percent of the observations with the annual district-wise sugarcane yield as the response variable. Iterative feature selection was done based on correlation factor and feature importance to reduce the dimensionality of the data from around a hundred features to twenty-four. The R-2 metric was used as the evaluation metric to choose the best predictive model. The study showed results with moderate accuracy and was used to estimate the sugarcane crop yield for the year 2019. The highest R-2 of 0.66 and an RMSE value of 7.15 t/ha were obtained using the GBR algorithm by using seven variables and 24 features. The model was very closely followed by the XGB model with an R-2 of 0.65 and an RMSE value of 7.20 t/ha. The FPAR-based features contributed the most to the model followed by the LAI and NDVI features. The simple methodology used in the study uses ready-to-use satellite products and has operationalization potential. The model can be improved by incorporating more satellite-derived parameters and an accurate crop mask to avoid spectral interference from other cropland.

TI  - A reappraisal of active tectonics along the Fethiye<i>-</i>Burdur trend, southwestern Turkey
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate active tectonics in southwestern Turkey along the trend between Fethiye, near the eastern end of the Hellenic subduction zone, and Burdur, on the Anatolian plateau. Previously, regional GNSS velocities have been used to propose either (1) a NE-trending zone of strike-slip faulting coined the Fethiye-Burdur Fault Zone, or (2) a mix of uniaxial and radial extension accommodated by normal faults with diverse orientations. We test these models against the available earthquake data, updated in light of recent earthquakes at Aricilar (24 November 2017, M-w 5.3), Acipayam (20 March 2019, M-w 5.6) and Bozkurt (8 August 2019, M-w 5.9), the largest in this region in the last two decades. Using Sentinel-1 InSAR and seismic waveforms and arrival times, we show that the Aricilar, Acipayam and Bozkurt earthquakes were partially or fully buried ruptures on pure normal faults with subtle or indistinct topographic expressions. By exploiting ray paths shared with these well-recorded modern events, we relocate earlier instrumental seismicity throughout southwestern Turkey and incorporate these improved hypocentres in an updated focal mechanism compilation. The southwestern Fethiye-Burdur trend is dominated by ESE-WNW trending normal faulting, even though most faults evident in the topography strike NE-SW. This hints at a recent change in regional strain, perhaps related to eastward propagation of the Gokova graben into the area or to rapid subsidence of the Rhodes basin. The northeastern Fethiye-Burdur trend is characterized by orthogonal normal faulting, consistent with radial extension and likely responsible for the distinct physiography of Turkey's Lake District. We find that the 1971 M-w 6.0 Burdur earthquake likely ruptured a NW-dipping normal fault in an area of indistinct geomorphology near Salda Lake, contradicting earlier studies that place it on well-expressed faults bounding the Burdur basin, and further highlighting how damaging earthquakes are possible on faults that would prove difficult to identify beforehand. Overall, our results support GNSS-derived kinematic models that depict a mix of uniaxial and radial extension throughout southwestern Turkey, with no evidence from focal mechanisms for major, active strike-slip faults anywhere along the Fethiye-Burdur trend. Normal faulting orientations are consistent with a stress field driven primarily by contrasts in gravitational potential energy between the elevated Anatolian plateau and the low-lying Rhodes and Antalya basins.

TI  - New insights into tuft cell formation: Implications for structure-function relationships
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CELL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tuft cells are sentinel chemosensory cells that monitor the lumen of hollow organs for noxious or infectious stimuli and respond with disease- and tissue-specific effectors. The discovery of critical tuft cell functions in intestinal type 2 immune responses and airway defense has sparked interest in the formation and function of this architecturally unique cell type. Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics and computational biology allow for new insights into the genetics and environmental cues underlying tuft cell formation and maturation. Here, we summarize the most recent research on tuft cell development and function in various disease states and organ systems.

TI  - Household composition after resettlement and emotional health in adolescent migrants
T2  - JOURNAL OF MIGRATION AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Migration during adolescence constitutes an important stressor that particularly impacts unaccompanied minors (UAM). Adolescent UAM in the United States (U.S.) are relatively understudied, especially regarding their resilience and emotional well-being after resettlement. Small school-based studies have documented the mental health status of UAM who resettled reuniting with their parents. However, many do not resettle with parents and less is known about the degree to which post-resettlement household composition impacts resilience and emotional well-being.Methods: Our goal was to examine how migration characteristics, supports, resilience, and emotional well-being vary by UAM resettlement household composition (reunification with parents, reunification with a nonparental family member, or living in a household not containing any family members). Using a mixed-methods (quantitative-qualitative) cross-sectional approach, we assessed 46 Latin American adolescent UAM to the U.S. who resettled into these three household types.Results: Youth experienced support differently by household type, influencing their strategies for adapting and coping post-resettlement, impacting their resilience (Kruskal Wallis-H 4.8; p<0.09) and emotional well-being (Kruskal Wallis 5.3; p<0.07). Youth living in households without relatives (n = 9) had lower resilience (Fisher's exact test p<0.002) and positive affect (Fisher's exact test p<0.003) and needed to expend greater efforts to mobilize social supports than youth living with parents (n = 22) or with non-parental family members (n = 15).Conclusion: The needs and coping abilities of UAM migrants vary with the composition of their immediate receiving environment, their post-resettlement household. Understanding differences associated with these household characteristics can guide interventions to maximize emotional health and resilience.

TI  - Evaluating Mesquite Distribution Using Unpiloted Aerial Vehicles and Satellite Imagery
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Encroachment of woody plant species on rangelands is of critical concern for rangeland health and function. Recent advances in unpiloted aerial vehicles (UAVs) technology have opened new opportunities for natural resource personnel to quantify features within the landscape. Our goal was to combine information derived from UAV and Sentinel-2 imagery to quantify the presence and spatial distribution of mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). The specific objectives were to 1) evaluate the accuracy of UAVs to estimate mesquite height and 2) classify mesquite using a combination of height metrics and spectral information by combining UAV and Sentinel-2 remote sensing data. We conducted our study in three different ecoregions in Texas. We collected on-site tree height field measurements and created two UAV-derived height outputs at 50 m and 100 m above ground level (AGL). We then used a random forest classification with data derived from the UAV to inform Sentinel-2 imagery of mesquite locations to assess its presence at the landscape level. Linear regression analysis showed that 50-m AGL mesquite height estimates from UAV explained 95% of the variability. Variability explained from 100 m AGL height estimates was slightly lower at 92%. Accuracy assessments from using UAV training data to predict mesquite presence using Sentinel-2 imagery yielded overall accuracy of > 80% for all sites, user accuracies up to 86%, and producer accuracies up to 92%. UAV-derived heights of mesquite were reliable. UAV imagery can be used as training data for Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to assess mesquite presence on Texas rangelands. Being able to combine the high spatial resolution of the UAV imagery with the high temporal resolution of the Sentinel-2 satellite imagery could improve our ability to use UAVs to monitor rangelands.

TI  - Estimation of turbulent fluxes over almond orchards using high-resolution aerial imagery with one and two-source energy balance models
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of actual crop evapotranspiration (ETc) using high-resolution aerial remote sensing data is important to detect water stress, map, and manage water resources in precision agriculture. High-resolution ETc can be estimated using land surface energy balance models and remotely sensed land surface temperatures (LST) obtained using manned or unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with thermal cameras. In this study, three remote sensing ETc models were compared, i.e., Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model, Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), and Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) models. Thermal images were obtained using an airplane flying daily over almond orchards in California during the 2020 growing season. The LST images were obtained at 0.5 m spatial resolution. Model comparisons indicated that all three models produced latent heat fluxes and net radiation estimates that agreed with eddy covariance measurements in the order of TSEB (R-2 of 0.89 for LE and 0.88 for R-n), METRIC (R-2 of 0.81 for LE and 0.86 for R-n), and SEBAL (R-2 of 0.81 for LE and 0.83 for R-n). However, METRIC and SEBAL overestimated the latent heat fluxes while underestimating the sensible heat fluxes as compared to the two-source model (TSEB). The root mean square error (RMSE) of the instantaneous latent and sensible heat fluxes were less than 38 W m(-2) for TSEB, and were within 58 W m(-2) for METRIC and SEBAL models. The TSEB model's good performance can be attributed to its partitioning of surface temperature between soil, crop cover in the inter rows, and almond tree canopies. Overall, the results suggest that both one and two-source surface energy models originally developed for satellite imagery are able to estimate instantaneous turbulent fluxes and spatial variability in ETc using high-resolution imagery. In addition, systematic variations in LST due to variable rate irrigation scheduling as depicted in the high spatial resolution imagery provided confidence in the spatially distributed latent heat flux maps estimated by the energy balance models. This study shows that high-resolution aerial imagery combined with energy balance models originally developed for satellite remote sensing can be used to accurately estimate site specific ETc that is critical to achieving precision irrigation management in almond orchards and other crops.

TI  - Genetic characteristics and pathogenicity of the first bluetongue virus serotype 20 strain isolated in China
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Bluetongue virus (BTV), a member of the genus Orbivirus in the family Reoviridae, is transmitted by biting midges and causes severe disease in domestic and wild ruminants. In the present study, a BTV strain, BTV-20/GX015/China/2013 (GX015), was isolated from sentinel cattle in Guangxi, China. Virus neutralization tests and phylogenetic analyses based on genomic segments 2 (S2) and 6 (S6) indicated that GX015 belongs to BTV serotype 20 (BTV-20) and represents a new topotype within BTV-20 strains, which makes GX015 the first BTV-20 strain isolated in China. Genomic analyses suggested that the 10 genomic segments of GX015 originated from a reassortment event, in which S2 and S6 are derived from exotic BTV-20 strains (South Africa or Australia), whereas the remaining eight genomic segments are apparently of Chinese origin and most likely share the same ancestor with a Taiwanese BTV-12 strain. Importantly, we evaluated the infectivity and pathogenicity of the BTV-20 strain in mice lacking the interferon receptor (IFNAR(-/-) mice, a good animal model for studying the pathogenesis, virulence and transmission of BTVs) and sheep for the first time, and found that GX015 causes severe disease and death in IFNAR(-/-) mice and clinical signs and viraemia in the natural host sheep. These results improve our understanding of the genetic characteristics, diversity and pathogenicity of BTVs, which is important for developing diagnostic methods and vaccines for the surveillance and prevention of bluetongue disease.

TI  - Ascertaining glacier dynamics and geodetic mass changes in the Pangong Region of Trans-Himalayan Ladakh using remote sensing data
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Glaciers in the Himalayan arc are receding rapidly in the eastern and western parts as compared to other regions. Contrararily, the glaciers in the Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh are comparatively stable. The differential retreat could be due to various climatic, topographic, and geologic influences. The use of multi-source remotely sensed imagery from open-source platforms and the GlabTop model has been discussed in this paper. This paper draws insights from a recently published paper which details the recession of 87 glaciers in the Trans Himalayan region of Ladakh using remote sensing data [1] . The use of remote sensing data from USGS and Planet Labs for assessing glacier area changes, frontal retreat, debris cover, topographic characteristics, and comparison with existing inventories has been discussed in this study. The geodetic mass changes have been assessed using SRTM and TanDEM-X of 20 0 0 and 2012 respectively. The use of remotely sensed data discussed in this article will help glaciologists to better characterize and understand the glacier recession in the region. The GlabTop model has been used to simulate proglacial lake expansion to understand glacier-bed overdeepenings of four glaciers in the region. The GlabTop simulations will help disaster managers to better quantify the vulnerability and risk of downstream population and infrastructure to Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs).

TI  - Factors influencing transferability in species distribution models
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) provide insights into species' ecology and distributions and are frequently used to guide conservation priorities. However, many uses of SDMs require model transferability, which refers to the degree to which a model built in one place or time can successfully predict distributions in a different place or time. If a species' model has high spatial transferability, the relationship between abundance and predictor variables should be consistent across a geographical distribution. We used Breeding Bird Surveys, climate and remote sensing data, and a novel method for quantifying model transferability to test whether SDMs can be transferred across the geographic ranges of 129 species of North American birds. We also assessed whether species' traits are correlated with model transferability. We expected that prediction accuracy between modeled regions should decrease with 1) geographical distance, 2) degree of extrapolation and 3) the distance from the core of a species' range. Our results suggest that very few species have a high model transferability index (MTI). Species with large distributions, with distributions located in areas with low topographic relief, and with short lifespans are more likely to exhibit low transferability. Transferability between modeled regions also decreased with geographical distance and degree of extrapolation. We expect that low transferability in SDMs potentially resulted from both ecological non-stationarity (i.e. biological differences within a species across its range) and over-extrapolation. Accounting for non-stationarity and extrapolation should substantially increase the prediction success of species distribution models, therefore enhancing the success of conservation efforts.

TI  - Contemporary Axillary Management in cT1-2N0 Breast Cancer with One or Two Positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes: Factors Associated with Completion Axillary Lymph Node Dissection Within the National Cancer Database
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Management of the axilla in patients with cT1-2N0 breast cancer with one or two positive (+) sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) is often debated, especially in patients undergoing mastectomy. In 2018, the National Cancer Database (NCDB) began collecting the number of +SLNs, enabling identification of patients with one or two +SLNs for the first time. Methods From the 2018 NCDB participant user file (PUF), all cT1-2N0M0 patients with one or two +SLNs were identified. The rates of completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and mastectomy were determined, and logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with cALND. Results Of 10,531 patients with one or two +SLNs, cALND was performed in 807/6498 (12.4%) BCS patients and 1845/4033 (45.7%) mastectomy patients (p < 0.001). Factors associated with cALND in BCS were cT2 versus cT1 (16.0% versus 11.1%, p < 0.001), two versus one positive SLN (20.7% versus 10.8%, p < 0.001), and higher tumor grade (grade 3: 15.4% versus grade 1-2: 11.7%, p = 0.002). Factors associated with cALND among mastectomy were cT2 versus cT1 (48.2% versus 43.7%, p = 0.004), two versus one positive SLN (56.6% versus 42.8%, p < 0.001), younger age (age < 50 years: 49.0%, age 50+ years: 44.1%, p = 0.004), and Hispanic ethnicity (55.7% versus 45.1%, p = 0.001). After adjusting for pN category, adjuvant radiation was significantly less likely after mastectomy if cALND was performed (odds ratio (OR) 0.51, p < 0.001). Conclusions Omission of cALND with one or two +SLNs in BCS is common. Deescalation of axillary therapy in mastectomy is slower, with a cALND rate of 45.7% in 2018. With the recent updates to the National Cancer Care Network (NCCN) guidelines, we anticipate continued deescalation of axillary therapy in mastectomy patients.

TI  - Coastal landform changes on the east coast of Sri Lanka using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal landforms are constantly changed due to both natural and anthropogenic forces. An attempt is made to analyze short-term coastal landform changes on the east coast of Sri Lanka using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. Such landform changes can be classified as either negative (e.g. erosion) or positive (e.g. accretion) impacts. Surface reflectance images of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/ TIRS) were analyzed for extracting spatial and temporal changes, based on cross-shore profile analysis and geomorphic change detection. In this study, we developed a novel script model builtin ArcMap for image pre-processing and processing. This model covers six functioning areas of mosaic, land feature extraction, cloud layer generation, vectorization, cloud masking, and smoothing. The green band and mid-infrared images were selected due to the largest reflectance difference between water and non-water bodies. These images have proceeded with modified normalized difference water index (i.e. algorithm of the script model for extracting water and land features). We also quantified the landform changes such as net shoreline movement, shoreline change envelope, endpoint rate, and linear regression rate, using a digital shoreline analysis system (i.e. statistical software combined with ArcMapTM). Therefore, landform changes were classified as erosion (>-2.5 m/year), minor seasonal changes (-2.5 m/year to +2.5 m/ year), accretion (>+2.5 m/year), based on the annual variations of endpoint rate (i.e. the distance between the oldest and the youngest shorelines to particular time interval). We visualized spatial and temporal coastal landform changes along the east of Sri Lanka, and also identified short-term landform change drives such as tsunamis, cyclones, and anthropogenic activities (e.g. engineering constructions). These landform changes were observed with a global positioning system (GPS)-based field survey. The understanding of such impacts can be directly applied to sustainable coastal zone management.

TI  - Understanding the impact of climatic variability on terrestrial water storage in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) is essential for better understanding the influences of climatic variability on hydrological cycles. Here we use Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)/GRACE Follow-on satellite data and meteorological observations to analyse the inter-annual trends of TWSA across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) during 2003-2020 and investigate the relationships between climatic variability and annual changes in TWSA. Results indicate that TWSA across the QTP generally decreased, at a rate of -0.5 +/- 1.4 mm/year during 2003-2020, which mainly arises from the coupled effects of Potential evapotranspiration (PET) and precipitation. In terms of the effects of climatic variability, annual changes in TWSA show a negative correlation coefficient (r = -0.76) with PET, which is greater than that with precipitation (r = 0.67). The cross-wavelet transformation analysis revealed that the evolution of TWSA across the QTP is closely associated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Our conclusions can help decision makers to formulate appropriate policies for the assessment and management of water resources over the QTP.

TI  - HFA-Net: High frequency attention siamese network for building change detection in VHR remote sensing images
T2  - PATTERN RECOGNITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Building change detection (BCD) recently can be handled well under the booming of deep-learning based computer vision techniques. However, segmentation and recognition for objects with sharper boundaries still suffer from the poorly acquired high frequency information, which can result in the deteriorated annotation of building boundaries in BCD. To better obtain the high frequency pattern under the deep learning pipeline, we propose a high frequency attention-guided Siamese network (HFA-Net) in which a novel built-in high frequency attention block (HFAB) is applied. HFA-Net is designed to enhance high frequency information of buildings via HFAB which is composed of two main stages, i.e., the spatial-wise attention (SA) and the high frequency enhancement (HF). The SA firstly guides the model to search and focus on buildings, and HF is employed afterwards to highlight the high frequency information of the input feature maps. With high frequency information of buildings enhanced by HFAB, HFA-Net is able to better detect the edges of changed buildings, so as to improve the performance of BCD. Our proposed method is evaluated on three widely-used public datasets, i.e., WHU-CD, LEVIR-CD, and Google dataset. Remarkable experimental results on these datasets indicate that our proposed method can better detect edges of changed buildings and shows a better performance.

TI  - Root-zone soil moisture estimation based on remote sensing data and deep learning
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture in the root zone is the most important factor in eco-hydrological processes. Even though soil moisture can be obtained by remote sensing, limited to the top few centimeters (< 5 cm). Researchers have attempted to estimate root-zone soil moisture using multiple regression, data assimilation, and data-driven methods. However, correlations between root-zone soil moisture and its related variables, including surface soil moisture, always appear nonlinear, which is difficult to extract and express using typical statistical methods. The artificial intelligence (AI) method, which is advantageous for nonlinear relationship analysis and extraction is applied for root-zone soil moisture estimation, but by only considering its separate temporal or spatial correlations. The convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) model, known to capture spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale sequential datasets with the advantage of dealing with spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem, was used in this study to estimate root-zone soil moisture based on remote sensing-based variables. Owing to limitation of regional soil moisture observation data, the physical model Hydrus-1D was used to generate large and spatiotemporal vertical soil moisture dataset for the ConvLSTM model training and verification. Then, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) etc. remote sensing-based factors were selected as predictive variables. Results of the ConvLSTM model showed that the fitting coefficients (R-2) of the root-zone soil moisture estimation significantly increased compared to those achieved by Global Land Data Assimilation System products, especially for deep layers. For example, R-2 increased from 0.02 to 0.60 at depth of 40 cm. This study suggests that a combination of the physical model and AI is a flexible tool capable of predicting spatiotemporally continuous root-zone soil moisture with good accuracy on a large scale.

TI  - Gridded flood depth estimates from satellite-derived inundations
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Canada's RADARSAT missions improve the potential to study past flood events; however, existing tools to derive flood depths from this remote-sensing data do not correct for errors, leading to poor estimates. To provide more accurate gridded depth estimates of historical flooding, a new tool is proposed that integrates Height Above Nearest Drainage and Cost Allocation algorithms. This tool is tested against two trusted, hydraulically derived, gridded depths of recent floods in Canada. This validation shows the proposed tool outperforms existing tools and can provide more accurate estimates from minimal data without the need for complex physics-based models or expert judgement. With improvements in remote-sensing data, the tool proposed here can provide flood researchers and emergency managers accurate depths in near-real time.

TI  - A coarse-to-fine weakly supervised learning method for green plastic cover segmentation using high-resolution remote sensing images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Green plastic cover (GPC) is a kind of green plastic fine mesh primarily used for covering construction sites and mitigating large amounts of dust during construction. Accurate GPC detection is vital for monitoring urban environment and understanding urban development. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based segmentation methods are widely used for detecting object extents, while they rely on high-quality pixel-level labels with high acquisition cost. In this regard, weakly supervised learning can achieve pixel-level segmentation using only image-level labels, by first generating the class activation map (CAM) to obtain initial pixel-level labels and then applying the CNN-based segmentation methods to detect object extents. However, these initial labels are usually incomplete and noisy, caused by the local high response property of CAM. Moreover, the CNN-based segmentation methods often lead to blurry object boundaries due to the gradual down-sampling of feature maps, and meanwhile suffer from the class imbalance problem in real scenarios. Given these problems, we introduce weakly supervised learning into GPC detection to lower the label acquisition cost. Furthermore, to improve the completeness and correctness of initial labels and mitigate the blurry boundary problem, we propose a coarse-tofine weakly supervised segmentation method (called CFWS), consisting of three steps: 1) object-based label extraction; 2) noisy label correction; and 3) boundary-aware semantic segmentation. Moreover, to alleviate the class imbalance problem, we propose a classification-then-segmentation strategy and integrate it into the CFWS to detect GPC. We test the CFWS on two datasets from Google Earth and Gaofen-2 high-resolution images, respectively. The results show that the CFWS obtains more complete GPCs and effectively retains boundaries on both datasets compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. In real scenarios, the classification-thensegmentation strategy significantly reduces a large number of false alarms generated by direct segmentation. These findings confirm that the CFWS holds great potentials for large-scale GPC detection and urban environmental monitoring. The source code will be available at https://github.com/lauraset/Coarse-to-fine-weaklysupervised-GPC-segmentation.

TI  - Using the SBAS InSAR technique to monitor surface deformation in the Kuqa fold-thrust belt, Tarim Basin, NW China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kuqa foreland fold-thrust belt is one of the key areas for gas exploration and a rare region with allochthonous salt outcrops well-preserved. In this study, twenty-eight Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired from 2015 to 2017 were utilized to detect and map the surface deformation in the western Kuqa fold-thrust belt (KFTB) based on the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) method. Spatial-temporal statistics analysis and comparison in different structural belts and geomorphology were made based on the inversion results. The results show that the spatial distribution characteristics of the surface deformation detected in subaerial salt structures are highly consistent with the previous studies, but the deformation rate in Daxiagu and Awate namakier increased to 25-35 mm/a. It indicates that the KFTB is still undergoing continuous north-south compression and shortening, which drives the underground salt to keep moving. Combined with the sufficient salt supply, increased activity of subaerial namakier and enhanced surface process in recent years, a variety of spatial-temporal surface deformation patterns are observed in the western KFTB. These varieties are attributed to the differences in structure and geomorphology in different belts, which can provide vital clues for exploring the roles of tectonics and surface processes in the spatial-temporal evolution of surface morphology in active tectonic regions.

TI  - Investigation of the Luco dei Marsi DSGSD revealing the first evidence of a basal shear zone in the central Apennine belt (Italy)
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs) show a wide range of geomorphological characteristics and kinematic behaviours. In many cases, deforming rock masses move on a continuous surface or a thick basal shear zone (BSZ) overlying the stable bedrock. The nature of this boundary is a significant issue in scientific debates since examples of BSZs have been observed or inferred in some DSGSDs worldwide. In the central Apennines, although several cases of DSGSDs have been described in recent decades, no evidence of BSZs has been documented thus far. This work presents the first case of a BSZ found in the region at the bottom of a large-scale gravitational deformation that affects the Mesozoic-Cenozoic carbonate ridge overhanging the Luco dei Marsi village (Abruzzi region). The BSZ consists of several metres-thick, cataclastic breccia developed within middle-Upper Cretaceous biodetritic limestone. The breccia level is exposed for approximately 200 m with a subhorizontal geometry and shows severe rock damage and weathering. The DSGSD hosting the BSZ affects an NNW-SSE-oriented and wide Miocene anticline whose eastern limb is dismembered by Pliocene-Quaternary normal faults delimiting the edge of a large Quaternary intermontane basin (the Fucino Basin). Field survey, aerial photointerpretation, and remote sensing (DInSAR technique) analyses outline an active gravity-driven process. This is characterized by several kinds of geomorphological features, including downhill- and uphill-facing scarps, ridge-top depressions, gravitational grabens and trenches in the upper and middle parts of the ridge, and bulging at the toe of the slope. These features, which can be distinguished from tectonic elements due to their shape and extension, are an indication of a high degree of internal deformation and a compound sagging geometry for the Luco dei Marsi DSGSD. The short-term activity of the process was revealed by DInSAR time series covering almost thirty years of satellite datasets, including ERS1/2, ENVISAT, COSMO-SkyMed, and SENTINEL 1 constellations. Strain rates on the order of a few mm/yr were inferred, with a marked difference between different sectors of the DSGSD area. The long-term (y > 102) lifespan of the DSGSD was framed into a multiple-step conceptual model summarizing the Early Pleistocene-Holocene geological evolution of the area. The model results outline the control exercised by extensional tectonics on DSGSD development, as progressive displacements along normal faults in the latest Pleistocene were the cause of lateral unconfinement at the toe of the slope. This work further contributes to the increasing knowledge on DSGSDs in the central Apennines and the understanding of the relationship between deformation features induced by slope morphogenesis, such as the BSZ, and Quaternary tectonics within the mountain belt.

TI  - Improving astaxanthin production of <i>Haematococcus pluvialis</i> on the outdoor large scale cultivation by optimizing the disinfection strategy of photobioreactor
T2  - ALGAL RESEARCH-BIOMASS BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Astaxanthin production is often plagued by biological contaminants during the outdoor culture of Haematococcus pluvialis. The contaminants may even lead to the failure of the whole cultivation. To reduce the contaminants during outdoor culture and ensure the stability of large-scale astaxanthin production, the disinfection strategies using sodium hypochlorite in outdoor closed horizontal tube photobioreactor (HTPBR) were studied. The effective concentration of sodium hypochlorite for disinfection was 80 mg.L-1 by comparing the tolerances of various kinds of biological contaminants to sodium hypochlorite. Moreover, a degradation model of sodium hypochlorite was established to quantify the concentration of residual sodium hypochlorite in HTPBR. The predicted value of this model was close to the measured value, the maximum deviation was 4.88 mg.L-1, and the average deviation was 1.97 mg.L-1. In order to avoid adverse effects on astaxanthin accumulation, the residual sodium hypochlorite or sodium thiosulfate after disinfection should be controlled below 0.1 mg.L-1 and 10 mg.L-1, respectively. By comparing the multiple disinfection effects on outdoor HTPBRs, a low level of the total bacterial count was observed in HTPBR with double disinfection. By optimizing the disinfection strategy, the biological contaminants were reduced, and the volume content of astaxanthin was 2.37 times that of the unoptimized disinfection strategy. This study indicated that the astaxanthin yield can be improved by reducing the biological contaminants during the culture of H. pluvialis. The information will be a foundation for the disinfection strategy of other microalgae cultivation reactors.

TI  - The impact of SARS-CoV-2 on respiratory syndromic and sentinel surveillance in Israel, 2020: a new perspective on established systems
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic presented new challenges for the existing respiratory surveillance systems, and adaptations were implemented. Systematic assessment of the syndromic and sentinel surveillance platforms during the pandemic is essential for understanding the value of each platform in the context of an emerging pathogen with rapid global spread. Aim: We aimed to evaluate systematically the performance of various respiratory syndromic surveillance platforms and the sentinel surveillance system in Israel from 1 January to 31 December 2020. Methods: We compared the 2020 syndromic surveillance trends to those of the previous 3 years, using Poisson regression adjusted for overdispersion. To assess the performance of the sentinel clinic system as compared with the national SARS-CoV-2 repository, a cubic spline with 7 knots and 95% confidence intervals were applied to the sentinel network's weekly percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases. Results: Syndromic surveillance trends changed substantially during 2020, with a statistically significant reduction in the rates of visits to physicians and emergency departments to below previous years' levels. Morbidity patterns of the syndromic surveillance platforms were inconsistent with the progress of the pandemic, while the sentinel surveillance platform was found to reflect the national circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the population. Conclusion: Our findings reveal the robustness of the sentinel clinics platform for the surveillance of the main respiratory viruses during the pandemic and possibly beyond. The robustness of the sentinel clinics platform during 2020 supports its use in locations with insufficient resources for widespread testing of respiratory viruses.

TI  - Anthropogenic fire patterns affect niche breadth and niche overlap in sympatric songbird species
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The severity of wildfires increases globally, and return intervals decrease. Fires can benefit biodiversity, as post-burn early successional stages provide diverse habitats and niches for many species. How fire disturbance affects niche use and niche overlap of species is poorly understood so far. We studied the effect of anthropogenic fire on breeding habitat use, niche breadth and niche overlap of five sympatric bunting species breeding in wetlands of the Amur River floodplain (Russian Far East). Fire frequency, measured as the time an area burnt in the period 2000 to 2017, was mapped from Landsat imagery and related to the presence or absence of the species. Niche breadth and niche overlap were calculated separately for occurrences in burned (within the study year) and unburned patches. Fire frequency characterized differences in niche use among the species, but the probability of presence was not affected by recent fire in four of five species. Niche breadth was significantly lower in recently burned patches, but we found no increase in niche overlap between species after fire. Instead, the studied species seemed to occupy similar patches before and after fire, possibly because of a high site fidelity. Our results clearly show that fire frequency is a major determinant for the niche separation in the five studied species, while recent fire does not affect niche overlap.

TI  - App-based COVID-19 syndromic surveillance and prediction of hospital admissions in COVID Symptom Study Sweden
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The app-based COVID Symptom Study was launched in Sweden in April 2020 to contribute to real-time COVID-19 surveillance. We enrolled 143,531 study participants (>= 18 years) who contributed 10.6 million daily symptom reports between April 29, 2020 and February 10, 2021. Here, we include data from 19,161 self-reported PCR tests to create a symptom-based model to estimate the individual probability of symptomatic COVID-19, with an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.74-0.83) in an external dataset. These individual probabilities are employed to estimate daily regional COVID-19 prevalence, which are in turn used together with current hospital data to predict next week COVID-19 hospital admissions. We show that this hospital prediction model demonstrates a lower median absolute percentage error (MdAPE: 25.9%) across the five most populated regions in Sweden during the first pandemic wave than a model based on case notifications (MdAPE: 30.3%). During the second wave, the error rates are similar. When we apply the same model to an English dataset, not including local COVID-19 test data, we observe MdAPEs of 22.3% and 19.0% during the first and second pandemic waves, respectively, highlighting the transferability of the prediction model.The app-based COVID Symptom Study was launched in Sweden in April 2020 to contribute to real-time COVID-19 surveillance using daily symptom reports from study participants. Here, the authors show how syndromic surveillance can be used to estimate regional COVID-19 prevalence and to predict later COVID-19 hospital admissions.

TI  - Multi-scale spatial-spectral attention network for multispectral image compression based on variational autoencoder
T2  - SIGNAL PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based upon the fact that multispectral image compression needs to remove both spatial and spectral redundancy, recent learnt models via end-to-end manners have shown promising performance. However, most of them ignore the characteristics of multispectral image, i.e., the non-stationarity of spectral correlation and the scale-diversity of spatial features. Meanwhile, they directly utilize fully factorized entropy model, rendering compression performance suboptimal. This paper proposes a Multi-Scale SpatialSpectral Attention Network (MSSSA-Net) based on variational autoencoder (VAE). Our MSSSA-Net (1) incorporates a simple neuroscience-based non-local attention module into attention mechanism to capture the tiny features in adjacent pixels and large-scale features in spatial domain simultaneously, (2) proposes a multi-scale spectral attention block to extract non-stationary correlation of adjacent spectra at different scales. We demonstrate that our MSSSA-Net offers the state-of-the-art performance in comparison with classical algorithms, including JPEG20 0 0 and 3D-SPIHT, and recent learnt image compression models, on 7-band and 8-band datasets from Landsat-8 and WorldView-3 satellites, when measured by PSNR, MSSSIM and Mean Spectral Angle. Extensive ablation experiments have verified the effectiveness of each component, and have demonstrated that, for multispectral image compression, Scale-only Hyperprior can make a better trade-off between compression performance and complexity compared with Mean & Scale Hyperprior and Joint Autoregressive model.

TI  - Developing Immune Profiles of Endangered Australian Sea Lion (<i>Neophoca cinerea</i>) Pups Within the Context of Endemic Hookworm (<i>Uncinaria sanguinis</i>) Infection
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As a top predator, the endangered Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) is a sentinel of ecosystem change, where population trends can reflect broader shifts in the marine environment. The population of this endemic pinniped was historically diminished by commercial sealing, and recovery has been slowed by fishery interactions, disease and, potentially, pollutants. Hookworm infects 100% of neonatal pups and has been identified as a contributor to population decline. Here, a multivariable approach using traditional serological and novel molecular tools such as qPCR and ddPCR was used to examine immune phenotypes of developing Australian sea lion pups infected with the endemic hookworm (Uncinaria sanguinis) from two South Australian colonies. Results show changing immunophenotypes throughout the patent period of infection represented by pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6), IgG and acute-phase proteins. Although cytokines may prove useful as markers of resistance, in this study, IL-6 is determined to be an early biomarker of inflammation in Australian sea lion pups, excluding the alternative hypothesis. Additionally, immunological differences between animals from high- and low-intensity hookworm seasons, as well as ivermectin-treated animals, indicate hookworm infection modulation of the host immune response, as evidenced by a lower IL-6 mRNA expression in the non-treated groups. This study of the Australian sea lion is an example of an ecoimmunological approach to disease investigation, which can be applied to evaluate the impact of environmental and anthropogenic factors on susceptibility to infectious diseases in free-ranging species

TI  - Marine life at Lagrangian fronts
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - Many ocean fronts are known to feature enhanced primary and secondary production and elevated biodiversity. The confluence of water masses on strong fronts promotes concentration of plankters (phytoplankton and small zooplankton) contributing to creation of oases in the oceanic desert for marine habitants, from small pelagic fish and turtles to seabirds and apex (top) predators. This article is a concise review of the role of ocean fronts in marine life, with a particular focus on their detection and tracking using satellite data and Lagrangian diagnostics. Using altimetry-based calculations of the indicators of water motion, it is shown how to identify circulation features with enhanced values of gradients of these indicators, the so-called Lagrangian fronts, which approximate locations of ocean fronts. The role of Lagrangian fronts, induced by horizontal stirring by large-scale currents, in structuring plankters and organizing spatial distribution of food resources in the open ocean is discussed as well. The paper emphasizes the importance of Lagrangian fronts in foraging strategy and as potential feeding grounds of pelagic fish, squid, seabirds, elephant seals, penguins and whales and their significance in marine ecology and fisheries.

TI  - The worldview of the "working rich"-notions of justice and legitimization strategies of working wealth heirs
T2  - OSTERREICHISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SOZIOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - As social mobility decreases, social background becomes increasingly important. At the same time, wealth is distributed considerably uneven and is passed on as heritage and/or endowment inter vivos within wealthy families. Therefore, a conflict between the socially dominant principle of meritocracy and the inheritance of wealth as a privilege of social status arises. This paper asks, how the "working rich" legitimize their wealth when interpreting their origin within a meritocratic society as well as which ideology of justice they believe in. Drawing on seven problem-centered interviews the author has worked out two main types of legitimation of origin and perception of justice: the first type resolves the conflict through "meritocratic devaluation"-by devaluing social class origin and acknowledging only "success" as merit. The second type "status-oriented philanthropy", dignifies their social origin through an "appropriate way of living" and philanthropy and makes linkages between meritocratic principles and social status. Both types legitimize their privileged position in society and contribute to the reproduction of social inequality. However, the two types of legitimization strategies do have different implications for fundamental attitudes towards solidarity.

TI  - Monitoring vegetation dynamics with open earth observation tools: the case of fire-modulated savanna to forest transitions in Central Africa
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Woody encroachment and forest progression are widespread in forest-savanna transitional areas in Central Africa. Quantifying these dynamics and understanding their drivers at relevant spatial scales has long been a challenge. Recent progress in open access imagery sources with improved spatial, spectral and temporal resolution combined with cloud computing resources, and the advent of relatively cheap solutions to deploy laser sensors in the field, have transformed this domain of study. We present a study case in the Mpem & Djim National Park (MDNP), a 1,000 km(2) protected area in the Centre region of Cameroon. Using open source algorithms in Google Earth Engine (GEE), we characterized vegetation dynamics and the fire regime based on Landsat multispectral imagery archive (1975-2020). Current species assemblages were estimated from Sentinel 2 imagery and the open source biodivMapR package, using spectral dissimilarity. Vegetation structure (aboveground biomass; AGB) was characterized using Unmanned Aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR scanning data sampled over the study area. Savanna vegetation, which was initially dominant in the MDNP, lost about 50% of its initial cover in <50 years in favor of forest at an average rate of ca. 0.63%.year(-1) (6 km(2).year(-1)). Species assemblage computed from spectral dissimilarity in forest vegetation followed a successional gradient consistent with forest age. AGB accumulation rate was 3.2 Mg.ha(-1).year(-1) after 42 years of forest encroachment. In savannas, two modes could be identified along the gradient of spectral species assemblage, corresponding to distinct AGB levels, where woody savannas with low fire frequency store 40% more AGB than open grassy savannas with high fire frequency. A fire occurrence every five year was found to be the fire regime threshold below which woody savannas start to dominate over grassy ones. A fire frequency below that threshold opens the way to young forest transitions. These results have implications for carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation policies. Maintaining savanna ecosystems in the region would require active management actions to limit woody encroachment and forest progression, in contradiction with global reforestation goals.

TI  - Geospatial technology in agroforestry: status, prospects, and constraints
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Agroforestry has an indispensable role in food and livelihood security in addition to its capacity to combat the detrimental effects of climate change. However, agroforestry has not been properly promoted and exploited due to lack of precise extent, geographical distribution, and carbon sequestration (CS) assessment. The recent advent of geospatial technologies, as well as free availability of spatial data and software, can provide new insights into agroforestry resources assessment, decision-making, and policy development despite agroforestry's small spatial extent, isolated nature, and higher structural and functional complexity of agroforestry. In this review, the existing application of geospatial technologies together with its constraints and limitations as well as the potential future application for agroforestry has been discussed. The review reveals that the application of optical remote sensing in agroforestry includes spatial extent mapping, production of tree species spectral signature, CS assessment, and suitability mapping. Simultaneously, the recent surge in the use of synthetic aperture radar in conjunction with algorithms based on vegetation photosynthesis and optical data enables a more accurate estimation of gross primary productivity at different scales. However, unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with sensors, such as multispectral, LiDAR, hyperspectral, and thermal, offer a considerably higher potential and accuracy than satellite-based datasets. In the future, the health monitoring of agroforestry systems can be a key concern that may be addressed by utilizing hyperspectral and thermal datasets to analyze plant biochemistry, chlorophyll fluorescence, and water stress. Additionally, current (GEDI, ECOSTRESS) and future space agency missions (BIOMASS, FLEX, NISAR, TRISHNA) have enormous potential to shed fresh light on agroforestry systems.

TI  - Wildfire controls on land surface properties in mixed conifer and ponderosa pine forests of Sierra Nevada and Klamath mountains, Western US
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the post-fire biogeophysical and biochemical dynamics after several high-severity wildfires that occurred in mixed conifer and ponderosa pine forest types in the Sierra Nevada and Klamath Mountains regions between 1986 and 2017. We found a consistent pattern of reduced leaf area index (LAI) in the first year after fire, followed by gradual recovery over the subsequent 25 years. Recovery rate varied between forest types. For example, average summer LAI for 16-25 years post-fire was 88% of the pre-fire average for mixed conifers in the Sierra Nevada, 64% for ponderosa pine in the Sierra Nevada, and 83% for mixed conifers in Klamath Mountains (63, 35, and 64% in winter, respectively). The slower recovery of LAI in ponderosa pine could be due to poor species diversity and drier climate. Summer and winter albedo increased progressively until 12 years post-fire in Sierra Nevada, while it continued to increase until 25 years post-fire in Klamath Mountains. Ponderosa pine had the highest summer (0.148 +/- 0.001) and winter (0.5 +/- 0.0033) albedos. Post-fire changes in evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary productivity (GPP) were consistent with the changes in LAI. Both summer and winter ET and GPP returned to pre-fire levels by 25 years after fire in mixed conifers of both regions, while the ET and GPP did not recover to pre-fire levels in ponderosa pine. Wildfires increased the land surface temperature (LST) immediately after fire in summer. This effect was significantly higher in mixed conifers of the Sierra Nevada (11 +/- 0.03 degrees C) compared to Klamath Mountains (7 +/- 0.01 degrees C). Our results suggest that reduced ET, consistent with less leaf area and its associated reduced evaporative cooling is the main factor controlling the immediate post-fire warming effect of wildfires in these regions. The findings reported here can be used to understand ecological responses to wildfire in these and nearby ecoregions as they represent mean historical behavior across multiple wildfire events.

TI  - Adequacy of satellite derived data for streamflow simulation in three Hexi inland river basins, Northwest China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The limited gauge measurements usually constrain the accurate hydrological modeling of runoff, especially in the ungauged or gauge-sparsely areas with complex terrain conditions. Satellite derived data provide alternative forcing data for hydrological modeling in ungauged areas, while quantitative evaluation on their performance is still needed. This study explores the adequacy and accuracy of satellite derived data based on the gauge observations over three inland river basins in the arid Hexi Corridor, Northwest China, where the satellite-based products are adopted to drive the HBV-Light model, including six satellite precipitation datasets (CHIRPS, CMORPH, GPM, GSMaP, MSWEP, PERSIANN) and the widely used evaporation product (GLEAM) combing with MODIS land surface temperature product (MOD11A1). Seven statistical metrics (CC, ME, RMSE, BIAS, POD, FAR, CSI) are adopted to assess satellite-based precipitation estimates, and three indices (NSE, R2, PBIAS) are used to evaluate the hydrological performance. Results indicate that: (1) For precipitation evaluation at point-to-pixel scale, all products have a relatively poor agreement with gauged observations with the CC ranging from 0.16 to 0.56. Both MSWEP and GPM outperformed other products at daily scale with higher CC values, and showed the capability of detecting the precipitation events with higher POD and CSI. PERSIANN, GSMaP, GPM, and CMORPH tend to underestimate the precipitation amount in three river basins. (2) For the hydrological evaluation, the statistical assessment showed that the GPM presents the best results at daily scale, while underestimates streamflow amount in three watersheds. All the grided precipitation datasets show higher NSE and R2 in the relatively humid HHRB and XYRB than SLRB. (3) The combination of MOD11A1, GLEAM and satellite based precipitation as forcing data of the HBV-Light can achieve good performance in the three inland river basins. This study aims to provide an additional reference for the hydrological application of satellite derived data in gauge-sparsely areas located in high altitude and arid regions.

TI  - Extracting tea plantations in complex landscapes using Sentinel-2 imagery and machine learning algorithms
T2  - COMMUNITY ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tea tree is an economically important crop. The rapid and efficient mapping of the distribution and dynamic changes in tea plantations informs decision making for government departments. It also plays an important role in rational tea planting and environmental governance. This study used the 10 m Sentinel-2 image data to map the spatial distribution of tea plantations in Yingde City, China. In this article, we analyzed the differences in vegetation and texture characteristics between the new and mature tea plantations. We found that the texture features of the new and mature tea plantations were significantly different in contrast, which can be used as an index for tea plantation extraction. Moreover, we selected machine learning classifiers, including support vector machine (SVM) and random forests (RF) method, which were utilized to extract the preliminary classification to complete spatial distribution mapping of tea plantations. The overall accuracy of SVM and RF was 90.79% and 89.42%, respectively, and the kappa coefficient was 0.88 and 0.86, respectively. SVM had the highest overall accuracy in terms of tea plantation distribution at the regional scale. These results demonstrate that: (1) separating tea plantations into mature and new tea plantations, taking into account vegetation and texture features such as soil brightness index and contrast, will help improve the accuracy of tea plantation classification and (2) using multi-period images combined with machine learning classification methods can improve the efficiency and accuracy of tea plantation identification.

TI  - Axillary Needle Biopsy in the Era of American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011: Institutional Experience With a Largely Urban Minority Population and Review of the Literature
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial demonstrated that sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone is adequate for axillary control in patients with one to two positive axillary lymph nodes. However, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is required in patients with N1 disease diagnosed with a preoperative needle biopsy. In this report, we determined how many patients could potentially have had SNB alone based on finding only one to two positive nodes in the axilla.Methods: A retrospective review of patients with positive preoperative axillary needle biopsy undergoing ALND was used to identify rates of high volume axillary disease (>2 positive nodes). Wilcoxon's rank-sum and Fisher's exact test were used for statistical analysis. A review of the literature is included for comparison.Results: 73% of 51 total patients with a positive needle biopsy had >2 positive nodes on axillary dissection. The high-volume axillary disease was significantly more likely with the presence of lymphovascular invasion and extranodal extension.Conclusions: Patients with positive preoperative axillary needle biopsies have a significantly higher rate of high volume axillary disease. However, at least one-quarter of these patients will have <3 positive nodes and potentially could have been treated with SNB alone.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Agriculture is a key element of Afghanistan's economy and plays an essential role supporting the expanding population and urban development of Kabul, the country's capital. Over the past decades the urban landscape has changed substantially and agricultural land use has shifted in its extent, location, and density. Identifying trends in the amount of agricultural area, as an indication of food production, is important for city planning and humanitarian efforts. While many studies have investigated Afghanistan's agriculture, most are conducted at scales that preclude their use for local-scale decision-making. This study quantifies agricultural extent across 32 years from 1988 to 2020 at local scale using simple and repeatable Landsat multispectral image analysis. The volume of data in time-series analysis complicatesvisualization of key findings and long-term trends. This study also explored visualization methods such as zonal mapping, animations, and the isolation of key themes in a 2D static map.

AB  - We present the optomechanical design and development of a wide-field auroral imager (WAI) on board the satellite Fengyun-3D. The optomechanical system of the WAI features a combination of a large field of view and a single-axis scanning mechanism. The combination makes the WAI perform better than its counterparts in temporal resolution in a low Earth orbit. In-orbit tests have verified the survival of WAI in the launching vibration and space environment. It has functioned on-orbit since 2018, with a spatial resolution of similar to 10 km at the nadir point, at a reference height of 110 km above the ionosphere. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

TI  - Katabatic and convective processes drive two preferred peaks in the precipitation diurnal cycle over the Central Himalaya
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The diurnal cycle of precipitation over the Central Himalaya is governed by a complex interaction between the diurnal cycle of tropical convection and local orographic flow. Understanding this interaction is crucial for model evaluation, where the simulation of such processes is highly sensitive to model resolution and choice of parametrisation schemes. In this study, the mean diurnal cycle is computed using gridded satellite data-Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) (IMERG) data and is shown to be bimodal, with one peak in the late afternoon (1700 India Standard Time (IST)) and a stronger one in the early morning (0200 IST). This structure is an artefact of compositing, as individual days are associated with single peaks. The late-afternoon "convective" peak is shown to be linked to the diurnal cycle of tropical convection, whereas the nocturnal "katabatic" peak is shown to be triggered by nocturnal downslope flow converging with the background monsoon circulation. As such, the katabatic peak is strongly favoured by an active monsoon trough, which provides greater southeasterly moisture flux to the foothills, resulting in increased low-level moisture flux convergence upon interaction with the katabatic northerlies. When the trough is less active, precipitation is brought to the region by mesoscale convective systems, ranging in scale from tens to thousands of kilometres, resulting in convective peaks. We hypothesise that these convective afternoon peaks are enhanced by anabatic flow. It is shown that the Boreal Summer Intraseasonal Oscillation does not play a significant role in modulating either the timing or the amplitude of the diurnal cycle; however, low-pressure systems do: either by intensifying the trough (and hence the katabatic peak), or, when further north, by providing deep convection (hence supporting the convective peak). Two reanalyses and a separate 17-km model with parametrised convection capture both peaks, but overestimate the magnitude of the convective peak and underestimate the magnitude of the katabatic peak.

TI  - Machine learning based wildfire susceptibility mapping using remotely sensed fire data and GIS: A case study of Adana and Mersin provinces, Turkey
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the number of wildfires has increased all over the world. Therefore, mapping wildfire susceptibility is crucial for prevention, early detection, and supporting wildfire management decisions. This study aims to generate Machine Learning (ML) based wildfire susceptibility maps for Adana and Mersin provinces, which are located in the Mediterranean Region of Turkey. To generate a wildfire inventory, this study uses active fire pixels derived from MODIS monthly MCD14ML composites. Furthermore, as a sub aim, the performance of seven ML approaches, namely, stand-alone Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and ensemble algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and AdaBoost (AB), was evaluated based on wildfire susceptibility mapping. The capabilities of the corresponding ML methods were assessed using thirteen wildfire conditioning factors, which can be grouped into four main categories: topographical, meteorological, vegetation, and anthropogenic factors. The Information Gain (IG) approach was used to assess their importance scores. A multicollinearity analysis was also performed to assess the relationship between conditioning factors. To compare the predictive performances of ML algorithms, five performance metrics, namely average accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve, were used. To test the significance of the generated wildfire susceptibility maps and to detect similarities and differences among the output of these ML algorithms, McNemar's test was implemented. In the end, the ML-based models were locally interpreted using the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique. The AUC values of seven methods varied from 0.817 to 0.879, and the accuracy scores ranged between 0.734 and 0.812. The results showed that the RF model provided the best results considering all performance metrics. The accuracy score and AUC values of the RF model were equal to 0.812 and 0.879, respectively. On the other hand, stand-alone algorithms (LDA, SVM, and LR) represented lower performance than tree-based ensemble methods. Both the IG and SHAP analyses showed that elevation, temperature, and slope factors were the most contributing factors. The RF model classifier found that 7.20% of the study area has very high wildfire susceptibility, and the majority of the wildfire samples (68.84%) correspond to the very high susceptible areas in the RF model. The outcomes of this study are likely to provide decision-makers with a better understanding of wildfires in the Eastern Mediterranean Region of Turkey.

Our results suggested that total snow cover area (SCA) computed using NDSI from raw satellite images, under estimated SCA (viz. 10,938.66 and 7739.97 Km2); relative to atmospherically corrected (AC) (14,819.01 and 11,199.7 Km2) and topographically corrected (TC) (14,882.07 and 11,188.18 Km2) images during both the time periods (i.e., 2015 and 2018, respectively). This is mainly due to the non-identification of snow pixels in the shadow regions of raw imageries. Maximum SCA lies in the higher NDSI range in case of AC and TC images, unlike raw image where maximum SCA lies in lower NDSI range for both sunlit and shadow test sites. In the sunlit and shadow terrains, minimum NDSI values were found to be higher for TC images as compared to AC images, except few observations which exhibited similar values for both AC and TC images. In case of maximum NDSI values, most of the observations exhibited similar values for both AC and TC images, except few observations which depicted higher maximum NDSI value in AC images as compared to TC images in both the terrains. This observation ascertains the narrow range of NDSI values for TC images as compared to AC images, which could be attributed to reduced background reflection and low atmospheric scattering in the TC images. Comparison among shadow and sunlit snow terrains, reveals low values of minimum and maximum NDSI in the shadow site, which is ascertained by significant (p < 0.001) t-values of means difference between shadow and sunlit terrains. Moreover, snow surface temperature (SST) values computed for both the time periods, reveal low SST values for shadow sites (t-values -5.1 and - 10.57 for minimum SST, and - 9.1 and - 12.61 for maximum SST for the years 2015 and 2018, respectively) as compared to sunlit sites, and this observation validates that minimum amount of solar radiation reaches the shadow sites. Thus, it is concluded that AC and TC are helpful for delineation of snow pixels under shadow, but shadow has a significant impact on the spectral reflectance of snow, even in the AC and TC images. The influence of shadow should be taken into account for accurate estimation of physical properties and broadband albedo of the snow.

TI  - Optical quantification of oil emulsions in multi-band coarse-resolution imagery using a lab-derived HSV model
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil emulsions can harm marine and coastal environments for extended periods. Timely identification and quantification of oil emulsions are essential for oil spill response. Although SAR is the most commonly used technique in detecting oil presence, it has limits in oil quantification. In contrast, optical remote sensing can fill this gap with more spectral bands. Hyperspectral remote sensing is capable of achieving this purpose. However, it is challenging to use multi-band coarse-resolution imagery due to the fewer bands and mixed pixel effect. Through laboratory measurements, numerical simulation, and Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) model, we illuminate the multispectral mixed characteristics of oil emulsions and demonstrate Hue's role in characterizing the mixture features and oil concentration trends. Hue-based oil emulsion classification and oil concentration segmentation (OCS) methods are proposed and applied to Landsat-5 images under quantified uncertainties. This approach is expected to expand its application in multispectral remote sensing.

TI  - Metabolic plasticity can amplify ecosystem responses to global warming
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Organisms have the capacity to alter their physiological response to warming through acclimation or adaptation, but the consequence of this metabolic plasticity for energy flow through food webs is currently unknown, and a generalisable framework does not exist for modelling its ecosystem-level effects. Here, using temperature-controlled experiments on stream invertebrates from a natural thermal gradient, we show that the ability of organisms to raise their metabolic rate following chronic exposure to warming decreases with increasing body size. Chronic exposure to higher temperatures also increases the acute thermal sensitivity of whole-organismal metabolic rate, independent of body size. A mathematical model parameterised with these findings shows that metabolic plasticity could account for 60% higher ecosystem energy flux with just +2 degrees C of warming than a traditional model based on ecological metabolic theory. This could explain why long-term warming amplifies ecosystem respiration rates through time in recent mesocosm experiments, and highlights the need to embed metabolic plasticity in predictive models of global warming impacts on ecosystems.Organisms can alter their physiological response to warming. Here, the authors show that the ability to raise metabolic rate following exposure to warming is inverse to body size and provide a mathematical model which estimates that metabolic plasticity could amplify energy flux through ecosystems in response to warming.

TI  - Satellite data validation: a parametrization of the natural variability of atmospheric mixing ratios
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution model data are used to estimate the statistically typical mixing ratio variabilities of trace species as a function of distance and time separation. These estimates can be used to explain the fact that some of the differences between observations made with different observing systems are due to the less-than-perfect co-location of the measurements. The variability function is approximated by a two-parameter regression function, and lookup tables of the natural variability values as a function of distance separation and time separation are provided. In addition, a reparametrization of the variability values as a function of latitudinal gradients is proposed, and the seasonal independence of the linear approximation of such a function is demonstrated.

TI  - On the consistency of methane retrievals using the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) and multiple spectroscopic databases
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The next and current generations of methane-retrieving satellite instruments are reliant on the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) for validation. Understanding the biases inherent in TCCON and satellite methane retrievals is as important now as when TCCON started in 2004. In this study we highlight possible biases between different methane products by assessing the retrievals of the main methane isotopologue 12 CH4. Using the TCCON GGG2014 retrieval environment, retrievals are performed using five separate spectroscopic databases from four separate TCCON sites (namely, Ascension Island, NyAlesund, Darwin and Tsukuba) over the course of a year. The spectroscopic databases include those native to TCCON, GGG2014 and GGG2020; the high-resolution transmission molecular absorption database 2016 (HITRAN2016); the Gestion et Etude des Informations Spectroscopiques Atmospheriques 2020 (GEISA2020) database; and the ESA Scientific Exploitation of Operational Missions - Improved Atmospheric Spectroscopy Databases (SEOM-IAS). We assess the biases in retrieving methane using the standard TCCON windows and the methane window used by the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) TROPOspheric Ozone Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) for each of the different spectroscopic databases.By assessing the retrieved (CH4)-C-12 values from individual windows against the standard TCCON retrievals, we find bias values of between 0.05 and 2.5 times the retrieval noise limit These values vary depending on the window and TCCON site, with Ascension Island showing the lowest biases (typically < 0.5) and Ny-Alesund or Tsukuba showing the largest. For the spectroscopic databases, GEISA2020 shows the largest biases, often greater than 1.5 across the TCCON sites and considered windows. The TROPOMI spectral window (4190-4340 cm(-1)) shows the largest biases of all the spectral windows, typically > 1, for all spectroscopic databases, suggesting that further improvements in spectroscopic parameters are necessary. We further assess the sensitivity of these biases to locally changing atmospheric conditions such as the solar zenith angle (SZA), water vapour and temperature. We find evidence of significant non-linear relationships between the variation in local conditions and the retrieval biases based on regression analysis. In general, each site, database and window combination indicates different degrees of sensitivity, with GEISA2020 often showing the most sensitivity for all TCCON sites. Ny-Alesund and Tsukuba show the most sensitivity to variations in local condition, while Ascension Island indicates limited sensitivity.Finally, we investigate the biases associated with retrieving (CH4)-C-13 from each TCCON site and spectroscopic database, through the calculation of delta C-13 values. We find high levels of inconsistency, in some cases > 100 %0 between databases, suggesting more work is required to refine the spectroscopic parameters of (CH4)-C-13.

TI  - Poetry in the World: Harriet Monroe's China Travels
T2  - ENGLISH STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay focuses on the editor and writer Harriet Monroe, whose writings on China are unexamined within modernist literary history. Through a discussion of her essays and travel writings, this study argues that Monroe's understanding of cross-cultural poetic influence was based on a pragmatist worldview, one that stands in contrast to philological and essentialist views of cultural and linguistic difference. Unlike Ezra Pound and other Imagists who aimed at translating or approximating Asian aesthetics and the "ideographic" qualities of the Chinese language through their poetry, Monroe's viewed the transmission and translation of literary expression as socially situated and received by audiences within specific networks and contexts. Influenced by the pragmatic philosophy of John Dewey and William James, Monroe viewed artistic and literary expression "as experienced" and developed an awareness of art and literature that was based on the perception of aesthetic objects within a worldly context.

TI  - SAR data and field surveys combination to update rainfall-induced shallow landslide inventory
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Campania region has been recurrently hit by severe landslides in volcanoclastic deposits. The city of Naples, and in particular the Camaldoli and Agnano hills (Phlegraean Fields), also suffered several landslide crises in weathered volcanoclastic rocks as a consequence of intense rainfalls or wildfires. To identify slope failures phenomena occurred in the winter season 2019-2020 an innovative procedure has been proposed. The purpose of this procedure is to highlight areas where major land cover changes occurred within our area of study, which can be potentially related to mass movements. The amplitude of spaceborne SAR images has been exploited for the change detection analysis and the output derived from the segmentation procedure has been compared with field observations. The amplitude-based method has been already applied in the detection of landslides, but never on the event with limited extensions, such as for this application. The achieved outcomes allowed the mapping of 62 new landslides that have been used to update the current landslide inventory database. This type of information is expected to help decision-makers with land planning and risk assessment.

TI  - Canonical NF-κB p65, but Not p105, Contributes to IL-1β-Induced IL-8 Expression in Cardiac Fibroblasts
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cardiac fibroblasts participate in the inflammatory process of heart diseases as sentinel cells of the cardiac tissue. In this study, we investigated the effect of the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), on the expression of interleukin 8 (IL-8), which contributes to the induction of innate immunity via the activation and recruitment of innate immune cells, such as neutrophils, to the site of inflammation in canine cardiac fibroblasts. IL-1 beta mediates IL-8 mRNA expression and protein release in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The IL-beta-mediated IL-8 protein release and mRNA expression were inhibited by 2-[(aminocarbonyl)amino]-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-thiophenecarboxamide, an inhibitor of the transcription factor, nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B. In cells treated with IL-1 beta, NF-kappa B p65 and p105 were transiently phosphorylated, indicating the activation of NF-kappa B. However, IL-1 beta failed to induce IL-8 mRNA expression in the cells transfected with p65 small interfering RNA (siRNA), but not in those transfected with p105 siRNA. These observations suggest that IL-1 beta induces IL-8 expression via the activation of NF-kappa B p65 in canine cardiac fibroblasts.

TI  - Quantification of temporal variations in groundwater level using satellite imagery technique: a case study of Rachna Doab, Pakistan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, surface water, groundwater, soil moisture, snow storage, permafrost, canopy water, and wet biomass constituents make up terrestrial water storage (TWS), which plays a significant role in the hydrological water balance. Groundwater storage (GWS) is a major parameter that plays a significant role in groundwater resource management. The groundwater modeling tools and in situ data are not enough to cover the large areas. Recently, remote sensing technology can be used to collect continuous information on the hydrological cycle in a low-cost way. The spatio-temporal measures of groundwater storage anomalies are helpful for sustainable groundwater management strategies. The ability of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite and the Global Land Data Assimilate System (GLDAS) to detect GWS in the Rachna Doab transboundary, which is experiencing hazardous groundwater extraction, is assessed in this study. The spatio-temporal groundwater storage variations were evaluated from January 2005 to December 2015 using GRACE satellite data. The GRACE-based GWS anomalies positively agreed with groundwater levels of in situ data. The statistical analysis (RMSE = 26.34 mm, correlation = 0.65) demonstrates that GRACE has competently captured both phase and magnitude in Rachna Doab. Still, there is a significant deviation in the trend of groundwater storage detected from June 2007 to July 2009, where in situ data have revealed a considerable rise in GWS compared to GRACE-derived GWS. The mean GWS changes of Rachna Doab are 1.4 cm for the year 2015. Compared to the relevant year, the increase in groundwater level is due to a high amount of rainfall in 2015. The average groundwater storage variation data for 2005-2015 showed a decline of 0.39 mm in the region. The region requires to adopt water-saving practices and groundwater policies implementation.

TI  - [A Study of 3D-NPS Analysis in CT Images Based on the Central Cross-section Theorem].
T2  - Nihon Hoshasen Gijutsu Gakkai zasshi
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: The noise power spectrum (NPS) of a CT scanner is commonly measured from a single noise image. However, since CT images are three-dimensional (3D) volume data, they have 3D noise characteristics (3D-NPS). In this study, we clarify the relationship among NPSs measured by various approaches in NPS analysis based on the central slice theorem. Its validity is verified by the NPS measurements using actual 3D noise data.METHODS: We defined the NPSz-projection(fx,fy) that was calculated by the 2D Fourier transform (FT) from the 2D projection of 3D noise data in the patient longitudinal direction, the 3D-NPS(fx,fy,fz) that was calculated by the 3D-FT from the 3D noise data, and the 2D-NPS(fx,fy) that was calculated by the 2D-FT from a single noise image; fx, fy, and fz are spatial frequencies corresponding to the axes of x, y, and z in the reconstructed CT volume, respectively. Based on the central slice theorem, we described that the NPSz-projection(fx,fy=0) was equal to the 3D-NPS(fx,fy=0,fz=0), and the NPS(2D-NPS(fx,fy=0)) was different from the 3D-NPS(fx,fy=0,fz=0). To verify them, we compared the NPSs calculated from actual 3D noise data that were obtained using a cylindrical water phantom.RESULTS: The 3D-NPS(fx,fy=0,fz=0) matched the NPSz-projection(fx,fy=0) and was different from the 2D-NPS(fx,fy=0).CONCLUSION: Based on the central slice theorem, we clarified the relationship among NPSs measured by various approaches in NPS analysis; it is important to understand this and then select an appropriate noise data handling and NPS measurement method.

TI  - Carbon dioxide spatial variability and dynamics for contrasting land uses in central Brazil agricultural frontier from remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) sources and sinks are an important global concern. Monitoring the spatiotemporal variations of GHG concentrations, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), is crucial for identifying potential sources and sinks and moving toward a sustainable future. Therefore, via a time-series of remote data and multispectral images, this study evaluates the CO2 spatiotemporal dynamics and related factors during 2015-2018 in one of the world's main agricultural frontier areas, the state of Mato Grosso (SMT), Brazil, which is both experiencing continued deforestation and attempting to achieve sustainable food production. In this study, data was obtained from the measurement of column-averaged carbon dioxide (CO2) dry air mole fraction in the atmosphere, set as XCO2 from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 satellite from January 2015 to December 2018. The enhanced vegetation index data were obtained from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, and rainfall data were obtained from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station dataset. From a series of Landsat-8 satellite images, it was possible to distinguish land use and land cover classes and estimate the CO2 flux in the SMT. The results showed that the temporal variability of CO2 flux is correlated positively with rainfall, while XCO2 is negatively correlated with rainfall. Regarding spatial variability, we observed that forest areas that were converted to other land uses resulted in higher values that characterize with sources, and that the highest and lowest average concentrations of CO2 occurred in the dry and rainy months, respectively, for XCO2, which might be the result of differences in the vertical resolution of the CO2 column and scale. In contrast, areas with large continuous forest areas tended to have lower values and contribute positively to the carbon balance as sinks, thereby mitigating climate change impacts. Therefore, not only XCO2 but also CO2 flux are directly related to changes in land use and land cover (LULC) in complex systems that are affected by climatic variables and processes, such as photosynthesis and soil respiration.

TI  - Evaluation of the effects of land-use change and increasing deforestation in the Sapanca Basin on total suspended solids (TSS) movement with predictive models
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sapanca Lake is a tectonically sourced freshwater resource and one of the rare natural water resources used as a source of drinking water. This study examined the change of land use and lake area in the natural water source basin subjected to human pressure for years. Landsat 5 TM (1987) and Landsat 8 TM (2010) satellite images were used. Satellite images were analyzed using ArcGIS 10.1 software. As a result of the analysis, it was observed that the natural vegetation was significantly destroyed between 1987 and 2010. Besides, the bathymetry maps of Lake Sapanca belonging to the years 1990 and 2010 were also examined, and accordingly, it was determined that there was a 2% reduction in the lake surface area. The decrease in the volume of the lake was thought to be due to sedimentation movement caused by land-use change, and the total amount of suspended solids, grain size, discharge, and temperature measurements were made between 2012 and 2014 in 12 streams which are sources of Sapanca Lake. Sediment prediction models have been developed under two different scenarios using measurement data from side streams. Artificial neural networks (ANN), Sediment rating curve, and multiple linear regression models were examined within the scenario models, and comparisons were made between the models. It was determined that ANN achieved the closest results with the measurement data.

TI  - Assessment of Coastal Water Quality Parameters Along Mangaluru Region from AVIRIS-NG Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the ISRO-NASA joint program, airborne hyperspectral campaign and simultaneous in situ data collection were conducted along the Mangaluru coastal region with the objective to understand the water quality parameters along the coastal water of the region. A Semi-Analytical remote sensing reflectance model (SA model) has been used to simulate the reflectance spectra of the coastal waters. In situ measured suspended particulate matter (SPM) and bottom depth was given as input to the model, and look up table of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), colour dissolve organic matter (CDOM), backscattering coefficient of SPM (bb(SPM)) and absorption coefficient of Chl-a (a(Chl-a)) within an appropriate range were used to optimise the model. The model-derived spectra are then compared with the field-measured spectra. The set of water quality parameters are then optimised based on Spectral angle mapper (SAM) value and minimum euclidean distance (ED) between two spectra. A high variability of backscattering to scattering ratio of suspended sediments is observed and is inferred to play an important role in modulating reflectance spectra along the coastal water of Mangaluru. We then applied the parameterised SA model in an inverse mode on AVIRIS-NG image with input of spatially varying backscattering coefficient of SPM from Landsat 8 to generate map of optically active water quality parameters. The procedure is carried out without any further input of in situ data. The results clearly show the heterogeneous variations of coastal waters influenced by local mixing of river and ocean waters under the tidal and wind forces.

TI  - Assessment of long and short-term flood risk using the multi-criteria analysis model with the AHP-Entropy method in Poyang Lake basin
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - China suffers the most serious loss of life and property with the most floods in the world. In this study, a multi-criteria analysis model with the combined analytic hierarchy process and Entropy weight method (AHP-Entropy) was proposed to assess the long and short-term flood risk in Poyang Lake basin, and results were verified by several flood events that happened on July 2020. Considering multi-factors of flood risk, six flood hazard factors (namely, maximum three-day rainfall (RMAX3), annual average rainstorm frequency (RF), annual average rainstorm amount (ARA), drainage density (DD), slope, elevation (DEM)) and four flood vulnerability factors (namely, population density (PD), land use pattern (LUP), GDP, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)) were selected and weights of them were derived from the AHP-Entropy method. Results show that PD (0.168), RMAX3 (0.163), LUP (0.146), GDP (0.129), and RF (0.111) play a vital role in the results of flood risk assessment. Spatially, the long and short-term flood risk maps are shown to have similar characteristics with correlation coefficient of 0.9056. Areas with high risk and very high risk account for 19.6% of the total area in the long-term flood risk map and increased to 22.2% in the short-term flood risk map. Overall, the northeastern parts of the Poyang Lake basin are more prone to floods and the flood risk gradually decreases from the Poyang Lake towards the surrounding areas. Verification of the results with Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data shows that the flood risk assessment model has an accuracy of more than 50% in very high risk zones for floods, and more than 90% for high and very high risk floods, which showed that the presented model is reliable in flood risk assessment.

TI  - Comprehensive Analysis for Long-Term Hydrological Simulation by Deep Learning Techniques and Remote Sensing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological simulation plays a very important role in understanding the hydrological processes and is of great significance to flood forecasting and optimal allocation of water resources in the watershed. The development of deep learning techniques has brought new opportunities and methods for long-term hydrological simulation research at the watershed scale. Different from traditional hydrological models, the application of deep learning techniques in the hydrological field has greatly promoted the development trend of runoff prediction and provides a new paradigm for hydrological simulation. In this study, a CNN-LSTM model based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and a CNN-GRU model based on CNN and gated recurrent unit (GRN) are constructed to study the watershed hydrological processes. To compare the performance of deep learning techniques and the hydrological model, we also constructed the distributed hydrological model: Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model based on remote sensing data. These models were applied to the Xixian Basin, and the promising results had been achieved, which verified the rationality of the method, with the majority of percent bias error (PBE) values ranging between 3.17 and 13.48, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values ranging between 0.63 and 0.91, and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) values ranging between 0.70 and 0.90 on a monthly scale. The results demonstrated their strong ability to learn complex hydrological processes. The results also indicated that the proposed deep learning models could provide the certain decision support for the water environment management at the watershed scale, which was of great significance to improve the hydrological disaster prediction ability and was conducive to the sustainable development of water resources.

TI  - Morphology of sporadic E layers derived from Fengyun-3C GPS radio occultation measurements
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) data provided by the Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) mission during January 2015 to December 2019 are used to detect the existence of sporadic E (Es) layers over the globe, based on which the spatial and temporal distributions of the Es occurrence rates (ORs) are presented and analyzed. The results are compared with the Es morphology obtained using the RO data from the Constellation Observing System for the Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) mission. It is found that the seasonal variation patterns of the spatial distributions of Es ORs derived from the FY-3C RO data, which show clearly the effects of wind shear mechanism and the Earth's magnetic field on the formation of Es layers, are basically consistent with those derived from the COSMIC RO data. While the limited local time distribution of the FY-3C RO-detected Es occurrences makes it impossible to resolve the complete diurnal variations of Es layers. Detailed comparisons of the Es morphologies derived from the two different RO missions reveal that the magnitudes of the Es ORs derived by FY-3C data are slightly smaller than those derived by COSMIC data in the middle and low latitudes, which is due to that the top heights of the 50 Hz RO data of FY-3C mission are generally lower than those of the COSMIC mission. In the polar regions, the distinctly low ratio of the FY-3C RO 50 Hz measurements which reach the height of 90 km reduces the capability of these observations for Es-layer detections.

TI  - Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Syndromic Surveillance Program Data to Monitor Trends in US Emergency Department Visits for Firearm Injuries, 2018 to 2019
T2  - ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Study objective: We describe trends in emergency department (ED) visits for initial firearm injury encounters in the United States.Methods: Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Syndromic Surveillance Program, we analyzed monthly and yearly trends in ED visit rates involving a firearm injury (calculated as the number of firearm injury-related ED visits divided by the total number of ED visits for each month and multiplied by 100,000) by sex-specific age group and US region from 2018 to 2019 and conducted Joinpoint regression to detect trend significance.Results: Among approximately 215 million ED visits captured in the National Syndromic Surveillance Program from January 2018 to December 2019, 132,767 involved a firearm injury (61.6 per 100,000 ED visits). Among males, rates of firearm injury-related ED visits significantly increased for all age groups between 15 and 64 years during the study period. Among females, rates of firearm injury-related ED visits significantly increased for all age groups between 15 and 54 years during the study period. By region, rates significantly changed in the northeast, southeast, and southwest for males and females during the study period.Conclusion: These analyses highlight a novel data source for monitoring trends in ED visits for firearm injuries. With increased and effective use of state and local syndromic surveillance data, in addition to improvements to firearm injury syndrome definitions by intent, public health professionals could better detect unusual patterns of firearm injuries across the United States for improved prevention and tailored response efforts.

TI  - Predicting the impacts of land use/land cover changes on seasonal urban thermal characteristics using machine learning algorithms
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and land surface temperatures (LST) contribute significantly to the formation and intensity of urban heat islands (UHI) effects. The urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) can effectively describe any city's UHI (thermal characteristics) effect. This study aims to assess and predict the seasonal (summer and winter) UTFVI scenario to evaluate the thermal characteristics of Sylhet city, Bangladesh. Landsat 4-5 TM and 8 OLI images from 1995 to 2020 were used to assess the previous status of LULC and UTFVI and predict the future changes for 2025 and 2030 using cellular automata and artificial neural network machine learning algorithms. Prediction results indicate a substantial increase in urban built-up areas by 42% and 44% in 2025 and 2035, followed by reductions in green cover (21% and 22%), bare land (20% and 21%) and water bodies (1%). The rapid expansion of built-up areas will lead to 13 km2 and 14 km2 stronger UTFVI zones in the predicted years. The study provides effective strategies for mitigating the UTFVI effects by avoiding dense infrastructural development, increasing plantation and water bodies, rooftop gardening and using white colour roofs in construction. The findings of this study will allow the urban planners, policymakers and local government to ensure an eco-friendly, inclusive and sustainable urban development through functional modification and replacement of the LULC distribution depending on the present and future circumstances.

TI  - Wide-area ground deformation monitoring in geothermal fields in western Turkey
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The large-scale production and injection of geothermal fluids induce pressure, volume, and temperature gradient changes in the subsurface, which may result in surface deformation as well. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a promising utility for monitoring ground surface deformation and inferring subsurface reservoir operations that are difficult to observe directly. This study provides the first wide-area InSAR-derived long-term ground deformation across major geothermal fields in western Turkey. It aims to identify ground deformation hotspots within the geothermal exploitation sites and analyze their relationship with energy production and pumping. In the present study, the whole 2014???2020 Sentinel 1-A and 1-B SAR archive available over the region along ascending and descending orbits was processed using the persistent scatterer interferometry (PS-InSAR) technique. Compaction and land subsidence hot spots caused by fluid withdrawal are found within the geothermal fields. The results indicate that the observed systematic surface subsidence deformation result from the increase of geothermal production during the observation period in western Turkey. The real -time power data of geothermal plants retrieved from the transparency platform of the Turkish energy exchange are related to surface deformation. We estimated the drainage area of the production wells using subsidence deformation, caused by pore pressure decline in the reservoir. The results provide supporting evidence for the systematic monitoring and identification of deformation patterns in spatial-temporal extend can reveal reservoir dynamics and compartments, which are crucial for reservoir characterization and field development plan.

TI  - The Effect of MIPS, Headform Condition, and Impact Orientation on Headform Kinematics Across a Range of Impact Speeds During Oblique Bicycle Helmet Impacts
T2  - ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bicycle helmets are designed to attenuate both the linear and rotational response of the head during an oblique impact. Here we sought to quantify how the effectiveness of one popular rotation-attenuating system (MIPS) varied across 3 test headform conditions (bare, covered in stockings, and hair), 3 oblique impact orientations, and 4 impact speeds. We conducted 72 freefall drop tests of a single helmet model with and without MIPS onto a 45 degrees angled anvil and measured the peak linear (PLA) and angular acceleration (PAA) and computed the angular velocity change (PAV) and brain injury criterion (BrIC). Across all headform conditions, MIPS reduced PAA and PAV by 38.2 and 33.2% respectively during X-axis rotation, 47.4 and 38.1% respectively during Y-axis rotation, and 22.9 and 20.5% during a combined ZY-axis rotation. Across all impact orientations, PAA was reduced by 39% and PAV by 32.4% with the bare headform while adding stockings reduced PAA and PAV by 41.6 and 36% respectively and the hair condition reduced PAA and PAV by 30.2 and 24.4% respectively. In addition, our data reveal the importance of using consistent headform conditions when evaluating the effect of helmet systems designed to attenuate head rotations during oblique impacts.

TI  - Timeliness in forest change monitoring: A new assessment framework demonstrated using Sentinel-1 and a continuous change detection algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of near-real time forest monitoring systems, which are used to create alerts for events such as logging or fire, often involves tradeoffs between accuracy and timeliness. In the context of forest monitoring, timeliness is measured by the lag between when a change occurs in the forest and the creation of an alert about the event. Conventional accuracy assessments quantify both false negative and false positive errors in change maps, but do not specify those rates as a function of lag. Recent near real-time (NRT) accuracy assessment methods summarize the relationship between lag and correctly identified change events, but do not integrate consideration of changes mapped where they have not occurred. Here, we propose an assessment framework that we call "Sigmoid Accuracy", which characterizes forest change detection accuracy as it relates to timeliness. Using a change monitoring algorithm that applies the Continuous Change Detection and Classification algorithm (CCDC) to Sentinel-1 radar data in Madagascar, we demonstrate how the assessment framework can be used to calculate a lag-dependent F1-Score to create a sigmoidal curve describing system performance as it relates to the time since a change event. We introduce two new performance metrics that define key moments along this curve: "Initial Delay", or the minimum time required to create an alert as observed in reference data, and the "Level Off Point", or the lag at which accuracy stabilizes. Our framework accommodates varying assessment designs, as demonstrated using pixel-, block-, and event-based agreement for the response design. These metrics provide a holistic way to evaluate and compare the usefulness of forest monitoring systems in real-world applications.

TI  - Strategies for monitoring within-field soybean yield using Sentinel-2 Vis-NIR-SWIR spectral bands and machine learning regression methods
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soybean crop plays an important role in world food production and food security, and agricultural production should be increased accordingly to meet the global food demand. Satellite remote sensing data is considered a promising proxy for monitoring and predicting yield. This research aimed to evaluate strategies for monitoring within-field soybean yield using Sentinel-2 visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared (Vis/NIR/SWIR) spectral bands and partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector regression (SVR) methods. Soybean yield maps (over 500 ha) were recorded by a combine harvester with a yield monitor in 15 fields (3 farms) in Parana State, southern Brazil. Sentinel-2 images (spectral bands and 8 vegetation indices) across a cropping season were correlated to soybean yield. Information pooled across the cropping season presented better results compared to single images, with best performance of Vis/NIR/SWIR spectral bands under PLSR and SVR. At the grain filling stage, field-, farm- and global-based models were evaluated and presented similar trends compared to leaf-based hyperspectral reflectance collected at the Brazilian National Soybean Research Center. SVR outperformed PLSR, with a strong correlation between observed and predicted yield. For within-field soybean yield mapping, field-based SVR models (developed individually for each field) presented the highest accuracies. The results obtained demonstrate the possibility of developing within-field yield prediction models using Sentinel-2 Vis/NIR/SWIR bands through machine learning methods.

TI  - Evaluation and Application of Fengyun-4A/LMI Data in Tropical Cyclone Monitoring Over the Southeast Coast of China
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking 8 tropical cyclones (TCs) in 2018 as examples, the data quality and the application potential of Fengyun-4 A (FY-4 A) Lightning Mapping Imager (LMI) in monitoring lightning activity and analyzing the relationship between lightning activity and TC intensity are investigated and evaluated over the southeast coast of China. A comparison shows that the diurnal variation and the radial spatial distribution of lightning activity from FY-4 A/LMI data, and the relationship between FY-4 A/LMI lightning activity and tropical cyclone (TC) intensity are mainly consistent with the existing ground-based observations. FY-4 A/LMI data are further utilized to analyze some issues that are controversial or contradictory in the existing studies, and results show that there are obvious differences in the spatial distribution of TC lightning between land and sea. When TC is located on the sea and the land, lightning activity presents a radial spatial distribution of high-low-high and low-medium-high, respectively. Higher lightning density is mainly concentrated in the west and south side of TC track. During the change of TC intensity, the lightning activity in the outer rainband continues to be active, but the lightning activity in the eyewall region may be a better indicator for the early warning of TC intensity. We conclude that FY-4 A/LMI has good performance and practical potential in TC lightning monitoring and early warning.

TI  - Mapping 33 years of sugarcane evolution in Sa∼o Paulo state, Brazil, using landsat imagery and generalized space-time classifiers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques can help estimate large sugarcane areas in order to support sustainable planning and management for the sugarcane industry, as well as in the context of environmental monitoring. In this study, four generalized space-time classifiers of high-resolution satellite images were tested in Sao Paulo State (SP) in order to map out sugarcane areas over the course of 33 years. These classification models were created based on the random forest (RF) algorithm, using Landsat historical imagery from 1986 to 2019 as input data. Models were calibrated with reference data under the sugarcane and "other uses" classes over 10 sites across the state of Sa tilde o Paulo and applied to the entire state area. The four models differed in their use of input data from the different Landsat sensors. The Dice Coefficient (DC) accuracies across sites ranged between 0.60 and 0.90. The best model employed data from all sensors and was calibrated with data from 6 consecutive years. When this model was applied on independent years, the DC values averaged at 0.82. The sugarcane areas estimated from satellite imagery demonstrated a notable correlation with areas estimated from reference Canasat maps (R2 = 0.91), data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (R2 = 0.92), and data from the Brazilian National Supply Company (R2 = 0.73). The general trend was a large increase in sugarcane areas starting in the early 90s up until 2015, and a trend toward stabilization, and even small decreases, after 2015. This study showed that a single classification model trained on 6 years of data allowed for the accurate monitoring of sugarcane areas over 33 years, without the tedious and timeconsuming work of re-calibrating the classifier for previous or new years. Year-to-year accu racy, however, largely depended on the availability and quality of Landsat imagery. The results were applicable to the monitoring of sugarcane areas over large areas and numerous years, which could assist the sugarcane energy sector.

M3  - Article
AB  - Comprehensive air quality model with extensions (CAMx)-decoupled direct method (DDM) was used to simulate ozone-NO x -VOCs sensitivity of for May???November in 2016???2018 in China. Based on the relationship between the simulated ozone (O 3 ) sensitivity values and the ratio of formaldehyde (HCHO) to NO 2 (FNR) and the ratio of production rate of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to production rate of nitric acid (HNO 3 ) ( P H 2 O 2 /P HN O 3 ), the localized range of FNR and P H 2 O 2 /P HN O 3 thresholds in different regions in China were obtained. The overall simulated FNR values are about 1.640???2.520, and P H 2 O 2 /P HN O 3 values are about 0.540???0.830 for the transition regime. Model simulated O 3 sensitivities or region specific FNR or P H 2 O 2 /P HN O 3 thresholds should be applied to ensure the accurate local O 3 sensitivity regimes. Using the tropospheric column FNR values from ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) satellite data as an indicator with the simulated threshold values, the spatial distributions of O 3 formation regimes in China are determined. The O 3 sensitivity regimes from eastern to central China are gradually from VOC-limited, transition to NO x -limited spatially, and moving toward to transition or NO x -limited regime from 2005 to 2019 temporally. ?? 2022 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Effects of different sources and spatial resolutions of environmental covariates on predicting soil organic carbon using machine learning in a semi-arid region of Iran
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of this study was to consider and compare the effects of different spatial resolutions of covariates from different sources on predicting SOC in a semi-arid region located in the west of Iran. For this purpose, 67 topsoil samples (0-30 cm) with the measured SOC contents were used as the dependent variable. The covariates controlling the SOC content from different sources were provided in two scenarios. For the first scenario (scenario I), six covariate sets with spatial resolution ranging from 2 to 30 m, and original and aggregated pixel sizes were prepared using the digital elevation models (DEMs) and remote sensing data to predict SOC. In the second scenario (scenario II), the available legacy data, including geology, land use and soil texture maps, were prepared with compatible spatial resolution and added to each covariate set provided for scenario I. After feature selection analysis, the modelling processes were performed using two machine learning models, namely, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results of performance analysis, as obtained by leave one out cross validation (LOOCV), showed that the RF and covariate set B (with 10 m spatial resolution) in scenario I, with R-2 = 0.21, CCC = 0.41, MAE = 0.26 and RMSE = 0.34%, and also, in scenario II, with R-2 = 0.32, CCC = 0.51, MAE = 0.24, and RMSE = 0.32%, had a better performance in predicting SOC. In addition, the remote sensing data were identified as the most important variables controlling the spatial distribution of SOC. Finally, by using the RF model as the superior model, the SOC map provided by the covariate set B in scenario II, which was the combination of the three types of covariates (DEM, remote sensing data and legacy data), was shown to have the lowest uncertainty in comparison to the SOC provided by the covariate set B in scenario I. In general, our results showed that the model type, source, resolution and the combination of these variables could greatly influence the prediction outputs. In fact, the SOC map provided with the combination of parsimonious variables at the optimal pixel size could help decision-making in environmental resources management.

TI  - Development and validation of a new MODIS snow-cover-extent product over China
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on MOD09GA/MYD09GA surface reflectance data, a new MODIS snow-cover-extent (SCE) product from 2000 to 2020 over China has been produced by the Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources (NIEER), Chinese Academy of Sciences. The NIEER MODIS SCE product contains two preliminary clear-sky SCE datasets - Terra-MODIS and Aqua-MODIS SCE datasets and a final daily cloud-gap-filled (CGF) SCE dataset. The first two datasets are generated mainly through optimizing snow-cover discriminating rules over land-cover types, and the latter dataset is produced after a series of gapfilling processes such as aggregating the two preliminary datasets, reducing cloud gaps with adjacent information in space and time, and eliminating all gaps with auxiliary data. The validation against 362 China Meteorological Administration (CMA) stations shows that during snow seasons the overall accuracy (OA) values of the three datasets are larger than 93 %, all of the omission error (OE) values are constrained within 9 %, and all of the commission error (CE) values are constrained within 10 %. Bias values of 0.98, 1.02, and 1.03 demonstrate on a whole that there is no significant overestimation nor a significant underestimation. Based on the same ground reference data, we found that the new product accuracies are obviously higher than standard MODIS snow products, especially for Aqua-MODIS and CGF SCE. For example, compared with the CE of 23.78 % that the MYD10A1 product shows, the CE of the new Aqua-MODIS SCE dataset is 6.78 %; the OA of the new CGF SCE dataset is up to 93.15 % versus 89.54 % of MOD10A1F product and 84.36 % of MYD10A1F product. Besides, as expected, snow discrimination in forest areas is also improved significantly. An isolated validation at four forest CMA stations demonstrates that the OA has increased by 3-10 percentage points, the OE has dropped by 1-8 percentage points, and the CE has dropped by 4-21 percentage points. Therefore, our product has virtually provided more reliable snow knowledge over China; thereby, it can better serve for hydrological, climatic, environmental, and other related studies there.

TI  - The global thermophysical properties of (433) Eros
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present results from a shape-based, rotationally-resolved thermophysical model of near-Earth asteroid (433) Eros, using reflected and near-IR spectra collected at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) over 18 nights (25 disk-integrated spectra in total) from 2009 to 2019. The data sample a variety of viewing geometries, illumination angles, and rotational phases and therefore allow us to characterize Eros's surface physical properties in detail, particularly at wavelengths in the thermal near-IR regime (lambda > 3.5 mu m) that were not measured by the NEAR Shoemaker mission. Eros's shape, spin state, density, albedo, and other physical properties measured by NEAR were incorporated into our model, leaving thermal inertia and surface roughness as free parameters. We find that a thermal inertia range of 100-150 J m(-2) K-1 s(-1/2) and a roughness crater fraction of 0.3-0.4 with crater opening angle 130 degrees (equivalent adirectional rms slope angle of 32 degrees +/- 4 degrees) fit data from 18 spectra at the 1s level, but do not fit the remaining 7 spectra. This suggests that Eros's thermal properties vary over its surface, which has important implications for linking remote sensing data to spacecraft measurements of the physical properties of near-Earth asteroids.

TI  - A comprehensive review of remote sensing platforms, sensors, and applications in nut crops
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Due to their high protein content, nuts (almond, walnut, and pistachio) are among the main substitutes for meat, with a growing share of the food basket in the United States. However, the rapidly growing acreage of these crops, new legislations, the necessity of minimizing the environmental footprint, and a costeffective production demand certain managerial practices based on precision agriculture and remote sensing, which have shown promising results in food production. Scope and approach: This paper presents a comprehensive review of remote sensing platforms, sensors, applications, and analytic pipelines with a focus on nut crops, even though the materials are applicable for other specialty crops. In this regard, the paper is divided into five main sections: First, the problems and potential solutions are elaborated in the introduction. Second, the available platforms: satellites, manned aircraft, and UASs are discussed. Then the sensors used for remote sensing, their working principle, and the pros and cons of each are presented. Next, practiced and suggested applications of remote sensing data are reviewed. Finally, data processing and analytics needed to produce and interpret reliable results are highlighted.Key findings and conclusions: Key findings are listed as: 1) The acreage of the nut orchards and the purpose of the studies determine the fitting sensor and platform. 2) Although various sensors are available and reported to have promising results in other crops, they have not been used for nut crops. 3) Accurate sensor calibration is crucial for repeatable results as well as temporal and inter-field comparisons. 4) Except for water management, most remote sensing applications are limitedly studied in nut orchards, creating some research opportunities. 5) Finally, increasing data size requires new machine learning techniques and data fusion frameworks to handle all variables and fill the knowledge gap.

TI  - Long-term climatology and spatial trends of absorption, scattering, and total aerosol optical depths over East Africa during 2001-2019
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The unprecedented increase in anthropogenic activities, coupled with the prevailing climatic conditions, has increased the aerosol load over East Africa (EA). Given this, the present study examined the trends in total, absorption, scattering, and total aerosol extinction optical depth (TAOD, AAOD, SAOD, and TAEOD) over EA, alongside trends in single scattering albedo (SSA). For this purpose, the AOD of different optical properties retrieved from multiple sensors and the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) model between January 2001 to December 2019 were utilized to estimate trends and assess their statistical significance. The spatial patterns of seasonal mean AOD from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor and MERRA-2 model were generally characterized with high (>0.35) and low (<0.2) AOD centers over EA observed during the local dry and wet seasons, respectively. Also, the spatial trend analysis revealed a general increase in TAOD, being positive and significant over the arid and semi-arid zones of the northeastern part of EA, which is majorly dominated by locally derived dust. The local dry (wet) months generally experienced positive (negative) trends in TAOD, associated with seasonal cycles of rainfall. High and significant positive trends in AAOD were dominated over the study domain, attributed to an increased amount of biomass burning, variations in soil moisture, and changes in the rainfall pattern. The trends in TAEOD showed a distinct pattern, except over some months that depicted significant increasing trends attributed to changes in climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities. At last, the study domain exhibited decreasing trends in SSA, signifying strong absorption of direct solar radiation resulting in a warming effect. The study revealed patterns of trends in aerosol optical properties and forms the basis for further research in aerosols over EA.

TI  - Trauma re-engagement and PTSD in older medically ill veterans: implications for trauma-informed care
T2  - AGING & MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Objectives We characterize rates and correlates of PTSD and of trauma re-engagement without PTSD in medically ill older Veterans, as well as supportive strategies, with the goal of advancing trauma-informed care. Methods We interviewed medically ill older Veterans (N = 88, M age 75.13, SD = 6.14) with primary care screening measures for PTSD and trauma re-engagement, and open-ended questions to assess supportive strategies. Results One-fifth (20.5%) presented with probable PTSD, associated with greater trauma exposures (r=.57, p<.001), whereas two-fifths (43.2%) reported re-engagement with military memories without PTSD, associated with having a spouse/partner (t = 2.27, p=.028). Of those who experienced trauma, half reported thinking more about the trauma recently and becoming more emotional on certain days. In response to the question 'What gives you strength as you think about the future with your illness' Veterans described support of family, healthcare, worldview, personal control, acceptance, and health behaviors. Conclusion Memories of trauma are common with medical illness. Age-friendly trauma-informed care could consider factors that patients describe as sources of strength with illness.

TI  - A novel model to accurately predict continental-scale timing of forest green-up
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The yearly cycles in vegetation greenness are among the most important drivers of ecosystem processes. Predictive models for the timing of vegetation greenup and senescence are crucial for understanding how biological communities respond to global change. Greenup timing is closely tied to climate and also tracks yearly variability in temperature, and the strength of this relationship varies spatiotemporally. Local studies have been useful in understanding underlying mechanisms but they are insufficient in explaining larger scale variabilities. Largescale studies using remotely-sensed data have the potential to harness regional dynamics, even if underlying mechanisms remain unknown, Yet predictive power using these approaches is low. Here, we predict vegetation phenology across Eastern North America via a novel class of Bayesian regression model. Our modeling framework provides continental-level peak greenup time predictions with high accuracy using satellite observations from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In addition to taking into account temporal structure at individual sites, our models make use of information from the entire study extent regardless of their spatial proximity. Models were built from 2000 to 2016 and showed high prediction accuracy (R-2 > 95%). Out-of-sample predictions for the years 2017 and 2018 showed accuracy within days of the predicted peaks, even though yearly greenup timing can vary by up to 30 days across the study region. Performance was remarkably high across deciduous and mixed forest types. Our method is generalizable to temperate forests across the globe and provides a basis for backcasting and forecasting forest greenup for any time periods where daily temperatures, whether directly measured or modeled, are available.

TI  - A low-cost approach for soil moisture prediction using multi-sensor data and machine learning algorithm
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A high-resolution soil moisture prediction method has recently gained its importance in various fields such as forestry, agricultural and land management. However, accurate, robust and non-cost prohibitive spatially monitoring of soil moisture is challenging. In this research, a new approach involving the use of advance machine learning (ML) models, and multi-sensor data fusion including Sentinel-1(S1) C-band dual polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral data, and ALOS Global Digital Surface Model (ALOS DSM) to predict precisely soil mois-ture at 10 m spatial resolution across research areas in Australia. The total of 52 predictor variables generated from S1, S2 and ALOS DSM data fusion, including vegetation indices, soil indices, water index, SAR transformation indices, ALOS DSM derived indices like digital model elevation (DEM), slope, and topographic wetness index (TWI). The field soil data from Western Australia was employed. The performance capability of extreme gradient boosting regres-sion (XGBR) together with the genetic algorithm (GA) optimizer for features selection and optimization for soil mois-ture prediction in bare lands was examined and compared with various scenarios and ML models. The proposed model (the XGBR-GA model) with 21 optimal features obtained from GA was yielded the highest performance (R-2 = 0.891; RMSE = 0.875%) compared to random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine (SVM), and CatBoost gradient boosting regression (CBR). Conclusively, the new approach using the XGBR-GA with features from combination of reliable free-of-charge remotely sensed data from Sentinel and ALOS imagery can effectively estimate the spatial variability of soil moisture. The described framework can further support precision agriculture and drought resilience programs via water use efficiency and smart irrigation management for crop production.

TI  - Eco-biophysical indicators to ascertain the sustainability aspect of world's primitive hills range using time-series MODIS data products
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In India's semi-arid climatic zone, the Aravalli hills range is an ecotone between the Thar Desert and the Gangetic plain, covering about 10% of the forest cover of Western India. Notably, the upper range of the hills has a high population density; this range has encountered substantial areal transformation in the last five decades. However, we believe that the enhancement of green cover within this range has occurred primarily due to discontinuous degradation within the entire range, without geographical alteration. We use MODIS products to compare and contrast spatiotemporal ecological dynamics between different sub-ranges (upper, middle, and lower) of Aravalli between 2000 and 2019. Specifically, we adopt seven eco-biophysical parameters that include EVI, LAI, PTC, PNTV, ET, NPP, and LST. Pixel-based time-series trend evaluation for MODIS imagery composite within the GEE platform, using the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression method identified that forest enhancement is experienced in some parts of different ranges. We also observed some human-induced factors and natural stressors that could possibly be responsible for forest health dynamics. Thus, we suggest sustainable planning and policy changes for people who are under anthropocentric stress; this we believe, would help management practices.

TI  - Axillary lymphadenectomy in dogs: A description of surgical technique
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The axillary lymph center drains a large area; however, axillary lymphadenectomy is rarely reported in series detailing lymph node extirpation in dogs. No surgical technique has yet been described for axillary and superficial axillary lymphadenectomy. This study describes a technique for excision of nodes in the axillary lymph center of the dog. Two male neutered and two male intact cadavers weighing between 6.3 and 36.1 kg were used. With cadavers in dorsal recumbency and the shoulder extended, an incision was made in the caudal axillary region. Blunt dissection was used to separate the pectoralis profundus and latissimus dorsi muscles and loose connective tissue was dissected until the axillary lymph node was identified caudal to the brachial vein. The axillary lymphatic trunk was followed caudad from the axillary lymph node to identify the accessory axillary lymph node, deep to the lateral border of the pectoralis profundus muscle, for subsequent extirpation. Axillary lymph nodes were successfully removed in all axillae, and accessory axillary lymph nodes were located in 6/7 axillae and could not be visualized within the axillary lymphatic trunk in the remaining axilla. The described surgical technique allowed consistent identification of the axillary lymph node and the lymphatic trunk associated with the accessory axillary lymph node. This technique description provides a guide for surgeons to facilitate axillary and accessory axillary lymphadenectomy in the dog. While anatomic variation must be considered, the use of the axillary lymphatic trunk as a landmark may simplify identification of the small and inconsistent accessory axillary lymph node.

TI  - Socioeconomic inequalities and the surface heat island distribution in Santiago, Chile
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) are an important socio-environmental problem associated with large cities, such as the Santiago Metropolitan Area (SMA), in Chile. Here, we analyze daytime and nighttime variations of SUHIs for each season of the year during the period 2000-2020. To evaluate socioeconomic inequities in the distribution of SUHIs, we establish statistical relationships with socioeconomic status, land price, and urban vegetation. We use the MODIS satellite images to obtain the land surface temperatures and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) through the Google Earth Engine platform. The results indicate more intense SUHIs during the nighttime in the eastern sector, coinciding with higher socioeconomic status and larger green areas. This area during the day is cooler than the rest of the city. The areas with lower and middle socioeconomic status suffer more intense SUHIs (daytime and nighttime) and match poor environmental and urban qualities. These results show the high segregation of SMA. Urban planning is subordinated to land prices with a structure maintained over the study period. The lack of social-climate justice is unsustainable, and such inequalities maybe exacerbated in the context of climate change. Thus, these results can contribute to the planning of the SMA.

TI  - Detection method for <i>Convallaria keiskei</i> colonies in Hokkaido, Japan, by combining CNN and FCM using UAV-based remote sensing data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Convallaria keiskei, a plant species indigenous to Japan, is on the verge of extinction. In the past, they have been manually protected and managed. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are already being applied in various fields, such as agriculture, surveying, and logistics, can be applied to automate this task. Image processing and machine learning techniques applied on images obtained from UAVs can automate Convallaria keiskei classification, help to estimate the increase in colony numbers, and reduce the detection cost. In a previous study, a flower number estimation method that combines image processing and a convolutional neural network (CNN) was proposed. However, leaf regions similar to flower regions were misidentified as flower regions, and the accuracy was reduced. Therefore, in this study, a method was investigated to reduce the number of false positives by excluding areas similar to the flower regions. Specifically, a novel detection method combining image processing, CNN, and fuzzy c-means is proposed. To validate the proposed method, it was compared with the previous method as well as the method in which k-means was used instead of fuzzy c-means. All results were evaluated using flower distribution maps marked by field workers. The proposed method improved the F-measure by up to 22.0% compared with the previous method. Application of the proposed method to orthorectified images facilitates the understanding of flower populations over a wide range of areas, which can contribute to the conservation and management of the species.

TI  - Ethical concepts in Russian Marxism of the first quarter of the twentieth century: A. Bogdanov, L. Aksel'rod, A. Lunacharsky
T2  - STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
M3  - Article
AB  - At the beginning of the twentieth century, Russian Marxism, which was rapidly gaining intellectual and political influence, faced the need to develop its ethical concepts, since the "atheistic ethics," represented by the philosophy of Russian narodniki and European social democrats, were found to be ideologically unacceptable. The subject of this article is an attempt to comprehend the moral problems addressed in the heterogeneous circles of Russian Marxism in the first three decades of the twentieth century. The concepts introduced by A. Bogdanov, L. Aksel'rod, and A. Lunacharsky played a critical role in this context. If Bogdanov proclaimed historical legality and morality as such to be forms of ideological consciousness that would be abolished in the course of social evolution, then Aksel'rod sought to defend and justify a universalist understanding of morality, faced with the need to reconcile this understanding with the key provisions of historical materialism. Lunacharsky, finally, found himself in an equally difficult situation, trying to reconcile the position of the self-sufficiency of the Marxist worldview with the obvious, as it seemed to him, need for its "ethical supplement" and finding a solution in peculiar identification of the ethical and the aesthetic. These attempts reflect a peculiarity of the development of Russian Marxism. In the field of ethics, in particular, it followed a path that could be described as one of narrowing interpretations, as a result of which a more heuristically simple and unambiguous version of the theory was created.

TI  - Estimating generalized measures of local neighbourhood context from multispectral satellite images using a convolutional neural network
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The increased availability of high-resolution multispectral imagery captured by remote sensing platforms provides new opportunities for the characterisation and differentiation of urban context. The discovery of generalized latent representations from such data are however under researched within the social sciences. As such, this paper exploits advances in machine learning to implement a new method of capturing measures of urban context from multispectral satellite imagery at a very small area level through the application of a convolutional autoencoder (CAE). The utility of outputs from the CAE is enhanced through the application of spatial weighting, and the smoothed outputs are then summarised using cluster analysis to generate a typology comprising seven groups describing salient patterns of differentiated urban context. The limits of the technique are discussed with reference to the resolution of the satellite data utilised within the study and the interaction between the geography of the input data and the learned structure. The method is implemented within the context of Great Britain, however, is applicable to any location where similar high resolution multispectral imagery are available.

TI  - High temporal and spatial resolution PM<sub>2.5</sub> dataset acquisition and pollution assessment based on FY-4A TOAR data and deep forest model in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to urbanization and industrialization, PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 mu m) pollution has become a serious environmental problem. The low spatial resolution and insufficient coverage of PM2.5 observation stations affect research on pollution causes and human health risks. With the launch of FY-4A, new generation of Chinese geostationary weather satellites, it is possible to obtain PM2.5 with high temporal and spatial resolution covering all China. In this study, FY-4A top-of-the-atmosphere reflectance data, meteorological factors, and geographic information were input into the deep forest (DF) model to obtain the hourly PM2.5 in China. The samples based 10-fold cross validation of DF with an hourly R2 of 0.83-0.88, and the root mean square error is 8.81-14.7 mu g/m3, while the R2 of the 10-fold cross validation result based on sites was 0.77. The monthly (R2 = 0.98) and seasonal (R2 = 0.99) estimated results showed high consistency with the observations. Feature importance showed that the contribution of estimated features to the model varies with regions and seasons. Estimation results indicated the substantial spatiotemporal differences in PM2.5, and pollution was the highest between 09:00-10:00 and then gradually decreased. Regions with highest pollution of PM2.5 in China were mainly distributed in the Tarim Basin and Central China. The pollution assessment results in China indicated that: 1) In more than 80% of the winter days PM2.5 was higher than the World Health Organization interim target 3 (37.5 mu g/m3); 2) The bimodal distribution of PM2.5 indicated that there are obvious differences in pollution between cities and suburbs; 3) In autumn and winter, the regions where population-weighted PM2.5 was higher than IT-3 were mainly in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Central China, Guanzhong Plain, Sichuan Basin, and Yangtze River Delta. Our results showed that FY-4A has advantages of high resolution and coverage and thus shows great potential for estimating pollutants.

TI  - Oil Spill Candidate Detection Using a Conditional Random Field Model on Simulated Compact Polarimetric Imagery
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the compact polarimetric (CP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) offers new opportunities for oil spill candidate detection, there has not been an efficient machine learning model explicitly designed to utilize this new CP SAR data for improved detection. This paper presents a conditional random field model based on the Wishart mixture model (CRF-WMM) to detect oil spill candidates in CP SAR imagery. First, a "Wishart mixture model" (WMM) is designed as the unary potential in the CRF-WMM to address the class-dependent information of oil spill candidates and oil free water. Second, we introduce a new similarity measure based on CP statistics designed as a pairwise potential in the CRF-WMM model so that pixels with strong spatial connections have the same class label. Finally, we investigate three different optimization approaches to solve the resulting maximum a posterior (MAP) problem, namely iterated conditional modes (ICM), simulated annealing (SA), and graph cuts (GC). The results show that our proposed CRF-WMM model can delineate oil spill candidates better than the traditional CRF approaches, and that the GC algorithm provides the best optimization.

TI  - Land Use and Climate Change Impacts on Streamflow Using SWAT Model, Middle Awash Sub Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - WATER CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the impact of land use and climate change on streamflow is important for watershed management. This study aims to examine the possible impacts of land use and climate change on the streamflow of the Jewaha catchment. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is used to simulate streamflow by integrating complex interactions between climate and land use/cover. The past land-use changes were determined by classifying the Landsat images from 1990, 2000, and 2018 with Earth Resource Development System (ERDAS) Imagine 2015. The potential of climate change impact was examined under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios for 2041-2070 time horizon with the baseline 1971-2000. Climate change scenarios over the catchment indicated an increasing trend in temperature, in both RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, and variability in rainfall patterns in the catchment. The average annual temperature will increase by 0.1 degrees C and 0.15 degrees C for the RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively. Generally, the result indicated that in the future summer streamflow highly increases due to climate and land-use change and a decrease in the dry season because of the changes in the climate variables.

TI  - Assimilation of the FY-4A AGRI Clear-Sky Radiance Data in a Regional Numerical Model and Its Impact on the Forecast of the "21•7" Henan Extremely Persistent Heavy Rainfall
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Assimilation of the Advanced Geostationary Radiance Imager (AGRI) clear-sky radiance in a regional model is performed. The forecasting effectiveness of the assimilation of two water vapor (WV) channels with conventional observations for the "21 center dot 7" Henan extremely heavy rainfall is analyzed and compared with a baseline test that assimilates only conventional observations in this study. The results show that the 24-h cumulative precipitation forecast by the assimilation experiment with the addition of the AGRI exceeds 500 mm, compared to a maximum value of 532.6 mm measured by the national meteorological stations, and that the location of the maximum precipitation is consistent with the observations. The results for the short periods of intense precipitation processes are that the simulation of the location and intensity of the 3-h cumulative precipitation is also relatively accurate. The analysis increment shows that the main difference between the two sets of assimilation experiments is over the ocean due to the additional ocean observations provided by FY-4A, which compensates for the lack of ocean observations. The assimilation of satellite data adjusts the vertical and horizontal wind fields over the ocean by adjusting the atmospheric temperature and humidity, which ultimately results in a narrower and stronger WV transport path to the center of heavy precipitation in Zhengzhou in the lower troposphere. Conversely, the WV convergence and upward motion in the control experiment are more dispersed; therefore, the precipitation centers are also correspondingly more dispersed.

TI  - Comparison of SEBAL, METRIC, and ALARM algorithms for estimating actual evapotranspiration of wheat crop
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration is one of the main components of water balance and its accurate estimation is of great importance in planning and optimizing water consumption. In this study, therefore, it was tried to calculate the actual evapotranspiration rate of wheat crop in the Pars Abad section of Moghan plain, northwestern Iran, which is one of the main agricultural hubs in Iran. The research tools were Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), and Analytical Land Atmosphere Radiometer Model (ALARM) methods. For this purpose, 12 images of Landsat 7 and 8 satellites were used, all of which were in the product development period between 2016 and 2019, and the results were compared with lysimeter data. The results indicated that the highest actual evapotranspiration rate of wheat crop during the development period was related to 2018.07.01 (7.86 mm/day) in the ALARM method and the lowest rate in the mid-growth period belonged to 2017.01.30 (0.32 mm/day) in the METRIC method. Among the investigated methods, the SEBAL method with an RSME of 0.633 had the lowest error rate and the highest R-2 (0.9307) compared with the lysimeter data, followed by the METRIC and ALARM methods with the lowest error (RMSE= 0.761 and 0.855 mm/day) and the highest correlation (R-2 = 0.9057 and 0.8709), respectively.

TI  - The first evaluation of the FY-3D/MERSI-2 sensor's thermal infrared capabilities for deriving land surface temperature in volcanic regions: a case study of Mount Etna
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In November 2017, the China Meteorological Administration launched a new polar orbiting satellite in its Fengyun (FY) series: FY-3D. With its main purpose being the collection of meteorological data, FY-3D featured a comprehensive payload that is equally exploitable by various Earth Science disciplines. One of its sensors, the MEdium Resolution Spectral Imager-2 (MERSI-2), provides visible and infrared imagery at spatial resolutions of 250 - 1000 m. These characteristics make MERSI-2 suitable for volcanological remote sensing and make it comparable to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors which themselves, have been widely used in volcanological applications. This paper evaluates the first clear and near-coincident MODIS - MERSI-2 images of Mount Etna (Italy) during an active volcanic phase in 2019 and in turn, provides the first assessment of MERSI-2's utility in observing volcanic activity in the Thermal InfraRed (TIR). To ensure the comparability of both scenes, data from each were converted to Land Surface Temperature (LST) and comparisons were encouraging, with an r(2) of 0.92, a mean temperature discrepancy of 0.26 K and a root mean squared error of 0.75 K. Having ascertained comparability, we focussed on the absolute temperatures detected at the eruption site, with the highest being 317.3 K and 328.1 K for MODIS and MERSI-2, respectively. The 20 minute gap between the acquisitions is the most likely the cause of this temperature discrepancy, suggesting variations in lava effusion rates and activity were occurring at Mount Etna over such timescales. This study confirms the applicability of MERSI-2 for observing volcanic activity and emphasises the significance of TIR volcanic monitoring and the importance that additional spaceborne platforms might have in reducing temporal gaps between image acquisitions. Given its unique characteristics, future studies should investigate the applicability of MERSI-2 in more varied volcanic settings.

TI  - Winter conditions structure extratropical patterns of species richness of amphibians, birds and mammals globally
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim The aim was to derive global indices of winter conditions and examine their relationships with species richness patterns outside of the tropics. Location All extratropical areas (>25 degrees N and 25 degrees S latitudes), excluding islands. Time period 2000-2018. Major taxa studied Amphibians, birds and mammals. Methods We mapped three global indices of winter conditions [number of days of frozen ground (length of frozen ground winter); snow cover variability; and lack of subnivium (below-snow refuge)] from satellite data, then used generalized additive models to examine their relationships with species richness patterns derived from range data. Results Length of frozen ground winter was the strongest predictor of species richness, with a consistent cross-taxonomic decline in species richness occurring beyond 3 months of winter. It also often outperformed other environmental predictors of species richness patterns commonly used in biodiversity studies, including climate variables, primary productivity and elevation. In areas with >= 3 months of winter conditions, all three winter indices explained much of the deviance in amphibian, mammal and resident bird species richness. Mammals exhibited a stronger relationship with snow cover variability and lack of subnivium than the other taxa. Species richness of fully migratory species of birds peaked at c. 5.5 months of winter, coinciding with low species richness of residents. Main conclusions Our study demonstrates that winter structures latitudinal and elevational gradients of extratropical terrestrial species richness. In a rapidly warming world, tracking the seasonal dynamics of frozen ground and snow cover will be essential for predicting the consequences of climate change on species, communities and ecosystems. The indices of winter conditions we developed from satellite imagery provide an effective means of monitoring these dynamics into the future.

TI  - Superpixel segmentation of PolSAR images based on improved local iterative clustering
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to solve the problem that the simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) cannot segment the noisy image well, the local iterative clustering (LIC) is improved and successfully applied to the superpixel segmentation of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image. However, this algorithm still has two problems: the computation of edge graph is too large and the content of superpixel cannot guarantee the homogeneity. In this article, the LIC algorithm is improved to segment PolSAR image better and faster. For the first problem, the algorithm introduces the integral graph into edge graph calculation to remove the redundant operation; for the second problem, the algorithm adds hypothesis testing to test the homogeneity of superpixel content, and re-segment the superpixel that does not meet the homogeneity hypothesis. The experiment is carried out with the measured data of AIRSAR system and GaoFen-3 system, and the experimental result shows that the algorithm can double the calculation speed of edge graph and significantly improves the superpixel segmentation effect.

TI  - Wide bandwidth enriched symmetric hexagonal split ring resonator based triple band negative permittivity metamaterial for satellite and Wi-Fi applications
T2  - RESULTS IN PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bandwidth is a vital factor for the transmission phase of satellite data that plays an important role in satellite performance. This paper presents a wide bandwidth enriched metamaterial consisting of symmetric hexagonal split ring resonator (SRR) with triple band negative permittivity and refractive index and near zero permeability for satellite and Wi-Fi applications. The electrical dimension of the designed metamaterial unit cell is 0.17 lambda x 0.17 lambda where wavelength (lambda) is computed at a first resonance frequency and developed on a cheap dielectric material FR-4 (lossy) with a thickness of 1.6 mm. The proposed metamaterial contributes triple resonances for the transmission coefficient (S-21) at the frequencies of 5 GHz, 6.88 GHz and 8.429 GHz with the magnitude of -33.79, -21.7 and -25.18 dB, respectively covering C and X bands through the numerical execution of CST microwave studio 2019. The effective bandwidth of the unit cell are 1.67 GHz (3.89 to 5.56 GHz), 0.52 GHz (6.59 to 7.11 GHz) and 0.98 GHz (7.98 to 8.96 GHz) where the value of S-21 less than-10 dB. The first resonance frequency is used to high speed-bandwidth enriched Wi-Fi and satellite band. Wi-Fi is usually faster using 5 GHz frequency band. The rest of the resonance frequency can be used in satellite applications. A negative permittivity has been perceived at frequencies of 5 - 6.066 GHz, 6.88 - 7.409 GHz, 8.429 - 10.061 GHz using Nicolson-RossWeir (NRW) methods with MATLAB code. The dependence of the resonance frequencies on the design parameters, substrate thickness, dielectric materials, the influence of the different structure of unit cell has also been examined. The designed unit cell structure with equivalent circuit diagram are analyzed and validated using Advanced Design System (ADS) simulator that exhibits similar to the S-21 of the proposed structure. Furthermore, measurement results and Ansys high-frequency structure simulator (HFSS) simulator results are also employed to verify the outcome. Due to the overall performance, such as wide bandwidth, excellent effective parameters of the designed structure, the proposed research can be very suitable for satellite and Wi-Fi applications.

TI  - From Dualistic Opposition to Dyadic Integration: Toward a New Political Economy of Chinese Practice
T2  - MODERN CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article argues for the construction of a new political economy based on Chinese practices. It begins with an explanation of the research approach of starting from practice, and from a distinctive mode of thinking that is akin to that of medicine, rather than Newtonian physics and mathematical logic. Then it discusses the present-day Chinese practices of combining socialism with market economy, state enterprises with private enterprises, the peasant economy with an industrial economy, and the party-state with the economy-all distinctive realities about the new Chinese political-economic system. The foil for the discussion is the long-standing hegemonic ideology and worldview of Anglo-American classical and neoclassical liberal economics and law. This article suggests that we employ China's traditional dyadic integration worldview, evident in today's practices, to arrive at a new integrative cosmological view that rises above both. To a considerable extent, this article is also a reinterpretation of classical Marxist political economy. What the article advocates may be termed a "participatory socialist market economy," to be distinguished from a bureaucratized and controlling socialist planned economy. This is a system that is still very much in the process of formation, its particular content and characteristics yet to be clarified and specified through a sustained period of searching through practice.

TI  - Meteorological and agricultural drought monitoring in Southwest of Iran using a remote sensing-based combined drought index
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the most devastating natural hazards in the world, affecting millions of individuals in in different ways, so it's better monitoring and comprehensive assessment is important. Univariate or multivariate drought indices are able to monitor one type of drought and can not reflect comprehensive drought information from meteorological to agricultural aspects. For this purpose, by combining the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), the Soil Water Index (SWI) and the precipitation condition index (PCI) a comprehensive drought index called Combined Drought Index (CDI) was proposed. In this study, meteorological and agricultural droughts from 2001 to 1397 in Karkheh Basin in southwestern Iran were monitored. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method, which is a mainstay of modern data analysis tools for constructing a composite index, was applied to a data matrix that contains the time series of the computed PCI, VCI, TCI, and SWI indices for a given location, and the first leading component of the PCA was introduced as CDI index. The results indicated that the highest correlation (r = 0.53, r = 0.56) between the CDI, SPI-1 and SDI was observed respectively, which indicates the ability of this index for drought comprehensive monitoring. It is also suggested that in order to improve the performance of the CDI, in addition to the considered parameters in this study, other factors affecting the performance of each of the remote sensing indicators such as vegetation type, plant root, soil texture type, evaporation and Transpiration also be considered in future studies.

TI  - Towards daily maximum heat index estimation across the conterminous United States using satellite-derived products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) is widely utilized to study urban heat islands in the context of human health and thermal exposure. However, there is growing evidence to suggest that LST may be a poor indicator of apparent temperature, or the human-perceived equivalent temperature that reflects both heat and humidity. Moreover, heat index (HI), the apparent temperature metric used by the US National Weather Service, has yet to be computed at an increased spatial resolution and coverage beyond weather station observations. The goals of this study were to: 1) assess the extent to which HI can be estimated by a combination of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor and other satellite-derived products available at continental scales, and 2) determine which factors are most important in this estimation. Specifically, daily maximum 1-km HI from May through September of 2012 was modelled across the conterminous United States as a function of MODIS LST, precipitable water vapor (PWV), and near-infrared indices, in addition to static variables capturing land cover, topographic, and locational factors.The derived model was capable of estimating HI within a reasonable level of error (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 4.4 degrees F). This is the first time that HI has been directly estimated using exclusively remotely sensed products and validated over a large spatial extent. Analysis of individual variables indicated that LST and PWV were, by far, the most important factors for estimation. However, the incorporation of additional parameters further improved model performance (R-2: +0.14, RMSE: -1.6 degrees F). We hope that our work will eventually result in a national HI product assisting researchers in a variety of fields, including epidemiology, building energy demand, and environmental justice. Further work to interpolate cloud-contaminated satellite observations and downscale estimates to a 60-m resolution would considerably increase the utility of this HI estimation methodology.

TI  - Financial sector components in a religious context: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine financial sector components in a religious context, using the example of states representing the three major monistic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. For this purpose, the role of each religion in the economic life of society was analyzed using the method of qualitative approach, the main banking practices of each religious tradition were identified, and the banking sector in the religious context was assessed. The study results demonstrate that the religious worldview is a determining factor in the social and economic activities of society. Christian societies are not subject to religious norms in their banking practices; the state and the church are separate. Islamic financial institutions, by contrast, are based on Sharia law and are most subordinate to religion. This information is of interest to financiers as well as to policymakers involved in regulating the banking system. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Stage estimation of Himalayan rivers using passive microwave radiometer and altimeter
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological variables such as surface water extent and soil moisture are continuously being monitored from satellites with good accuracy. However, orbital measurement of river stage and discharge remains a major challenge even today. Although altimeters provide valuable information on water level variations with a precision of few centimetres, they suffer from poor revisit time and limited gauging sites. Microwave radiometers that provide brightness temperature (BT) can be used to fill the gaps between altimeter passes with a revisit time of 1-2 days, although with limited accuracy. This paper presents an approach for estimation of river stage based on passive microwave radiometer using BT of river/measurement target (M) and upstream calibration target (C). We have used altimeter data from Jason-2/3 and BT data from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR2) at 36.5 GHz (descending orbit and horizontal polarization) for the period January 2013 to August 2020 to estimate river stage at 12 virtual gauging sites along Indus, Ganga, and Brahmaputra rivers. A new approach for selection of calibration targets is presented in this study which results in higher correlation between altimeter observed river stage and AMSR2 derived C/M ratio when compared to existing methods. Coefficient of determination (R (2)) for C/M ratio with water level for the period 2013-2017 ranged from 0.45 to 0.89. Model functions were generated between C/M ratio and altimeter observed water level for all the gauging sites. Estimated water levels were validated against altimeter and ground observed values for the period January 2018-August 2020 with RMSE ranging from 0.35 to 1.45 m, which is 7-15% of total stage variability.

TI  - Spatial and temporal analysis of the increasing effects of large-scale infrastructure construction on the surface urban heat island
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of China's economy and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, large-scale infrastructure constructions (LSICs) are also increasing rapidly. LSICs with impervious surfaces have increasingly resulted in replacing natural landscapes, altering surface radiation, thermal properties, and humidity in urban areas. To study the environmental thermal changes of Beijing Daxing International Airport before and after its construction and operation, four Landsat-8 images (from the year of 2014, 2017, 2019, and 2021) were used to calculate the land surface temperature (LST). Then the LST values of four images covering the study area were compared and analyzed using the urban heat island ratio index (URI). Results show that the URI value of this area increased from 0.120 of 2014 to 0.185 of 2017 after the construction of Daxing Airport, indicating that the urban surface heat island effect in this area greatly increased. Additionally, the URI value of this area increased from 0.153 of 2019 to 0.206 of 2021 after the operation of Daxing Airport, indicating that the surface urban heat island effect in this area further increased. Therefore, we infer that this effect is closely related to airport construction and operation. Afterward, the random forest classification algorithm is used to classify land types based on pixels, and then the relationship between URI and land classification types was discussed. It is found that before the construction of Daxing Airport, both dark buildings and bare land contribute significantly to the thermal environment of the airport. After the completion of Daxing Airport, the contribution model was changed to high-reflectivity buildings and bright soil. The thermal pollution generated by the airport has a greater impact on the ground objects within the range of 7.5 km, and a relatively smaller impact on the ground objects outside the range of 9.5 km. Our results can provide a valuable reference for the study of the thermal environment caused by human activities.

TI  - Land cover change and multiple remotely sensed datasets consistency in China
T2  - ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Although numerous land cover datasets can act as references for understanding land cover change in China, the inconsistencies between the datasets can also provide understanding. Previous studies on the consistency between land cover datasets have mostly focused on land cover type consistencies and have ignored data consistencies in land cover change.Outcomes: Therefore, we aim to analyse the consistencies in land cover changes through likelihood assessment methods. We compared the spatiotemporal changes in forest, grassland, cropland, and bare land in the Climate Change Initiative land cover dataset (CCI-LC), Moderate-resolution Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer land cover dataset (MCD12Q1), China's National Land Use and Cover Change (CNLUCC), Globeland30 and Global Land Cover Fine Surface Covering 30 (GLC-FCS30) datasets in 2010. The results showed that the percentages and changes in each land cover type in MCD12Q1 were different from those in the other datasets.Discussion: For example, the proportion of grassland in MCD12Q1 was the highest, reaching 48.04%. The places with high consistency were the places where the land cover types were concentrated, and the bare land had the highest consistency. However, the consistency of China's land cover change was quite low, and the percentage of low consistency was more than 87% from 2000-2018. Comparison of the data with the global artificial impervious area (GAZA) and Hansen-Global Forest Change (Hansen-GFC) datasets showed that the percentage of high construction gain consistency (38.83%) was higher than the forest change consistency, and the percentage forest loss high consistency (8.85%) was lower than the forest gain high consistency (12.76%).Conclusion: The results not only provide a basis for the use of land cover datasets but also give a clearer understanding of the pattern of land cover changes.

TI  - Assessing Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 spectral-temporal features for mapping tree species of northern plantation forests in Heilongjiang Province, China
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Accurate mapping of tree species is highly desired in the management and research of plantation forests, whose ecosystem services are currently under threats. Time-series multispectral satellite images, e.g., from Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2), have been proven useful in mapping general forest types, yet we do not know quantitatively how their spectral features (e.g., red-edge) and temporal frequency of data acquisitions (e.g., 16 day vs. 5-day) contribute to plantation forest mapping to the species level. Moreover, it is unclear to what extent the fusion of L8 and S2 will result in improvements in tree species mapping of northern plantation forests in China. Methods: We designed three sets of classification experiments (i.e., single-date, multi-date, and spectral-temporal) to evaluate the performances of L8 and S2 data for mapping keystone timber tree species in northern China. We first used seven pairs of L8 and S2 images to evaluate the performances of L8 and S2 key spectral features for separating these tree species across key growing stages. Then we extracted the spectral-temporal features from all available images of different temporal frequency of data acquisition (i.e., L8 time series, S2 time series, and fusion of L8 and S2) to assess the contribution of image temporal frequency on the accuracy of tree species mapping in the study area. Results: 1) S2 outperformed L8 images in all classification experiments, with or without the red edge bands (0.4%- 3.4% and 0.2%-4.4% higher for overall accuracy and macro-F1, respectively); 2) NDTI (the ratio of SWIR1 minus SWIR2 to SWIR1 plus SWIR2) and Tasseled Cap coefficients were most important features in all the classifications, and for time-series experiments, the spectral-temporal features of red band-related vegetation indices were most useful; 3) increasing the temporal frequency of data acquisition can improve overall accuracy of tree species mapping for up to 3.2% (from 90.1% using single-date imagery to 93.3% using S2 time-series), yet similar overall accuracies were achieved using S2 time-series (93.3%) and the fusion of S2 and L8 (93.2%). Conclusions: This study quantifies the contributions of L8 and S2 spectral and temporal features in mapping keystone tree species of northern plantation forests in China and suggests that for mapping tree species in China's northern plantation forests, the effects of increasing the temporal frequency of data acquisition could saturate quickly after using only two images from key phenological stages.

TI  - Approach of recognition and precision location for the beacon in satellite optical communications
T2  - OPTIK
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite optical communications have high communication speed and good confidentiality, which can establish high-speed and large-capacity communication links between satellites and the ground or other satellites. The requirements for the PAT (pointing, acquisition and tracking) system of satellite optical communication terminals are very high. In satellite optical communications, the biggest influence on the beacon's recognition and tracking is the background light on CCD (Charge Coupled Device). Therefore, denoising work is required during the recognition or tracking process. This paper uses corner detection method to extract the beacon frame by frame. Mark the spot, and use the optical flow method to calculate the optical flow displacement based on the two consecutive frames. In addition, calculation accuracy of the beacon's centroid is compared with that of the tradition method. The feasibility is verified by simulation experiment, the tracking process is completed, and the noise can be precisely eliminated.

TI  - Assessment of WorldView-2 images for aboveground seagrass carbon stock mapping in patchy and continuous seagrass meadows
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially explicit information on aboveground seagrass carbon stock (AGC(seagrass)) is required to understand the role of seagrass as a nature-based solution to mitigating and adapting to climate change. Remote sensing provides the most effective and efficient means to map AGC(seagrass). This research aimed to assess the accuracy of multispectral images to map AGC in seagrass meadows with different characteristics. Kemujan Island in Indonesia was selected to represent patchy beds with relatively low seagrass percent cover and low water clarity, whereas Labuan Bajo of Indonesia served an example of continuous beds with a relatively high percent cover and water clarity. WorldView-2 is a high-spatial-resolution multispectral image with six visible bands, by which water can be penetrated. Several image processing techniques, including sunglint and water column correction, principal component analysis, and co-occurrence texture analysis, were applied to the atmospherically corrected WorldView-2 images. These datasets were used as inputs in the AGC empirical model using seven regression algorithms, namely, single-band linear regression, band-ratio linear regression, stepwise regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, extreme gradient boosting, and multivariate adaptive regression spline. Seagrass field data collected using photo quadrat technique were used to train the regression model and assess the accuracy of the resulting AGC(seagrass) maps. The results indicated that WorldView-2 can be used to map AGC in different seagrass meadows with a consistent accuracy. The most accurate AGC(seagrass) map for Kemujan Island had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.11 g C m(-2) for the aboveground stock in the range of 0-28.70 g C m(-2), and for Labuan Bajo, the RMSE of the map was 9.73 g C m(-2), with aboveground stock range of 0.31-64.38 g C m(-2). Model cross-validation revealed that the mapping model can be site-specific or robust depending on the characteristics of the field-derived AGC(seagrass) data used to train the regression algorithm. For example, the model developed for Labuan Bajo seagrasses, which had a higher AGC variance, can be successfully applied to Kemujan Island with its lower AGC variance, but not vice versa. This finding is a key factor in the future development of a robust AGC(seagrass) mapping model that is applicable to various seagrass meadows as a stepping stone to accelerating the filling of gaps in the global seagrass dataset.

TI  - Wind speed retrieval from Chinese Gaofen-3 synthetic aperture radar using an analytical approach in the nearshore waters of China's seas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Empirical wind-retrieval algorithms for synthetic aperture radar (SAR), such as the geophysical model function (GMF) CMOD5N in the C-Band, are currently well developed. The retrieval accuracy of GMFs, however, is lower in the presence of marine phenomena such as oceanic fronts and mesoscale eddies, making SAR wind retrieval challenging under these conditions. In this study, we proposed a scheme for wind retrieval from Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR images using an analytical approach to obtain the wind speed in the nearshore waters of China's seas. Approximately 300 images were acquired from 2018 to 2021 in the copolarization channels [vertical-vertical (VV) and horizontal-horizontal (HH)]. The images were collocated with the measurements from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and the Chinese Haiyang-2B (HY-2B) scatterometer. Our analytical approach was based on the Bragg resonant and non-Bragg (NB) scattering model for the calculation of the normalized radar backscatter cross-section (NRCS), which accounted for the influence of wave-current interactions and breaking waves in nearshore waters. We used the sea surface currents obtained from the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) to simulate the Bragg resonant roughness. We derived the contribution of the NB breaking waves from the SAR-measured NRCS values in both the VV and HH channels. By comparing the retrieval results obtained using the analytical approach with the scatterometer products, we concluded that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the wind speed was 2.01 m s(-1) with a 0.91 correlation coefficient (COR), which was less than the 2.93 m s(-1) RMSE and 0.72 COR for the GMF CMOD5N. The variation in the bias of the HYCOM currents was approximately 1 m s(-1) for current speeds greater than 0.3 m s(-1). These findings verified the stability of the analytical approach for SAR wind retrieval in complex sea states.

TI  - Evaluation of red-edge features for identifying subtropical tree species based on Sentinel-2 and Gaofen-6 time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fast and accurate tree species mapping using remote sensing technology is invaluable to forest sustainable management. However, due to the limitation of ecosystem complexity and the frequent cloudy weather, it remains challenging to obtain detailed knowledge about the varieties in subtropical areas. In this study, 18 scenes of Gaofen-6 (GF6) and 13 scenes of Sentinel-2 (S2) images were harmonized using linear regression models, and the identification abilities of 23 red-edge vegetation index (REVI) time-series and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series were evaluated using the random forest classifier (RF). The feature reduction methods were employed to boost the effectiveness of the input features, and the optimal red-edge combination consisting of spectral and textural features was built to map the dominant tree species precisely in Southeast China. Our results showed as follows: (1) GF6 and S2 could be harmonized with a mean coefficient of determination (R-2) greater than 0.94 and the root means squared error (RMSE) less than 0.02, which was helpful to improve the consistency between multi-source remote sensing data and subsequently derived products. (2) Most of the REVI time-series performed better than NDVI time-series, and the transformed chlorophyll absorption ratio indexes (TCARI(2)) got the highest overall accuracy of 86.28%, which could be further improved to 88.37% by adding 26 textural features. (3) The phenological characteristics from different seasons were conducive to tree species classification compared to the effect of different sensors, and the contribution of spring images played the most important role in RF, followed by autumn and winter, while the mid-summer images seemed to be negligible in the classifier. Overall, this study proposed an accurate and cost-efficient approach for tree species identification, which demonstrated good potential in providing a profound reference for subtropical forest landscape studying.

TI  - Quantifying the accuracies of six 30-m cropland datasets over China: A comparison and evaluation analysis
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of remote sensing technology, more and more fine-resolution cropland datasets have emerged as powerful tools for agriculture planning and food security evaluation. But questions about their accuracy and reliability must be answered before using them, making evaluations necessary. So far, little attention has been paid to the performance of fine-resolution (e.g., 30 m) and cropland-specific products at continental or regional scales. This study implemented a comparison analysis and accuracy assessment for six cropland products with a 30-m resolution in China circa 2015, including FROM-GLC, GLC_FCS, CLCD, AGLC, GFSAD, GLAD. Their similarities and disparities were delineated at national, provincial, meridional, and zonal scales. 33,713 ground truth points were then collected through visual interpretation of Google Earth images and from existing available validation datasets, to evaluate the pixel-wise accuracy of them across China. In terms of spatial consistency, high agreement among the six products could be found in North China Plain and Northeast China, and low agreement was found in Southern, Southwest, and Northwest China. Topography including elevation and slope were important factors influencing spatial consistency. As for provincial area accuracy, CLCD and AGLC were most correlated with statistical data (r(2) > 0.9), followed by GLAD (0.88) and AGLC (0.87). FROM-GLC had the lowest correlation (r(2) = 0.37) with statistics. The relative area differences between each product and statistics also demonstrated that CLCD had the best area accuracies in most provinces. By contrast, GLC_FCS had a severe overestimation and FROM-GLC suffered from a large underestimation of cropland area. Last, the pixel-wise validation results indicated that CLCD and GLAD had the highest overall accuracy (OA) of 0.88, followed by AGLC (0.85) and GFSAD (0.84). FROM-GLC and GLC_FCS had the lowest OAs of less than 0.70. The comparison and evaluation results in this study can provide insights into the national and provincial performances of these fine-resolution cropland products and give valuable references for guiding data usage and help to improve future land use/cover mapping.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In the study presented in this paper, bathymetric maps in shallow waters of Neil and Havelock Islands of Andaman were produced based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) machine learning (ML) technique with two popular empirical approaches (log-linear and log-ratio models) with only satellite remotely sensed data. A new adaptive Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm has been proposed to automatically extract the seafloor photons from the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2) Level 2A data after applying tide and refraction corrections. Later, these depth points were used in place of the in situ bathymetric points to train (with 80% of data) the SVR model. With trained models and Sentinel-2 multispectral images of 2019, the bathymetric maps were produced. The performance of the models was evaluated using remaining independent (20%) data points from ICESat-2. The results indicate that the overall errors during the test phase for the range of depth (0-25 m) are 0.60 (0.47 m) and 0.41 m (0.32 m) based on Log-Ratio Model-LRM-(Log Linear Model-LLM) methods in Neil and Havelock Islands, respectively. The LLM-based SVR ML produced relatively accurate bathymetry as compared to the LRM approach over the entire depth range. Therefore, this approach can be extended to produce large-scale bathymetry maps in shallow waters of other islands and reefs along Indian coastal waters.

TI  - Make It Great Again: The Relationship Between Populist Attitudes and Nostalgia
T2  - POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Populist movements typically endorse a pessimistic view that blames the "elites" for societal problems. Why is this populist worldview so appealing to many citizens? We propose that populism is associated with nostalgia: A bittersweet feeling defined as a sentimental longing for a better past. We tested this idea in three preregistered studies. Study 1 revealed that both personal and collective nostalgia (i.e., referring to either personal memories or a shared national history) were associated with populist attitudes. Moreover, the nostalgia measures mediated a link between collective angst and populist attitudes. Studies 2 and 3, then, were experiments designed to investigate the causal order between nostalgia and populist attitudes. In Study 2, a manipulation of nostalgia could not establish a causal effect on populist attitudes; however, a measure of nostalgia was again correlated to populist attitudes. In Study 3, we tested the reverse causal order by exposing participants to either a populist or pluralist speech. Results revealed that exposure to the populist speech increased both personal and collective nostalgia. In all studies, these effects emerged independent of political orientation. Apparently, feelings of nostalgia are closely associated with populist attitudes and may help explain why citizens find a populist worldview appealing.

TI  - Assessing the Meteorological Impacts of Time-Varying Land Cover in the Intertidal Zone
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The meteorological impacts of intertidal land cover variation during summer and winter were simulated using the weather research and forecasting (WRF) meteorological model through two experiments: a TIDE experiment with time-varying land cover by tidal effects in the intertidal zone using a new modeling method used hourly surface boundary conditions obtained using ocean model and satellite data, and a CNTL experiment with fixed land cover in the intertidal zone using a typical WRF modeling method used to fix the surface boundary conditions. The results of the TIDE experiment were more consistent with the recorded observations, especially during high tides. During summer daytime, the sensible heat flux (SHF) became negative (downward exchanging process) in the intertidal zone due to a low sea surface temperature, which decreased the temperature and increased the water vapor mixing ratio in the intertidal zone and inland areas. The wind speeds in intertidal zones and inland areas increased due to strong sea winds at altitudes from 80 m to 1.5 km, thereby increasing the sea breeze intensity and resulting in meteorological changes in inland areas. During winter, land cover changes in the intertidal zone impacted fog formation. During nighttime high tides, the SHF became positive in the intertidal zone and the latent heat flux increased prior to fog formation. During flood tide, the relative humidity increased and wind speed decreased in the intertidal zone and coastal areas coincident with fog occurrence. Overall, meteorological changes due to tidal effects were more pronounced in the summer.

TI  - An Inversion Framework for Optimizing Non-Methane VOC Emissions Using Remote Sensing and Airborne Observations in Northeast Asia During the KORUS-AQ Field Campaign
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - We aim to reduce uncertainties in CH2O and other volatile organic carbon (VOC) emissions through assimilation of remote sensing data. We first update a three-dimensional (3D) chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem with the KORUSv5 anthropogenic emission inventory and inclusion of chemistry for aromatics and C2H4, leading to modest improvements in simulation of CH2O (normalized mean bias (NMB): -0.57 to -0.51) and O-3 (NMB: -0.25 to -0.19) compared against DC-8 aircraft measurements during KORUS-AQ; the mixing ratio of most VOC species are still underestimated. We next constrain VOC emissions using CH2O observations from two satellites (OMI and OMPS) and the DC-8 aircraft during KORUS-AQ. To utilize data from multiple platforms in a consistent manner, we develop a two-step Hybrid Iterative Finite Difference Mass Balance and four-dimensional variational inversion system (Hybrid IFDMB-4DVar). The total VOC emissions throughout the domain increase by 47%. The a posteriori simulation reduces the low biases of simulated CH2O (NMB: -0.51 to -0.15), O-3 (NMB: -0.19 to -0.06), and VOCs. Alterations to the VOC speciation from the 4D-Var inversion include increases of biogenic isoprene emissions in Korea and anthropogenic emissions in Eastern China. We find that the IFDMB method alone is adequate for reducing the low biases of VOCs in general; however, 4D-Var provides additional refinement of high-resolution emissions and their speciation. Defining reasonable emission errors and choosing optimal regularization parameters are crucial parts of the inversion system. Our new hybrid inversion framework can be applied for future air quality campaigns, maximizing the value of integrating measurements from current and upcoming geostationary satellite instruments.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Using Bivariate Statistical Models and GIS in Chattagram District, Bangladesh
T2  - GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide is one of the most devastating hazards in Chattagram Dsitrict and has become a recurrent phenomenon in this region. This study attempts to produce Landslide Susceptibility Map (LSM) for Chattagram District of Bangladesh by using five GIS based bivariate statistical models, namely the Frequency Ratio (FR), Shanon's Entropy (SE), Weight of Evidence (WofE), Information Value (IV) and Certainty Factor (CF). Landslide Inventory (2001-2017) of Chittagong Hilly Areas database was used to measure the relationship between the previous landslides with the landslide conditioning factors. SRTM DEM and Landsat satellite images were collected from USGS and the geological data were collected from GSB to produce the thematic layer of conditioning factors. Sixteen landslide conditioning factors of Slope Aspect, Slope Angle, Geology, Elevation, Plan Curvature, Profile Curvature, General Curvature, Topographic Wetness Index, Stream Power Index, Sediment Transport Index, Topographic Roughness Index, Distance to Stream, Distance to Anticline, Distance to Fault, Distance to Road and NDVI were used. The Area Under Curve (AUC) was used for validation of the LSMs. The predictive rate of AUC for FR, SE, WofE, IV and CF were 76.11%, 70.11%, 78.93%, 76.57% and 80.43% respectively. CF model indicates 15.04% of areas are highly susceptible to landslide. All the models showed that the high elevated areas are more susceptible to landslide where the low-lying river basin areas have a low probability of landslide occurrence. The findings of this research will contribute to land use planning, management and hazard mitigation of the CHT region.

TI  - Host Finding Behavior of the Parasitoid <i>Hadronotus pennsylvanicus</i> (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) for Egg Masses of the Squash Bugs <i>Anasa tristis</i> and <i>Anasa armigera</i> (Hemiptera: Coreidae) in Squash and Cucumber Fields
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Parasitoid foraging behavior is affected by habitat and host plant differences. Egg parasitoids also use a combination of oviposition-induced and host-derived cues to find host eggs. This study compared parasitism by Hadronotus pennsylvanicus (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) on two squash bug species, Anasa tristis (DeGeer) and Anasa armigera Say (Hemiptera: Coreidae), by placing sentinel squash and cucumber plants with egg masses of either of the two squash bug species in squash and cucumber fields in a 3-way factorial design. Host density of wild A. tristis egg masses in squash fields may have influenced parasitoid foraging behavior on sentinel plants. In the 3-way factorial design, parasitism was higher on sentinel squash plants and in squash fields overall. However, parasitism on A. armigera egg masses was highest on sentinel cucumber plants in squash fields and parasitism on A. tristis egg masses was higher on sentinel squash plants in either squash or cucumber fields and lowest on sentinel cucumber plants in cucumber fields. Results suggest that parasitoids were able to specifically orient to the combination of host plant and host cues associated with A. tristis egg masses on sentinel squash plants, but that they were more responsive to plant-induced cues associated with cucumber when searching for A. armigera egg masses. Parasitoids appear to utilize different combinations of host plant and host cues when searching for eggs of the two squash bug species.

TI  - Pre- and Co-Eruptive Analysis of the September 2021 Eruption at Cumbre Vieja Volcano (La Palma, Canary Islands) Through DInSAR Measurements and Analytical Modeling
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the 19 September 2021 eruption of the Cumbre Vieja volcano (La Palma, Canary Islands, Spain). In particular, we analyze the Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) measurements obtained by processing Sentinel-1 images acquired from both ascending and descending orbits. First, we show the importance, for oceanic islands like La Palma, of investigating DInSAR products retrieved from time series, instead of single interferograms, to effectively remove possible atmospheric artifacts within the displacement measurements. Subsequently, we invert the retrieved data through analytical modeling. Our results highlight that a sill-like source was active in the pre-eruptive phase (8-16 September), whereas the action of two dikes prevailed during the co-eruptive phase (17-22 September). This evolution suggests a process of magma rising through a network of interconnected sills and dikes. The seismicity, that preceded and accompanied the onset of the eruption, is consistent with our findings.

TI  - Geospatial solutions for evaluating the impact of the Tigray conflict on farming
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Military conflicts strongly affect agricultural activities. This has strong implications for people's livelihoods when agriculture is the backbone of the economy. We assessed the effect of the Tigray conflict on farming activities using freely available remote sensing data. For detecting greenness, a normalized difference vegetation Index (NDVI) was analyzed in Google Earth Engine (GEE) using Sentinel 2 satellite images acquired in the pre-war (2020) and during war (2021) spring seasons. CHIRPS data were analyzed in GEE to understand the rainfall conditions. The NDVI of 2020 showed that farmlands were poorly covered with vegetation. However, in 2021, vegetation cover existed in the same season. The NDVI changes stretched from - 0.72 to 0.83. The changes in greenness were categorized as increase (2167 km(2)), some increase (18,386 km(2)), no change (1.6 km(2)), some decrease (8269 km(2)), and decrease (362 km(2)). Overall, 72% of the farmlands have seen increases in green vegetation before crops started to grow in 2021. Scattered patches with decreases in vegetation cover correspond to irrigation farms and spring-cropping rain-fed farms uncultivated in 2021. There was no clear pattern of changes in vegetation cover as a function of agro-climatic conditions. The precipitation analysis shows less rainfall in 2021 as compared to 2020, indicating that precipitation has not been an important factor. The conflict is most responsible for fallowing farmlands covered with weeds in the spring season of 2021. The use of freely accessible remote sensing data helps recognizing absence of ploughing in crisis times.

TI  - Identification of occult metastatic disease via lymphoscintigraphy-guided neck dissection in N0 oral squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of lymphoscintigraphy-guided neck dissection (LSG-ND) in the treatment of N0 oral squamous cell carcinoma. Methods A retrospective cohort study of patients with N0 oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) who had either LSG-ND or neck dissection (ND) at our institution between 2008 and 2020. Results Eighty-seven patients met criteria with N0 oral squamous cell carcinoma with no previous treatment or neck surgery (27 LSG-ND, 60 ND). Sentinel lymph nodes were identified on the contralateral side in 14.8% of patients with unilateral tumors in the LSG-ND group, with 22.2% of cases with unexpected lymphatic drainage outside ipsilateral levels I-III. No recurrences to date have occurred in the LSG-ND cohort, while 13.3% of patients with ND had regional recurrence (p = 0.04). Conclusions LSG-ND provides a greater ability to identify occult metastatic disease with a significant reduction in regional recurrence in N0 oral SCC.

TI  - A Comprehensive Set of Juno In Situ and Remote Sensing Observations of the Ganymede Auroral Footprint
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Jupiter's satellite auroral footprints are a manifestation of the satellite-magnetosphere interaction of the Galilean moons. Juno's polar elliptical orbit enables crossing the magnetic flux tubes connecting each Galilean moon with their associated auroral emission. Its payload allows measuring the fields and particle population in the flux tubes while remotely sensing their associated auroral emissions. During its thirtieth perijove, Juno crossed the flux tube directly connected to Ganymede's leading footprint spot, a unique event in the entire Juno prime mission. Juno revealed a highly-structured precipitating electron flux, up to 316 mW/m(2), while measuring both a small perturbation in the magnetic field azimuthal component and small Poynting flux with an estimated total downward current of 4.2 +/- 1.2 kA. Based on the evolution of the footprint morphology and the field and particle measurements, Juno transited for the first time through a region connected to the transhemispheric electron beam of the Ganymede footprint.

TI  - Bayesian Inference of Fault Slip and Coupling Along the Tuosuo Lake Segment of the Kunlun Fault, China
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating newly-processed Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and available Global Positioning System (GPS) data, we obtained a dense interseismic velocity field across the Tuosuo Lake segment of the Kunlun fault. Using a Bayesian approach, we obtained the spatial distribution of fault slip and coupling. The slip rate below the locking depth, which represents contemporary steady-state faulting, demonstrates an overall decrease, and decreases non-monotonically toward the eastern fault tip in the range of similar to 5-11 mm/a. Two strongly locked zones are identified, extending 100-120 km along-strike and being separated by narrow sections of moderate coupling. These locked zones were likely ruptured during the 1937 M 7.5 Huashixia earthquake. The estimated moment accumulation rate provides a recurrence time of 428 +/- 57 years for an earthquake similar to the 1937 event. The Maduo Mw 7.3 earthquake on 21 May 2021 imposed stress loading on the locked zones, equivalent to tectonic loading of similar to 10 years, implying increased seismic hazard along the Kunlun fault.Plain Language Summary Strike-slip faults in Tibet are central to our understanding of the ways in which continental lithosphere deforms in response to the ongoing India-Eurasia collision. As a key parameter of faulting, fault slip rates have been well investigated for some major strike-slip faults in Tibet (e.g., the Altyn Tagh, Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang, and Haiyuan faults). However, the slip rate along the Kunlun fault, one of the main faults in central Tibet, remains controversial, especially along its eastern segment. In this study, from one track of descending Sentinel-1A Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images, we obtained a dense velocity field across the Tuosuo Lake segment of the Kunlun fault. We applied a Bayesian dislocation model jointly to the InSAR and Global Positioning System data to obtain the spatial distribution of fault slip and coupling. Our detailed investigation demonstrates that slip rates vary, but overall decrease toward the eastern fault tip. Our results provide new insight into slip rate variation along the eastern Kunlun fault and suggest a similar to 430 year recurrence interval for large earthquakes along this segment (i.e., Mw 7.5, similar to the 1937 M 7.5 Huashixia earthquake).

TI  - A high-resolution planetary boundary layer height seasonal climatology from GNSS radio occultations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new seasonal planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) climatology product derived from 14 years of Global Navigation Satellite System radio occultation (GNSS-RO) data from multiple missions including COSMIC, TerraSAR-X, KOMPSAT-5, and PAZ. PBLH estimates are derived from the minimum gradients of retrieved refractivity profiles, with a vertical resolution of ~200 m. The climatology is obtained from occultations observed between June 2006 and December 2019, and is divided into land and ocean regimes on a 2-degree grid. We provide seasonal climatologies at 2-degree resolution as well as climatologies of diurnal cycle amplitude and phase at 5-degree resolution. The new GNSS PBLH climatology is compared to radiosonde data from the shipbased Marine ARM GPCI Investigation of Clouds (MAGIC) campaign in the subtropical northeast Pacific ocean and to previous GNSS PBLH climatology estimates. The higher spatial resolution reveals new details such as seasonal PBLH modulation due to sea ice off the coast of Antarctica. The PBLH product is the first publicly available at 2-degree resolution.

TI  - A Multiscale Deep Learning Model for Soil Moisture Integrating Satellite and In Situ Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning (DL) models trained on hydrologic observations can perform extraordinarily well, but they can inherit deficiencies of the training data, such as limited coverage of in situ data or low resolution/accuracy of satellite data. Here we propose a novel multiscale DL scheme learning simultaneously from satellite and in situ data to predict 9 km daily soil moisture (5 cm depth). Based on spatial cross-validation over sites in the conterminous United States, the multiscale scheme obtained a median correlation of 0.901 and root-mean-square error of 0.034 m(3)/m(3). It outperformed the Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite mission's 9 km product, DL models trained on in situ data alone, and land surface models. Our 9 km product showed better accuracy than previous 1 km satellite downscaling products, highlighting limited impacts of improving resolution. Not only is our product useful for planning against floods, droughts, and pests, our scheme is generically applicable to geoscientific domains with data on multiple scales, breaking the confines of individual data sets.

TI  - Using InSAR Data to Improve the Water Vapor Distribution Downstream of the Core of the South American Low-Level Jet
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Two and half years of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images obtained by Sentinel-1 near Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, before August 2019 are here analyzed and assimilated in the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF) to assess the quality of the water vapor field at the core of the South American Low-level Jet, and the downstream propagation of the implied water vapor anomalies into a large sector of South America. Due to the topographic locking of the Jet near the edge of the Andes cordillera at Santa Cruz, this experiment allows an assessment of the extension of the spatial impact of InSAR data assimilation in varying circulation conditions. That data improves the model skill at varying locations thousands of kilometers downstream, in both the distribution of water vapor assessed at a large number of well-distributed GNSS observations and precipitation assessed against the Global Precipitation dataset and ERA5 reanalysis. Gains in the precipitation forecast skill are found to have a larger impact on the forecast of light rain, and lead to an almost cancellation of forecasts of no rain in cases with moderate to heavy rain. Because the distribution of water vapor is a main driver of weather, and InSAR is one of the few sources of data that can look down to mesoscale resolution regardless of daytime or weather, it is suggested that it may have a significant positive impact on short-range weather forecasting and, maybe more importantly, on the quality of the climate of the forecast model.

TI  - Pollen-based reconstruction of total land-cover change over the Holocene in the temperate steppe region of China: An attempt to quantify the cover of vegetation and bare ground in the past using a novel approach
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Fossil pollen data are essential for reconstructing ancient vegetation and land-cover changes. Sugita's REVEALS model is the best method to estimate regional plant cover (in percentage cover) using pollen data from lakes. Such reconstructions imply that the sum of all plants' cover is 100%. However, land cover is not always represented by vegetation alone, the area of bare ground can be significant in many types of biomes, e.g., in alpine or steppe regions. Here we define "total land cover " as the sum of vegetation cover (VegC) and bare ground (BareC). In this study, we use the relationship between tree pollen percentages and both tree cover (TreeC) and VegC (=TreeC + herb cover (HerbC)) based on a dataset of modern pollen assemblages and related total land cover. This relationship is applied to estimate past "actual " vegetation cover (a-VegC) from fossil pollen percentages using the Modern Analogue Technique (MAT). The REVEALS (RV) model can then be applied to the same fossil pollen records to estimate regional cover of individual plant taxa (RV PlantC; e.g., RV PinusC, etc.), total tree cover (RV-TreeC) and total herb cover (RV-HerbC). These cover values can then be converted into RV aPlantC, RV a-TreeC and RV a-HerbC using the MAT-reconstructed a-VegC (e.g., RV PinusC x MAT a-VegC = RV aPinusC; RV-TreeC x MAT a-VegC = RV a-TreeC, etc.). The results of leave-one-out cross-validation indicates that the MAT reconstructions using the modern pollen assemblages provide values of a-TreeC, a-HerbC and BareC mostly very similar to the modern vegetation data. We further tested the method using pollen assemblages from lake surface sediments of 11 lakes and the results also suggest a good performance of MAT-based reconstruction. We then applied the proposed method (MAT-REVEALS) to four Holocene pollen records available from the study area to evaluate the feasibility of the strategy to reconstruct past actual plant cover. The results suggest that the method provides plausible estimates of vegetation cover for the sub-regions within the study area. The results from Lake Daihai over the last 10,000 years BP are interpreted and discussed in more details to evaluate the effects of possible departures from the approach assumptions.

TI  - Preoperational diagnosis and management of breast ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i> arising within fibroadenoma: Two case reports
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDDuctal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) arising within fibroadenoma is a type of tumor that is rarely encountered in clinic, with only about 100 cases of carcinoma arising within a fibroadenoma reported in the literature. Here, we present two cases of breast DCIS arising within a fibroadenoma and discuss their clinical and imaging findings as well as treatment.CASE SUMMARYThe patients did not have cancer-related personal and family histories. Case 1 (a 49-year-old woman) was diagnosed with a bilateral breast nodule in May 2018 and was followed (preoperative imaging data including ultrasound and mammography) for 3 years; she underwent an excisional biopsy to address an enlargement in nodule size. Case 2 (a 37-year-old woman) was diagnosed with a left breast nodule in June 2021 and consequently received vacuum-assisted biopsy of the tumor which appeared as "irregularly shaped" and "unevenly textured" tissue on ultrasound. The pathological diagnosis was clear in both cases. Both patients underwent breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The two cases received or planned to receive radiotherapy as well as endocrine therapy (tamoxifen).CONCLUSIONBreast DCIS arising within a fibroadenoma is rare, but patients treated with radiotherapy and endocrine therapy can have good prognosis.

TI  - Subsidence in Coastal Cities Throughout the World Observed by InSAR
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We measured subsidence rates in 99 coastal cities around the world between 2015 and 2020 using the PS Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar method and Sentinel-1 data. In most cities, part of the land is subsiding faster than sea level is rising. If subsidence continues at present rates, these cities will be challenged by flooding much sooner than projected by sea level rise models. The most rapid subsidence is occurring in South, Southeast, and East Asia. However, rapid subsidence is also happening in North America, Europe, Africa, and Australia. Human activity-primarily groundwater extraction-is likely the main cause of this subsidence. Expanded monitoring and policy interventions are required to reduce subsidence rates and minimize their consequences.

TI  - Civil Aircrafts Augmented Space-Air-Ground-Integrated Vehicular Networks: Motivation, Breakthrough, and Challenges
T2  - IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to meet mobile users' unprecedented communication demands and the goal of global seamless communication, space-air-ground-integrated networks (SAGINs) have attracted lots of attention in recent years. The existing works related on air segment mainly discussed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), airships, and balloons near the space. However, they neglected many other valuable resources, such as civil aircrafts (CAs). Moreover, communication problems for remote areas and emergency scenarios (such as disasters and hot-spot areas) have not been solved thoroughly. Motivated by these facts, we introduce CAs to enhance the current SAGIN and present a novel architecture called "CAs augmented space-air-ground-integrated vehicular networks" (CAA-SAGIVNs). The proposed network architecture makes breakthrough in three main aspects: 1) a normal network architecture; 2) collaboration with multiple sky access platforms (SAPs); and 3) service-oriented fair allocation. Although CAA-SAGIVN can bring out many benefits, it also faces more challenges due to its high mobility and cross-layer characteristics. Therefore, we provide an exhaustive review of state-of-the-art works on modeling, mobility management, solutions of service-oriented allocation in SAGIN. On the basis of the preliminary investigation and discussion, some open issues are identified as possible future research directions.

TI  - Shifts in growth light optima among diatom species support their succession during the spring bloom in the Arctic
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Diatoms of the Arctic Ocean annually experience extreme changes of light environment linked to photoperiodic cycles and seasonal variations of the snow and sea-ice cover extent and thickness which attenuate light penetration in the water column. Arctic diatom communities exploit this complex seasonal dynamic through a well-documented species succession during spring, beginning in sea-ice and culminating in massive phytoplankton blooms underneath sea-ice and in the marginal ice zone. The pattern of diatom taxa sequentially dominating this succession is relatively well conserved interannually, and taxonomic shifts seem to align with habitat transitions. To understand whether differential photoadaptation strategies among diatom taxa explain these recurring succession sequences, we coupled laboratory experiments with field work in Baffin Bay at 67.5 degrees N. Based on field data, we selected five diatom species typical of different ecological niches and measured their growth rates under light intensity ranges representative of their natural habitats. To characterize their photoacclimative responses, we sampled pigments and total particulate carbon, and conducted C-14-uptake photosynthesis response curves and variable fluorescence measurements. We documented a gradient in species respective light intensity for maximal growth suggesting divergent light response plasticity, which for the most part align with species sequential dominance. Other photophysiological parameters supported this ecophysiological framing, although contrasts were always clear only between succession endmembers, Nitzschia frigida and Chaetoceros neogracilis. To validate that these photoacclimative responses are representative of in situ dynamics, we compared them to the chlorophyll a-specific light-limited slope (alpha*) and saturated rate of photosynthesis (PM*$$ {P}_{\mathrm{M}}<^>{\ast } $$), monitored in Baffin Bay on sea-ice and planktonic communities. This complementary approach confirmed that unusual responses in alpha* and PM*$$ {P}_{\mathrm{M}}<^>{\ast } $$ as a function of light history intensity are similar between sentinel sympagic species N. frigida and natural ice-core communities. While no light-history-dependent trends were observed in planktonic communities, their alpha* and PM*$$ {P}_{\mathrm{M}}<^>{\ast } $$ values were in the range of measurements from our monospecific cultures. Synthesis. Our results suggest that Arctic diatoms species photoadaptation strategy is tuned to the light environment of the habitats in which they dominate and indeed drives the seasonal taxonomic succession.

TI  - A Comparison between Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 OLI Satellite Images for Soil Salinity Distribution Mapping Using a Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we aim to compare the suitability of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 OLI images for detecting and mapping soil salinity distribution (SSD) using a deep learning convolutional neural network (DL-CNN) approach. We first identified and selected six SSD predisposing variables to train the models. These variables are the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land use, soil types, geomorphology, land surface temperature, and evaporation rate. Next, we collected 219 ground control points from the top 20 cm of the soil surface and randomly divided them into training (70%) and validation (30%) datasets. We then evaluated the different activation, loss/cost, and optimization functions and, finally, employed ReLu, Cross-Entropy, and Adam as the most effective activation function, loss/cost function, and optimizer, respectively. The results showed that the Sentinel-2 image (94.78% overall accuracy and a Kappa of 93.14%) is more suitable for detecting and mapping SSD than the Landsat 8 OLI image (91.45% overall accuracy and a Kappa of 90.45%). Our findings also demonstrated that the DL-CNN approach can support fast and reliable image analysis and classification. As such, this research is a promising step toward understanding, controlling, and managing the complex mechanisms of soil salinization.

TI  - Drought monitoring and its effects on vegetation and water extent changes using remote sensing data in Urmia Lake watershed, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of drought hazards is important due to their socio-economic impacts on water resources, agriculture, and ecosystems. In this study, the effects of drought on changing water area and canopy of the Lake Urmia watershed in the northwest of Iran have been monitored and evaluated. For this purpose, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was calculated in short and medium periods (1-month and 3-month) to determine the dry-spell periods in the Lake Urmia basin. In reviewing this analysis, the annual average has been examined and evaluated. Furthermore, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and remote sensing data were used to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and the Temperature-Vegetation-Dryness Index (TVDI) to identify the area of water body, water level, and vegetation changes during 20 years (2000-2020). The Pearson correlation coefficient was also employed to explore the relationship between the drought and the remote sensing-derived indices. According to the results of drought analysis, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020 had experienced dry spells in the Lake Urmia basin. The NDWI changes also showed that the maximum area of the Lake Urmia happened in 2000, and its minimum was recorded in 2014. The variation of NDVI values showed that the highest values of vegetation cover were estimated to be 2,850 km(2) in.2000, and its lowest value was 1,300 km(2) in.2014. The maximum EVI and TDVI were calculated in 2000, while their minimum was observed in 2012 and 2014. Also, the correlation analysis showed that the SPI had the highest correlation with NDVI. Meanwhile, 1-month SPI had a higher correlation than the 3-month SPI with NDVI and EVI. As a concluding remark, NDVI and NDWI were more suitable indices to monitor the changes in vegetation and drought-related water area. The results can be used to make sound decisions regarding the rapid assessment of remote sensing-derived data and water-related indices.

TI  - Identifying trend shifts in vegetation greenness in China from 1982 to 2015
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding vegetation evolution is critical for exploring changes in terrestrial ecosystems and identifying future challenges. However, analyses that simultaneously examine trend shifts in vegetation greenness at the national, regional, biome, and pixel scales in China are still rare. Using long-term (1982-2015) satellite data and the breaks for additive season and trend (BFAST) technique, we identified breakpoints in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in China. The results showed that the annual mean NDVI gradually increased. A total of 68.8% of the vegetated area exhibited upward trends in NDVI, most of which was distributed in Southeast China and the Loess Plateau. Changes in NDVI trends occurred in 78.7% of the total vegetated areas, while hotspots were concentrated in Northwest and North China. A rapid increase in breakpoints was detected after 1999, mainly concentrated in North and Northwest China, and corresponding to the times and areas with the highest ecological engineering efforts. Positive shifts in NDVI trends were more common and generally distributed on the eastern side of the Hu Huanyong line, while browning (negative) shifts were mainly distributed on the western side and were gradually expanding, indicating a possible tendency toward environmental degradation. Although unstable vegetation areas that underwent land cover type changes had higher frequencies of breakpoints, the proportion of stable vegetation experiencing NDVI trend shifts was higher after 2000, probably because human intervention buffered external disturbances in unstable areas. Identifying hotspot areas of shifts in vegetation greenness can help setting priorities when taking measures for ecosystem conservation, thus provide scientific reference for sustainable land development.

TI  - Effects of climatic parameters on <i>Tetranychus urticae</i> (Acari: Tetranychidae) populations based on remote sensing in the southeastern Caspian Sea
T2  - PERSIAN JOURNAL OF ACAROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) is known to be a serious pest in cotton fields worldwide. In this research, monitoring of T. urticae was done based on satellite data by using the time series of vegetation index and climatic factors through near real-time assessment. The current study aimed to determine correlations between the population dynamic of T. urticae and the effects of Absorbing Aerosol Index (AAI) depicted by Sentinel-5 Precursor. Sentinal-2 NDVI (10 m), Land Surface Temperature (LST), MODIS-Evapotranspiration (ET), and CHIRPS precipitation. Spider-mite outbreak was found to be coincided with wheat harvesting where several dusty days were experienced with a high aerosol index of 0.167. Rainfall had a significant negative correlation with T. urticae populations (R-2 = 0.378), while a threshold precipitation level of at least 2 mm was estimated for cleaning up the canopy. No significant pattern could be found between temperature and T. urticae populations until August 2020. Yet, significant positive relationships were weekly observed during August 2020 (R-2 = 0.3519, 0.1283, 0.1675, and 0.178). Evapotranspiration (ET) displayed a statistically synchronous relationship with T. urticae dynamism (R-2 = 0.637). Also, there was a positive correlation between increasing NDVI and T. urticae population until August 2020 and then, it changed to a negative pattern (R-2 = 0.273 and 0.139). Based on these findings, AAIs of Sentinel-5 and MOD'Sevapotranspiration had the potential to forecast spider-mite population with high temporal resolution.

TI  - Integrated approach to evaluate unstable rocky slopes: case study of Aqabat Al-Sulbat road in Aseer Province, Saudi Arabia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this applied research work, the risk of rock instability in the Aqabat Al-Sulbat road section located in the north-west area of Aseer Province in Saudi Arabia was evaluated, and the primary natural trigger factors of rock slope instability on further environmental components (rock slope stability, road network, and urban areas) were estimated using satellite images (Landsat8), digital terrain models, and geoprocessing in geographical information systems software (classification, overlapping algorithms and production thematic mapping in Arctoolbox). Additionally, field geotechnical investigations testing and over-coring drilling sampling allowed the characterization of the section of road in terms of geological structure and environmental components (geology, morphology, road network, lineaments, and hydrology). As a result, rock slope instability vulnerability mapping was simulated using satellite imagery and geographical information systems (GIS) and ranking natural trigger factors using the combined fuzzy Delphi analytical hierarchic process with the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) as multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques. Additionally, many rock layer discontinuity stations were implemented to evaluate rock slope instabilities, and these were visualized using the Dips program and combined with modeling using 3DEC software to predict rock slope failure based on the distinct element method (DEM) at a small scale. Thereafter, safety factors were computed depending on these previous geospatial data. Finally, vulnerability index mapping was combined with rock instability risk mapping for the Aqabat Al-Sulbat road. Within the framework of sustainable development, these results can be used to inform the urban planning of the municipality of Aseer Province.

TI  - Detection and analysis of drought over Turkey with remote sensing and model-based drought indices
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the severe impacts of climate change, drought has become one of the most undesirable and complex natural phenomena with critical consequences for the environment, economy and society. The orthodox drought monitoring approaches use observations of meteorological stations, which are typically restricted in time and space. Remote sensing, conversely, provides continuous global coverage of a variety of hydro-meteorological variables that are influential in drought, and data extracted from remote sensing and modeling missions are now considered more practical and alluring for researchers. In this study, we applied a combination of field data, remotely sensed data and modeled data to detect and quantitatively analyze drought phenomena. To achieve this objective, we utilized Terrestrial Water Storage Anomalies (TWSA) estimations from GRACE mission, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from MODIS mission, Surface Runoff (R) and Evapotranspiration from ERA5 reanalysis datasets and Soil Moisture (SM) from GLDAS data model to evaluate their feasibility in detecting recent droughts over Turkey. We validated the accuracy of several remote sensing-based indices (GRACE Drought Severity Index, Water Storage Deficit Index [WSDI], Soil Moisture Index, Standardized Runoff Index and NDVI) with the traditional indices (SPI and SPEI) calculated from in situ observations of precipitation. The results revealed that the GRACE-based WSDI gave the best performance with high correlations with the SPI index both temporally and spatially over Turkey. We also found that monthly and annual time series of WSDI agreed well with the SPI index with correlations of 0.69 and 0.73, respectively. The results of drought analysis also indicated that WSDI could be used as a proxy to standard meteorological drought indices over Turkey as it performed well to detect and characterize the recent droughts of Turkey based on its comparisons to SPI results.

TI  - Biangular-Combined Vegetation Indices to Improve the Estimation of Canopy Chlorophyll Content in Wheat Using Multi-Angle Experimental and Simulated Spectral Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) indicates the photosynthetic functioning of a crop, which is essential for the growth and development and yield increasing. Accurate estimation of CCC from remote-sensing data benefits from including information on leaf chlorophyll and canopy structures. However, conventional nadir reflectance is usually subject to the lack of an adequate expression on the geometric structures and shaded parts of vegetation canopy, and the derived vegetation indices (VIs) are prone to be saturated at high CCC level. Using 3-year field experiments with different wheat cultivars, leaf colors, structural types, and growth stages, and integrated with PROSPECT+SAILh model simulation, we studied the potential of multi-angle reflectance data for the improved estimation of CCC. The characteristics of angular anisotropy in spectral reflectance were investigated. Analyses based on both simulated and experimental multi-angle hyperspectral data were carried out to compare performances of 20 existing VIs at different viewing angles, and to propose an algorithm to develop novel biangular-combined vegetation indices (BCVIs) for tracking CCC dynamics in wheat. The results indicated that spectral reflectance values, as well as the coefficient of determination (R-2) between mono-angular VIs and CCC, at back-scattering directions, were mostly higher than those at forward-scattering directions. Mono-angular VIs at +30 degrees angle, were closest to the hot-spot position in our case, achieved the highest R-2 among 13 viewing angles including the nadir observation. The general formulation for the newly developed BCVIs was BCVIVI = f x VI(theta 1) - (1 - f) x VI(theta 2), in which the VI was used to characterize chlorophyll status, while the subtraction of VI at theta 1 and theta 2 viewing angles in a proportion was used to highlight the canopy structural information. From our result, the values of the theta 1 and theta 2 around hot-spot and dark-spot positions, and the f of 0.6 or 0.7 were found as the optimized values. Through comparisons revealed that large improvements on CCC modeling could be obtained by the BCVIs, especially for the experimental data, indicated by the increase in R-2 by 25.1-51.4%, as compared to the corresponding mono-angular VIs at +30 degrees angle. The BCVIMCARI[705,750] was proved to greatly undermine the saturation effect of mono-angular MCARI[705,750], expressing the best linearity and the most sensitive to CCC, with R-2 of 0.98 and 0.72 for simulated and experimental data, respectively. Our study will eventually have extensive prospects in monitoring crop phenotype dynamics in for example large breeding trials.

TI  - SAR and optical images correlation illuminates post-seismic landslide motion after the Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake (Nepal)
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the days to weeks following an earthquake, landslides can display specific post-seismic motions, including delayed initiations and post-seismic relaxations. These motions have an uncertain origin, sometimes attributed to specificities of the landslide basal interface or to fluid transports in the landslide basal shear zone. Here we address this question, by documenting the co- and post-seismic motions of slow-moving landslides accelerated by the Gorkha earthquake (Mw 7.8, 25/04/2015, Nepal). We detect 11 slow-moving landslides over an area of 750 km(2) in the near field of the earthquake, and monitor their motions thanks to a time-series of Pleiades optical satellite images and SAR Sentinel-1 images. The post-seismic landslide motions are much larger than the co-seismic ones, reaching up to 34 +/- 0.6 m accommodated over 2 months. A delayed initiation of several days (> 4 days) is also measured for at least two of the landslides. We analyze our findings in regards with all the previous observations on slow-moving landslides accelerated by earthquakes, and propose that the post-seismic motions are caused by diffusion of groundwater from co-seismic material contraction up to the landslide basal shear zone or from internal landslide reconfiguration. Our observations strongly suggest the main control of the hydrology in the landslide processes under seismic forcings.

TI  - Ecological Quality Assessment of the Wetlands in Beijing: Based on Plant Diversity
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland plant diversity reveals key aspects of the environmental and ecological status of wetlands and plays an important role in the maintenance of ecosystem functions and services. The present study surveyed the plant species diversity of 22 wetlands in Beijing and, combining field data and remote sensing data, evaluated ecological qualities of the wetlands based on indicators of habitat status, plant species diversity, typical wetland plant community, and status of alien plant invasion. A total of 338 species (including varieties and subspecies) belonging to 220 genera of 74 families of wetland plants were recorded in Beijing. The wetlands could be divided into four types according to plant species composition, which showed a spatial gradient pattern from urban core to ecological conservation areas. Wetlands located in ecological conservation areas were of better ecological quality than those located in urban core and suburban plain areas. The value of ecological quality index (EQI) for Baihe River, Huaishahe-Huaijiuhe River, Jinniu Lake, Hanshiqiao Wetland, and Yongdinghe River (Mentougou Section) were in the top five, whereas the value of EQI for river-type wetlands located in suburban plain areas were relatively lower. The results of the canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the most critical factors affecting wetland plant species composition were the distance to the nearest road, water total nitrogen, and area percentage of ecological green land. Furthermore, the results of the canonical correlation analysis indicated that the most critical factors affecting wetland plant species diversity were the area percentage of construction land and water total organic carbon. Human activity intensity and water quality have a strong impact on the plant diversity and ecological quality of wetlands in Beijing. It is suggested that efforts should be made to strengthen the ecological protection and restoration of the river-type wetlands located in suburban plain areas.

TI  - Land use and land cover change, and analysis of its drivers in Ojoje watershed, Southern Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - There have been incredible changes that have taken place in the land use pattern globally over the last 50 years, which resulted from environmental degradation and climate change impacts. Quantitative analysis of the LULC dynamics helps in land-use management and ecosystem degradation at large. The study was conducted in the Doyogena district, southern Ethiopia to identify LULC change dynamics, and analyze the driving forces using combined approaches: remote sensing, field observations, in-depth household interviews, key informants, and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs). A supervised maximum likelihood image cataloging method was employed in conjunction with feature extraction of satellite images to categorize and map LULC classes of the study area. Satellite image handing out, classification technique, and remotely sensed data were processed using ArcGIS map 10.6, and ERDAS Imagine 2014. Common LULC categories were identified, and a change analysis was conducted. Accordingly, seven LULC categories were determined. The result showed a considerable decline in forestland from 1756.7 ha (38.8%) in 1973 to 71.6 ha (1.6%) in 2020. Similarly, wetlands have declined successively from 16.8 in 2000-2010 to 6.3 in 1986-2020 ha/year over the last three and half decades respectively. On the other hand, cropland has increased from 34.1% in 1986-2000 to 46.3% between 1986-2020, which is linked to population growth, settlement, and expansion of farmlands. The study watershed has experienced a considerable change in LULC change over the last >3 decades. Hence, local and national regimes should implement sustainable land planning, management strategies including integrated land-use planning, and policy reform into development projects and programs.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and oncological results of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with early lip and oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in a real-world scenario. Methods Retrospective study including seven Brazilian centers. Results Four-hundred and seven cN0 patients were accrued for 20 years. The rate of occult metastasis was 23.1% and 22 patients (5.4%) had regional failure. We found, for 5 years of follow-up, 85.3% of regional recurrence-free survival; 77.1% of disease-free survival; 73.7% of overall survival; and 86.7% of disease-specific survival. The rate of false-negative cases was 5.4%. Conclusion In a real-world scenario, sentinel lymph node biopsy for patients with SCC of the lip and oral cavity proved feasible in different settings and to be oncologically safe, with similar rates of occult lymph node metastasis and false-negative cases, when compared to elective neck dissection, and with similar long-term survival to that reported historically.

TI  - Interseismic coupling along the Mexican subduction zone seen by InSAR and GNSS
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Mexican subduction zone, the heterogeneous spatial density of the GNSS network is limiting the capability to measure and study the variability of the surface deformation field all along the subduction zone. To improve the spatial coverage of interseismic deformation estimates, we combine InSAR and GNSS data. We use four Sentinel-1 descending tracks covering a large part of the Mexican Pacific coast from Jalisco to Oaxaca, over the period from 2016 to 2019.5. The InSAR and GNSS time series, over the same 3.5-year period, are corrected for the coseismic deformations of two M-w > 7 earthquakes but not for slow slip events (SSE) and postseismic surface displacements. We present estimates of mean surface velocities over the study period, which combine the linear inter-SSE trend and transient aseismic slip. By inverting these velocities, we estimate the short term coupling at the plate interface, which shows large lateral variations. InSAR data significantly improves the resolution of the inversion, compared to a model based only on GNSS data. Although not representative of long-term coupling in areas with large transient events, the short-term coupling estimates highlight the role of transient signals, such as slow slip events, on the coupling variability measured by geodesy. In agreement with GNSS times series over longer time period, the data also suggest that the Jalisco area (longitude from -106 degrees E to -104 degrees E), where no large transient events are observed, is highly coupled with a coupling ratio higher than 0.8.

TI  - Determining microclimates, required weather stations, and suitable fruit tree species by using remote sensing techniques: A case study in an arid and subtropical region
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To efficiently manage agricultural lands and increase their productivity, the number of meteorological stations needs to be determined, based on the climatic diversity. Darab region in southeastern Iran, which is a hub of agricultural and horticultural production, has only one synoptic station despite its diverse climatic conditions. So, the study's purpose is to determine microclimates, the number of meteorological stations necessary, and the types of plants suitable for cultivation based on landforms, altitudes, and temperatures. The temperature zoning maps were prepared by the IDW method (meteorological stations near the study area) and MODIS satellite image for every month for an average of 15 years (2004-2019). In order to determine the relationship between temperature classes and topographic features, the digital elevation model and topographic position index (TPI) were used, respectively. For each microclimate in the study area, different types of tropical, subtropical, and temperate tree cultivars were determined. According to the results, there are six microclimates in the study area. Correlation results between topography, rainfall and temperature indicate that there is a strong link (R-2 = 0.91) between these variables. From these values, 6 classes with 6 microclimates can be determined for the study area, which indicates that 6 meteorological stations are needed. In order to increase productivity, one of the major innovations of this study focused on the relationship between the type of landforms in the region and the type of vegetation. The results showed that canyons, shallow valleys, plains small, open slopes, upper slopes, hills in valleys, and mid-slope ridges are suitable for growing tropical plants; canyons, u-shaped valleys, hills in valleys, and mid-slope ridges are suitable for cultivation of subtropical plants; and upland drainages, canyons, upper slopes, mid-slope ridges, and mountain tops are suitable for cultivation of temperate plants.

TI  - Differential Effects of Natural Grazing and Feedlot Feeding on Yak Fecal Microbiota
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Variation in food and diet shapes the diversity of the gut microbiota of ruminants. The present study investigated the microbial diversity in the fecal microbiota of yaks reared under natural grazing and feedlot system. A total of 48 domestic yaks with an average age of 7.5 years were selected from two different grazing habitats: one group grazed on natural pasture (grazing yaks-GY) while the other group was fed fodder and concentrate (feedlot yaks-FY). Crude protein, non-fiber carbohydrate, hemicelluloses, and digestible dry matter contents of natural pastures were higher than those in the feedlot. The lower insoluble fiber contents were found in grazing land. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed 675 and 348 unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the GY and FY, respectively, in addition to 1,778 common OTUs. Overall, a total of 9,891 OTUs were identified as a whole, of which 6,160 OTUs were from GY and 3,731 were from FY. Shannon index analysis revealed a higher bacterial diversity in GY than FY. At the phylum level, Firmicutes were dominant bacterial taxa in both groups. The relative abundance of Firmicutes in GY (56% +/- 0.05) was higher than in FY (41% +/- 0.08). At the family level, GY had a significantly higher abundance of Ruminococcaceae (p < 0.001) and Rikenellaceae (p < 0.001) than FY, but FY had a significantly higher abundance of Prevotellaceae than GY (p < 0.001). At the genus level, abundances of Faecalibacterium, Alloprevotella, and Succinivibrio were higher in FY than in GY. This study presents novel information on fecal bacterial composition and diversity in yaks reared under two different production systems.

TI  - Improved precise kinematic LEO orbits based on the raw observation approach
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Observing Earth's gravity field variations by means of precise orbits is nowadays a common practice next to dedicated gravity field satellite missions. The reason for using kinematic orbits of low earth orbiting (LEO) satellites for gravity field estimates instead of dynamic or reduced-dynamic orbits is based on the fact that kinematic orbits do not include a priori information about the gravity field. To achieve highly accurate gravity field estimates through the use of LEO satellite positions, it is of paramount importance to determine these positions as precisely as possible. We investigated whether it is possible to improve the accuracy of the kinematic orbits that had been processed by our working group in the past. For this purpose we modified our processing approach, which is based on an iterative least-squares adjustment using raw observations, and re-processed the kinematic orbits for several satellite missions such as CHAMP, GRACE, GRACE Follow-On, Jason, MetOp, Swarm, Sentinel, TanDEM-X and TerraSAR-X. The modifications include that we are now processing global navigation satellite system (GNSS) constellations in-house and that the phase ambiguities are fixed to integer values. In this paper we discuss these modifications. We show that the consistent in-house processing of the GNSS products already significantly improves the orbit determination, since the use of the these GNSS products mitigates the performance degradation. Furthermore, we present that an additional enhancement through integer ambiguities can be achieved.

TI  - Pixel- and Object-Based ensemble learning for forest burn severity using USGS FIREMON and Mediterranean condition dNBRs in Aegean ecosystem (Turkey)
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires cause aerosol emissions and biomass burning that pose major threats to the ozone layer. The precise estimation of burned area with the degree of burn severity plays a critical role to investigate the impacts of fire on forests. Burn severity analysis using remotely sensed data has become popular in the last decade for post-fire detection, management and mitigation studies. In this study, performances of three ensemble learning algorithms, namely, random forest (RF), rotation forest (RotFor), and canonical correlation forest (CCF) were analyzed on burn severity mapping in terms of pixel-and object-based image analyses applying standard accuracy metrics and McNemar's statistical test. The classification procedures were applied to two fire-affected areas located in Izmir province, Turkey using multitemporal (pre-and post-fire) Sentinel-2A images. The results showed that the CCF classifier outperformed the RF and RotFor classifiers for both pixel-and object-based classifications in that classification accuracies varied by about 5% in both pixel-and objectbased classifications. According to the results of pixel-based CCF classification, total burned area (i.e., moderate-high and high severity) was estimated as 813 ha and 2,546 ha for Menderes and Karabag lar fires, respectively. The difference between the pixel- and object-based classification estimation about the burned area coverage could be resulting from intraclass spectral heterogeneity about the image objects located in the burned regions of the study areas. Statistical analysis also revealed that the RotFor and CCF algorithms produced similar (c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Scour initiation mechanism of deposit in Jiuzhaigou scenic area after earthquake
T2  - ROCK AND SOIL MECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A magnitude of Ms 7.0 earthquake struck the Jiuzhaigou World Natural Heritage Park, in Jiuzhaigou county, Northwest of Sichuan province on August 8, 2017, and trigged abundant coseismic landslides deposit in the scenic spot. Due to the heave rainfall after earthquake, the slope debris flow occurred frequently, which seriously threatened the restoration and reconstruction in the after three years. In 2017-2020, continuous investigation, remote sensing interpretation and in-situ erosion test were used to research the impact of slope runoff erosion on deposit. The result shows that the seepage response characteristics are significant during the scouring process, and the downward movement of wetting front causes the increase of volumetric water content and pore water pressure, the matrix suction first fluctuates slightly and then decreases. In addition, the material characteristics of deposit provides the prerequisites for initiation. Under strong hydrodynamic conditions, the startup process is "preliminary penetration -> scraping slip flow -> rapid accumulation -> local saturation erosion-stability". And finally, the mechanical analysis of deposit under different saturations is more consistent with the field test monitoring results. It is further believed that the increase of soil moisture content, and pore water pressure, the rapid decrease of matrix suction and the erosion of high-intensity runoff caused the initiation. The research results can have a certain significance for the long-term effects prediction of debris flow and ecological management after the earthquake.

T2  - ANNALS OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The feasibility of tracer production of (99m)technetium (Tc)-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-I&S sterile cold kit, imaging with single photon emission tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT), and Tc-99m-PSMA-radioguided robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (Tc-99m-PSMA-RG-RALRP) technique for lymph node (LN) dissection of primary prostate cancer (PCa) patients were evaluated prospectively. Methods Fifteen primary PCa patients with intermediate- or high-risk score according to D'Amico risk stratification who had PSMA receptor affinity with Ga-68 PSMA-11 PET/CT were enrolled. After Tc-99m-PSMA-I&S injection and SPECT/CT imaging, Tc-99m-PSMA-RG-RALRP with DaVinci XI robotic platform and laparoscopic gamma probe were performed. Radioactive rating of resected tissue was compared with post-operative histopathology. Physiological and pathological uptakes of organs and tissues for both imaging modalities were compared. Results Physiological radiotracer distribution was similar for both imaging modalities. PCa lesions were much more visible on PET/CT. Metastatic LNs could not be visualized with SPECT/CT. Eighteen of 297 totally dissected LNs were metastatic, which were exactly the same with per-operative probe counts with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and negative and positive predictive value of all 100%. The median follow-up was 23.5 +/- 4.6 months. tPSA reduction was > 98%. The 2.5 years biochemical recurrence-free survival, PCa-specific treatment-free survival and overall survival rates were 86,7%, 66,7% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion Tc-99 m-PSMA-RG-RALRP is a promising technique for extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) during robotic surgery, which may shorten the operation time and reduce complication risks. If LN metastases is detected during surgery with PSMA-targeted probe, it may be an early indicator of PCa-spesific treatment planning. Tc-99 m-PSMA-I&S SPECT/CT is not as successful as Ga-68 PSMA-11 PET/CT for diagnosis of primary PCA lesions or LN metastases.

TI  - A study of the serious conflicts between oil palm expansion and biodiversity conservation using high-resolution remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable oil palm production is a key issue in global biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. As one of the world's major vegetable oil crops, oil palm has expanded exponentially to meet increased demand over the past decades. However, previous monitoring and assessments of oil palm plantations were hampered because of the lack of high-resolution annual maps at the global scale. We produced annual oil palm plantation maps in 4 major producer countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Papua New Guinea) in Asia-Pacific from 2007 to 2018 at 100-m resolution using advanced remote sensing techniques with Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. We uncover the global patterns of oil palm expansion and find that global oil palm expansion has a very high degree of potential conflict with local biodiversity. Globally, 99.9% of oil palm plantations overlapped with Conservation Priority Zones (CPZs) and oil palm plantations encroached on 231 protected areas. We suggest to incorporate the related issues into the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.

AB  - Objective: Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) spares most patients diagnosed with clinically early-stage vulvar cancer from undergoing complete inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFLND). We sought to evaluate the intraoperative examination of frozen sentinel lymph node (SLN) sections to assess the need for IFLND. Methods: We identified patients with vulvar cancer treated at a tertiary referral center between January 2006 and December 2019 who either underwent SLND or met the eligibility criteria to receive SLND. All patients were restaged according to the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2009 guidelines. The records of each patient were reviewed for disease characteristics, follow-up status, patient demographics, SLN eligibility, and surgical and pathologic variables. Results: Of 142 eligible patients, 76 underwent SLND (53.5%) for a total of 118 groins assessed. We found no statistically significant differences in characteristics between the cohorts that received or lacked SLN examination. The SLN was detected in 90.8% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 81.9%-96.2%) of patients. SLNs of 52 patients were sent for frozen section, and the results were used to direct further surgical intervention. The results of the frozen section pathology and the final pathology report exhibited a high degree of correlation per patient (100%) and per groin (98.7%). The 1 incorrect groin was negative on frozen but positive on final pathology and therefore no patients received an incorrect complete groin dissection. We observed no statistically significant differences in recurrence-free survival or overall survival rates between those patients who received or did not receive SLND. Conclusions: The use of intraoperative frozen section is appropriate for assessing node status at time of initial surgery. The use of this method decreases the incidence of reoperation by identifying those patients who warrant immediate IFLND.

TI  - Joint estimation of aboveground biomass using "Space-Air-Ground" data in the Qilian Mountains, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of aboveground biomass (AGB) and its spatial distribution is essential for sustainable management and development. The most frequently used method for estimating AGB with remotely sensed data is based on the relationship between AGB measured data and vegetation indices. In the past, there were some shortcomings in analyzing the spatial heterogeneity and solving scale difference. Therefore, this paper realized the space-air-ground integrated based on Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and measured data. The results indicated that the RFR models have excellent adaptability to invert AGB of three different coverage regions in study area, with R-2 of 0.69 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 116.22 kg.hm(-2) for low-coverage region, R-2 of 0.65 and RMSE of 164.16 kg.hm(-2) for medium-coverage region, R-2 of 0.73 and RMSE of 149.99 kg.hm(-2) for high-coverage region. We found that the main driving vegetation indices was different in each region during the process of model building and it was related to the characteristics of vegetation indices. Moreover, regions with different coverage have different responses to topography. The findings showed that the spatial distribution and driving mechanism of AGB in the study area could be more clearly analyzed based on the coverage division. The introduction of coverage division reasonably enhanced the accuracy of RFR modeling AGB. This study confirmed that using the Sentinel-2 MSI, UAV images, measured data and the RFR model to realize the space-air-ground integrated is an applicable method for monitoring and assessment of AGB in Qilian Mountains, which can offer scientific basis and theoretical support to rational development of land resources and maintaining the balance of ecosystem.

TI  - Does sentinel lymph node biopsy in endometrial cancer surgery have an impact on the rate of adjuvant post operative pelvic radiation? An Israeli Gynecologic Oncology Group Study
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To compare the rates of post-operative radiotherapy between two methods of lymph nodes assessment during surgical staging for endometrial cancer (EC). Methods: We conducted a comparative study of all consecutive women with endometrial cancer who underwent sentinel lymph node detection and biopsy using blue dye and isotope scan (SLNB) at Kaplan Medical Center and patients from the IGOG database, who underwent staging lymphadenectomy (PLND). The primary outcome was the rate of adjuvant and therapeutic radiation. The secondary outcome was a comparison of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: There were 138 patients in the SLNB group and 1022 women in the PLND group. The detection rate of SLN was 74% for unilateral detection and 54% for bilateral detection. In the PLND group 57% were high risk patients vs. 47% in SLNB group (p = 0.03). 43% of high-risk patients in the PLND group received adjuvant or therapeutic pelvic radiation vs. 28% of high-risk women in the SLNB arm (p = 0.017). No statistically significant difference in recurrence rates nor in death rates had been observed in the high-risk group patients. The 5-years survival in the high-risk PLND group was 80% and the recurrence rate was 19% vs. 75% 5-year survival and 14% recurrence in high-risk SLNB cohort, log-rank p = 0.82 for survival and long-rank p = 0.25 for recurrence. Conclusion: Endometrial cancer patients undergoing lymph node assessment by sentinel lymph node biopsy, receive less pelvic radiotherapy.

TI  - Annual variation of the landscape pattern in the Liao River Delta wetland from 1976 to 2020
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Liao River Delta wetland is an important breeding base for rare waterbirds in the world. In recent years, with the immense disturbance of human activities, the wetland has degraded. It is a prerequisite for wetland conservation and restoration to accurately extract and monitor changes in wetland area and spatial distribution. Here, based on Landsat time-series images from 1976 to 2020 in the Liao River Delta wetland, we used a synthesized upon object-oriented classification and hierarchical classification method to detect the wetland changes. We analyzed the driving factors of these change. The study found that the total wetland area have reduced by 188.00 km(2) by human activities during the 45 years, among which the decrease was the most drastic from 2009 to 2012. Natural wetland area have decreased by 414.90 km(2), with a large reduction in intertidal muds, mainly due to the increase in human activities after the establishment of the city in 1984. Human-made wetland area have increased by 226.90 km(2), mainly influenced by changes in the transfer of intertidal muds to aquaculture ponds and paddy fields. A significant increase in the area of construction land among non-wetlands, mainly caused by the completion of Panjin New Port in 2009. Human activities were the main factors causing the extravagant changes in the Liao River Delta wetland.

TI  - A Multiscale Spatiotemporal Approach for Smallholder Irrigation Detection
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In presenting an irrigation detection methodology that leverages multiscale satellite imagery of vegetation abundance, this paper introduces a process to supplement limited ground-collected labels and ensure classifier applicability in an area of interest. Spatiotemporal analysis of MODIS 250 m enhanced vegetation index (EVI) timeseries characterizes native vegetation phenologies at regional scale to provide the basis for a continuous phenology map that guides supplementary label collection over irrigated and non-irrigated agriculture. Subsequently, validated dry season greening and senescence cycles observed in 10 m Sentinel-2 imagery are used to train a suite of classifiers for automated detection of potential smallholder irrigation. Strategies to improve model robustness are demonstrated, including a method of data augmentation that randomly shifts training samples; and an assessment of classifier types that produce the best performance in withheld target regions. The methodology is applied to detect smallholder irrigation in two states in the Ethiopian Highlands, Tigray and Amhara, where detection of irrigated smallholder farm plots is crucial for energy infrastructure planning. Results show that a transformer-based neural network architecture allows for the most robust prediction performance in withheld regions, followed closely by a CatBoost model. Over withheld ground-collection survey labels, the transformer-based model achieves 96.7% accuracy over non-irrigated samples and 95.9% accuracy over irrigated samples. Over a larger set of samples independently collected via the introduced method of label supplementation, non-irrigated and irrigated labels are predicted with 98.3 and 95.5% accuracy, respectively. The detection model is then deployed over Tigray and Amhara, revealing crop rotation patterns and year-over-year irrigated area change. Predictions suggest that irrigated area in these two states has decreased by approximately 40% from 2020 to 2021.

TI  - Risks to carbon storage from land-use change revealed by peat thickness maps of Peru
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical peatlands are among the most carbon-dense ecosystems but land-use change has led to the loss of large peatland areas, associated with substantial greenhouse gas emissions. To design effective conservation and restoration policies, maps of the location and carbon storage of tropical peatlands are vital. This is especially so in countries such as Peru where the distribution of its large, hydrologically intact peatlands is poorly known. Here field and remote sensing data support the model development of peatland extent and thickness for lowland Peruvian Amazonia. We estimate a peatland area of 62,714 km(2) (5th and 95th confidence interval percentiles of 58,325 and 67,102 km(2), respectively) and carbon stock of 5.4 (2.6-10.6) PgC, a value approaching the entire above-ground carbon stock of Peru but contained within just 5% of its land area. Combining the map of peatland extent with national land-cover data we reveal small but growing areas of deforestation and associated CO2 emissions from peat decomposition due to conversion to mining, urban areas and agriculture. The emissions from peatland areas classified as forest in 2000 represent 1-4% of Peruvian CO2 forest emissions between 2000 and 2016. We suggest that bespoke monitoring, protection and sustainable management of tropical peatlands are required to avoid further degradation and CO2 emissions.

TI  - Increasing Arctic Tundra Flooding Threatens Wildlife Habitat and Survival: Impacts on the Critically Endangered Siberian Crane (<i>Grus leucogeranus</i>)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is causing Arctic temperatures to increase at least twice as fast as the planet on average. Temperature and precipitation are predicted to continue increasing, such that flooding might become more prevalent in the new Arctic. Increased flooding frequency and extreme flooding events may pose new threats to Arctic biodiversity through habitat disturbance and decreased survival. We used the Siberian crane (Grus leucogeranus) as a model organism to investigate how flooding influences nesting habitat availability and juvenile counts. When spring flooding destroys eggs, adults either do not raise any chicks or have reduced time to prepare them for their long migration to China, thus years with extensive flooding could negatively impact future crane generations. We used nest site observation data from 14 surveys between 1995 and 2019, habitat mapping based on Landsat 8 imagery, and species distribution modeling to predict Siberian crane potential nesting habitat. Nesting habitat loss due to extreme flooding was calculated by overlaying this potential nesting habitat with Global Surface Water data. The percent of potential flooded nest sites varied between 6.7-55% across years, with a significant increase between 2001 and 2018. Extreme flood events, as experienced in 2017 and 2018, eliminated almost half of the potential nesting habitat. Importantly, we found that the percentage of flooded nest sites across years was negatively correlated with the number of observed juveniles. The Arctic lowlands are exposed to seasonal water level fluctuations that species have evolved with and adapted to. Siberian cranes and other species depending on Arctic ecosystems are expected to continue adapting to changing flood conditions, but extreme flood events further threaten the long-term survival of critically endangered species. It is imperative to assess how ecosystems and species respond to climatic extremes to support Arctic conservation strategies.

TI  - Beyond Climatic Variation: Human Disturbances Alter the Effectiveness of a Protected Area to Reduce Fires in a Tropical Peatland
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is considered a major threat to biodiversity in many habitats and the occurrence of fire has frequently been used to investigate the effectiveness of protected areas. Yet, despite the known importance of tropical peatlands for biodiversity conservation and serious threat that anthropogenically induced fires pose to this ecosystem, the influence of protected area designation on fire occurrence in tropical peatland has been poorly assessed thus far. Our study addresses this knowledge gap through providing a novel assessment of fire patterns from a tropical peatland protected area and surrounding landscape. We investigated the importance of both climatic factors (top-down mechanism) and human interventions (bottom-up mechanism) on fire occurrence through analyzing 20-years (2001-2020) of LANDSAT and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) images of the Padang Sugihan Wildlife Reserve and a 10-km buffer area surrounding this in Sumatra, Indonesia. Fire density was assessed in relation to road and canal construction. Monthly and annual precipitation was compared between wet and dry years. The reserve was effective in limiting fire compared to surrounding landscapes only in wet years. We revealed that peat fire occurrence in the protected area and buffer zone was not due to climatic factors alone, with distance from canals and roads also contributing toward fire occurrence. Our results suggest that it is essential to address tropical peatland fire processes at a landscape level, particularly at the surroundings of protected areas, in order to increase the effectiveness of fire protection, improve fire risk classification maps, and conserve threatened tropical peatland wildlife such as the Sumatran elephant.

TI  - Cloud and cloud shadow detection for optical satellite imagery: Features, algorithms, validation, and prospects
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of clouds prevents optical satellite imaging systems from obtaining useful Earth observation information and negatively affects the processing and application of optical satellite images. Therefore, the detection of clouds and their accompanying shadows is an essential step in preprocessing optical satellite images and has emerged as a popular research topic in recent decades due to the interest in image time series analysis and remote sensing data mining. This review first analyzes the trends of the field, summarizes the progress and achievements in the cloud and cloud shadow detection methods in terms of features, algorithms, and validation of results, and then discusses existing problems, and provides our prospects at the end. We aim at identifying the emerging research trends and opportunities, while providing guidance for selecting the most suitable methods for coping with cloud contaminated problems faced by optical satellite images, an extremely important issue for remote sensing of cloudy and rainy areas. In the future, expected improvements in accuracy and generalizability, the combination of physical models and deep learning, as well as artificial intelligence and online big data processing platforms will be able to further promote processing efficiency and facilitate applications of image time series. In addition, this review collects the latest open-source tools and datasets for cloud and cloud shadow detection and launches an online project (Open Satellite Image Cloud Detection Resources, i.e., OpenSICDR) to share the latest research outputs (https://github.com/dr-lizhiwei/OpenSICDR).

TI  - Visualizing and quantifying the spatiotemporal expansion of the Blue Lentic Belt in Alabama and Mississippi
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Blue Lentic Belt is a spatial belt of dense lentic habitats formed in the Mobile River Basin since the 1990s, and it is imposing considerable environmental stress on local and downstream aquatic habitats. Depicting the spatiotemporal evolution of the Blue Lentic Belt is essential to understanding its formation and consequential impacts on local environments. However, relevant discussion on it is absent since the Blue Lentic Belt is a new discovery. In this study, we developed a retrospective delineation method to visualize the spatiotemporal evolution of the lentic habitats in the Mobile River Basin and a tesseral model to numerically analyze the spatiotemporal expansion of the Blue Lentic Belt. In the developed method, the baseline inventory of lentic habitats is first delineated from 2019 Sentinel-2 satellite imagery at a spatial resolution of 10 m. The baseline inventory is then used to retrospectively delineate the past lentic habitats in the Mobile River Basin using the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Kernel density surfaces of lentic habitat image objects are estimated to detect the regions of dense lentic habitats, which sequentially form spatiotemporal objects of dense lentic habitats. The spatiotemporal objects of dense lentic habitats are projected onto planar space and are then structuralized as groups of spatial tesserae, namely alpha-peaks, beta-slopes, and gamma-edges. Attributes of these tesserae are numerically derived to quantify the spatiotemporal expansion of the Blue Lentic Belt. The results indicate that the Blue Lentic Belt has 4 alpha-peaks, 3 beta-slopes, and a single gamma-edge. It is formed from 4 stable hotspots (alpha-peaks) of the densest lentic habitats. The expansion of the Blue Lentic Belt ranges about 15.42 km. The expansion distance is about 0.57 of the average range of the beta-slopes in the Blue Lentic Belt, indicating a significant change of landscape in the Mobile River Basin. The development of the farm-raised catfish industry is considered the main driving force in the formation of the Blue Lentic Belt. The outcomes of this study have emphasized the rapid expansion of the Blue Lentic Belt and its negative impacts on local and downstream aquatic habitats, which calls for attention to systemic investigations by multiple disciplines.

TI  - A novel method of identifying and analysing oil smoke plumes based on MODIS and CALIPSO satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Black carbon aerosols are the second largest contributor to global warming while also being linked to respiratory and cardiovascular disease. These particles are generally found in smoke plumes originating from biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion. They are also heavily concentrated in smoke plumes originating from oil fires, exhibiting the largest ratio of black carbon to organic carbon. In this study, we identified and analysed oil smoke plumes derived from 30 major industrial events within a 12-year timeframe. To our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind that utilized a synergetic approach based on satellite remote sensing techniques. Satellite data offer access to these events, which, as seen in this study, are mainly located in war-prone or hazardous areas. This study focuses on the use of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) products regarding these types of aerosol while also highlighting their intrinsic limitations. By using data from both MODIS instruments on board Terra and Aqua satellites, we addressed the temporal evolution of the smoke plume while assessing lidarspecific properties and plume elevation using CALIPSO data. The analysis method in this study was developed to better differentiate between oil smoke aerosols and the local atmospheric scene. We present several aerosol properties in the form of plume-specific averaged values. We believe that MODIS values area conservative estimation of plume aerosol optical depth (AOD) since MODIS algorithms rely on general aerosol models and various atmospheric conditions within the look-up tables, which do not reflect the highly absorbing nature of these smoke plumes. Based on this study we conclude that the MODIS land algorithms are not yet suited for retrieving aerosol properties for these types of smoke plumes due to the strong absorbing properties of these aerosols. CALIPSO retrievals rely heavily on the type of lidar solutions showing discrepancy between constrained and unconstrained retrievals. Smoke plumes identified within a larger aerosol layer were treated as unconstrained retrievals and resulted in conservative AOD estimates. Conversely, smoke plumes surrounded by clear air were identified as opaque aerosol layers and resulted in higher lidar ratios and AOD values. Measured lidar ratios and particulate depolarization ratios showed values similar to the upper ranges of biomass burning smoke. Results agree with studies that utilized ground-based retrievals, in particular for Angstrom exponent (AE) and effective radius (R-eff) values. MODIS and CALIPSO retrieval algorithms disagree on AOD ranges, for the most part, due to the extreme light-absorbing nature of these types of aerosols. We believe that these types of studies are a strong indicator for the need of improved aerosol models and retrieval algorithms.

TI  - Radioisotope-Guided Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Penile Cancer: A Long-Term Follow-Up Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph node (LN) management is critical for survival in patients with penile cancer. However, radical inguinal lymphadenectomy carries a high risk of postoperative complications such as lymphedema, lymphocele, wound infection, and skin necrosis. The European Association of Urology guidelines therefore recommend invasive LN staging by modified inguinal lymphadenectomy or dynamic sentinel node biopsy (DSNB) in clinically node-negative patients (cN0) with intermediate- and high-risk tumors (>= T1G2). However, the timing of DSNB (simultaneous vs. subsequent to partial or total penile resection) is controversial and the low incidence of penile cancer means that data on the long-term outcomes of DSNB are limited. The present study aimed to analyze the reliability and morbidity of DSNB in patients with penile cancer during long-term follow-up. This retrospective study included 41 patients (76 groins) who underwent radioisotope-guided DSNB simultaneously or secondarily after penile surgery from June 2004 to November 2018. In total, 193 sentinel LNs (SLNs) and 39 non-SLNs were removed. The median number of dissected LNs was 2.5 (interquartile range 2-4). Histopathological analysis showed that five of the 76 groins (6.6%) contained metastases. None of the non-SLNs were tumor-positive. In accordance with the guidelines, all inguinal regions with positive SLNs underwent secondary radical inguinal lymphadenectomy, which revealed three additional metastases in one groin. Regional LN recurrence was detected in three patients (four groins) during a median follow-up of 70 months, including two patients in whom DSNB had been performed secondarily after repetitive penile tumor resections. DSNB-related complications occurred in 15.8% of groins. Most complications were mild (Clavien-Dindo grade I; 50%) or moderate (II; 25%), and invasive intervention was only required in 3.9% of groins (IIIa: n = 1; IIIb: n = 2). In summary, this study suggests that the current radioisotope-guided DSNB procedure may reduce the complication rate of inguinal lymphadenectomy in patients with cN0 penile cancer. However, DSNB and penile surgery should be performed simultaneously to minimize the false-negative rate. Recent advances, such as new tracers and imaging techniques, may help to reduce the false-negative rate of DSNB further.

TI  - The use of cavity-nesting wild birds as agents of biological control in vineyards of Central Chile
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Insectivorous birds provide key ecosystem services for agricultural production, such as biological pest control. However, habitat loss and degradation by agriculture are among the main causes of biodiversity loss globally, including the recent decline in bird populations. Habitat loss has particularly affected insectivorous birds due to the associated decrease in the availability of suitable nesting sites. Our study assessed a tool of ecological intensification to increase insectivorous bird abundance and biological control in vineyards. We evaluated the effects of nest boxes on prey removal by insectivorous birds in five vineyards in central Chile, using a two-year sentinel prey experimental trial. Our results showed significantly more sentinel larvae removal by birds in plots with nest boxes than control plots. Deploying the nest boxes resulted in a 43% higher consumption of sentinel prey. Therefore, we recommend using nest boxes as an environmentally-friendly method to increase native predators and enhance biological control in agricultural fields. This would have the potential to improve biodiversity conservation and maximize crop yields.

TI  - Sensitivity of biomass burning emissions estimates to land surface information
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Emissions from biomass burning (BB) are a key source of atmospheric tracer gases that affect the atmospheric carbon cycle. We developed four sets of global BB emissions estimates (named GlcGlob, GlcGeoc, McdGlob, and McdGeoc) using a bottom-up approach and by combining the remote sensing products related to fire distribution with two aboveground biomass (AGB) and two land cover classification (LCC) distributions. The sensitivity of the estimates of BB emissions to the AGB and LCC data was evaluated using the carbon monoxide (CO) emissions associated with each BB estimate. Using the AGB and/or LCC data led to substantially different spatial estimates of CO emissions, with a large (factor of approximately 3) spread of estimates for the mean annual CO emissions: 526 +/- 53, 219 +/- 35, 624 +/- 57, and 293 +/- 44 Tg CO yr(-1) for GlcGlob, GlcGeoc, McdGlob, and McdGeoc, respectively, and 415 +/- 47 Tg CO yr(-1) for their ensemble average (EsmAve). We simulated atmospheric CO variability at an approximately 2.5 degrees grid using an atmospheric tracer transport model and the BB emissions estimates and compared it with ground-based and satellite observations. At ground-based observation sites during fire seasons, the impact of intermittent fire events was poorly defined in our simulations due to the coarse resolution, which obscured temporal and spatial variability in the simulated atmospheric CO concentration. However, when compared at the regional and global scales, the distribution of atmospheric CO concentrations in the simulations shows substantial differences among the estimates of BB emissions. These results indicate that the estimates of BB emissions are highly sensitive to the AGB and LCC data.

TI  - Axillary Lymph Node Dissection Can Be Omitted in Breast Cancer Patients With Mastectomy and False-Negative Frozen Section in Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe IBCSG 23-01 and AMAROS trials both reported that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) did not change survival rates in breast cancer patients with positive nodes detected by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The aim of this study was to determine whether breast cancer patients with mastectomy and false-negative frozen section (FS) in SLNB could forgo ALND. Materials and MethodsThis was a retrospective study of cN0 patients diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer treated by mastectomy and SLNB at our institute between January 2010 and December 2014. Patients with false-negative FS in SLNB were separated by the following management of axillary lymph node dissection in the non-ALND group (nonprocess or axillary radiation only) and ALND group (with or without radiation). ResultsA total of 212 patients were included, 86 and 126 patients in the non-ALND and ALND groups, respectively. The positive rate of non-sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) was 15.87% (20/126) in the ALND group. In multivariate analysis, we found that patients with larger tumor size (>2 cm) (OR, 1.989; p = 0.030) and multifocal lesions (OR, 3.542; p = 0.029) tended to receive ALND. The positivity of non-SLNs in the ALND group was associated with SLN macrometastasis (OR, 3.551; p = 0.043) and lymphovascular invasion (OR, 6.158; p = 0.003). Also, removing more SLNs (>= 3) was related to negativity in non-SLNs (OR, 0.255; p = 0.016). After a median follow-up of 59.43 months, RFS and OS of the two groups were similar (p = 0.994 and 0.441). In subgroup analysis, we found that 97 patients who met the inclusive criteria of the IBCSG 23-01 trial had similar RFS and OS between the non-ALND and ALND groups (p = 0.856 and 0.298). The positive rate of non-SLNs was 9.62% (5/52). Also, in 174 patients who met the criteria of the AMAROS trial, RFS and OS in the non-ALND and ALND groups were similar (p = 0.930 and 0.616). The positive rate of non-SLNs was 18.27% (19/104). ConclusionALND can be carefully omitted in selected breast cancer patients with mastectomy and false-negative FS in SLNB. SLNB is relatively sufficient in the IBCSG 23-01-eligible patients, and axillary radiation was an effective option in the AMAROS-eligible patients.

TI  - Monitoring 13 years of drastic catchment change and the hydroecological responses of a drained thermokarst lake
T2  - ARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Catastrophic drainage of thermokarst lakes transforms portions of former lakebed to terrestrial settings, which have largely unknown consequences for the remaining aquatic habitat. Old Crow Flats, northern Yukon (Canada), is a lake-rich area that has recently experienced a climate-driven increase in lake drainage frequency. A notable example occurred during June 2007 when Zelma Lake (originally 12 km2) lost over 80% of its volume. Here we integrate remote sensing techniques with in situ hydrological and limnological measurements over 13 years following drainage to (1) monitor water surface area and terrestrial land cover change and (2) identify associated effects on aquatic conditions. An airborne drone system was used to provide training data for land cover classification of AVIRIS-NG data, which indicated that tall willow shrubs covered 30.8% of the former lake area by 2017. Lake water isotope-derived deuterium excess increased during the 13-year record indicating that hydrological input increased with greater snowpack accumulation within encroaching vegetation. Limnological conditions were highly variable and eutrophic during the first few years following drainage but became more stable as vegetation colonized the former lakebed. This long-term study provides insight into aquatic responses to thermokarst lake drainage and shrub vegetation proliferation, which are increasing in many Arctic and subarctic landscapes.

TI  - Direct measurements of ozone response to emissions perturbations in California
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new technique was used to directly measure O-3 response to changes in precursor NOx and volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations in the atmosphere using three identical Teflon smog chambers equipped with UV lights. One chamber served as the baseline measurement for O-3 formation, one chamber added NOx, and one chamber added surrogate VOCs (ethylene, m-xylene, n-hexane). Comparing the O-3 formation between chambers over a 3-hour UV cycle provides a direct measurement of O-3 sensitivity to precursor concentrations. Measurements made with this system at Sacramento, California, between April-December 2020 revealed that the atmospheric chemical regime followed a seasonal cycle. O-3 formation was VOC-limited (NOx-rich) during the early spring, transitioned to NOx-limited during the summer due to increased concentrations of ambient VOCs with high O-3 formation potential, and then returned to VOC-limited (NOx-rich) during the fall season as the concentrations of ambient VOCs decreased and NOx increased. This seasonal pattern of O-3 sensitivity is consistent with the cycle of biogenic emissions in California. The direct chamber O-3 sensitivity measurements matched semi-direct measurements of HCHO/NO2 ratios from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P) satellite. Furthermore, the satellite observations showed that the same seasonal cycle in O-3 sensitivity occurred over most of the entire state of California, with only the urban cores of the very large cities remaining VOC-limited across all seasons. The O-3-nonattainment days (MDA8 O-3 > 70 ppb) have O-3 sensitivity in the NOx-limited regime, suggesting that a NOx emissions control strategy would be most effective at reducing these peak O-3 concentrations. In contrast, a large portion of the days with MDA8 O-3 concentrations below 55 ppb were in the VOC-limited regime, suggesting that an emissions control strategy focusing on NOx reduction would increase O-3 concentrations. This challenging situation suggests that emissions control programs that focus on NOx reductions will immediately lower peak O-3 concentrations but slightly increase intermediate O-3 concentrations until NOx levels fall far enough to re-enter the NOx-limited regime. The spatial pattern of increasing and decreasing O-3 concentrations in response to a NOx emissions control strategy should be carefully mapped in order to fully understand the public health implications.

TI  - Disparity in Obesity and Hypertension Risks Observed Between Pacific Islander and Asian American Health Fair Attendees in Los Angeles, 2011-2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction The Pacific Islander American population is understudied due to being aggregated with Asian Americans. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of directly measured body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage (%BF), and blood pressure (BP) between Pacific Islander Americans and Asian Americans from health screenings in Los Angeles, California. We hope to reveal intra-APIA health disparities masked by this data aggregation. Methods We analyzed BMI, %BF, and BP that were objectively measured by trained personnel at health screenings in Los Angeles between January 2011 and December 2019. We performed multivariable multinomial logistic regression models with obesity and hypertensive categories as outcome variables and ethnicity as the primary independent variable of interest. Models controlled for year of visit, participant age, sex, income, education level, years living in the USA, employment status, English proficiency, regular doctor access, and health insurance status. Results A total of 4,832 individuals were included in the analysis. Multivariable analyses revealed that Pacific Islander participants were at significantly higher risks for being classified as obese compared with all Asian American subgroups studied, including Chinese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Japanese. Pacific Islanders also exhibited significantly lower predicted probability of having a normal blood pressure compared with Chinese and Thai participants. Some variation between Asian subgroups were also observed. Conclusions Pacific Islander participants had higher risk of several sentinel health problems compared to Asian American participants. Disaggregation of PI Americans from the APIA umbrella category in future studies is necessary to unmask the critical needs of this important community.

TI  - Construction of GI Network Based on MSPA and PLUS Model in the Main Urban Area of Zhengzhou: A Case Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - With continuous urbanization and the fragmentation of green areas that affect human well-being, the establishment of a green infrastructure (GI) network is important in future urban planning. As a National Central City, Zhengzhou has a large population and is undergoing rapid economic development, resulting in an urgent demand for green space within the city in recent years. We selected the main urban area of Zhengzhou as the study area based on the two phases of Landsat 8 satellite remote sensing image data, for 2016 and 2021, and used the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model to predict the spatial distribution of GI in the future; compared with traditional methods, this method identified green spaces from a future perspective. A GI network-consisting of an open space with vegetation as the main body-was designed for the main urban area of Zhengzhou using the traditional landscape ecological pattern theory, integrating morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model, circuit theory, and other methods. Evidently, the area of green space in Zhengzhou City in 2021 was 36 231.6 hm(2). GI prediction results indicate that continuous expansion of the main urban area did not result in significant changes in the size of GI in the city. The GI within the urban area was relatively fragmented, forming 15 GI hubs, most of which were densely distributed along the edges of the main urban area. This study proposed the construction of a GI network with a target corridor and target points based on the existing corridor. This included the identification of seven target corridors and 15 target hubs; the total length of the corridor was 77.032 km, with a total of 31 target points. In summary, the GI network pattern of "one protection barrier, two lines, three loops and more points " was proposed. With new urban problems constantly emerging, this research could provide a theoretical reference basis for the planning of GI in the main urban area of the National Central City. The study provides concrete evidence on the optimum pattern for the construction of GI networks in cities with large populations.

TI  - GISD30: global 30 m impervious-surface dynamic dataset from 1985 to 2020 using time-series Landsat imagery on the Google Earth Engine platform
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Accurately mapping impervious-surface dynamics has great scientific significance and application value for research on urban sustainable development, the assessment of anthropogenic carbon emissions and global ecological-environment modeling. In this study, a novel and automatic method of combining the advantages of spectral-generalization and automatic-sample-extraction strategies was proposed, and then an accurate global 30m impervious-surface dynamic dataset (GISD30) for 1985 to 2020 was produced using time-series Landsat imagery on the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform. Firstly, the global training samples and corresponding reflectance spectra were automatically derived from prior global 30m land-cover products after employing the multitemporal compositing method and relative radiometric normalization. Then, spatiotemporal adaptive classification models, trained with the migrated reflectance spectra of impervious surfaces from 2020 and transferred pervious-surface samples in each epoch for every 5 degrees x 5 degrees geographical tile, were applied to map the impervious surface in each period. Furthermore, a spatiotemporal-consistency correction method was presented to minimize the effects of independent classification errors and improve the spatiotemporal consistency of impervious-surface dynamics. Our global 30m impervious-surface dynamic model achieved an overall accuracy of 90.1% and a kappa coefficient of 0.865 using 23 322 global time-series validation samples. Cross-comparisons with five existing global 30m impervious-surface products further indicated that our GISD30 dynamic product achieved the best performance in capturing the spatial distributions and spatiotemporal dynamics of impervious surfaces in various impervious landscapes. The statistical results indicated that the global impervious surface has doubled in the past 35 years, from 5.116 x 10(5) km(2) in 1985 to 10.871 x 10(5) km(2) in 2020, and Asia saw the largest increase in impervious surface area compared to other continents, with a total increase of 2.946 x 10(5) km(2). Therefore, it was concluded that our global 30m impervious-surface dynamic dataset is an accurate and promising product and could provide vital support in monitoring regional or global urbanization as well as in related applications. The global 30m impervious-surface dynamic dataset from 1985 to 2020 generated in this paper is free to access at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5220816 (Liu et al., 2021b).

T2  - ANNALS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Fluorescence imaging using indocyanine green (ICG) has revolutionized commonly performed general surgical procedures by providing superior anatomic imaging and enhancing safety for patients. ICG, when injected, shows a bright green fluorescence when subjected to the near infra-red (NIR) spectrum. Materials and methods: We employed the use of ICG in Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, Intestinal Colorectal Anastomosis and Hernia to assess vascularity of resected ends and bowel viability, Sentinel Lymph node map -ping, Vascular surgery to assess amputation stump success and in assessing Flap Vascularity and healing. Results: ICG when administered had successfully shown bright green fluorescence in different cases thereby aiding in surgical procedures. Conclusion: Routine intraoperative use of ICG could pave the way for a more objective assessment of different surgical circumstances and thereby reduce personalized barriers to aciurgy. ICG fluorescence therefore seems to be a promising apparatus in standard general surgical procedures minimizing untoward errors and improving patient conformance.

TI  - Investigation of spaceborne trace gas products over St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg, Russia, by using COllaborative Column Carbon Observing Network (COCCON) observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This work employs ground- and space-based observations, together with model data, to study columnar abundances of atmospheric trace gases (XH2O, XCO2, XCH4 and XCO) in two high-latitude Russian cities, St. Petersburg and Yekaterinburg. Two portable C011aborative Column Carbon Observing Network (COCCON) spectrometers were used for continuous measurements at these locations during 2019 and 2020. Additionally, a subset of data of special interest (a strong gradient in XCH4 and XCO was detected) collected in the framework of a mobile city campaign performed in 2019 using both instruments is investigated. All studied satellite products (TROPOMI, OCO-2, GOSAT, MUSICA IASI) show generally good agreement with COCCON observations. Satellite and ground-based observations at high latitudes are much sparser than at low or mid latitudes, which makes direct coincident comparisons between remote-sensing observations more difficult. Therefore, a method of scaling continuous Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) model data to the ground-based observations is developed and used for creating virtual COCCON observations. These adjusted CAMS data are then used for satellite validation, showing good agreement in both Peterhof and Yekaterinburg. The gradients between the two study sites (Delta Xgas) are similar between CAMS and CAMS-COCCON datasets, indicating that the model gradients are in agreement with the gradients observed by COCCON. This is further supported by a few simultaneous COCCON and satellite Delta Xgas measurements, which also agree with the model gradient. With respect to the city campaign observations recorded in St Petersburg, the downwind COCCON station measured obvious enhancements for both XCH4 (10.6 ppb) and XCO (9.5 ppb), which is nicely reflected by TROPOMI observations, which detect city-scale gradients of the order 9.4 ppb for XCH4 and 12.5 ppb for XCO.

TI  - Building Image Feature Extraction Using Data Mining Technology
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, data mining technology is continuously researched in science and application. With the rapid development of remote sensing satellite industry, especially the launch of remote sensing satellites with high-resolution sensors, the amount of information obtained from remote sensing images has increased dramatically, which has largely promoted the application of remote sensing data in various industries. This technique mines useable information from less complete and accurate data while ensuring low program complexity. In order to determine the impact of data mining techniques on feature extraction of graphic images, this paper explores the relevant steps in the image recognition process, especially the image preenhancement and image extraction processes. This paper develops a preliminary set of relevant data and investigates two different extraction methods based on the availability or absence of nursing information. Aiming at the advantages and disadvantages of the two house extraction methods, this work discusses how to effectively integrate remote sensing data. It uses different data sources to describe different characteristics of buildings, analyzes and extracts effective information, and finally derives building information. The research results show that, using the SVM algorithm in data mining for image feature extraction, in the verified filtering window, the accuracy can be effectively improved by about 20%. Buildings are important objects in high-resolution remote sensing images, and their feature extraction and recognition technology is of great significance in many fields such as digital city construction, urban planning, and military reconnaissance.

TI  - New morphological features for urban tree species identification using LiDAR point clouds
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban tree species identification is the basis for studying the urban-environment coordination mechanism at the species level. Although the gradual maturity of remote sensing data and related research including light detection and ranging (LiDAR) provides a good foundation for the realization of this technology, multiple reasons such as cost, data openness, study scope limitations, and weakness of traditional morphological features make such data still challenging to apply to subtropical urban trees with heterogeneous canopy structures and high biodiversity. To address the problem, we developed two large-scale LiDAR morphological features in this research by, 1) modifying the rotate image method based on the axisymmetric structure to make it easier to use, and 2) developing an innovative adaptive ellipsoid method to extract the canopy features of the non-axisymmetric structure effectively. We evaluated the ability of these two morphological features to describe 12 common subtropical urban tree (SUT) species in Hong Kong growing in urban parks and streets, obtaining an accuracy of 88%. And the advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated by comparison with existing LiDAR morphological features and mean decrease accuracy (MDA) analysis. Our results illustrated that the rotate image feature based on the axisymmetric structure did not perform as well as the adaptive ellipsoid feature based on the non-axisymmetric structure in SUT, and the combined application of these two new morphological features got further accuracy improvement. The method proposed in this study had significant advantages in terms of accuracy, the number of species included, and generalisation capability compared to existing studies on the identification of subtropical urban trees.

TI  - Inter-eruptive spatiotemporal variation of caldera contraction on Miyakejima volcano revealed by PALSAR and PALSAR-2 time-series data
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring caldera deformation helps improve the understanding of pressure conditions within a volcanic conduit beneath the caldera. Miyakejima volcano in Japan experienced a caldera collapse associated with an eruption in 2000, which included dike intrusions. Although a previous InSAR study suggested deceleration of caldera subsidence in 2009, few observations on the caldera deformation have been reported. We applied SAR time-series analysis to Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) and PALSAR-2 data to investigate spatiotemporal variations of ground deformations at Miyakejima volcano during 2006-2011 and 2014-2019. The spatial characteristics of the caldera contraction transformed from a concentric pattern into a north-south asymmetric pattern in mid-2009, implying migration of a deformation peak from the central aspect to the southern edge of the caldera floor. These peaks of the caldera contraction are located at the initial position of the caldera collapse on the central caldera floor, and at an active fumarole on its southern edge. The asymmetric pattern of the caldera contraction continued during 2014-2019 based on PALSAR-2 data. Using the results of numerical modeling and earthquake distribution beneath the caldera, we interpreted that the continuous asymmetric caldera contraction was driven by brittle failures induced by continuous hydrothermal alterations. Although a previous study proposed deceleration of caldera subsidence in mid-2009, we believe that their findings revealed only a snapshot of the spatial variation of the caldera contraction detected in this study.

TI  - Multi-criteria land suitability spatial model (MLSM) for expanding sustainable aquaculture based on resource characteristics and policies
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Unplanned aquaculture led to the destruction of important ecosystems worldwide. A multi-criteria land suitability model (MLSM) was developed to locate the suitable regions for aquaculture using satellite images, AHP and Monte Carlo simulation, spatial analysis, resource characteristics, and regulations. Twenty-one variables within four subgroups (land use, water quality, soil characteristics, and infrastructure support) have been integrated for the site suitability. Land availability was the major limiting factor. The area available for aquaculture was 4310 ha in Ramanathapuram District, which consists of 33.3% of most appropriate, 23.1% of appropriate, and 43.6% of moderately appropriate regions. The carrying capacity of rivers indicated that all rivers had sufficient nutrient assimilation capacity, except the Kottagudi River, where the aquaculture planning is to be within the carrying capacity of the river. The sensitivity analysis confirmed that integrated MLSM and carrying capacity approach could be adopted to identify suitable zones to develop aquaculture and save productive ecosystems.

TI  - The story of the Samaritan woman and Jesus (John 4:1-42) focusing on water within an ecofeminist theological perspective
T2  - PRACTICAL THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores water as portrayed in the story of the Samaritan woman and Jesus in John 4:1-42 on the basis of an ecofeminist theological perspective: a method of valuing the liberation of women and nature. The story depicts an event in the context of water shortages, which are characteristic of the region. However, when interpreting the story, a number of scholars have focused on the spiritual living water of Jesus rather than on the value of ordinary, physical, potable water. Based on an ecofeminist theological analysis, this article not only critiques anthropocentric, dualistic, and patriarchal paradigms, but also highlights interdependencies, interrelationships, and mutualities between all creatures and water. This contributes to the pursuit of an alternative Christian worldview which is concerned with all living beings on earth without any disparity. In addition, it is important not to distinguish between the two interpretations of water, as a physical resource and as a spiritual metaphor, especially if this leads us to put a greater emphasis on the former to the detriment of the latter. This article applies an ecofeminist biblical hermeneutic, which articulates and explores the oppression of both nature and women. This looks at the story through the lenses of four different hermeneutics: experience, suspicion, reconfiguration, and transformative action for Church, and proposes a range of ways in which a new interpretation can be justified and applied.

TI  - Utility of Axillary Reverse Mapping (ARM) and Incidence of Metastasis in Arm Draining Lymph Nodes in Patients with Breast Cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Lymphedema of the upper limb is the most common complication in patients with breast cancer, who require axillary lymph node (LN) dissection. Proposition of identifying upper limb draining LN and preserving it, during axillary dissection can reduce significant postoperative morbidity, but it has the risk of inadequate oncological resection. This study was planned to find out metastatic rate in axillary reverse mapping (ARM) nodes in our population. Materials and Methods Lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) was performed using intradermal injection of (99m) Tc Sulfur Colloid into ipsilateral second and third interdigital web spaces of hand in patients with breast cancer. Planar, single-photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography images were acquired followed by intraoperative localization of arm draining LNs using Gamma Probe. All identified ARM nodes were dissected and sent for histopathological examination to confirm metastatic involvement. Results Twenty eligible patients were prospectively analyzed. The identification rate of arm draining LN with LSG was 90% (18/20). Among 14 eligible patients included in the study, ARM node metastasis was seen in two patients. A total of 64 ARM nodes were dissected from 14 patients, 4/64 nodes (2 patients) were positive for metastases (6.25%). Of the six patients excluded from the study, in 1 patient ARM node could not be identified on Gamma Probe, in two cases, it could not be retrieved surgically, in next two cases ARM could not be identified on LSG and remaining one case was removed because of previous surgical intervention. Conclusion In the current study, LSG showed the identification rate of 90% for ARM nodes in patients with carcinoma breast and metastatic involvement was seen in 6.25% (4/64) of these nodes in 2/14 (14.2%) patients, which is in agreement with previously published data. Oncological safety of preserving ARM nodes needs to be evaluated in the larger population.

TI  - The Eco-Environmental Changes in Typical Coastal Zones of Southern China From 1987 to 2020: A Case Study of Guangdong Coastal Counties
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Population growth, socioeconomic development, and rapid urbanization have exacerbated the deterioration of coastal ecosystems, particularly in the coastal region of southern China, which has experienced significant urbanization. A precise and timely insight into the ecological changes is indicative of economic and environmental harmonization in southern coast of China and other regions of the world. This study applied 731 Landsat images to assess quantitatively the spatial and temporal evolution of ecological environment quality in the coastal zone of South China during 19872020 based on the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI). The results show that 1) the correlation between the RSEI calculated using Landsat data and the parameters is more than 75%, and the results were significant when applied to assess the ecological environment of the coastal zone in South China. 2) The ecological quality of the coastal zone in South China as a whole showed a slight initial degradation during 19872020, followed by a gradual improvement trend and then a slight degradation; the area with good ecological quality decreased from 38.96 to 7.97%, and then gradually recovered to 56.61% in 2010. Subsequently, the regions with good ecological quality showed a significant decline, reducing to 1.72%, and then increasing to 38.46% until 2020. In addition, regional differences persisting during the study period are caused by the impact of human activities on the land use types of different landscapes. 3) Good and moderate ecological quality classes occupy most of the coastal zones in South China, but the pressure on the coastal zone is still not optimistic due to the sensitivity of the coastal zone and the accelerated urbanization in South China. As a large-scale, long time series of coastal zone ecological monitoring, this study can provide support for planning, ecological monitoring, environmental protection policy formulation, and integrated regional management of coastal zones and similar areas in South China.

TI  - Can wind farms change the phenology of grassland in China?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind energy has attracted worldwide attention as a clean energy source and wind farms are rapidly increasing in num-ber. However, operation of wind farms can affect the local climate and, consequently, local vegetation phenology. Hence, the influence of wind farms on phenology needs to be understood. In this paper, we use remote sensing MOD09GQ data to calculate phenological indexes of vegetation near a large wind farm in a semi-arid grassland area of Inner Mongolia, China. The vegetation phenology before and wind farm construction is compared, with a control area used to account for long-term climate change. The results show that the wind farm extended the growing season of vegetation in areas upwind and downwind of the wind farm. In the prevailing wind direction, the growing season was extended by 11.7 days within 4 km of the wind farm in the upwind area, by 10.0 days within the wind farm, and by 5.5 days within 4 km of the wind farm in the downwind area. The extension of the growing season is due to an earlier start of the growing season, which was mainly influenced by increases in local land surface temperatures. And such an extension will increase the evaporation from vegetation transpiration in study area, which is very likely to bring about decreases in soil moisture here. Such effects should be considered when assessing the ecological impacts of planned wind farms.

TI  - The Timing of Stroke Care Processes and Development of Stroke Associated Pneumonia: A National Registry Cohort Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionTimely stroke care can result in significant improvements in stroke recovery. However, little is known about how stroke care processes relate to complications such as the development of stroke associated pneumonia (SAP). Here we investigated associations between stroke care processes, their timing and development of SAP. MethodsWe obtained patient-level data from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme for all confirmed strokes between 1st April 2013 and 31st December 2018. SAP was identified if new antibiotic initiation for pneumonia occurred within the first 7 days of admission. Time to key stroke care processes in the pre-hospital, hyperacute and acute phase were investigated. A mixed effects logistic regression model estimated the association between SAP [Odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI] and each process of care after controlling for pre-determined confounders such as age, stroke severity and comorbidities. ResultsSAP was identified in 8.5% of 413,133 patients in 169 stroke units. A long time to arrival at a stroke unit after symptom onset or time last seen well [OR (95% CI) = 1.29 (1.23-1.35)], from admission to assessment by a stroke specialist [1.10 (1.06-1.14)] and from admission to assessment by a physiotherapist [1.16 (1.12-1.21)] were all independently associated with SAP. Short door to needle times were associated with lower odds of SAP [0.90 (0.83-0.97)]. ConclusionTimes from stroke onset and admission to certain key stroke care processes were associated with SAP. Understanding how timing of these care processes relate to SAP may enable development of preventive interventions to reduce antibiotic use and improve clinical outcomes.

TI  - Empirical Remote Sensing Algorithms to Retrieve SPM and CDOM in Québec Coastal Waters
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In most coastal waters, riverine inputs of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) are the primary optically active constituents. Moderate- and high-resolution satellite optical sensors, such as the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat-8 and the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) on Sentinel-2, offer a synoptic view at high spatial resolution (10-30 m) with weekly revisits allowing the study of coastal dynamics (e.g., river plumes and sediment re-suspension events). Accurate estimations of CDOM and SPM from space require regionally tuned bio-optical algorithms. Using an in situ dataset of CDOM, SPM, and optical properties (both apparent and inherent) from various field campaigns carried out in the coastal waters of the estuary and Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL) and eastern James Bay (JB) (N = 347), we developed regional algorithms for OLI and MSI sensors. We found that CDOM absorption at 440 nm [ag (440)] can be retrieved using the red-to-green band ratio for both EGSL and JB. In contrast, the SPM algorithm required regional adjustments due to significant differences in mass-specific inherent optical properties. Finally, the application of regional algorithms to satellite images from OLI and MSI indicated that the atmospheric correction (AC) algorithm C2RCC gives the most accurate remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) absolute values. However, the ACOLITE algorithm gives the best results for CDOM estimation (almost null bias; median symmetric accuracy of 45% and R2 of 0.78) as it preserved the Rrs spectral shape, while tending to yield positively bias SPM (88%). We conclude that the choice of the algorithm depends on the parameter of interest.

TI  - Heat wave-induced augmentation of surface urban heat islands strongly regulated by rural background
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of heat waves (HWs) on surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) has been widely studied, but the spatial pattern of SUHI responsiveness to HWs across various climates remains unclear, and the influence of HW intensity on SUHI responsiveness has not been systematically quantified. Using MODIS land surface temperature data, here we investigated the responsiveness of SUHI to HWs (quantified as Delta I) as well as its variations with HW intensity in 354 cities in seven climate zones across China. We find that during HW periods, the SUHI and surface urban cool island are augmented in the humid and arid regions of China, respectively. The inter-city heterogeneity in rural vegetation coverage accounts for such a spatial pattern. In eastern China, the Delta I peaks in the north subtropical climate (0.72 +/- 0.54 K for daytime and 0.29 +/- 0.23 K for the nighttime) probably for its specific rural farming method. With the intensification of HWs, the augmentation effect can be further enhanced for the north subtropical, warm temperate, and arid temperate climates during the day and for almost all the climates at night. These findings can help advance the understanding of the responsiveness of SUHI to extreme climatic events.

TI  - Decadal changes in Arctic Ocean Chlorophyll a: Bridging ocean color observations from the 1980s to present time
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely-sensed Ocean color data offer a unique opportunity for studying variations of bio-optical properties which is especially valuable in the Arctic Ocean (AO) where in situ data are sparse. In this study, we re-processed the raw data from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View (SeaWiFS, 1998-2010) and the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, 2003-2016) ocean-color sensors to ensure compatibility with the first ocean color sensor, namely, the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS, 1979-1986). Based on a bio-regional approach, this study assesses the quality of this new homogeneous pan-Arctic Chl a dataset, which provides the longest (but non-continuous) ocean color time-series ever produced for the AO (37 years long between 1979 and 2016). We show that despite the temporal gaps between 1986 and 1998 due to the absence of ocean color satellite, the time series is suitable to establish a baseline of phytoplankton biomass for the early 1980s, before sea-ice loss accelerated in the AO. More importantly, it provides the opportunity to quantify decadal changes over the AO revealing for instance the continuous Chl a increase in the inflow shelves such as the Barents Sea since the CZCS era.

TI  - The Global 2000-2020 Land Cover and Land Use Change Dataset Derived From the Landsat Archive: First Results
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in Landsat archive data processing and characterization enhanced our capacity to map land cover and land use globally with higher precision, temporal frequency, and thematic detail. Here, we present the first results from a project aimed at annual multidecadal land monitoring providing critical information for tracking global progress towards sustainable development. The global 30-m spatial resolution dataset quantifies changes in forest extent and height, cropland, built-up lands, surface water, and perennial snow and ice extent from the year 2000 to 2020. Landsat Analysis Ready Data served as an input for land cover and use mapping. Each thematic product was independently derived using locally and regionally calibrated machine learning tools. Thematic maps validation using a statistical sample of reference data confirmed their high accuracy (user's and producer's accuracies above 85% for all land cover and land use themes, except for built-up lands). Our results revealed dramatic changes in global land cover and land use over the past 20 years. The bitemporal dataset is publicly available and serves as a first input for the global land monitoring system.

TI  - How do snow cover fraction change and respond to climate in Altai Mountains of China?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating the spatial and temporal changes in snow cover over mountain areas is significant for understanding the impact of regional climate variability. In this study, using cloud-removed snow cover data, which are generated based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily snow cover products, the spatiotemporal changes of snow cover fraction (SCF) and its relationship with temperature and precipitation changes from 2002 to 2020 were examined over Altai Mountains, China. The results demonstrate that the distribution and changes of SCF are highly spatiotemporally heterogeneous. Within a year, the maximum SCF occurs in January at 98.6%, and the minimum appears in July at 8.7%. The annual-mean SCF shows an increasing trend at 0.09%center dot annum(-1), owing to the significantly increasing SCF in the snow accumulation period at 0.5%center dot annum(-1) and the decreasing SCF in the snow melting period at -0.2%center dot annum(-1). The SCF distribution, as well as its interannual change, is greatly influenced by elevation. During the snow cover period, a positive linear correlation between SCF and elevation is found at 0.02%center dot m(-1) (p < .01). The annual-mean SCF decreases in the area below 1,200 m, whereas it increases in the area above 1,200 m. Accordingly, the elevation-dependent SCF results in various SCF distributions on different slopes and watersheds. The SCF shows an apparent pattern in different aspects, with similar SCFs between the north and east aspects and between the west and south aspects but a difference between the northeast aspects and the westsouth aspects. The SCF is negatively correlated with air temperature (r = -0.74, p < 0.01) and positively correlated with precipitation (r = 0.74, p < 0.01). In addition, temperature shows a significant and larger correlation with SCF in both the snow accumulation and melting periods, indicating the major factor of temperature for the changes in SCF.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Cartosat-1 satellite provides relatively high-resolution elevation data, which is publicly available for free, for most parts of India. Yet, published works applying such data in the local geographical context are few. This paper illustrates the application of CartoDEM, an elevation dataset based on Cartosat-1, to develop a coarse geographic narrative of the terrain at the tehsil level. Kotra tehsil in Udaipur district of Rajasthan, India, was used as a case study. It was found that the data, along with the calibration and analysis methods used here, allows a fairly well-resolved understanding of the terrain of the tehsil, including identification of major landforms and quantification of terrain metrics such as elevation and roughness. The free and easy availability of such data shows offers the potential for such studies to be performed for any local area for which CartoDEM or similar data exists.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System Applications in Hydrocarbon Exploration: A Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Hydrocarbon exploration requires integration and updating of multi-source geo-scientific data for gathering knowledge of subsurface oil and gas bearing geological traps. Multi-spectral aerospace remote sensing (RS) data is an important spatial geo-scientific information source for hydrocarbon exploration, when combine with data of ground based geophysical, geochemical and well log data, using geographic information system (GIS). This paper presents a review on current status as well as future prospects of satellite RS and GIS applications in hydrocarbon exploration. In recent years, satellite RS and GIS techniques successfully used for basin wide assessment of hydrocarbon favourable areas by integration and analysis of multi-spectral RS derived geological inputs on sedimentary basin, lithology, geomorphology, terrain, geological structure, tectonic information etc. RS and digital elevation model derived geomorphic anomalies in the forms of anomalous drainage pattern and surface lineament linked with subsurface structural features are widely used in onshore hydrocarbon prospecting. Commonly, in hydrocarbon reservoirs, a well-known phenomenon called seepage (both macro and micro) is associated with oil and gas leak from subsurface accumulations to the surface. Long-term hydrocarbon seepages locally alter surface geochemical and microbial processes. Recently, hyperspectral RS successfully used in onshore hydrocarbon exploration by detection of micro-seepage based on identification and mapping of altered clay minerals, bleaching of red beds and geo-botanical effects of vegetation stress. Hyperspectral satellite derived indices viz. Hydrocarbon index, vegetation indices, and spectral angle mapper and spectral unmixing classification techniques are used in micro-seepage detection. Number of studies showed the potential utility of satellite microwave synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for offshore petroleum exploration by identification of sea surface oil slicks produced from sea floor hydrocarbon seeps. Use of satellite altimetry remote sensing technique also attempted for offshore hydrocarbon exploration by free air gravity anomalies derived geological details from satellite estimated geoid anomalies. Limited studies also highlighted potential applications of thermal and UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) RS in hydrocarbon exploration. GIS aided both data and knowledge driven geospatial modelling were applied for identification of favourable potential hydrocarbon areas integration of RS derived geological and vegetation anomalies and ground geophysical, geochemical and well data. Although recent and past multi-spectral RS and GIS techniques are successfully used for petroleum exploration, in depth research studies needed in the use of hyperspectral, polarimetric microwave SAR, altimetry, thermal satellite data, UAV RS, and GIS aided spatial modeling for efficiently exploring petroleum resources.

TI  - Satellite Derived Bathymetry with Sentinel-2 Imagery: Comparing Traditional Techniques with Advanced Methods and Machine Learning Ensemble Models
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate charting of nearshore bathymetry is critical to the safe and dependable use of coastal waterways frequented by the trading, fishing, tourism, and ocean energy industries. The accessibility of satellite imagery and the availability of various satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) techniques have provided a cost-effective alternative to traditional in-situ bathymetric surveys. Furthermore, improved algorithms and the advancement of machine learning models have provided opportunity for higher quality bathymetric derivations. However, to date the relative accuracy and performance between traditional physics-based techniques, improved physics-based methods, and machine learning ensemble models have not been adequately quantified. In this study, nearshore bathymetry is derived from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery near La Parguera, Puerto Rico utilizing a traditional band-ratio algorithm, a band-ratio switching method, a random forest machine learning model, and the XGBoost machine learning model. The machine learning models returned comparable results and were markedly more accurate relative to other techniques; however, both machine learning models required an extensive training dataset. All models were constrained by environmental influences and image spatial resolution, which were assessed to be the limiting factors for routine use of satellite-derived bathymetry as a reliable method for hydrographic surveying.

TI  - Geospatial approach to elucidate anomalies in the hierarchical organization of drainage network in Kuttiyadi River Basin, Southern India
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - An assessment of anomalies in the hierarchical organization of the drainage network in the Kuttiyadi River Basin (KuRB), Kerala, has been performed by considering various morphometric parameters such as bifurcation index (R), hierarchical anomaly index ( increment a), hierarchical anomaly density (ga), and stream gradient index (SL) in a geographical information system (GIS) platform. Further, a digital elevation model (DEM) of the area has been generated from Cartosat stereo pair data at 2.5-m resolution. The computed quantitative information about drainage characteristics reveals the highest drainage anomaly is observed in sub-watersheds (SW) III and IV. It is observed that neo-tectonic activity caused the development of younger stage drainage patterns of structural controls in the sub-watersheds of this river basin. The tectonic activity-induced diffusion, high energy fluvial erosion, and anthropogenic interferences altered the hierarchical organization of the drainage network of the sub-watersheds in mature to old stages of geomorphic evolution. The results of finding validated with asymmetry factor and ratio of the hierarchical index ( increment a) with hierarchical anomaly number (A), bifurcation index (R), direct bifurcation ratio (R-db), stream gradient index (SL), and denudation index (logTu). From the denudation index analysis, the sediment yield of the river basin is identified as 0.67 t center dot km(-2)center dot yr(-1). Moreover, the asymmetric factor (AF) in the KuRB shows the imprints of Paleo-Neo Proterozoic crustal tilting toward a NNW-SSE direction.

TI  - Evaluating a new temperature-vegetation-shortwave infrared reflectance dryness index (TVSDI) in the continental United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate dryness monitoring is important for formulating reasonable response measures to reduce social and economic losses caused by drought. The land surface temperature (LST), shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance, and vegetation index (VI) are popular remote sensing (RS) indices that can be individually used to characterize surface dryness. Given the interactions of these factors, limitations are inevitably associated with using a single factor. Integrated dryness indices that combine LST or SWIR reflectance with the VI have thus been successively proposed and applied for dryness monitoring and soil moisture (SM) retrieval work. However, the advantages of these three indicators have not yet been combined to construct a more comprehensive dryness index. In this study, we integrated the LST, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and SWIR reflectance and developed an integrated satellite-based dryness index with simple calculations, called the temperature vegetation shortwave infrared reflectance dryness index (TVSDI). The proposed TVSDI was thoroughly assessed in the continental United States (CONUS) using the following data: the soil moisture active passive (SMAP) SM; six commonly used dryness indices (i.e., temperature vegetation soil moisture dryness index (TVMDI), temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), modified perpendicular dryness index (MPDI), perpendicular dryness index (PDI), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), and standardized precipitation index (SPI)); in situ SM data collected from 24 Cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP) sites covering different climates, soil types, and land cover types; and the United States Drought Monitor (USDM) maps. The results demonstrated that the TVSDI was significantly correlated with SMAP SM (R = -0.75, p < 0.01) and exhibited better performance than the use of LST, EVI, and SWIR reflectance individually. Moreover, the TVSDI and the other six commonly used dryness indices exhibited good spatiotemporal consistency, all with consistency areas > 60%. The evaluation based on in situ SM from 24 CRNP sites indicated that the TVSDI exhibited more stability and accuracy than other satellite-based agricultural dryness indices (TVMDI, MPDI, PDI, and TVDI). Moreover, the spatial patterns of TVSDI maps were not only well-matched with SMAP SM maps but also provided more detailed spatial information. TVSDI maps could capture more dryness and drought variations in natural ecosystems and areas with less intensive human activities than USDM maps. Furthermore, the application of the TVSDI for dryness monitoring in the CONUS revealed that the dryness distributions differed greatly across different geographic regions at monthly and annual scales. In conclusion, the TVSDI was found to be a reliable and accurate satellite-based dryness index.

TI  - Ecological Knowledge and Management of Fauna Among the <i>Mexicatl</i> of the Sierra Negra, Mexico: An Interpretive Approach
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Generally motivated by the relevance of animals in human subsistence, the management of fauna has taken different shapes throughout the world. This study aims to analyse a typology of management forms, exploring their relationship with the motivation to maintain coexistence and use of fauna and mitigate negative human-fauna interactions by the Mexicatl (Nahua) people in Central Mexico. We generally expected to find a broad spectrum of management types in a gradient of interactions intensity. This is because we hypothesised that the more meaningful these interactions due to the magnitude of benefit or damage, philias, or phobias among other positive or negative perceptions, and ecological aspects and management viability, the more actions and practices might be motivated to maintain or mitigate them. We conducted a qualitative research based on interpretivist approaches, mixing qualitative and quantitative analyses, to register the Mexicatl names of fauna present in the area and recognised by locals and to analyse the influence of local ecological knowledge (LEK) and natural history as perceived by people on the use, conflicts, and management practices regarding local fauna. In order to gather such information, in 2018 and 2019 we generated 356 free lists of fauna and 20 sessions of group interviews about the presence of animals in the area, the Mexicatl name, information on distribution, diet, use, management, and other facts. We used visual stimuli with children and young people from schools of basic and intermediate levels in five rural communities and the municipal head of Coyomeapan, Puebla. We also generated free lists and in-depth interviews with 18 persons older than 16 years. People recognised 114 animal items, the most salient being 11 domestic and 14 wild animals including deer, medium and small mammals, snakes, and birds. For both domestic and wild fauna, people reported 18 use categories and three types of damage (crop losses, predation of domestic animals, and damages to health). LEK interacted with traditional celebrations, religious beliefs, land tenure, and migration to define preferences and management types of fauna. Bushmeat demand, especially for Mazama temama and Cuniculus paca, was related to a perception of healthy nutrition properties. Management actions included husbandry of domestic animals, extraction of wild animals for supply, or to avoid damages, captivity, tolerance to damage, protection of seeds and domestic animals threatened by wild fauna, regulations for extraction of wild fauna, and agreements to prevent conflicts. Mixed quantitative and qualitative approaches allowed the interpretation of the human-fauna interactions related to subsistence, coexistence, and the high relevance of LEK, perceptions, religious beliefs, ecosystem, socio-demographic factors, and animal behaviour and habits, which are crucial factors that influence the shaping of management practices. Local management strategies of fauna were diverse and contribute to biocultural conservation and theoretical construction on domestication.

TI  - Analysis of spatial and temporal changes of vegetation cover and its driving forces in the Huainan mining area
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Huainan mining area is rich in coal resources and has sparse vegetation and many collapsed waterways. Large-scale and long-term underground coal mining has led to a fragile ecological environment in the mining area, and it is urgent to solve the contradiction between coal development and ecological environmental protection. The Huainan mining area was selected as the research object, and the vegetation cover was extracted using 10-phase Landsat multispectral remote sensing images from 1989 to 2021 to analyze its spatial and temporal changes and driving forces to provide a scientific basis for the guided restoration of the ecological environment in the region. Combined with the image dichotomous model, regression slope, correlation coefficient, and standard deviation of vegetation cover grid points in different time series, standard deviation ellipse, and center of gravity migration, we analyzed the spatial and temporal variation pattern of vegetation cover for 33 years and revealed the responses of temperature, precipitation, population density, GDP, and afforestation area to vegetation cover. Results show the following: (1) from 1989 to 2021, the overall vegetation cover in the study area tended to decrease with 36.48% of the areas increasing and 63.52% of the areas decreasing, primarily in the very low and medium range; (2) the center of gravity of different types of vegetation cover generally shifted from north to south during 33 years; (3) climate and social activities had a substantial effect on the spatial heterogeneity of the vegetation cover in the study area. There is significant spatial heterogeneity in the effects of climate and social activities on the vegetation in the study area with human activities negatively correlating with vegetation cover. Mining activities are the primary driver of the evolution of regional vegetation cover, with climate change serving as a secondary driver.

TI  - Investigation of June 2020 giant Saharan dust storm using remote sensing observations and model reanalysis
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the characteristics and impact of a major Saharan dust storm during June 14th-19th 2020 on atmospheric radiative and thermodynamics properties over the Atlantic Ocean. The event witnessed the highest ever aerosol optical depth for June since 2002. The satellites and high-resolution model reanalysis products well captured the origin and spread of the dust storm. The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) measured total attenuated backscatter and aerosol subtype profiles, lower angstrom exponent values (similar to 0.12) from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application-version 2 (MERRA-2) and higher aerosol index value from Ozone monitoring instrument (> 4) tracked the presence of elevated dust. It was found that the dust AOD was as much as 250-300% higher than their climatology resulting in an atmospheric radiative forcing similar to 200% larger. As a result, elevated warming (8-16%) was observed, followed by a drop in relative humidity (2-4%) in the atmospheric column, as evidenced by both in-situ and satellite measurements. Quantifications such as these for extreme dust events provide significant insights that may help in understanding their climate effects, including improvements to dust simulations using chemistry-climate models.

TI  - Study on the solar albedo characteristics of pavement and embankment slope surfaces in permafrost regions
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Roadways built in permafrost regions are more sensitive to the thermal disturbance caused by the natural environment and engineering construction activities. The construction of the embankment changes the albedo characteristics of the natural ground surfaces. Dark asphalt pavement absorbs a huge amount of solar radiation into the permafrost embankment, which leads to the thawing of frozen soil and freezing-thawing diseases of the embankment. Besides, the south-facing slope of the high-fill embankment is exposed to longer and stronger insolation than the north-facing slope annually. It gives rise to the thermal asymmetrical problem and differential settlement across the embankment. To solve above problems and further improve the thermal stability of permafrost embankment, we study the solar albedo characteristics of pavement and embankment slope surfaces in permafrost regions. In this study, an albedo measurement method is proposed for both pavement surface and slope surfaces. The method is validated by in-situ experiments and compared with traditional albedo measurement methods. Meanwhile, we measure the albedo values of the permafrost embankment surfaces along the G109 Highway in high latitude permafrost regions by using the proposed method. The results show that these embankment surfaces absorb a lot of solar radiation for a long time due to the low albedo. Comparing the measured results and remote sensing data, we carry out a comprehensive analysis of the albedo characteristics of permafrost embankment surfaces. Based on these findings, a preliminary solution is put forward to improve the thermal stability of permafrost embankment and decrease embankment diseases.

TI  - Unique Observational Constraints on the Seasonal and Longitudinal Variability of the Earth's Planetary Albedo and Cloud Distribution Inferred From EPIC Measurements
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thorough comparison to observations is key to developing a credible climate model forecasting capability. Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) measurements of Earth's reflected solar and emitted thermal radiation provide a unique observational perspective that permits a more reliable model/data comparison than is possible with the otherwise available satellite data. The uniqueness is in the DSCOVR satellite's viewing geometry, which enables continuous viewing of the Earth's sunlit hemisphere from its Lissajous orbit around the Lagrangian L1 point. The key instrument is the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC), which views the Earth's sunlit hemisphere with 1024-by-1024-pixel imagery in 10 narrow spectral bands from 317 to 780 nm, acquiring up to 22 high spatial resolution images per day. The additional feature is that the frequency of EPIC image acquisition is nearly identical to that of the climate GCM data generation scheme where climate data for the entire globe are 'instantaneously' calculated at 1-h radiation time-step intervals. Implementation of the SHS (Sunlit Hemisphere Sampling) EPIC-view geometry for the in-line GCM output data sampling establishes a precise self-consistency in the space-time data sampling between EPIC observational and GCM output data generation and sampling. The remaining problem is that the GCM generated data are radiative fluxes, while the EPIC measurements are backscatter-dependent radiances. Radiance to flux conversion is a complex problem with no simple way to convert GCM radiative fluxes into spectral radiances. The more expedient approach is to convert the EPIC spectral radiances into broadband radiances by MODIS/CERES-based regression relationships and then into solar radiative fluxes using the CERES angular distribution models. Averaging over the sunlit hemisphere suppresses the meteorological weather noise, but preserves the intra-seasonal larger scale variability. Longitudinal slicing by the Earth's rotation permits a self-consistent model/data comparison of the longitudinal model/data differences in the variability of the reflected solar radiation. Ancillary EPIC Composite data provide additional cloud property information for climate model diagnostics. Comparison of EPIC-derived seasonal and longitudinal variability of the Earth's planetary albedo with the GISS ModelE2 results shows systematic overestimate of cloud reflectivity over the Pacific Ocean with corresponding underestimates over continental land areas.

TI  - SINS/BDS tightly coupled integrated navigation algorithm for hypersonic vehicle
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A tightly coupled integrated navigation system (TCINS) for hypersonic vehicles is proposed when the satellite signals are disturbed. Firstly, the architecture of the integrated navigation system for the hypersonic vehicle is introduced. This system applies fiber SINS, BeiDou satellite receiver (BDS) and System On a Parogrammable Chip (SOPC) missile-born computer. Subsequently, the SINS mechanization for hypersonic vehicle is presented. The J2 model is employed for the normal gravity of the near space. An algorithm for updating the attitude, velocity and position is designed. State equations and measurement equations of SINS/BDS tightly coupled integrated navigation for hypersonic vehicle are given, and a scheme of validity for satellite data is designed. Finally, the SINS/BDS tightly coupled vehicle field tests and hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) simulation tests are carried out. The vehicle field test and HWIL simulation results show that the heading angle error of tightly coupled integrated navigation is within 0.2 degrees, the pitch and roll angle errors are within 0.05 degrees, the maximum velocity error is 0.3 m/s, and the maximum position error is 10 m.

TI  - Symposium Introduction: Critical Perspectives on Global Law and the Environment
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
M3  - Article
AB  - Global law and the environment is an increasingly prominent and rapidly evolving area of scholarship. In confronting global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss, freshwater scarcity, and other symptoms of planetary breakdown, critical scholars from different intellectual traditions are questioning the traditional approach taken within environmental law which has, so far, only managed to save "some trees" but failed to keep "the forest". These dominant legal interactions often use the law to address "problems" after they arrive. However, the law plays a key role also in constituting these "problems" by incentivizing certain harmful activities, upholding socio-political-economic structures, and through the limited framing of the issues it claims to solve. It is becoming increasingly clear that we live in a "legally constituted world". Against this background, there is a need for further critical reflection on the role of the law in preventing, addressing, and even driving the entangled socio-ecological-economic crises of modernity. Through interrogating the assumptions that underlie environmental law, critical scholars have exposed, challenged, and put forward alternative visions to its neo-colonial and gendered biases; its exclusion of indigenous perspectives and voices; its construction upon problematic representations of "the environment" that centres an anthropocentric worldview; and a neoliberal economic order that fosters vast environmental damage.

TI  - Lymphovascular and perineural invasion are risk factors for inguinal lymph node metastases in men with T1G2 penile cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To analyse the risk of inguinal lymph node (ILN) metastases in T1G2 penile cancer stratified by lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI) and tumour size. Methods Retrospective study of men with localised T1G2 penile cancer with non-palpable lymph nodes and no local recurrence during follow-up at six European institutional high-volume centres was performed. ILN involvement was defined as cancer detected during ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology, core needle biopsy, dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy, ILN dissection or inguinal recurrence during follow-up. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. Results In the cohort of 554 men with T1G2 penile cancer, from 6 European institutions, ILN metastases were observed in 46/554 men (8%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 6-11%). Men with both, LVI- and PNI- primary cancers had the lowest risk of ILN involvement (6%) whereas men with LVI + or PNI + showed ILN metastases in 22% and 30%. In multivariable regression, men with LVI + or PNI + had higher odds for ILN metastases compared to men with LVI- and PNI- (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.6-9.0, p value < 0.01) Tumour size was not associated with ILN risk (OR 1.01 95% CI 0.99-1.04, p = 0.17). Conclusion Approximately, one out of ten men with T1G2 overall and one out of four men with either LVI + or PNI + still have ILN metastases despite being clinically node negative. Therefore, invasive ILN staging should strongly be recommended in T1G2 with LVI + or PNI + but importantly, must be discussed in patients with T1G2 with LVI- or PNI-.

TI  - The NASA EPIC/DSCOVR Ocean PAR Product
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The EPIC/DSCOVR observations of the Earth's surface lit by the Sun made from the first Lagrange point several times during the day in spectral bands centered on 443, 551, and 680 nm are used to estimate daily mean photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) at the ice-free ocean surface. The PAR algorithm uses a budget approach, in which the solar irradiance reaching the surface is obtained by subtracting from the irradiance arriving at the top of the atmosphere (known), the irradiance reflected to space (estimated from the EPIC Level 1b radiance data), taking account of atmospheric transmission and surface albedo (modeled). Clear and cloudy regions within a pixel do not need to be distinguished, which dismisses the need for often-arbitrary assumptions about cloudiness distribution within a pixel and is therefore adapted to the relatively large EPIC pixels. A daily mean PAR is estimated on the source grid for each EPIC instantaneous daytime observation, assuming no cloudiness changes during the day, and the individual estimates are remapped and weight-averaged using the cosine of the Sun zenith angle. In the computations, wind speed, surface pressure, and water vapor amount are extracted from NCEP Reanalysis 2 data, aerosol optical thickness and Angstrom coefficient from MERRA-2 data, and ozone amount from EPIC Level 2 data. Areas contaminated by Sun glint are excluded using a threshold on Sun glint reflectance calculated using wind data. Ice masking is based on NSIDC near-real-time ice fraction data. The product is evaluated against in situ measurements at various locations and compared with estimates from sensors in polar and geostationary orbits (MODIS, AHI). Unlike with MODIS, the EPIC PAR product does not exhibit gaps at low and middle latitudes. Accuracy is satisfactory for long-term studies of aquatic photosynthesis, especially given the much larger uncertainties on the fraction of PAR absorbed by live algae and the quantum yield of carbon fixation. The EPIC daily mean PAR product is generated operationally on a Plate Carree (equal-angle) grid with 18.4 km resolution at the equator and on an 18.4 km equal-area grid, i.e., it is fully compatible with the NASA Greenbelt OBPG ocean-color products. Data are available since the beginning of the DSCOVR mission (i.e., June 2015) from the NASA Langley ASDC website.

TI  - Study on Meteorological Disaster Monitoring of Field Fruit Industry by Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorological disasters have brought a great negative impact on people's lives. With the rapid development of modern science and technology, the detection technology of meteorological disasters has been continuously improved. At present, satellite remote sensing detection technology has made gratifying achievements, and it has a good application in meteorological disaster prediction. In this paper, the application of satellite remote sensing technology in the process of meteorological disaster monitoring is discussed in depth. In traditional work, the accuracy and timeliness of meteorological disaster monitoring is the key and difficult point of meteorological disaster prevention. Using satellite telemetry to monitor meteorological disasters can effectively improve the accuracy and timeliness of meteorological disaster monitoring, provide reasonable solutions and decision-making basis for meteorological disaster prevention, and achieve the purpose of disaster prevention and mitigation. This paper introduces the basic principle, technical system, and important role of satellite remote sensing technology, expounds on the application of satellite remote sensing technology in the monitoring of agricultural meteorological disasters such as water, drought, freezing, and hail, and provides a scientific reference for farmers, agricultural sustainability, and agricultural decision-making. The continuous development of our country's modern social economy has put forward higher requirements for agricultural production. Traditional monitoring technology can no longer meet the needs of agricultural meteorological disaster monitoring. The scientific application of remote sensing monitoring technology has important value, which can effectively improve the detection level and make it have higher accuracy and real-time performance, thereby promoting modern agricultural production in China. Based on the analysis of the application value of remote sensing monitoring technology, this paper comprehensively discusses the specific conditions of different disasters monitored by remote sensing monitoring technology in agricultural production.

TI  - Classification of hyperspectral images via improved cycle-MLP
T2  - IET COMPUTER VISION
M3  - Article
AB  - Pixel-wise classification of hyperspectral image (HSI) is a hot spot in the field of remote sensing. The classification of HSI requires the model to be more sensitive to dense features, which is quite different from the modelling requirements of traditional image classification tasks. Cycle-Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) has achieved satisfactory results in dense feature prediction tasks because it is an expert in extracting high-resolution features. In order to obtain a more stable receptive field and enhance the effect of feature extraction in multiple directions, we propose an MLP-like model called DriftNet for HSI classification inspired by Cycle-MLP and deformable convolution. Besides, the proposed DriftNet uses a unique ladder-like fully connected structure to achieve progressive activation of neurons and facilitates the fusion of spatial and spectral information, thereby obtaining more sensitive location information for better classification results. Experimental results on three public hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalisation of DriftNet.

TI  - Confucian Education: From Conformity to Cultivating Personal Distinction
T2  - DAO-A JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores contrasting interpretations of early Confucian philosophy as they apply to education, focusing primarily on the Analects of Confucius (Lunyu..), the Mencius (Mengzi..), and the Xunzi... I first describe a common interpretation of the Confucian worldview, according to which an already perfected way is thought to have been established. This view tends to encourage thinking of education as a process of conveying the True Way and ensuring conformity to the norms that constitute it. I then describe and defend a contrasting Confucian worldview, in which the learner's initiative, critical engagement, creativity, and personal qualities play a significant role. According to this interpretation, the way is, to some degree, indeterminate and evolving, and thus more open to participatory inquiry as well as influence. Illustrious virtue, which Confucian learning aims at developing, is likewise to some degree indeterminate and legitimately personalized. Although some degree of conformity to established norms is involved, especially in early stages, Confucian education culminates in the cultivation of personal distinction, developing one's own uniqueness.

TI  - Integrated emission inventory and modelling to assess the distribution of particulate matters from rice straw open burning in Hanoi, Vietnam
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice straw open burning (RSOB) is a major environmental issue in many Asian countries, including Vietnam, during every crop season. This study integrates activity data (post-harvest rice straw) from the SAR Sentinel-1A satellite with an empirical survey to estimate air pollutants (PM10 and PM2.5) emissions from RSOB in Hanoi for the year 2020. According to the findings, Hanoi city has 125.5 thousand ha of rice cultivation area in 2020, producing 725 thousand tons of rice and leaving behind approximately 556 thousand tons of rice straw and stubble on the field. Farmers burning the rice straw open-field is a long-standing practice that emits 517.8 tons of PM10 and 472.3 tons of PM2.5 each year. The results of the ADMS dispersion model show that the maximum hourly averaged concentrations of PM(10 )and PM2.5 appear at 8 p.m. at values of 90.5 mu g/m(3) and 82.6 mu g/m(3) for the winter-spring crop and 16.8 mu g/m(3) and 15.3 mu g/m(3) for the summer-autumn crop, respectively. The hotspot locates most clearly at the South-Eastern part of the city, corresponding to the region with the largest crop cultivating area. Emission from RSOB has contributed to the local air pollution of Hanoi and its surrounding areas, including non-cultivation and no burning areas.

TI  - Evaluation of remote sensing-based evapotranspiration products at low-latitude eddy covariance sites
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing-based evapotranspiration (ET) products have been evaluated primarily using data from northern middle latitudes; therefore, little is known about their performance at low latitudes. To address this bias, an evaluation dataset was compiled using eddy covariance data from 40 sites between latitudes 30 degrees S and 30 degrees N. The flux data were obtained from the emerging network in Mexico (MexFlux) and from openly available databases of FLUXNET, AsiaFlux, and OzFlux. This unique reference dataset was then used to evaluate remote sensing-based ET products in environments that have been underrepresented in earlier studies. The evaluated products were: MODIS ET (MOD16, both the discontinued collection 5 (C5) and the latest collection (C6)), Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) ET, and Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) ET. Products were compared with unadjusted fluxes (ETorig) and with fluxes corrected for the lack of energy balance closure (ETebc). Three common statistical metrics were used: coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and percent bias (PBIAS). The effect of a vegetation mismatch between pixel and site on product evaluation results was investigated by examining the relationship between the statistical metrics and productspecific vegetation match indexes. Evaluation results of this study and those published in the literature were used to examine the performance of the products across latitudes. Differences between the MOD16 collection 5 and 6 datasets were generally smaller than differences with the other products. Performance and ranking of the evaluated products depended on whether ETorig or ETebc was used. When using ETorig, GLEAM generally had the highest R2, smallest PBIAS, and best RMSE values across the studied land cover types and climate zones. Neither MOD16 nor ALEXI performed consistently better than the other. When using ETebc, none of the products stood out in terms of both low bias and strong correlations. The use of ETebc instead of ETorig affected the biases more than the correlations. The product evaluation results showed no significant relationship with the degree of match between the vegetation at the pixel and site scale. The latitudinal comparison showed tendencies of lower R2 (all products) but better PBIAS and normalized RMSE values (MOD16 and GLEAM) for forests at low latitudes than

TI  - Ice Dynamics and Morphological Changes During Proglacial Lake Development at Exploradores Glacier, Patagonia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Proglacial lakes are ubiquitous features formed during deglaciarization and are currently increasing in number in Patagonia and elsewhere. Proglacial lakes can affect glacier dynamics, catchment hydrology and have the potential to cause glacial lake outburst floods. Therefore, monitoring the onset and development of proglacial lake formation is relevant to understand glacial processes and anticipate glacier response to climate change. In this study, we integrate geomorphological and ice-dynamic information to assess proglacial lake development in Exploradores Glacier, Chilean Patagonia. We monitor recent spatial and temporal changes in the lower trunk of Exploradores Glacier (10 km(2)) to provide a 20-year observation record by combining eight uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV) surveys between 2019 and 2020, with high-medium resolution satellite imagery (Rapid Eye and Landsat) between 2000 and 2018. We use feature tracking techniques, digital surface elevation model analysis and field data to create a multi-temporal scale (inter-annual and seasonal) and a multi-spatial (cm to km) data set. Our analysis shows that surface velocity overall trend has not changed over the last 20 years and that surface velocity near the terminus is significant (>10 m a(-1)). Moreover, an exceptional advance over moraine deposits was detected. We also found low downwasting rates (<0.5 m a(-1)) close to the glacier terminus which are attributed to sufficient ice flux and the insulation effect of the debris-covered surface. However, hundreds of supraglacial ponds were observed and are currently coalescing and expanding by ice-cliff backwasting favoring glacier disintegration. Lastly, it was found that calving losses at the east marginal lake equaled ice-flux input into the lake for the UAV monitored period. This study contributes to a better understanding of glacial lake dynamics during proglacial lake development, and our results may help ice modelling efforts to predict glacier response to future climate scenarios.

TI  - Consequences of rare diagnoses for education and daily life: development of an observation instrument
T2  - ORPHANET JOURNAL OF RARE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background angstrom grenska, a Swedish national centre for rare diagnoses and health conditions, has arranged courses for families of children with rare diagnoses for over thirty years, and has experienced that the conditions often have complex and varying consequences in the children ' s everyday lives, not least in educational contexts. Knowledge of these consequences and of how to adapt the environment and educational methods is often lacking and the children ' s educational needs are not met. Many professionals also report a lack of sources of knowledge. Knowledge formation and dissemination about educational consequences of rare diagnoses are thus of utmost importance. For this purpose, a broad observation instrument was constructed in order to gather knowledge on a group level concerning how functional impairments affect school and everyday situations, how consequences vary within each diagnosis and if there are diagnosis-specific features that lead to specific every day and pedagogical consequences. Results The instrument consists of 119 quantitative and 65 qualitative items and covers ten domains: social and communicative ability, emotions and behaviours, communication and language, ability to manage his/her disability and everyday life, activities of daily life, gross and fine motor skills, perception and worldview, prerequisites for learning and basic school abilities. The instrument is intended for use by educational professionals with knowledge of typical development and was content validated against existing instruments. The items were considered relevant as they, with few exceptions, appear in well-known assessment tools. Interrater reliability was based on the observations of six children. Each child was observed by two educators. Interrater reliability was calculated for the quantitative items and items with fixed response options, including yes/no answers, a total of 100 items, which are usually observed during the course. Interrater reliability reached 91%. Factor analysis and Cronbach ' s alpha indicated good statistical properties and a multinomial regression gave reasonable results. Conclusions The instrument can be used to gather knowledge on a group level of educational and everyday consequences of rare diagnoses. This knowledge can be used to adapt methods and environment to meet the educational needs and create conditions for optimal learning and participation for children with rare health conditions.

TI  - A combined use of in situ and satellite-derived observations to characterize surface hydrology and its variability in the Congo River basin
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Congo River basin (CRB) is the second largest river system in the world, but its hydroclimatic characteristics remain relatively poorly known. Here, we jointly analyse a large record of in situ and satellite-derived observations, including a long-term time series of surface water height (SWH) from radar altimetry (a total of 2311 virtual stations) and surface water extent (SWE) from a multi-satellite technique, to characterize the CRB surface hydrology and its variability. First, we show that SWH from altimetry multi-missions agrees well with in situ water stage at various locations, with the root mean square deviation varying from 10 cm (with Sentinel-3A) to 75 cm (with European Remote Sensing satellite-2). SWE variability from multi-satellite observations also shows a plausible behaviour over a similar to 25-year period when evaluated against in situ observations from the subbasin to basin scale. Both datasets help to better characterize the large spatial and temporal variability in hydrological patterns across the basin, with SWH exhibiting an annual amplitude of more than 5 m in the northern subbasins, while the Congo River main stream and Cuvette Centrale tributaries vary in smaller proportions (1.5 to 4.5 m). Furthermore, SWH and SWE help illustrate the spatial distribution and different timings of the CRB annual flood dynamic and how each subbasin and tributary contribute to the hydrological regime at the outlet of the basin (the Brazzaville/Kinshasa station), including its peculiar bimodal pattern. Across the basin, we estimate the time lag and water travel time to reach the Brazzaville/Kinshasa station to range from 0-1 month in its vicinity in downstream parts of the basin and up to 3 months in remote areas and small tributaries. Northern subbasins and the central Congo region contribute highly to the large peak in December-January, while the southern part of the basin supplies water to both hydrological peaks, in particular to the moderate one in April-May. The results are supported using in situ observations at several locations in the basin. Our results contribute to a better characterization of the hydrological variability in the CRB and represent an unprecedented source of information for hydrological modelling and to study hydrological processes over the region.

TI  - Effective multi-satellite precipitation fusion procedure conditioned by gauge background fields over the Chinese mainland
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of precipitation has a basis for atmospheric and hydrological applications. However, large uncertainties exist in the estimation of regional precipitation derived solely from remote sensing data. Herein, we develop an effective method to fuse multiple satellite-based precipitation products to capitalize on their strengths and maximize their applicability at the 0.25 degrees resolution scale. Specifically, we describe an approach based on bias correction in individual satellite-based products and their merging with up-scaled (1.0 degrees) gauge-based interpolated data to produce finer-resolution (0.25 degrees) data outputs. By focusing on seven regions to generate the estimates of merged precipitation across the Chinese mainland (MPCM), we performed a full evaluation based on a range of error metrics. The results showed that the bias correction procedure can reduce the discrepancies in the individual satellite-based precipitation products. In addition, the mean absolute error values are also considerably reduced (20%-45%) with respect to the original data over the Chinese mainland. Error statistical metrics demonstrated that the MPCM generated considerably better estimates on a daily scale, and performed better than the satellite-based precipitation products across different precipitation thresholds. The intercomparison results clearly states the superiority of the MPCM against Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation version 2 global product. Nonetheless, we also suggest that the large uncertainties in satellite-based products should be paid more attention over mountainous areas where rain gauge data are insufficient.

TI  - NDBSI: A normalized difference bare soil index for remote sensing to improve bare soil mapping accuracy in urban and rural areas
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - As a component of the Earth's land surface, bare soil is an important indicator of urbanization and therefore plays an irreplaceable role in regional ecosystems. Given that the spectral signatures of bare soil are complicated and easily confused with impervious surfaces, few soil spectral indices have been purposed and widely used. In this study, we developed a soil index, the normalized difference bare soil index (NDBSI), by analyzing the spectral characteristics of multiple soil types. Using Landsat 8 OLI images from six urban and rural areas in China, we found that NDBSI was more effective in mapping bare soil than currently used indices (i.e. bare soil index (BI), product index for dark soil (PIDS), and biophysical composition index (BCI)), especially in distinguishing between bare soil and impervious surface. Moreover, NDBSI showed good performance in identifying bare soil from red brick, which is helpful for soil mapping in industrial urban areas, where red brick is widely used as roofing materials. Our study may be the first attempt to develop a soil index considering the spectral characteristics of various soil types and verify its effectiveness in multiple regions. More validation of NDBSI with remote sensing images with different spatial resolution will facilitate its applications, and ultimately promote more accurate soil mapping in the future.

TI  - How do disparate urbanization and climate change imprint on urban thermal variations? A comparison between two dynamic cities in Southeast Asia
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the combined influences of climate change and urbanization on land surface temperature (LST) and surface urban heat island (SUHI) in the Bangkok metropolitan region (BKK) and Ho Chi Minh City metropolitan area (HCM) during 1990-2020. We found climate change evidence from trends and variations of temperature extremes in both cities throughout the past three decades, especially for the significant upward trends of nighttime temperature in HCM (0.23 - 0.3 degrees C/decade). These cities have been undergoing rapid urbanization, in which HCM has a higher urbanization rate with an annual growth rate of 8.03%/year against BKK (4.26%/year). Landscape metrics have rapidly shifted towards urban aggregation and green space fragmentation along with urbanization. A peer comparison shows that BKK holds a greater urban size and LST intensity, while HCM leads in urban growth and SUHI magnitude. These changes jointly contribute to climbing SUHI intensity, especially the dramatic influence of surface changes. Yet, temperature extremes also play an indispensable role in regulating SUHI magnitude, in which the impact in HCM is considerable compared to the effect in BKK. The research findings provide crucial information for both cities - where incorporation of climate change resilience strategies and SUHI mitigation into the master plans for livable cities are recommended.

TI  - Associations Between Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Variants and Risk of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Hospitalization Among Confirmed Cases in Washington State: A Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is dominated by variant viruses; the resulting impact on disease severity remains unclear. Using a retrospective cohort study, we assessed the hospitalization risk following infection with 7 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants. Methods Our study includes individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the Washington Disease Reporting System with available viral genome data, from 1 December 2020 to 14 January 2022. The analysis was restricted to cases with specimens collected through sentinel surveillance. Using a Cox proportional hazards model with mixed effects, we estimated hazard ratios (HR) for hospitalization risk following infection with a variant, adjusting for age, sex, calendar week, and vaccination. Results In total, 58 848 cases were sequenced through sentinel surveillance, of which 1705 (2.9%) were hospitalized due to COVID-19. Higher hospitalization risk was found for infections with Gamma (HR 3.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.40-4.26), Beta (HR 2.85, 95% CI 1.56-5.23), Delta (HR 2.28 95% CI 1.56-3.34), or Alpha (HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.29-2.07) compared to infections with ancestral lineages; Omicron (HR 0.92, 95% CI .56-1.52) showed no significant difference in risk. Following Alpha, Gamma, or Delta infection, unvaccinated patients show higher hospitalization risk, while vaccinated patients show no significant difference in risk, both compared to unvaccinated, ancestral lineage cases. Hospitalization risk following Omicron infection is lower with vaccination. Conclusions Infection with Alpha, Gamma, or Delta results in a higher hospitalization risk, with vaccination attenuating that risk. Our findings support hospital preparedness, vaccination, and genomic surveillance.Hospitalization risk following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant remains unclear. We find a higher hospitalization risk in cases infected with Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, but not Omicron, with vaccination lowering risk. Our findings support hospital preparedness, vaccination, and genomic surveillance.

TI  - Rediscovered Mesolithic Rock Art Collection from Kamyana Mohyla Complex in Eastern Ukraine
T2  - OPEN ARCHAEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The unique rock art complex of Kamyana Mohyla in South-Eastern Ukraine is known due to its numerous cave art engraved elements and settlements, which show how important is this site in the general picture of European prehistory as regards the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age periods of the region. However, the assemblages from this site include also a collection of portable rock art artifacts called "churingas." Important elements of this assemblage are thought to belong to the Mesolithic. These specimens illustrate different aspects of the artist's worldview and are capable of revealing a lot of additional data on the technological and cultural aspects of their creation. However, their study is complicate because of a very abstract imaging, lack of systematic approach to the artifact classification and absence of a well-defined stratigraphic context from which they have been recovered. Likely, current state of archaeological record and modern technologies introduces the new opportunity to rediscover, reconsider and reshape this collection.

TI  - The value of sentinel lymph-node biopsy after neoadjuvant therapy: an overview
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose We conducted a systematic review to analyse the performance of the sentinel lymph-node biopsy (SLNB) after the neoadjuvant chemotherapy, compared to axillary lymph-node dissection, in terms of false-negative rate (FNR) and sentinel lymph-node identification rate (SLNIR), sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), need for axillary lymph-node dissection (ALND), morbidity, preferences, and costs.Methods MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and The Cochrane Library were searched. We assessed the quality of the included systematic reviews using AMSTAR2 tool, and estimated the degree of overlapping of the individual studies on the included reviews.Results Six systematic reviews with variable quality were selected. We observed a very high overlapping degree across the included reviews. The FNR and the SLNIR were quite consistent (FNR 13-14%; SLNIR- 90% or higher). In women with initially clinically node-negative breast cancer, the FNR was better (6%), with similar SLNIR (96%). The included reviews did not consider the other prespecified outcomes.Conclusions It would be reasonable to suggest performing an SLNB in patients treated with NACT, adjusting the procedure to the previous marking of the affected lymph node, using double tracer, and biopsy of at least three sentinel lymph nodes. More well-designed research is needed.

TI  - A Novel Approach for Monitoring the Ecoenvironment of Alpine Wetlands using Big Geospatial Data and Cloud Computing
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Alpine wetlands in western Sichuan plateau (WSCP) are located on the eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), where the ecological environment is very sensitive to global climate change. Being naturally driven coupled with unreasonable human development activities, alpine wetlands have experienced serious ecological and environmental issues such as drought, inversion, and desertification. However, due to the limitations of data sources and calculation models, it is impossible for us to deeply understand the change mechanism and spatial difference of the ecological environment of the alpine wetland (EEAW) in previous studies. In view of this, an innovative approach for monitoring the EEAW change has been proposed in this paper. We employ the approach to perform the EEAW change trend analysis, and some meaningful characteristics were founded. Specifically, it includes the fol1owing aspects. The air temperature increase is relatively significant, while the precipitation change has obvious spatial differentiation, and even some region's precipitation experienced a decrease especially in plot1. In Haizishan, Lugu Lake, and Bari Lake, we explored an interesting phenomenon that the precipitation increases first and then decrease, and the turning point occurred around 1999. Increases in air temperature and evaporation have aggravated the drought in high-latitude areas. The drought situation has been alleviated in high-altitude areas due to the acceleration of snow melt water. Wetland vegetation and biomass presented an overall increasing trend, but the degradation also occurs in some area, including Zoige and Lugu Lake area. The human activity disturbances of wetland degradation mainly include the settlements expansion, agricultural development, and the ecotourism prosperity. Among them, targeted poverty alleviation projects have accelerated the urbanization in WSCP, and the development of agriculture and tourism has increased the interference of wetlands. Additionally, we have used Landsat images and national wetland survey data (1999, 2013, and 2020 year) from the past two decades to verify the EEAW trend and confirm the reliability of the analysis results using this approach.

TI  - A novel index for robust and large-scale mapping of plastic greenhouse from Sentinel-2 images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As an efficient mode of modern agriculture, plastic greenhouse (PG) has significantly increased crop yields, but it is also criticized for changing the agriculture landscape and posing a threat to the environment. Accurate and timely information on PG distribution is essential for the strategic planning of modern agriculture as well as the projection of the environmental impacts. However, PG mapping over a large area has been a long-term challenge. Compared with classifier-based methods, index-based methods have the advantages of fast speed and convenience, which are very suitable for rapid large-scale mapping. The existing PG indices face the diversity of PG types and background environments, and the seasonal variation of PG spectra. To solve these problems, this study proposes a novel spectral index using Sentinel-2 images, namely the Advanced Plastic Greenhouse Index (APGI), to map PGs at a large scale. Four typical PG planting regions in the world, including Almeria (Spain), Anamur (Turkey), Weifang (China), and Nantong (China), were selected as study areas. Based on the spectral analysis, some common spectral characteristics of PGs (i.e., high reflectance in NIR wavelengths and strong absorption in red and SWIR2 wavelengths) were observed and used in the APGI for highlighting PG areas. Besides, the coastal aerosol band and the red band were selected as optimal indicators to distinguish PG from other land covers which share similar spectral characteristics with PG. The experimental results indicate that the APGI has obvious advantages in enhancing PG information and suppressing non-PG backgrounds in various scenes compared with the existing indices. The APGI achieved the PG mapping accuracy with an OA of 90.63% 97.50% and an F1 score of 80.56% - 96.20% in all study cases. Furthermore, the APGI also showed its robustness in seasonal variations and different datasets.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Lake systems on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are important for the supply and storage of fresh water to billions of people. However, previous studies on the dynamics of these lakes focused on monitoring on multi-year scales and therefore lack sufficient temporal information. Here we present a new dataset comprising annual maps of big lakes (>10 km(2)) on the TP for 1991-2018, generated by utilizing all available Landsat images in conjunction with Google Earth Engine. The annual lake maps with high overall accuracy (similar to 96%) highlight distinctive lake distribution and lake changes: (1) about 70% number and area of lakes concentrated in the Inner basin; (2) generally increasing trends in both the area (by 33%) and number (by 30%) of lakes from 1991 to 2018; (3) the total area changes were dominated by larger lakes (>50 km(2)) while more fluctuations in the lake number changes were found in medium lakes (10-50 km(2)). Our dataset infills temporal gaps in long-term inter-annual variations of big lakes, contributing towards enhanced knowledge of TP lake systems.

TI  - Remotely sensed variables explain microhabitat selection and reveal buffering behaviours against warming in a climate-sensitive bird species
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-scale habitat selection modelling can allow a mechanistic understanding of habitat selection processes, enabling better assessments of the effects of climate and habitat changes on biodiversity. Remotely sensed data provide an ever-increasing amount of environmental and climatic variables at high spatiotemporal resolutions, and a unique opportunity to produce fine-scale habitat models particularly useful in challenging environments, such as high-elevation areas. Working at a 10-m spatial resolution, we assessed the value of remotely sensed data for investigating foraging habitat selection (in relation to topography, microclimate, land cover) in nestling-rearing white-winged snowfinch (Montifringilla nivalis), a high-elevation species highly sensitive to climate change. Adult snowfinches foraged at locations with intermediate vegetation cover and higher habitat heterogeneity, also avoiding extremely warm or extremely cold microclimates. Temperature interacted with other environmental drivers in defining habitat selection, highlighting trade-offs between habitat profitability and thermoregulation: snowfinches likely adopted mechanisms of behavioural buffering against physiologically stressful conditions by selecting for cooler, shaded and more snowy foraging grounds at higher temperatures. Our results matched those from previous studies based on accurate field measurements, confirming the species' reliance on climate-sensitive microhabitats (snow patches and low-sward grassland, in heterogeneous patches) and the usefulness of satellite-derived fine-scale modelling. Habitat suitability models built on remotely sensed predictors can provide a cost-effective method for periodic monitoring of species' habitats both at fine grain and over large extents. Fine-scale models also enhance our understanding of the actual drivers of (micro)habitat selection and of possible buffering behaviours against warming, allowing more accurate and robust distribution models, finer predictions of potential future changes and carefully targeted conservation strategies and habitat management.

TI  - Processing and classification of landsat and sentinel images for oil palm plantation detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing demand for remote sensing, along with the advancement of technology, has led to the development of robust, sensible, and user-friendly products that can utilise remotely captured images. Remote sensing in agriculture has gained a lot of interest recently, especially in plantation management. This technology is useful for controlling and monitoring various aspects of the plantations. One of the capabilities of remote sensing is the detection of oil palm plantations. Therefore, this paper attempts to determine the best methods for image classification, especially for land cover classification of oil palm plantations. It first focuses on the correction algorithm needed to estimate the true surface reflectance value of the satellite image data before the image is filtered to reduce any noise. The process includes the analysis of both supervised and unsu-pervised modules in terms of their contrast visual and reflectance spectral curve to find the best method of extracting the images' features. In distinguishing oil palm trees, optimisation of the pre-processing of the images enables the extraction of useful information based on its spectral signature, before they are utilised as an input for the soft computing method. The results show that Artificial Neural Network (ANN) performed the best image classification with the highest overall accuracy and kappa coefficient compared to other supervised classifications. The pa-rameters for ANN were later adjusted to identify the best ANN classification, resulting in an overall accuracy of 98.2857% and 0.9792 of kappa coefficient, and manages to effectively detect oil palm trees from the background.

TI  - Mapping nectar-rich pollinator floral resources using airborne multispectral imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wild pollinator numbers are known to be positively associated with amounts of flower-rich habitat at landscape level. Increasing floral resources can be particularly beneficial in relatively nectar-poor agricultural systems and having a baseline understanding of the temporal and spatial availability of resources can allow targeted habitat management. Very high-resolution remote sensing has potential to facilitate accurate mapping of fine-scale, within-habitat pollinator foraging resources, thereby allowing spatial and temporal gaps to be identified and addressed, improving predictions of pollinator numbers, and enabling remote monitoring of pollinator conser-vation measures.Concentrating on hedgerow and flower-rich field margins in a UK agricultural landscape, we showed that multispectral airborne imagery with 3 cm and 7 cm spatial resolutions can be used to classify five nectar-rich flowering plant species (Prunus spinosa, Crataegus monogyna, Rubus fruticosus, Silene dioica and Centaurea nigra) using a maximum likelihood classification algorithm. In 2019, we separately acquired 3 cm and 7 cm imagery for the months of March, May and July, respectively. Overall accuracies were above 90% for each month at both 3 cm and 7 cm resolutions (range 92.32%-98.72%), supporting previous research that suggests higher spatial resolutions do not necessarily lead to higher accuracies, as pixel variability is increased.Remaining challenges include determining which co-flowering species of similar colours in the visible range can be distinguished from one another within classifications and quantifying floral unit density from classifi-cations so that the nectar sugar supply can be calculated. Nonetheless, we provided a prototype approach for mapping pollinator foraging resources in an agricultural context, which can be extended to other nectar-rich species. The foundation is set for developing a remote sensing pipeline that can provide valuable data on the availability of nectar-rich flowering plant species at different time-points throughout the year.

TI  - Characteristics and productivity of the chiropractic workforce of the Veterans Health Administration
T2  - CHIROPRACTIC & MANUAL THERAPIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Increasingly, integrated healthcare systems such as the United States Veterans Health Administration (VHA) are employing chiropractors. However, little is known about chiropractor employee clinical productivity which may be important for resource planning and monitoring care delivery. With its history of delivering chiropractic care and its enterprise-level assessment metrics, the VHA is an ideal setting to study a chiropractic workforce. We aim to assess characteristics of chiropractors employed by the VHA and explore associations between these characteristics and clinical productivity. Methods This was a cross-sectional and serial analyses of VHA administrative data. Characteristics of the chiropractor workforce were evaluated from fiscal year (FY) 2016 to FY2019. Productivity was calculated using the VHA productivity measure, the quotient of an individual's total work relative value units (wRVUs) per FY divided by the direct clinical full-time equivalent (FTE) worked. A multivariable regression model was used to analyze the association between productivity and characteristics of the chiropractor and VHA facility. Results From FY2016 to FY2019, the number of chiropractor employees increased from 102 to 167. In FY2019, the typical chiropractor employee was male, white, and 45.9 years old with 5.2 years of VHA experience. In FY2019, the VHA chiropractor workforce was 25.1% female, 79% white, and 20.4% Veteran. The productivity measure of a chiropractor was 3040 in FY2019. A higher facility complexity measure, presence of 3 chiropractor employees at a facility, and older age of the providers were the only characteristics studied that had a significant impact on productivity after adjusting for other covariates. Conclusion Provider characteristics and productivity metrics of the VHA chiropractor employee workforce are presented. The productivity measure provides an initial benchmarking that may be relevant to future modeling of chiropractor personnel in VHA and other healthcare systems.

TI  - Sixty years of irrigated wheat yield increase in the Yaqui Valley of Mexico: Past drivers, prospects and sustainability
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Continued global wheat yield increase (about 1.3% p.a. for 2000-2019) remains an essential condition for greater world food security. Relevant to this challenge is the rise in average farm yield (FY) of irrigated spring wheat in the Yaqui Valley of northwest Mexico from 2 to 7 t/ha between 1960 and 2019. Since the early 1950s the region has been the prime target of wheat research by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT) and its predecessors, research still having significant impact on wheat in the developing world, a grouping that today delivers more than half the world's wheat. FY increase was investigated in detail by dividing the interval into three 20-year periods, correcting FY for the strong influence of inter-annual variation in January to March minimum temperature (Tmin J-M, warming lowering yield around 7%/?) and measuring the remaining linear increase in FY (Fischer et al., 2022). Total yield increase, corrected for Tmin J-M and CO2 rise, relative to average yield in each period, was 4.17%, 0.47%, and 1.59% p.a. for 1960-79, 1980-99, and 2000-19, respectively. The breeding component, estimated by the increase in the Varietal Yield Index in farmers' fields, rose at 0.97%, 0.49%, and 0.71% p.a., respectively. The remaining yield change (3.16, -0.02% and 0.87% p.a., respectively) comprised the net effect of improved crop management (agronomic progress) plus that of off-farm changes, together here called agronomy+ . Major changes in agronomy included: a large increase in fertiliser N use, benefitting early on from a large positive variety x N interaction; in the second period a switch to planting on raised beds and a decline in rotational diversity; and in the final period, consolidation of operational crop units and probably more skilful and timely management. Off-farm developments saw strong government financial support in the first period, but in the second period breakdown of the traditional small holder land system and withdrawal of government support. The last period saw better prices and improved access to technical advice. Breeding progress is expected to continue in the Yaqui Valley but at a slowly diminishing rate (currently 0.66% p.a.), while progress from new agronomy appears limited. Although FY gaps are small, some gap closing remains possible, and 1.2% p.a. FY progress is estimated for the next 20 years in the absence of new technologies. World wheat food security without area increase will increasingly depend on developing countries where yield gaps are generally wider and gap closing prospects better. Biophysical sustainability of the Yaqui Valley wheat system is moderately good but N management and diversity can be improved.

TI  - Cloud detection in satellite images with classical and deep neural network approach: A review
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - This article introduces a review on implementations of various methods to perform cloud detection and its related applications such as detection of cloud shadow, types of cloud and cloud removal from multi-spectral satellite images. The cloud detection concept started with the basic sensitive parameters of clouds. These parameters have been reported based on albedo, spectral and textural parameters in the decade of 1980. With this parameters, a new era of Neural Network (NN) approach has been stimulated from 1992 for cloud classification. A summary of their empirical results are provided for various published works based on NN approach from 1970 to 2020. Moreover, the present article embodies experimental analysis of cloud detection using NN based classifier on multi-spectral satellite images with distinguish mathematical model of learning rules and number of hidden layers. The analysis is verified on L8, AVHRR, NOAA and GOES satellite images. The result demonstrates improved performance of NN approach with two layer perceptron architecture with Levenberg-Marquardt learning rule for cloud detection in terms of ellapse time. However, potential of self-organizing feature map (SOFM), an unsupervised NN approach, is observed in terms of accuracy over supervised learning architecture. The cloud detection algorithm is further discussed with convolutional neural network (CNN) as a deep learning algorithm to extract the local and global features from limited number of spectral bands to raise the performance accuracy of the approach.

TI  - Indian Perspective On 17th St. Gallen: Customizing Local and Systemic Therapies for Indian Women with Breast Cancer
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - This article gives an overview of consensus statements reached for twelve difficult clinical scenarios discussed at Indian perspective of St. Gallen consensus for customizing local and systemic therapies for breast cancer patients. Pathological states in which breast cancer patients should/should not undergo chemotherapy were analysed. It was agreed upon that post-operative radiation is associated with decreased recurrence rates across all subgroups of DCIS and was found to have a survival benefit too. Surgeons recommended re-sentinel procedures instead of complete axillary dissection in women with ipsilateral breast recurrence and negative nodes on imaging after previous treatment with breast conserving surgery and sentinel node mapping. Radiation oncologists established that hypofractionation is a safe and effective radiation technique for breast cancer. Indian experts advised against the addition of carboplatin to standard "dose-dense AC and paclitaxel" or other cyclophosphamide-/anthracycline-/taxane-type regimen and recommended the usage of anthracyclines in a case of HER2-positive node-negative breast cancer receiving taxane-based chemotherapy and anti-HER2 antibodies. They supported adjuvant chemotherapy after neoadjuvant endocrine therapy if there was any evidence of any residual lymph nodal involvement or residual breast lump > 5 cm. Indian oncologists favoured that de novo oligometastatic disease with single bone-only metastases should be treated with curative intent. In patients with more sites of metastatic cancer, such as three or more bone lesions, experts were split between curative and palliative intents.

TI  - An Assessment of Glacier Inventories for the Third Pole Region
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A glacier inventory contains data that are important for understanding the hydrology, water resources, and impacts of climate change in glaciated regions. Ten glacier inventories have been created for the Third Pole Region (TPR) or high-mountain Asia, but they vary largely in spatial coverage area and data quality. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the data quality to help potential users choose the right glacier inventories for their research. Using the analytical hierarchy process, this study selects eight assessment factors and quantifies the quality of eight glacier inventories of the TPR. The eight glacier inventories that we assessed are the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI), the Glacier Area Mapping for Discharge in Asian Mountains (GGI18), the Second Chinese Glacier Inventory (CGI-2), the Glacier Inventory of the Hindu Kush-Himalayan Region (HKHGI), the Glacier Inventory for the Western Himalayas (WHGI), the Glacier Inventory for the Karakoram and Pamir Region (KPGI), the Second Glacier Inventory of Pakistan (PGI-2) and the Glacier Inventory for the Southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETPGI). The assessment results indicate that the overall quality of the small-scale glacier inventories of WHGI, KPGI, PGI-2, and SETPGI is higher than that of the large-scale inventories of RGI, GGI18, CGI-2, and HKHGI. For the large-scale inventories, the quality-ranking order from high to low is CGI-2, GGI18, RGI, and HKHGI. However, the comprehensive quality of CGI-2 and GGI18 is comparable over the area covered by CGI-2. The comprehensive quality of CGI-2, GGI18, and RGI exhibits clear spatial differences. Overall, the data quality is higher for the inner TPR than for the surrounding areas. By merging the products of the eight glacier inventories, a new glacier inventory product of the best comprehensive quality was derived for the entire TPR. This new product resembles the spatial distribution of the best-quality glacier inventories of the regions where the different products overlap. In terms of specific regions, the CGI-2 and GGI18 are the best products for most parts of the TPR in China, except for an area of southeastern Tibet where the highest-quality data are from the SETPGI. The other main distributions of the best products are the WHGI for the western Himalayas, the GGI18 and HKHGI for the Hindu Kush and the middle and eastern Himalayas, the PGI-2 for Pakistan, the KPGI for the Karakorum-Pamir area, and the GGI18 and CGI-2 for the Tianshan Mountains. The new data product greatly promotes the quality of a single glacier inventory for the entire TPR. This database will meet the needs of a variety of potential researchers, including those who prefer to get information for a particular parameter from a single glacier inventory (http://data.tpdc.ac.cn/en/data)..

TI  - Very high-resolution remote sensing-based mapping of urban residential districts to help combat COVID-19
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban residential districts (URDs) are a major element in the formation of cities that are essential for urban planning. Regarding the COVID-19 virus, which remains variable in aerosols for several hours, airborne transmission tends to occur in areas of poor ventilation and high occupant density. Thus, ventilation capacity is an important factor influencing airborne transmission in URDs, which should be evaluated as part of efforts to fight COVID-19 and guide healthy city planning and implementation. Here, we develop and test systematic methods to map URDs in a typical city in northern China and quantify their ventilation capacity using very high-resolution remote sensing images. Four fundamental spatial forms of URD are identified in the research area: the point group form, parallel form, enclosed form, and hybrid form. Our analyses indicate that the integrated ventilation capacities for well-designed URDs are nearly twice those of poorly designed URDs. Large variations in ventilation capacity are also observed within URDs, with up to 13.42 times difference between the buildings. Therefore, very high-resolution remote sensing data are fundamental for extracting building height and generating precise spatial forms, which can improve the micro-scale URD ventilation planning for the prevention of COVID-19.

TI  - Acral lentiginous melanoma histotype predicts outcome in clinical stage I-II melanoma patients: an International multicenter study
T2  - ESMO OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification, acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) histotype ALM is not included as an independent prognostic factor; in small series its negative prognostic impact on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) has been linked to the greater Breslow thickness (BT). Patients and methods: The study was carried out at four referral melanoma centers (three Italian and one Polish). Clinical consecutive patients with stage I-II melanoma, who were diagnosed, treated, and followed up between January 1998 and March 2018 in annotated specific databases were included. Results: Overall, 6734 were evaluable, 4349 with superficial spreading melanoma (SSM), 2132 with nodular melanoma (NM), and 253 with ALM. At univariable analysis, a statistically significant worse DFS [hazard ratio (HR) 2.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.24-3.30; P < 0.001] and OS (HR 2.67, 95% CI 2.15-3.32; P < 0.001) were found in patients with ALM compared with SSM. Similarly, the NM histotype was associated with a worse prognosis compared with the SSM histotype (DFS: HR 2.29, 95% CI 2.08-2.52; P < 0.001 and OS: HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.99-2.46; P < 0.001). At multivariable analysis, after adjusting for age, sex, BT, ulceration, and the sentinel lymph node status, a statistically significant worse DFS [adjusted HR (aHR; ALM versus SSM) 1.25, 95% CI 1.02-1.52; P 1/4 0.028] was confirmed for patients with ALM. For patients with NM, instead, no impact of histology was found in terms of DFS [aHR (NM versus SSM) 1.04, 95% CI 0.93-1.15; P 1/4 0.513] and OS [aHR (NM versus SSM) 0.96, 95% CI 0.86-1.08; P 1/4 0.548]. Conclusions: ALM is associated with a worse long-term DFS. Our results could have important clinical implications for patients' stratification in future clinical trials and the incorporation of ALM histotype in the new AJCC classification as an independent prognostic factor.

TI  - Neutrophils: Amoeboid Migration and Swarming Dynamics in Tissues
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Neutrophils are key cells of our innate immune response with essential roles for eliminating bacteria and fungi from tissues. They are also the prototype of an amoeboid migrating leukocyte. As one of the first blood-recruited immune cell types during inflammation and infection, these cells can invade almost any tissue compartment. Once in the tissue, neutrophils undergo rapid shape changes and migrate at speeds higher than most other immune cells. They move in a substrate-independent manner in interstitial spaces and do not follow predetermined tissue paths. Instead, neutrophil navigation is largely shaped by the chemokine and chemoattractant milieu around them. This highlights the decisive role of attractant-sensing G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and downstream molecular pathways for controlling amoeboid neutrophil movement in tissues. A diverse repertoire of cell-surface expressed GPCRs makes neutrophils the perfect sentinel cell type to sense and detect danger-associated signals released from wounds, inflamed interstitium, dying cells, complement factors or directly from tissue-invading microbes. Moreover, neutrophils release attractants themselves, which allows communication and coordination between individual cells of a neutrophil population. GPCR-mediated positive feedback mechanisms were shown to underlie neutrophil swarming, a population response that amplifies the recruitment of amoeboid migrating neutrophils to sites of tissue injury and infection. Here we discuss recent findings and current concepts that counteract excessive neutrophil accumulation and swarm formation. In particular, we will focus on negative feedback control mechanisms that terminate neutrophil swarming to maintain the delicate balance between tissue surveillance, host protection and tissue destruction.

TI  - Life cycle cost analysis of CO<sub>2</sub> compression processes coupled with a cryogenic distillation unit for purifying high-CO<sub>2</sub> natural gas
T2  - JOURNAL OF CO2 UTILIZATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Novel compression processes coupled with a cryogenic distillation unit are designed in this study to puri fy high-CO2 natural gas or biogas before injection into the reservoir. Four different designs are evaluated to achieve the required injection pressure and minimize both the capital and operation costs. Depending on the pressure-temperature pathway for the compression of the top and bottom products of the distillation unit, the energy and equipment costs are quantified using process simulation models and economic analysis tools, which are integrated with the flow simulation model to determine the required injection pressure. This holistic approach of integrating the compression process and injection pipeline is efficient for optimizing the process design and operation variables. The results suggest that liquefying the top product followed by mixing with the bottom product is the most cost-effective method, as it eliminates costly compressors and simplifies the process configuration. In addition to the li f e cycle cost analysis of the process, the sudden release of CO2 from the vessel is also studied experimentally. The results show that releasing gaseous CO(2)through the valve induces the formation of solid CO2 inside the vessel before complete removal of CO2 from the vessel, thus requiring a controlled release strategy to avoid solid CO2 formation inside the vessel and through the valve.

TI  - Mapping Cashew Orchards in Cantanhez National Park (Guinea-Bissau)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The forests and woodlands of Guinea-Bissau are a biodiversity hotspot under threat, which are progressively being replaced by cashew tree orchards. While the exports of cashew nuts significantly contribute to the gross domestic product and support local livelihoods, the country's natural capital is under significant pressure due to unsustainable land use. In this context, official entities strive to counter deforestation, but the problem persists, and there are currently no systematic or automated means for objectively monitoring and reporting the situation. Furthermore, previous remote sensing approaches failed to distinguish cashew orchards from forests and woodlands due to the significant spectral overlap between the land cover types and the highly intertwined structure of the cashew tree patches. This work contributes to overcoming such difficulty. It develops an affordable, reliable, and easy-to-use procedure based on machine learning models and Sentinel-2 images, automatically detecting cashew orchards with a dice coefficient of 82.54%. The results of this case study designed for the Cantanhez National Park are proof of concept and demonstrate the viability of mapping cashew orchards. Therefore, the work is a stepping stone towards wall-to-wall operational monitoring in the region.

TI  - A simplified method for water depth mapping over crops during flood based on Copernicus and DTM open data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - After an extreme rainy event agricultural fields can be submerged by water. Stagnant water can be generated by river' flooding or by soil saturation causing different damage level to crops. In this work, the flood event occurred on 3rd October 2020 in NW Italy along the Sesia river was assessed with special concern about damages affecting rice crop fields. A method was proposed aimed at detecting flooded areas and giving an estimate of water depth (WD) based on free available Copernicus data (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) and digital terrain model (DTM). In particular, Sentinel-1 pre-and post-event images were compared by differencing (delta VV). delta VV was processed at pixel level to detect submerged areas through the thresholding Otsu's method. A simplified morphological analysis was then performed by DTM tessellation to map WD. A further step aimed at classifying submerged areas was achieved based on DTM and a proximity analysis, making possible to separate areas where water was related to soil saturation from areas where water was coming from the river. Corine Land Cover 2018 level-3 and NDVI from a Sentinel-2 pre-event image were used to map crops that were still to be harvested at the time of flood. These were the ones that were considered while estimating the potential economic loss. A total of 255 ha of rice that still to be harvested were submerged but only 211 ha were affected by river overflow. Using local rice yield and price the resulting economic loss was about 2,200,000 (SIC).

TI  - Rectification and validation of a daily satellite-derived Antarctic sea ice velocity product
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctic sea ice kinematics plays a crucial role in shaping the Southern Ocean climate and ecosystems. Satellite passive-microwave-derived sea ice motion data have been used widely for studying sea ice motion and deformation, and they provide daily global coverage at a relatively low spatial resolution (in the order of 60 km x 60 km). In the Arctic, several validated datasets of satellite observations are available and used to study sea ice kinematics, but far fewer validation studies exist for the Antarctic. Here, we compare the widely used passive-microwave-derived Antarctic sea ice motion product by Kimura et al. (2013) with buoy-derived velocities and interpret the effects of satellite observational configuration on the representation of Antarctic sea ice kinematics. We identify two issues in the Kimura et al. (2013) product: (i) errors in two large triangular areas within the eastern Weddell Sea and western Amundsen Sea relating to an error in the input satellite data composite and (ii) a more subtle error relating to invalid assumptions for the average sensing time of each pixel. Upon rectification of these, performance of the daily composite sea ice motion product is found to be a function of latitude, relating to the number of satellite swaths incorporated (more swaths further south as tracks converge) and the heterogeneity of the underlying satellite signal (brightness temperature here). Daily sea ice motion vectors calculated using ascending- and descending-only satellite tracks (with a true similar to 24 h timescale) are compared with the widely used combined product (ascending and descending tracks combined together, with an inherent similar to 39 h timescale). This comparison reveals that kinematic parameters derived from the shorter-timescale velocity datasets are higher in magnitude than the combined dataset, indicating a high degree of sensitivity to observation timescale. We conclude that the new generation of "swath-to-swath" (S2S) sea ice velocity datasets, encompassing a range of observational timescales, is necessary to advance future research into sea ice kinematics.

TI  - Node-splitting optimized canonical correlation forest algorithm for sea fog detection using MODIS data
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a node splitting optimized canonical correlation forest algorithm for sea fog detection is proposed by using active and passive satellites. The traditional canonical correlation forest (CCF) algorithm insufficiently accounts for the spectral characteristics and the reliability of each classifier during integration. To deal with the problem, the information gain rate of node entropy is used as the splitting criterion, and the spectral characteristics of clouds and fogs are also combined into the model generation process. The proposed algorithm was verified using the meteorological station data and compared with five state-of-the-art algorithms, which demonstrated that the algorithm has the best performance in sea fog detection and can identify mist better.

TI  - Downscaling SMAP soil moisture using a wide & deep learning method over the Continental United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in drought monitoring, agricultural management, flood forecasting, and other practical applications. However, the relatively coarse spatial resolutions of SM products derived from passive microwave satellite retrievals (approximately 25-55 km) greatly hamper their local-scale applications. In this research, we proposed an SM downscaling framework based on the Wide & Deep Learning (WDL) method to improve the spatial resolution of the level-3 daily composite of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer SM product (L3_SM_P). In this method, horizontally and vertically polarized Brightness Temperature (TBh, and TBv, respectively), surface reflectance and Land Surface Temperature (LST), topographic attributes, soil properties, climate types, and landcover types collected in the Continental United States (CONUS) during the annual unfrozen season (April 1st to November 1st) from 2015 to 2017 were used as auxiliary datasets to downscale the spatial resolution of the SMAP SM (L3_SM_P) product from its original 36 km to 1 km. Precipitation and in-situ SM measurements obtained from 211 sites distributed across the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) over the CONUS were utilized to validate the downscaled SM. The results demonstrated that the correlation (R) between the downscaled and the in-situ SM ranged from 0.325 to 0.997; the average R value was 0.715. The unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE) values ranged from 0.010 to 0.141 m3/m3, with an average ubRMSE of 0.041 m3/m3, which meets the accuracy of SMAP SM requirement of ubRMSE approximately 0.04 m 3/m3. The downscaled SM also showed good temporal consistency with the in-situ SM and exhibited a high response to the precipitation data. The downscaled SM not only maintained high spatial consistency with the original SMAP SM but also provides more detailed spatial SM variations.

TI  - Automatic boat detection based on diffusion and radiation characterization of boat lights during night for VIIRS DNB imaging data
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) day/night band (DNB) data has been used to detect lit boats during night as it is very sensitive to low radiances. The existing methods for boat detection from VIIRS DNB data are mainly based on thresholds that are estimated by the statistical characteristics of pixels or artificial experience. This may generate detection errors and poor adaptability due to the lack of characterization of boat lights. In this paper, a two-step threshold detection algorithm based on the point spread and the radiative characteristics of nightlight point sources is proposed, so that the interference from adjacent pixels could be reduced as much as possible and a reasonable threshold could be determined. Meanwhile, this algorithm is applied to three study areas, namely the sea area around Tianjin Port in Bohai Sea, the sea area around Shanghai Port in East China Sea, and the sea area around Port Sulphur in Gulf of Mexico. It is demonstrated that the detection precision of the proposed algorithm reaches up to 900/c and the recall rate reaches up to 85% in three areas when validated by visual interpretation, and the precision is 85.71% when validated by automatic identification system (AIS) data in the study area of the sea area around Port Sulphur in Gulf of Mexico, which approximately increases by 5% compared with the previous algorithm.

TI  - Reasonable efforts to preserve families? An examination of service utilization and child removal
T2  - CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Recent federal policy has solidified the importance of preserving families, yet over 400,000 children enter foster care each year. Although a few studies have found that certain types of services, like intensive family preservation services, may reduce child removals, more research is needed.& nbsp;Objective: This study examined the relationship between family preservation, family support, and basic need service utilization and child removal among families with substantiated cases of maltreatment.& nbsp;Methods: We conducted a survival analysis using data from the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS). We took a cohort of families with an investigation and substantiation of maltreatment in FY 2018 and followed them through FY 2019 to identify any that experienced a child removal during the study period. This included a total of n = 558,915 children.& nbsp;Results: Approximately 15.33% of children experienced a removal during the study period. Case management was the most frequently reported service, followed by transportation services and family preservation services. In the multivariable analysis, family preservation services (HR = 0.95, p < .01), home-based services (HR = 0.98, p < .001), and housing services (HR = 0.87, p < .001) decreased the hazards of child removal. Family support services (HR = 1.36, p < .001), transportation services (HR = 2.30, p < .001), education (HR = 1.13, p < .01), case management (HR = 1.83, p < .001), or daycare (HR = 1.26, p < .001) increased the hazards of child removal.& nbsp;Discussion: Findings from this study suggest that utilization of various services is associated with future child removals. While preservation and home-based services decreased the likelihood of removal, several basic needs services increased the hazards of child removal. This may reflect too little too late with services that may be better applied as primary or secondary preventive efforts. Implications for policy and future rollout of the Families First Prevention Services Act are explored.

TI  - Built-up areas are expanding faster than population growth: regional patterns and trajectories in Europe
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Human settlements typically expand to accommodate additional housing demand from a growing population and their socio-economic activities. This implies consumption of land, a limited resource necessary for many other services. The efficiency of this exploitation in relation to demographic trends is key to preserve land and natural capital that could otherwise be degraded. Here, we assess patterns of population and built-up area growth over the period 2000-2015, using demographic statistics and remote-sensing data. We find that on average, in the EU27, built-up areas grew at a faster pace than population and that they expanded even in regions where population has declined. We quantify the impact of future population growth under different assumptions on future built-up efficiency. Keeping current built-up per capita fixed could preserve up to 9,000 km(2) of land until 2030, especially outside predominantly urban regions, where land use efficiency is generally low and has been declining.

TI  - Building roof extraction fro ASTIL echo images applying OSA-YOLOv5s
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a type of essential tool for urban planning and geoinformation extraction. Airborne streak tube imaging LiDAR (ASTIL) is a new system with great advantages in the rapid collection of remote sensing data. To the best of our knowledge, a new method to extract a building roof from the echo images of ASTIL is proposed. We improve YOLOv5s with a one-shot aggregation (OSA) module to improve efficiency. The experimental results show that the mean average precision of the OSA-YOLOv5s algorithm can reach 95.2%, and the frames per second can reach 11.74 using a CPU and 39.39 using a CPU. The method proposed can extract building objects efficiently from the echo images of ASTIL and acquire the building roof point cloud. (C) 2022 Optica Publishing Group

AB  - Objective: To understand the infection status of HIV and related factors in men who have sex with men (MSM) in Shanxi province in 2010, 2015 and 2020. Methods: According to the sentinel surveillance protocol, continuous cross-sectional survey were conducted to collect the information about basic characteristics, general demographic characteristics, AIDS knowledge awareness, high-risk sexual behavior, sexually transmitted diseases, intervention services and HIV infection rate of the MSM in Shanxi in 2010, 2015 and 2020. Results: In 2010, 2015 and 2020, a total of 2 708 MSM were included in this study. There were significant differences in HIV infection rate among three years (chi2=23.76, P<0.001) with an increasing trend with year (trend chi2 =17.34, P<0.001). The rates of anal sex, commercial sex and heterosexual behavior in the past 6 months were 77.62% (2 102/2 708), 5.91% (160/2 708) and 28.14% (762/2 708) respectively, and the rates of consistent use of condom were 52.52% (1 104/2 102), 63.13% (101/160) and 23.49%(179/762) respectively, and the rate of consistent condom use was low. Results from multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that different cities, having educational level of junior high school or below, being recruited through internet, voluntary counseling and testing, suffering from sexually transmitted diseases, occasional condom use in anal sex in the past 6 months were the correlative factors of HIV infection of MSM. Conclusions: The HIV infection rate of MSM in Shanxi increased year by year from 2010, 2015 to 2020. The HIV/AIDS-related risk behavior persisted, and the proportion of condomuse adherence was low, and the HIV detection rate was low in the MSM, so targeted and effective measures should be taken to promote the condom use adherence and regular HIV testing in MSM.
AB  - 目的： 了解2010、2015和2020年山西省男男性行为人群（MSM）的HIV的感染状况及其相关因素。 方法： 根据全国艾滋病哨点监测实施方案，在艾滋病哨点监测期通过横断面调查方法收集山西省2010、2015和2020年MSM哨点监测研究对象的基本特征、艾滋病知识知晓率、高危性行为、性传播疾病（STD）患病史、干预服务和HIV感染率等信息。 结果： 2010、2015和2020年山西省监测MSM共2 708例，各年HIV感染率的差异有统计学意义（chi2=23.76，P<0.001），呈逐年上升趋势（趋势chi2=17.34，P<0.001）；最近6个月发生同性性行为、商业性行为和异性性行为的比例分别为77.62%（2 102/2 708）、5.91%（160/2 708）和28.14%（762/2 708）；坚持使用安全套的比例分别为52.52%（1 104/2 102）、63.13%（101/160）和23.49%（179/762）；坚持使用安全套的比例均较低。多因素logistic回归分析结果显示，不同城市、初中及以下文化程度、网络招募和自愿咨询与检测点、患有STD、发生同性性行为未坚持使用安全套是MSM的HIV感染的相关因素。 结论： 2010、2015、2020年山西省MSM的HIV感染率呈上升趋势，艾滋病相关危险行为持续存在，且安全套坚持使用比例较低，MSM的HIV检测率较低。应采取针对性、有效性措施促进MSM危险行为时安全套的坚持使用及定期检测HIV。.

TI  - Endometrial cancer
T2  - LANCET
M3  - Review
AB  - Endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecological cancer in high income countries and its incidence is rising globally. Although an ageing population and fewer benign hysterectomies have contributed to this trend, the growing prevalence of obesity is the major underlying cause. Obesity poses challenges for diagnosis and treatment and more research is needed to offer primary prevention to high-risk women and to optimise endometrial cancer survivorship. Early presentation with postmenopausal bleeding ensures most endometrial cancers are cured by hysterectomy but those with advanced disease have a poor prognosis. Minimally invasive surgical staging and sentinel-lymph-node biopsy provides a low morbidity alternative to historical surgical management without compromising oncological outcomes. Adjuvant radiotherapy reduces loco-regional recurrence in intermediate-risk and high-risk cases. Advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of endometrial cancer have paved the way for targeted chemotherapeutic strategies, and clinical trials will establish their benefit in adjuvant, advanced, and recurrent disease settings in the coming years.

TI  - Epigenetic Signatures Predict Pathologic Nodal Stage in Breast Cancer Patients with Estrogen Receptor-Positive, Clinically Node-Positive Disease
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Breast cancer patients with clinically positive nodes who undergo upfront surgery are often recommended for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), yet more than half are found to have limited nodal disease (<= 3 positive nodes, pN1) at surgery. In this study, we examined the efficiency of molecular classifiers in stratifying patients with clinically positive nodes to pN1 versus > pN1 disease. Methods We evaluated the clinical and epigenetic data of patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative invasive ductal carcinoma who underwent ALND for node-positive disease. Patients were divided into control (pN1, <= 3 positive nodes) and case (> pN1, > 3 positive nodes) groups. Machine learning algorithms were trained on 50% of the cohort and validated on the remaining 50% to identify DNA methylation signatures that predict > pN1 disease. Clinical variables and epigenetic signatures were compared. Results Controls (n = 34) and case (n = 24) cohorts showed similar mean age (56.4 +/- 12.2 vs. 57.6 +/- 16.7 years; p = 0.77), number of nodes removed (16.1 +/- 7.3 vs. 17.5 +/- 6.2; p = 0.45), tumor grade (p = 0.76), presence of lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.18), extranodal extension (p = 0.17), tumor laterality (p = 0.89), and tumor location (p = 0.42). The mean number of positive nodes was significantly different (1.76 +/- 0.82, pN1; 8.83 +/- 5.36, > pN1; p < 0.001). Three epigenetic signatures (EpiSig14, EpiSig13, EpiSig10) based on DNA methylation patterns of the primary tumors demonstrated high accuracy in predicting > pN1 disease (area under the curve 0.98). Conclusions Epigenetic signatures have an excellent diagnostic accuracy for stratifying nodal disease in patients with clinically positive nodes. Validation of this tool is warranted and may provide an accurate and cost-effective method of identifying patients with predicted low nodal burden who could be spared the morbidity of ALND.

AB  - The study strictly inclined to the Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change mapping and assessing, surrounding and inside the abandoned natural river cutoffs and oxbow lakes of Bhagirathi-Hooghly river in the stretch between Katwa and Kalna, East India. Landsat satellite images of selected years (1990, 2000, 2013, and 2020) and supervised classification technique (Maximum Likelihood Classifier) were used for mapping and assessing LULC classification in four selected Areas of Interest, namely A, B, C, and D. Six LULC classes were adopted by deeply observing the selected areas: vegetation, waterbody, sandy land, bare and fallow land, agricultural land, and settlement and built up. LULC matrixes prepared for evaluating the land transformation in three decades (1990-2020). The study results witnessed a huge transformation of land by anthropogenic pressures and river channel migration. In every region, the waterbody area declines and transforms mostly to the fallow land and agricultural land. On the other side, settlement and built-up areas were increased by primarily occupying the agricultural land, bare and fallow land, and vegetation. In the last three decades, a massive expansion happened in agricultural land except region C, primarily for the conversion of bare and fallow land. Except for region B, the conversion of agricultural, bare and fallow, and settlement and built up land to vegetation has triggered the growth of vegetation area. Therefore, the transformation of land, primarily driven by anthropogenic activities, requires utmost concern. The study findings help in proper integrated LULC and resource management, planning, and sustainable development.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Swarm-Intelligence (SI), the collective behavior of decentralized and self-organized system, is used to efficiently carry out practical missions in various environments. To guarantee the performance of swarm, it is highly important that each object operates as an individual system while the devices are organized as simple as possible. This paper proposes an efficient, scalable, and practical swarming system using gas detection device. Each object of the proposed system has multiple sensors and detects gas in real time. To let the objects move toward gas rich spot, we propose two approaches for system design, vector-sum based, and Reinforcement Learning (RL) based. We firstly introduce our deterministic vector-sum-based approach and address the RL-based approach to extend the applicability and flexibility of the system. Through system performance evaluation, we validated that each object with a simple device configuration performs its mission perfectly in various environments.

TI  - Mapping the distribution and tree canopy cover of <i>Jacaranda mimosifolia</i> and <i>Platanus</i> x <i>acerifolia</i> in Johannesburg's urban forest
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the distribution and the tree canopy cover (TCC) of the two most prominent street trees (Jacaranda mimosifolia and Platanus x acerifolia) in Johannesburg, using the multispectral SPOT 6 satellite data and field survey GPS points. The importance of the spectral bands (Blue, Green, Red and NIR) and the NDVI index in discriminating between the tree species was quantified using five separability indices (Divergence, Bhattacharyya, Transformed Divergence, Jeffries-Matusita and M-statistic). The visual comparison of the Blue band and the NDVI histograms between the two species and other vegetation type showed the lowest feature overlap, suggesting the highest separability between paired classes. This was further supported by the highest Divergence value for the Blue band (3.68) and NDVI index (2.48) followed by the M-statistic (0.8 and 0.73, respectively) indicating good to moderate separability between the two species, respectively. The results were also consistent with the RF classification where the Blue band and NDVI index were the most important variables for the discrimination between the two species with an overall accuracy of 88% (kappa = 8). The TCC of J. mimosifolia and P. x acerifolia constituted 38% of the total vegetation cover in the city. These findings not only would help prioritize the increase of targeted vegetation cover in low cover areas, but will also provide a valuable information for assessment and protection of vulnerable species such as P. x acerifolia from the threat of the polyphagous shot hole borer, Euwallacea fornicatus in Johannesburg.

TI  - A novel analysis of critical water pollution in the transboundary Aras River using the Sentinel-2 satellite images and ANNs
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, remote sensing considered as important tool in studies of water quality issues. The Aras River flows across a transboundary basin in northern Iran. In this study, the aim is to model the water quality parameters (WQPs) using remote sensing and an artificial neural network (ANN), which is a new method proposed to find WQPs based on multivariate regression approaches. The relationship between WQPs and digital data from the Sentinel-2 satellite was determined to estimate and map the WQPs in this river. Using the field data and digital image data, the obtained results show that multivariate regression approaches and high-resolution remote sensing could monitor and predict the distribution of WQPs in this basin. There was a meaningful correlation between bands calculated from image data and the river's WQPs, including electrical conductivity (EC) (R-2 = 0.91), Na+ (R-2 = 0.81), Mg2+ (R-2 = 0.90), SO42- (R-2 = 0.89), Cl- (R-2 = 0.81), and Ca2+ concentrations (R-2 = 0.60). Likewise, the WQPs including EC, SO42-, Mg2+, and Cl- in the river are predicted using ANN. This powerful model is built for the rapid assessment and forecasting of experimentally mentioned WQPs at any location in the domain of interest. The results represent the good ability of ANN to simulate the mentioned WQPs. Simulation accuracy, measured by the determination coefficient (DC), varies between 0.982 and 0. 991 for training and overfitting EC test data. It is concluded that the management of transboundary rivers can be achieved by using remote sensing techniques and machine learning methods, which help the beneficiary countries in the sustainable operation.

TI  - PCA-based composite drought index for drought assessment in Marathwada region of Maharashtra state, India
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a composite approach for drought characterization and monitoring using in situ and remote sensing-based drought indicators. The study was carried out on one of the most drought-prone areas of India, i.e., the Marathwada region of Maharashtra. Meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural drought indices, namely standardized precipitation index (SPI), streamflow drought index (SDI), and vegetation condition index (VCI), respectively, were integrated to develop the composite drought index (CDI) using principal component analysis (PCA). SPI and SDI were computed using in situ precipitation and streamflow data, respectively, for 35 years (1980-2014), whereas VCI was computed using MODIS satellite data (500-m resolution) for 15 years (2000-2014) at 1-, 3-, and 5-month time scales. The time scales of drought indices were evaluated using historical drought years and foodgrain production of the region. The drought areas observed by SPI, SDI, and VCI at different time scales were correlated with foodgrain production during the kharif crop growing season for 15 years (2000-2014). The maximum correlation of foodgrain production was observed with 3-month SPI (r = - 0.72), 5-month SDI (r = - 0.40), and 5-month VCI (r = - 0.81) for meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural drought, respectively. Three-month SPI, 5-month SDI, and 5-month VCI were selected from each drought category to develop CDI. These drought indices were combined using weights derived through the PCA technique. The maximum weight was obtained for 3-month SPI (45.4%) followed by 5-month VCI (42.8%) and 5-month SDI (11.8%). The developed CDI products showed a strong relationship (r = - 0.85) with foodgrain production. The drought years observed by CDI were also closest to drought years declared by the State Government. The time series trend of the drought-affected area observed by CDI, 3-month SPI, and 5-month VCI resembled the drought patterns very closely, especially during the drought years. The spatio-temporal analysis of individual drought indices and CDI with foodgrain production deviation showed that CDI was better for capturing drought conditions than individual indicators. The study suggested that an individual or single indicator is not sufficient to capture the actual drought severity and its magnitudes; therefore, using a composite approach could be a good choice for effective drought assessment and monitoring in the region.

TI  - Digital technologies and ILK in the Arctic: In search of epistemological pluralism
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The digital revolution is profoundly challenging to Indigenous societies in their relationships with non-humans. To guide research that involves Indigenous communities and digital technology, we analysed the impacts of such technologies on Indigenous knowledge systems from the perspective of environmental ethics and anthropology. Using the example of S ' ami reindeer husbandry in Sweden, we found that digital technologies, rather than relying on sensitive ways of understanding and experiencing nature, potentially reinforce a Western worldview of reindeer husbandry, instead of valuing a S ' ami ontology. Therefore, they have the potential to compete with Indigenous ways of interacting with humans and non-humans. Our analysis also underlines that research with Indigenous people using digital technology in participatory research projects may contribute to this competition rather than empower the Indigenous knowledge system. Based on these findings, we distinguish two ethical directions - co-construction and strong epistemological pluralism - that can be followed to address concerns about the effects of the development of digital technologies on the diversity of knowledge systems in the Arctic, and elsewhere.

TI  - Spotted seals<i> (Phoca</i><i> largha)</i> harbor unique gut microbiota shaped by their host habitat
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the structure and composition of gut microbiota of sentinel species such as spotted seals (Phoca largha) is a potential tool for assessing the health of the marine mammals and their habitats. However, the link between the host microbiome and their habitat is poorly understood. In this study, microbial communities in the habitat (sea ice and water) and marine mammalian host (fecal matter from P. largha) were evaluated in samples obtained from the Liaodong Bay, China during population aggregation period. Results from high-throughput sequencing showed that the bacterial communities in P. largha fecal matter were less rich and diverse compared to those from the water and ice samples. Significant differences in the composition and function of bacterial communities were also found among the water, ice, and fecal samples, in which sample type and sampling site had the greatest impact on composition and function variations, respectively. Several potential pathogenic bacteria and bacteria with functions associated with human disease were significantly enhanced in the communities of P. largha feces compared to those of surrounding environments. The ratios of environmental microorganisms sourced from the P. largha fecal matter were estimated. The results showed that certain bacteria in P. largha-inhabited fecal matter were associated with sea ice and had specific antibiotic resistance and infectious capacity. These findings provide critical data for monitoring the health of marine mammals and their habitats, which is essential for predicting the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on marine ecosystems.

TI  - Click-on fluorescence detectors: using robotic surgical instruments to characterize molecular tissue aspects
T2  - JOURNAL OF ROBOTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluorescence imaging is increasingly being implemented in surgery. One of the drawbacks of its application is the need to switch back-and-forth between fluorescence- and white-light-imaging settings and not being able to dissect safely under fluorescence guidance. The aim of this study was to engineer 'click-on' fluorescence detectors that transform standard robotic instruments into molecular sensing devices that enable the surgeon to detect near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence in a white-light setting. This NIR-fluorescence detector setup was engineered to be press-fitted onto standard forceps instruments of the da Vinci robot. Following system characterization in a phantom setting (i.e., spectral properties, sensitivity and tissue signal attenuation), the performance with regard to different clinical indocyanine green (ICG) indications (e.g., angiography and lymphatic mapping) was determined via robotic surgery in pigs. To evaluate in-human applicability, the setup was also used for ICG-containing lymph node specimens from robotic prostate cancer surgery. The resulting Click-On device allowed for NIR ICG signal identification down to a concentration of 4.77 x 10(-6) mg/ml. The fully assembled system could be introduced through the trocar and grasping, and movement abilities of the instrument were preserved. During surgery, the system allowed for the identification of blood vessels and assessment of vascularization (i.e., bowel, bladder and kidney), as well as localization of pelvic lymph nodes. During human specimen evaluation, it was able to distinguish sentinel from non-sentinel lymph nodes. With this introduction of a NIR-fluorescence Click-On sensing detector, a next step is made towards using surgical instruments in the characterization of molecular tissue aspects.

TI  - Mapping α- and β-diversity of mangrove forests with multispectral and hyperspectral images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove deforestation has rapidly declined by an order of magnitude compared to that reported for the 20th century, but the remaining mangrove ecosystems are still undergoing biodiversity loss and degradation. Laborintensive ground surveys that are usually used for terrestrial plant biodiversity assessment are difficult to conduct in the mangrove forests. Assessing plant biodiversity from space does offer a novel perspective, but existing solutions are mainly focused on estimating alpha- or beta-diversities (i.e., diversity within communities or diversity among communities) alone. This paper applied a novel holistic biodiversity approach that could partition gamma-diversity into alpha- and beta-diversities for plant diversity mapping with operational satellites (WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, and Zhuhai-1) and field plots in the Qinglangang Provincial Nature Reserve, Hainan, China. We compared the resulting outputs of the alpha-diversity from the holistic method (SD alpha) to those by the coefficient of variation (CV) and the Rao's Q index, and the contributions of individual spectral features to alpha- and beta-diversity were also measured. Results indicated that alpha- and beta-diversities accounted for -30% and - 70% of the total diversity in the Reserve, respectively. alpha-diversity derived from the WorldView-2 images showed statistically higher correlations with the observed Shannon's index (R2: 0.20-0.42) compared to that from Sentinel-2 and Zhuhai-1 (R2: 0.03-0.15). beta-diversity derived from WorldView-2 images had the highest accuracy (90.00%), followed by that from Sentinel-2 and Zhuhai-1 (83.33% and 73.33%, respectively). Red-edge and near-infrared spectral features were the most informative features for diversity mapping while shortwave infrared (SWIR) features were also valuable for beta-diversity mapping. Concurrent mapping of alpha- and beta-diversities of mangrove forests represents the first step toward achieving rapid biodiversity monitoring schemes of mangrove forests over a national or global scale.

TI  - Remote Sensing Satellite Image-Based Monitoring of Agricultural Ecosystem
T2  - WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the agricultural ecosystem, it is necessary to grasp the differences of soil fertility and crop growth in time and space. With the rapid development of remote sensing and its popularization and application in social production practice, remote sensing has become a new way to obtain farmland information. At present, remote sensing means in the field of agroecosystem monitoring mainly include satellite remote sensing and unmanned aerial remote sensing. It can monitor and manage the agro-ecosystem environment in real time by acquiring remote sensing images. It can monitor the growth and identification of crops, pests, and diseases, and water supply, analysis timely, and effectivity for the spatial information provided by a feedback processing. But its performance needs to be improved. In this paper, the imaging methods and main features of remote sensing images are introduced in order to analyze the characteristics of agricultural ecosystem targets in remote sensing images. Then, based on object-oriented classification technology, a series of farmland images are preprocessed, segmented, and sparsely represented. Processing operations are used to study how to transform crop observation into crop and noncrop discrimination in remote sensing data. The research shows that the effective acquisition of crop image area and the remote sensing monitoring of crop farmland area can be achieved by processing the crop field map image obtained by remote sensing.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As the main form of the new urbanization strategy, urban agglomeration promotes inter-regional economic development, population flow, and industrial cooperation. It is not only an important platform for the country to participate in international competition, but also an important carrier to explore the multiple influencing factors of urbanization. Based on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, the temporal and spatial characteristics of its evolution from 1990 to 2020 are analyzed by using the models of urban evolution and industrial transfer. The results show that at the level of urban land use evolution intensity, Beijing > Tianjin > Hebei, and the evolution of urban land use showed an obvious pattern of concentration of resources in central cities (districts) and weak development in sub-central cities (counties). The overall level of urban sprawl showed a downward trend, and only 0.50% of districts and counties were in the stage of high sprawl. Before 2010, the urban sprawl of Beijing, Tangshan, and southern Hebei province remained at a high level, and after 2010, the urban sprawl of central Hebei province remained at a high level. In terms of comprehensive development, the index of cities decreased, including Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan, while the index of cities increased including Shijiazhuang, Handan, Xingtai, and Baoding. There is a trend of agglomeration and diffusion of regional industries in geographical space. Middle- and high-end manufacturing industry and service industry gather in the first city, and middle- and low-end processing industry, labor-intensive industry, and agriculture move to surrounding cities. The research results can provide policy suggestions for the coordinated development of regional integration in developing countries.

TI  - Rainfall-induced landslide susceptibility mapping using machine learning algorithms and comparison of their performance in Hilly area of Fujian Province, China
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rainfall can contribute significantly to landslide events, especially in hilly areas. The landslide susceptibility map (LSM) usually helps to mitigate disasters. However, how to accurately predict the susceptibility of landslides is still a difficult point in the field of disaster research. In this study, five advanced machine learning technologies (MLTs), including the Light Gradient Boosting Machine, extreme gradient boost, categorical boosting (CatBoost), support vector machine, and random forest, are utilized to landslide susceptibility modeling and their capabilities are compared through evaluation indicators. The northern part of Yanping, Fujian Province, China, is selected as the research object, because this area experienced mass landslide events due to extremely heavy rainfall in June 2010, resulting in many casualties and a large number of public facilities destroyed. The influencing factors for landslides, namely topographic, hydrological, geologic and human activities, are prepared from various data sources based on the availability. Through the analysis of the actual situation in the study area, 13 suitable landslide condition factors are considered and the availability of relevant factors is checked according to the multicollinearity test. The landslide inventory including 631 samples in this study area is obtained from historical information, satellite data in Google earth and performed field surveys. The landslide inventory is randomly divided into two datasets for model training and testing with a 7:3 ratio. The area under the curve of ROC, accuracy rate, Kappa index and F1 score are applied to compare the MLTs capabilities. In this paper, the results of factor importance analysis show that the first three important condition factors are the distance to faults, the distance to drainages and the slope. According to the LSMs, in the study area, the central and western regions are at high and very high landslide susceptibility levels, while almost all the eastern and northeastern regions are at medium and low landslide susceptibility levels. The CatBoost model is a very promising technology in landslide research according to the evaluation results, which means that for landslide susceptibility research, gradient boosting algorithms may get more accurate results and show better prospects in the future. Finally, the results of this paper will contribute to environmental protection to a certain extent.

TI  - Wealth and land use drive the distribution of urban green space in the tropical coastal city of Haikou, China
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green spaces (UGSs) provide a plethora of ecosystem services that benefit humans and wildlife within cities. UGS both promotes and is affected by overall urban ecological health, which can be measured by a wide range of indices. In this study, we investigated the distribution patterns and drivers of UGS within the tropical coastal city of Haikou, Hainan, China over the past decade using a combination of remote sensing data and field work. We interpreted Google earth images from 2010 and 2020 to determine the land cover of UGS within Urban Functional Units (UFUs). We collected socioeconomic variables to test if wealth, site age, and land use determine the proportion of UGS in the city. We found that the proportion of UGS in parks was the highest among all UFUs in 2010 and 2020. In general, UGS increased with maintenance frequency and housing price, which are proxies for the luxury effect. However, land use also played a role in UGS distribution across UFUs, especially in transportation areas, recreation and leisure districts, and residential districts. Haikou is similar to other cities in showing a positive luxury effect on the distribution of UGS. Our results highlight the key roles that parks, colleges and universities, and research institute areas have played in maintaining stable green space within Haikou over the past decade. We suggest that relatively recently implemented governmental programs to increase green space elsewhere in the city may not yet have achieved success within the time span that we analyzed.

TI  - Exploration of the strategies to enhance the regeneration of the optic nerve
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In adult mammals, only minimal regeneration of the optic nerve (ON) is possible. Both the low levels of intrinsic regeneration ability of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the inhibitory glial environment of ON contribute to it. To explore the influence of these two factors on the extent of axon regeneration, two ON injury models were established. A conventional optic nerve crush model (ONC) is considered a high-inhibitory environment. A longrange optic nerve injury model (LI) is considered a low-inhibitory environment. Zymosan (Zy) was used to regulate the intrinsic regeneration capability of RGCs: the injection of zymosan represented a high state; no injection represented a low state. In the low-inhibitory environment, zymosan (LI + Zy group) significantly increased both the number of regenerated axons and the number of surviving RGCs, however the Relative A/R (representing the proportion of regenerated RGCs) was similar to the LI group (no zymosan injection).Furthermore, in the highly-inhibitory environment, although zymosan (ONC + Zy group) significantly increased the number of regenerated axons and the number of surviving RGCs, the relative A/R was significantly lower than that in the low-inhibitory environment (LI or LI + Zy groups). The results suggest that the low inhibitory environment may be more important for optic nerve regeneration. Binary regression analysis also demonstrated the similar results. Also, there was a clear synergy between the two factors. These indicate that both low inhibitory environments and high regeneration capability can enhance the regeneration of ON. A low inhibitory environment is greater essential.

TI  - Geometric correction of satellite stereo images by DEM matching without ground control points and map projection step: tested on Cartosat-1 images
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground Control Points (GCPs) are needed in most geometric processing of satellite images. Generally used geometric model is based on the use of rational polynomials. The Coefficients of Rational Polynomials (RPCs) are provided by image vendors which are contaminated by some biases. In this paper, a no-GCP bias correction method for RPCs of satellite stereo images is introduced. The method uses global DEMs as ground control information: First, a point cloud is generated from stereo pair, then using the DEM matching strategy it is aligned to the global DEM for estimation of 3D rigid transformation parameters. This transformation is performed with our originally developed method which separates three planimetric parameters from three leveling parameters. They are then employed for bias correction in object space. For DEM matching and also for bias correction, we developed new formulae given directly in geodetic longitude and latitude format, instead of Cartesian map projection coordinates. Numerical results of this research are reported in two categories: with or without (1) GCPs and (2) map projection step. Experiments on two Cartosat-1 stereo pairs show in category (1), improvement in geopositioning accuracy from 399.2 m and 124.0 m to 7.6 m and 2.6 m, respectively. In category (2), we observed RMS improvement in both datasets and in all components up to 3.1 m in longitude, 6.8 m in latitude and 1.2 m in height.

TI  - Integrated model for land-use transformation analysis based on multi-layer perception neural network and agent-based model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The efficacy of land-use changes on aquatic ecosystems has been extensively studied in recent decades. Water resource management needs to understand the relationship between land-use change patterns and water quality, especially in urban areas. Hence, recognizing spatial-temporal changes in land use is required for sustainable development and proper water resource management. This research has developed an integrated model based on agent-based model (ABM) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network technique to predict the future land-use transformation tested on the North Ahvaz watershed, Iran. Random forest-supervised classification technique was applied to derive the land-use maps using Landsat 1989, 2004, and 2019 images in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The overall accuracy of classified land-use images was 0.82, 0.81, and 0.84, respectively, with the kappa coefficient of 0.74, 0.72, and 0.78. Land-use change analysis and generating transition potential maps were carried out in land change modeler (LCM) through MLP based on seven driving factors. Then, the land-use map for 2019 (for validation) and 2040 was simulated using the transition potential map and an agent-based approach. The ABM scenario was farmers' and urban landowners' decisions to convert undeveloped and unprotected lands to residential lands. The results showed that residential areas and pasture lands would grow by 67.96 km(2) and 64.63 km(2), and agricultural and barren lands would degrade about 84.19 km(2) and 47.98 km(2) during 2019-2040, respectively. Predicting land-use change through the integrated MLP-ABM model may be used to evaluate the effects of land-use change coming out of human decision-making.

TI  - Modified goldilocks nipple-sparing mastectomy with immediate prepectoral implant-based reconstruction: a case report
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Nearly 80% of women who undergo post-mastectomy reconstruction opt for implant-based reconstruction. Preservation of the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) in nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM) significantly improves patient satisfaction; however in women with macromastia or breast ptosis, NAC preservation carries an increased risk of nipple ischemia. Traditional options have included free nipple grafts or a staged reconstruction, however in patients with aggressive or multifocal breast cancer, this is not feasible due to the need for timely oncologic resection. The Goldilocks mastectomy, which utilizes redundant adipodermal tissue to recreate a breast mound, was originally designed for women with large or ptotic breasts who did not desire post-mastectomy reconstruction. However, this technique has been modified in several ways. In this case report, we present our approach to a patient with breast ptosis and multifocal breast cancer who desired NAC preservation, volume preservation and mastopexy using the modified Goldilocks technique with pre-pectoral implant-based reconstruction. Case Description: A 38-year-old woman, with a bra size of 36C, presented with grade II, multifocal, estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 positive right breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma. The patient's aesthetic goals included: preservation of the NACs, elevation of NAC position, reduction in areola diameter, and maintenance of breast volume using implant-based reconstruction. As a result of her multifocal breast cancer, she was not a candidate for staged mastopexy followed by mastectomy and reconstruction. Therefore, the patient underwent bilateral Goldilocks NSM, right sentinel lymph node biopsy, and immediate implant-based reconstruction using the modified Goldilocks technique with acellular dermal matrix (ADM). At 3-month follow-up, the patient was satisfied with the overall aesthetic outcome of her breasts. Conclusions: We present a patient with breast ptosis and multifocal breast cancer who desired NAC preservation and implant-based reconstruction, but was not a candidate for staged reoperation. This case report is the first to describe a modified Goldilocks NSM with pre-pectoral implant-based reconstruction.

TI  - How large-scale bark beetle infestations influence the protective effects of forest stands against avalanches: A case study in the Swiss Alps
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale bark beetle outbreaks in spruce dominated mountain forests have increased in recent decades, and this trend is expected to continue in the future. These outbreaks have immediate and major effects on forest structure and ecosystem services. However, it remains unclear how forests recover from bark beetle infestations over the long term, and how different recovery stages fulfil the capacity of forests to protect infrastructures and human lives from natural hazards.The aim of this study was to investigate how a bark beetle infestation (1992-1997) in a spruce dominated forest in the Swiss Alps changed the forest structure and its protective function against snow avalanches. In 2020, i.e. 27 years after the peak of the outbreak, we re-surveyed the composition and height of new trees, as well as the deadwood height and degree of decay in an area that had been surveyed 20 years earlier. With the help of remote sensing data and avalanche simulations, we assessed the protective effect against avalanches before the disturbances (in 1985) and in 1997, 2007, 2014 and 2019 for a frequent (30-year return period) and an extreme (300-year return period) avalanche scenario. Post-disturbance regeneration led to a young forest that was again dominated by spruce 27 years after the outbreak, with median tree heights of 3-4 m and a crown cover of 10-30%.Deadwood covered 20-25% of the forest floor and was mainly in decay stages two and three out of five. Snags had median heights of 1.4 m, leaning logs 0.5 m and lying logs 0.3 m. The protective effect of the forest was high before the bark beetle outbreak and decreased during the first years of infestation (until 1997), mainly in the case of extreme avalanche events. The protective capacity reached an overall minimum in 2007 as a result of many forest openings. It partially recovered by 2014 and further increased by 2019, thanks to forest regeneration. Simulation results and a lack of avalanche releases since the infestation indicate that the protective capacity of post-disturbance forest stands affected by bark beetle may often be underestimated.

TI  - Forest aboveground biomass in the southwestern United States from a MISR multi-angle index, 2000-2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-angle surface reflectance data from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) were used to map aboveground biomass density (AGB, Mg ha(-1)) in the forests of the southwestern United States inter-annually from 2000 to 2015. The approach uses a multi-angle index that has a loge relationship with AGB estimates in the National Biomass and Carbon Dataset 2000 (NBCD 2000). MISR Level 1B2 Terrain radiance data from May 15-June 15 of each year were converted to mapped surface bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) and leveraged to adjust the kernel weights of the RossThin-LiSparse-Reciprocal Bidi-rectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model. The kernel weights with the lowest model-fitting RMSE were selected as the least likely to be cloud-contaminated and were used to generate synthetic MISR datasets. An optimal index calculated using BRFs modeled in the solar principal plane was found with respect to NBCD 2000 estimates for 19 sites near Mt. Lindsey, Colorado. These relationships were found in areas with AGB ranging from 20 to 190 Mg ha(-1), with the model yielding R-2 = 0.91 (RMSE: 15.4 Mg ha(-1)). With spectral-nadir metrics, the R-2 values obtained were 0.07, 0.32, and 0.37 for NIR band BRFs, NDVI, and red band BRFs, respectively. For regional application, a simplified single coefficient model was fitted to the NBCD 2000 data, to account for variations in forest type, soils, and topography. The resulting AGB maps were consistent with esti-mates from up-scaled 2005 ICESat GLAS data and 2013 NASA Carbon Monitoring System airborne lidar-derived estimates for the Rim Fire area in California; and with the 2005 GLAS-based map across the southwestern United States. Trajectories were stable through time and losses from fire and beetle disturbance matched historical data in published sources. MISR estimates were found to reliably capture ABG compared to radar-and lidar-derived estimates across the southwestern United States (N = 11,019,944), with an RMSE of 37.0 Mg ha(-1) and R-2 = 0.9 vs GLAS estimates.

TI  - Validation of a rapid, saliva-based, and ultra-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 screening system for pandemic-scale infection surveillance
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Without any realistic prospect of comprehensive global vaccine coverage and lasting immunity, control of pandemics such as COVID-19 will require implementation of large-scale, rapid identification and isolation of infectious individuals to limit further transmission. Here, we describe an automated, high-throughput integrated screening platform, incorporating saliva-based loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technology, that is designed for population-scale sensitive detection of infectious carriers of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Central to this surveillance system is the "Sentinel" testing instrument, which is capable of reporting results within 25 min of saliva sample collection with a throughput of up to 3840 results per hour. It incorporates continuous flow loading of samples at random intervals to cost-effectively adjust for fluctuations in testing demand. Independent validation of our saliva-based RT-LAMP technology on an automated LAMP instrument coined the "Sentinel", found 98.7% sensitivity, 97.6% specificity, and 98% accuracy against a RT-PCR comparator assay, confirming its suitability for surveillance screening. This Sentinel surveillance system offers a feasible and scalable approach to complement vaccination, to curb the spread of COVID-19 variants, and control future pandemics to save lives.

TI  - Detecting Geothermal Resources in a Plateau Area: Constraints From Land Surface Temperature Characteristics Using Landsat 8 Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Geothermal energy is a kind of clean energy, which attracts more attention. The detection of geothermal resources is inseparable from regional geothermal prospects. Land surface temperature (LST) is an indispensable parameter for geothermal exploration, but the retrieval accuracy of LST for complex and remote areas is currently a major challenge. In this article, based on Landsat 8 remote sensing data, the characteristics of surface temperature retrieval methods are systematically reviewed, and the differences among these three algorithms are researched by using them to detect the surface temperature in the study area, which is Kangding County, Sichuan Province, China. Then the experimental results of the three algorithms are verified by using long-time (more than 1 year) measured data from the two monitoring sites, and the monitoring sites are situated in Zhonggu and Lao Yulin area of Kangding County. The results show that the radiative transfer equation (RTE) has the highest accuracy, and the mean error is 0.372 degrees C; mono-window algorithm (MW) has a mean error of -0.606 degrees C; and the split-window (SW) algorithm has the lowest accuracy, with a mean error of -2.07 degrees C. The experimental results were used to select an algorithm with relatively high accuracy and low sensitivity. At the same time, a time series was used to perform temperature retrieval for this study area from November 2016 to December 2017 to evaluate the applicability of the method. The result shows that the RTE has the highest accuracy in mid-winter and a relatively low accuracy in summer in Kangding County. The purpose of this article is to establish a suitable method for high-precision surface temperature retrieval in plateau areas and to provide technical support for exploring geothermal resources or evaluating geothermal potential in these areas.

TI  - Cross-view SLAM solver: Global pose estimation of monocular ground-level video frames for 3D reconstruction using a reference 3D model from satellite images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate pose estimation of monocular ground-level images with respect to a satellite/aerial photogrammetric dataset is an extremely challenging task. Existing solutions often perform an offline post-registration on 3D results from both sources, which however, suffers from non-rigid geometric distortions of the 3D monocular reconstruction and the lack of overlaps between the air to ground content. This paper provides an online solution that performs accurate pose estimation of the ground images with respect to a 3D model derived from satellite images, followed by a dense 3D reconstruction. Our solution takes advantage of the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) paradigm to dynamically incorporate reference observations from the satellite 3D model during the incremental pose estimation, called a cross-view SLAM solver, which leverages both ground-to satellite error and image-level reprojection errors at the frame level to yield image poses that are well registered to the satellite 3D model for facade point cloud reconstruction. This process also has the advantage of correcting non-rigid distortions and trajectory drifts that are often presented in monocular SLAM systems. In addition, our solution leverages both the geometric and semantic information from the satellite model and ground images to perform a per-frame correction for frame-level pose initialization, in which a novel scheme called pose buffer is introduced to initialize the pose of each keyframe through robust visual hull alignment of ground objects. The proposed approach has been experimented using four trajectories of monocular videos collections (around 7,000 frames per trajectory on average) and a 3D semantic model from multi-view satellite images to estimate the poses of the video frames and yield point clouds consistent with the satellite 3D models, evaluated by using LiDAR ground-truth. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our solution yields accurate, drift-free poses and point clouds consistent with the satellite data and visually much more pleasing 3D models with facade information. Compared to the LiDAR ground-truth, the derived 3D models with ground-level images have achieved a mean absolute error of 1.78 m (improved from 3.15 m achieved using SLAM without utilizing satellite 3D models) (A testing program will be made available through https://github. com/GDAOSU/Cross-View-SLAM).

TI  - How does precipitation data influence the land surface data assimilation for drought monitoring?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts are among the costliest natural hazards that occur annually worldwide. Their socioeconomic impacts are significant and widespread, affecting the sustainable development of human societies. This study investigates the influ-ence of different forcing precipitation data in driving Land Surface Models (LSMs) and characterizing drought conditions. Here, we utilize our recently developed LSM data assimilation system for probabilistically monitoring drought over the Contiguous United States (CONUS). The Noah-MP LSM model is forced with two widely used precipitation data including IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM) and NLDAS (North American Land Data Assimilation System). Soil moisture and evapotranspiration are known to have a strong relationship in the land atmospheric interaction processes. Unlike other studies that attempted the individual assimilation of these variables, here we propose a multivariate data assimilation framework. Therefore, in both modeling scenarios, the data assimilation approach is used to integrate remotely sensed MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) evapotranspiration and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) soil moisture observations into the Noah-MP LSM. The results of this study indicate that the source of precipitation data has a significant impact on the performance of LSM data assimilation system for drought monitoring. The findings revealed that NLDAS and IMERG precipitation can result in a significant difference in identifying drought severity depending on the region and time of the year. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that regardless of the precipitation forcing data product used in the land surface data assimilation system, our modeling framework can effectively detect the drought impacts on crop yield. Additionally, we calculated the drought probability based on the ensemble of soil moisture percentiles and found that there exist temporal and spatial discrepancies in drought probability maps generated from the NLDAS and IMERG precipitation forcings.

TI  - Changes in daily rainfall and temperature extremes of upper Awash Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has an impact on rainfall and temperature. In this study, changes in rainfall and temperature extremes in Upper Awash Basin (Ethiopia) from 1983 to 2016 were investigated using daily combination of observed and satellite data of ten meteorological stations. To determine the annual trends, two non-parametric methods, namely Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator were utilized. In this study, RClimDex1.1 was utilized to compute the selected temperature and rainfall extreme indices. The Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) technique was used for spatial interpolation. The findings indicate significant trends in both annual and Kiremt Uune - September) season rainfalls in two out of the ten stations, namely, Addis Alem and Koka Dam (p < 0.05). None of the ten stations exhibited significant trends for Belg (February-May) season. Overall, the mean rainfall trends of the basin indicate a considerable decline. However, from the spatial analysis, increasing rainfall and extreme events in the eastern portion of the basin were observed. Moreover, from average anomalies of the rainfall extreme indices of the entire basin showed a tendency of wetness. The maximum and the minimum temperatures displayed increasing trends in most of the weather stations (except in Addis Alem, and Kimoye for maximum temperature and Koka Dam, Hombole, Mojo, and Sendafa (AD) for minimum temperature). The temperature extreme indices showed increasing trends in TXx, TNx, TN90p, TX90p, SU25, and WSDI. The trend of the SU25 index indicated an increasing trend at 90% of the stations (p < 0.05). Overall, average anomalies of all temperature extreme indices of the entire basin (except TXn) revealed warming trends. The possible causes of these extreme events are the results of both local and global processes. Urban expansion and associated land use/cover changes could synergistically contribute to global warming. These findings are useful for the stakeholders in the region. (C) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Deriving moderate spatial resolution leaf area index estimates from coarser spatial resolution satellite products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf Area Index (LAI) is a key parameter used to characterize vegetation biophysical properties and plays an important regulatory role in terrestrial-atmospheric exchanges. Subsequently, LAI is often a critical data input to various evapotranspiration, hydrological and climatic models. While LAI data can generally be easily obtained, it is seldom available at spatio-temporal scales that can be used to guide and inform management decisions for localised applications. To this end, we propose a methodology to acquire moderate resolution LAI (LAIMR) estimates from freely available satellite-earth observation data sets and data processing platforms. Fifteen sites distributed within the KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga provinces of South Africa were selected as study areas. Coarse spatial resolution MODIS LAI and vegetation index (VI) products were acquired for each of these sites to establish the LAI-VI relationship which was then used to develop machine learning-based models (MLBMs) to estimate LAIMR using VIs derived from Landsat or Sentinel-2 data. During the validation and testing phases of the study, LAI estimates were compared against the corresponding MODIS LAI product values. The results of these investigations demonstrated that MLBMs performed satisfactorily across the majority of the study sites, producing correlation coefficients ranging from 0.62 to 0.97 and 0.29-0.84 for the validation and testing phases, respectively. The poorer performance of the MLBMs when using VIs derived from Landsat or Sentinel-2 data can be largely attributed to inherent limitations associated with the proposed methodology, such as i) the lack of moderate-high spatial resolution LAI records that could be used for training and testing purposes and ii) saturation effects associated with the use of VIs. Notwithstanding these limitations, the proposed methodology has been shown to be flexible and robust and can be a useful approach to acquire LAIMR estimates with fairly reasonable accuracy in data limited circumstances.

M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review The complex and varied drainage patterns in the head and neck present a challenge in the regional control of cutaneous neoplasms. Lymph node involvement significantly diminishes survival, often warranting more aggressive treatment. Here, we review the risk factors associated with lymphatic metastasis, in the context of the evolving role of sentinel lymph node biopsy.Recent Findings In cutaneous head and neck melanomas, tumor thickness, age, size, mitosis, ulceration, and specific histology have been associated with lymph node metastasis (LNM). In head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, tumor thickness, size, perineural invasion, and immunosuppression are all risk factors for nodal metastasis. The risk factors for lymph node involvement in Merkel cell carcinoma are not yet fully defined, but emerging evidence indicates that tumor thickness and size may be associated with regional metastasis.Summary The specific factors that predict a greater risk of LNM for cutaneous head and neck cancers generally include depth of invasion, tumor size, mitotic rate, ulceration, immunosuppression, and other histopathological factors.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is essential for maintaining urban ecosystems, climate regulation, and resident health. To explore the variations in city-level vegetation greening (VG) and its relationship to urban expansion, VG in 439 Chinese cities was extracted using the Theil-Sen and Mann-Kendall algorithms based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer EVI (enhanced vegetation index) data from 2001 to 2020. The spatial variations in VG and its patterns, as well as its relationship with urban expansion, were then analyzed. The following results were obtained: (1) cities with larger greening areas were primarily located in the central and eastern provinces of China, followed by the southeastern, southwestern, and western provinces. The 48 cities with the largest greening areas accounted for 60.47% of the total greening area. (2) VG patches in northern China exhibited better integrity. (3) The centralization trend of VG was evident; the location of VG patterns was influenced by the form of urban expansion. (4) The intensity of artificial impervious area expansion had a weak negative correlation with the VG. Therefore, we must enhance vegetation in new urban areas to improve the spatial balance of VG. The present results of this study can provide a foundation for developing effective policies for the construction and management of urban greenery projects.

UK deer sera were collected in 2020-2021 from 6 species and a hybrid with 1748 tested using anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid serology assays. No samples were positive on both assays nor by surrogate neutralization testing. There is no evidence that spill-over infections of SARS-CoV-2 occurred from the human population to UK deer or that SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating in UK deer (over the study period). Although it cannot be ruled out, study results indicate that spill-over infections followed by circulation of SARS-CoV-2 to the most common European deer species is small.

TI  - Analysis of clustering methods for crop type mapping using satellite imagery
T2  - NEUROCOMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the current challenges in population growth and scarceness of food, new technologies are emerging. Remote sensing in general and satellite imagery more specifically are part of these technologies which can help provide accurate monitoring and classification of cultivars. Part of the increase in the use of these technologies has to do with the ongoing increment on the spatial-temporal resolution together with the free availability of some of these services. Typically time series are used as a pre-processing technique and combined with supervised learning techniques in order to build models for crop type identification in remote images. However, these models suffer from the lack of labelled data sets needed to train them. Unsupervised classification can overcome this limitation but has been less frequently used in this research field. This paper proposes to test and analyse the performance of several unsupervised clustering algorithms towards crop type identification on remote images. In this manner combinations of clustering algorithms and distance measures, a key element in the behaviour of these algorithms, are studied using an experimental design with more than twenty datasets built from the combinations of five crops and more than 45000 parcels. Results highlight better clustering methods and distance measures to create accurate and novel crop mapping models for remote sensing images. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Determination of rainfed wheat agriculture potential through assimilation of remote sensing data with SWAT model case study: ZarrinehRoud Basin, Iran
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the importance of rainfed agriculture in adaptation to nature and long-term sustainability in human food supply and livelihood of farmers, the main purpose of this study is to investigate the potential of rainfed agriculture in the Zarrinehroud basin as this basin is one of the most important sub-basins of Lake Urmia. For this study, the remote sensing data of surface soil moisture and evapotranspiration were combined with the SWAT model using the Data Assimilation method, Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). Calibration of runoff flow rate in SWAT model showed the correlation coefficient ranging between 0.69 and 0.84 in the calibration period (2000-2009) and between 0.64 and 0.86 for the validation period (2010-2014). The assimilation of the remote sensing data with the calibrated SWAT model showed that the model simulations for both the variables of surface soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration improved by at least 25% in both 2010 and 2014. It has been determined that 10.5 and 25.4% of the region's lands have a Very Appropriate and Appropriate potential for rainfed wheat agriculture, respectively. Areas with Moderate and Inappropriate potential occupy 64.1% of the lands in the region.

The findings based on a sample of 176 junior business executives establish that investors with higher scores on Islamic Worldview are less likely to invest in a profitable firm that is alleged of environmental degradation than those with lower scores. Guided by their intrinsic religiosity, investors make decisions different from those of the supposedly economically rational person. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Wind erosion susceptibility modelling along the Eastern Cape Wild Coast, South Africa
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind erosion is a major driver of land degradation, impacting more than a third of all land areas in recent centuries. It has been estimated that approximately 19% of lands in Europe are moderately to highly susceptible to wind erosion, whilst up to 25% of East and Southern Africa are at moderate to elevated risk of soil erosion. Along the eastern seaboard of South Africa, accelerated wind erosion has led to severe, localised land degradation in parts of the Wild Coast. In data sparse regions where conventional wind erosion modelling is difficult, mitigation of the devastating impacts associated with accelerated wind erosion could be facilitated by the identification of highly susceptible areas. Therefore, the study objectives were to map the regional wind erosion susceptibility conditions and identify vulnerable areas. In this study, general concepts of the Wind Erosion Equation were adopted. Two regional susceptibility methods were implemented and compared. Model 1 employed a geostatistical approach, based on erosion factor class frequency ratio data and Analytical Hierarchy Process importance weights. Model 2 utilised the data driven Weights of Evidence modelling technique. Model 1 has classified large areas of the study area as having low susceptibility (46%) whilst Model 2 classed more than 90% of the areas as very low susceptible zones. Both models show that less than 4% of the study region has a high to very high susceptibility to wind erosion. In general, areas associated with a higher wind erosion susceptibility are poorly vegetated, wind exposed coastal zones that are characterized by unconsolidated, erodible sandy soils. Model 1 and Model 2 are associated with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.987 and 0.946 respectively, displaying satisfactory average performances. The employed modelling approaches provide an effective means to assess regional wind erosion susceptibility in coastal environments worldwide.

TI  - Accuracy, stability, and continuity of AVHRR, SeaWiFS, MODIS, and VIIRS deep blue long-term land aerosol retrieval in Asia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The deep blue (DB) aerosol algorithm applied to four satellite instruments, AVHRR, SeaWiFS, MODIS, and VIIRS, produced a long-term aerosol data set since 1989. This study first evaluated and compared the accuracy, stability, and continuity of four DB aerosol optical depth (AOD) products in Asia using AErosol RObotic NETwork measurements. Then, the regional AOD spatial distributions, coverages, and series trends are analyzed. The results show that VIIRS DB has the highest accuracy and stability, with an expected error (EE, +/-(0.05 + 20%)) of 76.59% and stability of approximately 0.027 per decade. The performance of MODIS DB is slightly worse than that of VIIRS. However, their AOD pattern, coverage, and trend are comparable. The performance of AVHRR (EE = 58.10%) and the stability of SeaWiFS (0.093 per decade) are less good. Therefore, SeaWiFS DB data should be used with caution for trend analysis. The AOD accuracy and coverage together determine the AOD pattern and the continuity of multi-sensor data. In addition to consistent algorithm accuracy, it is necessary to consider the influences in sensor sampling and inappropriate-pixel screening schemes in the joint multi-sensor analysis. Encouragingly, although multiple DB products have different AOD averages of regional series, their changing trends are consistent. Error analysis shows that the AOD bias characteristic is different in different surface conditions. This indicates that the surface reflectance estimated by the DB algorithm using different techniques is divergent, which may be the direction for the improvement of the algorithm.

TI  - Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells: A review of recent proteomic applications
T2  - PROTEOMICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) represent a sentinel blood sample which reacts to different pathophysiological stimuli in the form of immunological responses/immunophenotypic changes. The study of molecular content of PBMCs can provide better understanding of immune processes giving the possibility of monitoring the health conditions of the host organism. Proteomic analysis of PBMCs can achieve mentioned goal as important immune-related biomarkers are easily accessible for analysis. PBMCs have been gaining attention in different research areas including preclinical or clinical investigations. In this review, recent applications of proteomic analysis of PBMCs are described and discussed. Approaches are divided based on different proteomic workflows such as in-gel, in-solution and on-filter modes. The effect of various diseases such as autoimmune, cancer, neurodegenerative, viral, metabolic, and various immune stimulations such as radiation, vaccine, corticosteroids over PBMCs proteome, are described with emphasis on promising protein biomarker candidates.

T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR RHEUMATOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Elucidating the basis of chronic disease courses and the development of appropriate treatment methods for inflammatory diseases still represent a big challenge for medical science, as the mechanisms driving aberrant immune reactions are mostly still unknown. Of particular interest is the identification of checkpoints that regulate the function and differentiation of proinflammatory cells during the pathogenesis, along with methods for modulation of specific checkpoints as a treatment approach. Innate receptors, such as members of the natural killer group 2 family (NKG2X), natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR) or Toll-like receptors (TLRs), play an important role in modulating the immune response. NKG2 member D (NKG2D) is a potent activating receptor of the immune system, known as a sentinel for cellular danger signals presented by cells exposed to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, cell death or an inflammatory cytokine milieu. NKG2A/C bind the non-classical HLA class I molecule, sense changes in ligand expression associated with malignant transformation and cellular stress and their main function is to send inhibitory or activating signals to NK cells and subsets of T cells. In this review, we present our latest knowledge on the understanding of the role of innate receptors in the context of chronic inflammation and autoimmunity with special emphasis on danger sensor receptors NKG2D and NKG2A/C.

M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing technique with multi-sensor satellite images is found to be a useful tool in delineation of the palaeochannel network in arid to semi-arid regions in India. Principal Component Analysis method with fused images (optical and microwave data) shows a wide N-S trending Sutlej Palaeochannels (SPC) and narrow NE-SW trending palaeochannels in central Punjab. High-resolution Electrical Resistivity Tomography (HERT) survey and litholog data analysis provide good groundwater prospect zone of the palaeochannel. Interpretation of 2D resistivity tomograms with Wenner-Schlumberger method exhibit a thick zone of low resistivity layer (saturated coarse-grained sand) at a depth of 40 m. Integrated geo-tectonic study provides clue that the river migration of Sutlej River from N-S to E-W direction was due to a major tectonic upliftment in the Himalaya. Geochronological data analysis indicates that the avulsed channel of SPC was the main course of old Ghaggar River, linked to the 'Lost Saraswati River' in northwest India.

M3  - Article
AB  - The current study envisages the hydrometeorological disasters risk assessment using meteorological and remote sensing data combined with geomorphological and geological information. Landslide susceptibility was analyzed by maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) using 11 conditioning factors. Potentially dangerous lakes for glacial lake outburst flood were identified based on volume, lake type, slope and distance from mother glacier. Rainfall induced flash flood conditioning factors were classified and ranked using weighted overlay approach to get flash flood risk map. About 237 km(2) is highly vulnerable to the rainfall induced flash floods, whereas, 259.36 km(2) was found high to moderately susceptible to landslides. Most of the settlement areas along the river banks, in and around geological faults are found in high risk zone. The residents of the catchment need to be cautious and appropriate logistic arrangements should be made before rainy season to reduce the fatality and infrastructure damage.

TI  - Reversible data hiding in multispectral images for satellite communications
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat multispectral images are taken by satellites and then transmitted to the monitor center on the ground. Due to that governments and companies sometimes transmit secret messages through the satellite channel, the transmitting process of multispectral images can be a good cover for the secret messages by applying reversible data hiding (RDH) technology. This work proposed a novel RDH method for multispectral images. Before data embedding, each band is creatively matched with a reference band to perform the proposed inter band complexity computation and inter-band prediction. For the pixels of the to-be-embedded band, we inventively combine the proposed inter-band complexity and the inter-space complexity to classify them into four categories and then process them by the inter-space predictor, inter-band predictor, multi-predictor and second time prediction, respectively. Moreover, a general complexity is used to control the embedding priority to achieve lower distortion. Compared with the generally used reversible data hiding methods, our proposed method can reach a larger embedding rate and lower distortion for multispectral images.

TI  - Assessing biodiversity from space: Impact of spatial and spectral resolution on trait-based functional diversity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Observing functional diversity continuously in time and space using satellite imagery forms the basis for studying impact, interactions, and feedback of environmental change mechanisms on ecosystems and biodiversity globally. Functional diversity of plant traits links ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. This work presents an approach to map and quantify functional diversity of physiological forest traits derived from 20 m Sentinel-2 data in a temperate forest ecosystem. We used two complementary data sources, namely high-resolution, as well as spatially resampled airborne imaging spectroscopy data and Sentinel-2 data, to ensure our methods support consistently mapping functional diversity from space. We retrieved three physiological traits related to forest health, stress, and potential productivity, namely chlorophyll, carotenoid, and water content, from airborne imaging spectroscopy and Sentinel-2 data using corresponding spectral indices as proxies. We analyzed changes in two functional diversity metrics, namely functional richness and divergence, at different spatial resolutions. Both functional diversity metrics depend on the size and number of pixels to derive functional diversity as a function of distance, leading to different interpretations. When mapping functional diversity using Sentinel-2 data, small-scale patterns <1.1 ha were no longer visible, implying a minimum calculation area with 60 m radius recommended for retrieval of functional diversity metrics. The spectrally convolved and spatially resampled airborne spectroscopy data and the native Sentinel-2 data were correlated with r = 0.747 for functional richness and r = 0.709 for divergence in a 3.1 ha neighborhood. Functional richness was more affected by the differences in trait maps between the acquisitions resulting from effects in illumination and topography compared with functional divergence. Further differences could be explained by varying illumination/observation effects and phenological status of the vegetation at acquisition. Our approach demonstrates the importance of spatial and spectral resolution when scaling diversity assessments from regional to continental scales.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of Choosing Wisely guidelines for axillary observation in women older than age 70 years with hormone receptor-positive, clinically node-negative, operable breast tumors
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND The Society for Surgical Oncology's Choosing Wisely guidelines recommend against sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in favor of observation in this population. Recent analyses reveal that this has not been widely adopted. The purpose of this cost-effectiveness analysis is to compare the costs and benefits associated with observation or SLNB in women >70 years old with hormone receptor-positive, clinically node-negative, operable breast cancer. METHODS A decision tree with Markov modeling was created to compare treatment strategies using long-term follow-up data from clinical trials in this population. Costs were estimated from published literature and publicly available databases. Breast cancer-specific health-state utilities were derived from the literature and expert opinion. One-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. A structural sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of functional status and anxiety from nonevaluation of the axilla on cost-effectiveness. Costs and benefits, measured in life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), were tabulated across 10, 15, and 20 years and compared using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS SLNB is not cost-effective from the payer or societal perspectives with ICERs of $138,374/LY and $131,900/LY, respectively. When QALYs were considered, SLNB provided fewer QALYs (SLNB, 10.33 QALYs; observation, 10.53 QALYs) at a higher cost (SLNB, $15,845; observation, $4020). Structural sensitivity analysis revealed that SLNB was cost-effective in certain patients with significant anxiety related to axillary observation (ICER, $39,417/QALY). CONCLUSIONS Routine SLNB in this population is not cost-effective. The cost-effectiveness of SLNB, however, is dependent on individual patient factors, including functional status as well as patient preference.;

TI  - Drone-based magnetic and multispectral surveys to develop a 3D model for mineral exploration at Qullissat, Disko Island, Greenland
T2  - SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineral exploration in the West Greenland flood basalt province is attractive because of its resemblance to the magmatic sulfide-rich deposit in the Russian Norilsk region, but it is challenged by rugged topography and partly poor exposure for relevant geologic formations. On northern Disko Island, previous exploration efforts have identified rare native iron occurrences and a high potential for Ni-Cu-Co-PGE-Au mineralization. However, Quaternary landslide activity has obliterated rock exposure in many places at lower elevations. To augment prospecting field work under these challenging conditions, we acquire high-resolution magnetic and multispectral remote sensing data using drones in the Qullissat area. From the data, we generate a detailed 3D model of a mineralized basalt unit, belonging to the Asuk Member of the Palaeocene Vaigat Formation. Different types of legacy data and newly acquired geo- and petrophysical as well as geochemical-mineralogical measurements form the basis of an integrated geological interpretation of the unoccupied aerial system (UAS) surveys. In this context, magnetic data aim to define the location and the shape of the buried magmatic body, and to estimate if its magnetic properties are indicative for mineralization. UAS-based multispectral orthomosaics are used to identify surficial iron staining, which serves as a proxy for outcropping sulfide mineralization. In addition, UAS-based digital surface models are created for geomorphological characterization of the landscape to accurately reveal landslide features. UAS-based magnetic data suggest that the targeted magmatic unit is characterized by a pattern of distinct positive and negative magnetic anomalies. We apply a 3D magnetization vector inversion (MVI) model to the UAS-based magnetic data to estimate the magnetic properties and shape of the magmatic body. By means of introducing constraints in the inversion, (1) UAS-based multispectral data and legacy drill cores are used to assign significant magnetic properties to areas that are associated with the mineralized Asuk Member, and (2) the Earth's magnetic and the palaeomagnetic field directions are used to evaluate the general magnetization direction in the magmatic units. Our results suggest that the geometry of the mineralized target can be estimated as a horizontal sheet of constant thickness, and that the magnetization of the unit has a strong remanent component formed during a period of Earth's magnetic field reversal. The magnetization values obtained in the MVI are in a similar range to the measured ones from a drillcore intersecting the targeted unit. Both the magnetics and topography confirm that parts of the target unit were displaced by landslides. We identified several fully detached and presumably rotated blocks in the obtained model. The model highlights magnetic anomalies that correspond to zones of mineralization and is used to identify outcrops for sampling. Our study demonstrates the potential and efficiency of using high-resolution UAS-based multi-sensor data to constrain the geometry of partially exposed geological units and assist exploration targeting in difficult or poorly exposed terrain.

TI  - Effects of lignin-based flame retardants on flame-retardancy and insulation performances of epoxy resin composites
T2  - IRANIAN POLYMER JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great interest and remains a challenge to simultaneously improve the compatibility and flame-retardant performance of lignin/epoxy resin (EP) composites. In this work, a polysiloxane-enwrapped phosphorus-containing lignin-based flame retardant (PHMS-lig-P) was prepared through reactions of lignin, PHMS and TCP to address this issue, with results showing significantly improved flame-retardant performance and comprehensive performance. The influence of PHMS-lig-P on the flame retardancy of EP was investigated by vertical burning test (UL-94V), limiting oxygen index (LOI), smoke density test and cone calorimeter (CC) test. The PHMS-lig-P/EP achieved a V-1 rating, and its LOI value increased to 25.3%. The maximum smoke density (D-s,D-max) decreased by 83.2%. Furthermore, pHRR, avHRR, and MLR of PHMS-lig-P/EP decreased by 37.5%, 22.6%, and 25.1%, respectively. In addition, the evolved gases and char residues were studied using thermogravimetric analysis coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (TG-FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results certified the flame-retardant mechanism of PHMS-lig-P was attributed to the synergistic effect of lignin, phosphonate, and polysiloxane, producing a compact and cohesive char layer that acted as a physical barrier, limiting the transfer of heat and oxygen and preventing the spread of pyrolysis volatiles and flammable gases. Moreover, the flame-retarded epoxy resin possessed good dispersion uniformity in mechanical properties and insulation performance, showing good applicability.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - The value of satellite soil moisture and snow cover data for the transfer of hydrological model parameters to ungauged sites
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent advances in remote sensing provide opportunities for estimating the parameters of conceptual hydrologic models more reliably. However, the question of whether and to what extent the use of satellite data in model calibration may assist in transferring model parameters to ungauged catchments has not been fully resolved. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of different methods for transferring model parameters obtained by multiple-objective calibrations to ungauged sites and to assess the model performance in terms of runoff, soil moisture, and snow cover predictions relative to existing regionalization approaches. The model parameters are calibrated to daily runoff, satellite soil moisture (Advanced Scatterometer - ASCAT), and snow cover (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer - MODIS) data. The assessment is based on 213 catchments situated in different physiographic and climate zones of Austria. For the transfer of model parameters, eight methods (global and local variants of arithmetic mean, regression, spatial proximity, and similarity) are examined in two periods, i.e., the period in which the model is calibrated (2000-2010) and an independent validation period (2010-2014). The predictive accuracy is evaluated by the leave-one-out cross-validation. The results show that the method by which the model is calibrated in the gauged catchment has a larger impact on runoff prediction accuracy in the ungauged catchments than the choice of the parameter transfer method. The best transfer methods are global and local similarity and the kriging approach. The performance of the transfer methods differs between lowland and alpine catchments. While the soil moisture and snow cover prediction efficiencies are higher in lowland catchments, the runoff prediction efficiency is higher in alpine catchments. A comparison of the model transfer methods, based on parameters calibrated to runoff, snow cover, and soil moisture with those based on parameters calibrated to runoff, only indicates that the former outperforms the latter in terms of simulating soil moisture and snow cover. The performance of simulating runoff is similar, and the accuracy depends mainly on the weight given to the runoff objective in the multiple-objective calibrations.

TI  - Comparing single or dual tracing modality on sentinel lymph node biopsy from patients who plan to omitting axillary lymph node dissection referring to the criteria of Z0011 trial: a retrospective study
T2  - UPDATES IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be omitted in the part of the breast-conserving patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) since Z0011 trial has presented. Nevertheless, to date, no studies revealed the influence of different tracing modalities (single tracer versus dual tracers) for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) on axillary management referring to Z0011 trial criteria. This study aimed to assess whether different tracing modalities of SLNB have impact on axillary management referring to Z0011 trial criteria. The clinical data of breast-conserving patients who underwent SLNB guided by combination of methylene blue (MB) and indocyanine green(ICG) were retrospectively analyzed in our center. The numbers of metastatic (positive) SLNs guided by the single tracer and the dual tracer were compared by self-control study. 127 patients with 1-2 metastatic SLNs dyed by MB [(recorded as MB(+))]were retrieved from our database between 2016 and 2020. In these cases, 53 patients contained 86 SLNs, which were ICG staining but MB negative staining (recorded as ICG(+)/MB(-)). In addition, 16 patients contained 20 metastatic SLNs with ICG(+)/MB(-). There were six patients finally excluded patients (6/127, 4.7%) who initially met the criteria of Z0011 trial, because the further detection of ICG(+)/MB(-) SLNs led the total numbers of positive SLNs over two. The difference was statistically significant. Single tracing modality may underestimate the positive SLN numbers compared to dual tracing modality. Different tracing modalities of SLNB will significantly affect Axillary management referring to Z0011 trial criteria.

TI  - The Roles of Cardiac Fibroblasts and Endothelial Cells in Myocarditis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - In myocarditis caused by various etiologies, activated immune cells and the immune regulatory factors released by them play important roles. But in this complex microenvironment, non-immune cells and non-cardiomyocytes in the heart, such as cardiomyocytes (CMs), cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and endothelial cells (ECs), play the role of "sentinel", amplify inflammation, and interact with the cardiomyocytes. The complex interactions between them are rarely paid attention to. This review will re-examine the functions of CFs and ECs in the pathological conditions of myocarditis and their direct and indirect interactions with CMs, in order to have a more comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of myocarditis and better guide the drug development and clinical treatment of myocarditis.

TI  - Higher risk tumor features are not associated with higher nodal stage in patients with estrogen receptor-positive, node-positive breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Studies support omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for patients with sentinel node-positive disease, with ALND recommended for patients who present with clinically positive nodes. Here, we evaluate patient and tumor characteristics and pathologic nodal stage of patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER +) breast cancer who undergo ALND to determine if differences exist based on nodal presentation. Materials and methods Retrospective chart review from 2010 to 2019 defined three groups of patients with ER + breast cancer who underwent ALND for positive nodes: SLN + (positive node identified at SLN biopsy), cNUS (abnormal preoperative US and biopsy), and cNpalp (palpable adenopathy). Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy or presented with axillary recurrence were excluded. Results Of 191 patients, 94 were SLN + , 40 were cNUS, and 57 were cNpalp. Patients with SLN + compared with cNpalp were younger (56 vs 64 years, p < 0.01), more often pre-menopausal (41% vs 14%, p < 0.01), and White (65% vs 39%, p = 0.01) with more tumors that were low-grade (36% vs 8%, p < 0.01). Rates of PR + (p = 0.16), levels of Ki67 expression (p = 0.07) and LVI (p = 0.06) did not differ significantly among groups. Of patients with SLN + disease, 64% had pN1 disease compared to 38% of cNUS (p = 0.1) and 40% of cNpalp (p = 0.01). On univariable analysis, tumor size (p = 0.01) and histology (p = 0.04) were significantly associated with pN1 disease, with size remaining an independent predictor on multivariable analysis (p = 0.02). Conclusion Historically, higher risk features have been attributed to patients with clinically positive nodes precluding omission of ALND, but when restricting evaluation to patients with ER + breast cancer, only tumor size is associated with higher nodal stage.

TI  - Evaluating the consistency and continuity of pixel-scale cloud property data records from Aqua and SNPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Aqua, SNPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership), and JPSS (Joint Polar Satellite System) satellites carry a combination of hyperspectral infrared sounders (AIRS, Atmospheric Infrared Sounder, and CrIS, Cross-track Infrared Sounder) and high-spatial-resolution narrowband imagers (MODIS, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, and VIIRS, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite). They provide an opportunity to acquire high-quality, long-term cloud data records and are a key component of the existing Program of Record of cloud observations. By matching observations from sounders and imagers across different platforms at the pixel scale, this study evaluates the self-consistency and continuity of cloud retrievals from Aqua and SNPP by multiple algorithms, including the AIRS version 7 retrieval algorithm and the Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Combined Atmospheric Product System (CLIMCAPS) version 2 for sounders and the standard Aqua MODIS collection 6.1 and the NASA MODIS-VIIRS continuity cloud products for imagers. Metrics describing detailed statistical distributions at the sounder field of view (FOV) and the joint histograms of cloud properties are evaluated. These products are found to be highly consistent despite their retrieval from different sensors using different algorithms. Differences between the two sounder cloud products are mainly due to cloud clearing and the treatment of clouds in scenes with unsuccessful atmospheric profile retrievals. The sounder subpixel cloud heterogeneity evaluated using the standard deviation of imager retrievals at the sounder FOV shows good agreement between the standard and continuity products from different satellites. However, the impact of algorithm and instrument differences between MODIS and VIIRS is revealed in cloud top pressure retrievals and in the imager cloud distribution skewness. Our study presents a unique aspect to examine NASA's progress toward building a continuous cloud data record with sufficient quality to investigate clouds' role in global environmental change.

TI  - Suitability evaluation of potential arable land in the Mediterranean region
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The existing cultivated land in the Mediterranean region faces great pressure from various sources. A suitability evaluation of potential arable land is urgent for helping adaptation measures to mitigate the impacts of climate change and human pressure on agricultural production in the Mediterranean region. We integrated 15 biophysical and socio-economic factors from GIS and remote sensing data to perform a suitability evaluation of potential arable land in the Mediterranean region using analytical hierarchy process and radial basis function artificial neural network methods. Moreover, we analyzed the gap between potential arable land and existing cultivated land and compared the evaluation results between the analytical hierarchy process and artificial neural network methods. The results show that the suitability index of potential arable land based on artificial neural network with 6 neurons has the best correlation with average yield and average harvested area. The land area with a suitability grade over medium level accounts for 62.95% of the potential arable land area, of which 45.71% is uncultivated land. Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Lebanon, Portugal, Spain and Turkey have great opportunities for agricultural development. Radial basis function artificial neural network outperforms analytical hierarchy process, has better verification results, and requires less input. This study provides an initial insight into the agricultural land suitability of 16 countries around the Mediterranean Sea and introduces a research idea for agricultural land suitability evaluation.

TI  - New double decomposition deep learning methods for river water level forecasting
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecasting river water levels or streamflow water levels (SWL) is vital to optimising the practical and sustainable use of available water resources. We propose a new deep learning hybrid model for SWL forecasting using convolutional neural networks (CNN), bi-directional long-short term memory (BiLSTM), and ant colony optimisation (ACO) with a two-phase decomposition approach at the 7-day, 14-day, and 28-day forecast horizons. The newly developed CBILSTM method is coupled with complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and variational mode decomposition (VMD) methods to extract the most significant features within predictor variables to build a hybrid CVMD-CBiLSTM model. We integrate three distinct datasets (satellite-derived, climate mode indices, and ground-based meteorological observations) to improve the forecasting capability of the CVMD-CBiLSTM model, applied at nineteen different gauging stations in the Australian Murray River system. This proposed model returns a significantly accurate performance with-98% of all prediction errors within less than +/- 0.020 m and a low relative root mean square of-0.08%, demonstrating its superiority over several benchmark models. The results show that using the new hybrid deep learning algorithm with ACO feature selection can significantly improve the accuracy of forecasted river water levels, and therefore, the method is attractive for adopting remote sensing data to the model ground-based river flow for strategic water savings planning initiatives and dealing with climate change-induced extreme events such as drought events.

TI  - The interrelationship between LST, NDVI, NDBI, and land cover change in a section of Lagos metropolis, Nigeria
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent times, there has been renewed interest in understanding the dynamics of land cover change and its relationship with several environmental parameters. This study assesses the interrelationship between land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and land cover change in Amuwo-Odofin Local Government Area of Lagos State, Nigeria. Multi-temporal and multi-spectral Landsat imageries for years 2002, 2013, 2016, and 2019 served as the primary dataset. Using the parallelepiped classifier, the imageries were classified into five land cover classes - mixed vegetation, bare land, built-up area, water body, and wetland. The spectral indices (NDVI and NDBI) were computed and the LST was determined using a single-channel algorithm. Land cover transition matrices were calculated to examine the proportion of land cover change between classes, including the unchanged areas. Pearson's correlation analysis enabled an analysis of the interdependence or interrelationship in the distribution of the parameters. From 2002 to 2019, the highest land cover transitions recorded were bare land to built-up area (12.64 km(2)), mixed vegetation to built-up area (21.55 km(2)), wetland to mixed vegetation (8.87 km(2)), and mixed vegetation to bare land (8.46 km(2)). There was a negative correlation between LST and NDVI, and between NDVI and NDBI. The distribution of the LST, NDVI, and NDBI varied correspondingly in accordance with land cover changes. The increase in built-up area could be the major driver of the observed changes in LST, NDBI, and NDVI, with an observed relationship that NDBI and LST values increase with increase in built-up areas.

TI  - Mapping three-dimensional morphological characteristics of tidal salt-marsh channels using UAV structure-from-motion photogrammetry
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal channels (TCs) are geomorphological features of coastal and tidal landscapes. They provide a pathway for the exchange of material and energy between marshes and adjacent water bodies and thereby control the hydrodynamic, morphological, and ecological processes on marsh platforms. Due to difficulties in terms of accessibility, limitations on the duration of exposure during low-water stages, and variations in morphology over time, rapid and accurate mapping of such intertidal morphological features at a high frequency is extremely challenging. Here, we present an efficient method integrated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) structure-frommotion (SfM) photogrammetry, and spatial morphological fitting and delineation for accurately quantifying channel three-dimensional (3D) morphological features in terms width, depth, width-to-depth ratio, and crosssectional area. We also relate these measured proxies to salt marsh species distributions. A two-step thresholding approach combining elevation and slope is developed in order to determinate TC boundaries from salt marsh and tidal flat area, and a Gaussian fit is used to estimate water-bearing channel depth and cross-sectional area. Salt marsh species are identified from fine-resolution multispectral satellite data and a field training dataset using a Random Forest classifier. Our results indicate that (1) UAV-based SfM photogrammetry can achieve centimeter-level accuracy in mapping the topography of TCs, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.7 cm - mainly from the strong reflection of light from smooth TC water surfaces and the presence of water-bearing layers; (2) the morphological features of TCs, ranging from tidal flats to salt marsh areas, demonstrate a similar tendency, which increases at first and then decreases. The maximum depth and cross-sectional area of TCs is in sparse salt-marsh area, up to 4 m and 150 m2, respectively; and (3) TC morphology has a major impact on the distribution of salt marsh plants and such effects vary across different plant species. These results greatly contribute deep understanding of feedbacks between TCs and salt marsh plant species distribution and have significant implications for developing ecological and morphological salt marsh restoration guidelines.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of agricultural and meteorological droughts using SPI and MODIS-based estimates over a Brazilian semiarid region: study case of Upper Paraiba River basin
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a very complex natural phenomenon that affects the water supply and consequently impacts agricultural and socioeconomic activities, causing social and political crises. The objective of this study is to spatiotemporally analyze meteorological and agricultural droughts based on multiple indices in the Upper Paraiba River basin for the 2001-2017 period. The agricultural droughts were analyzed using four drought indices (NDVI, LST, VSWI, and VHI) based on data from the MODIS sensor on the TERRA and AQUA satellites, while the meteorological droughts were characterized using the standardized precipitation index (SPI) at three different time scales based on TRMM rainfall data. The values of LST, NDVI, VHI, VSWI, and SPI revealed how much vegetation is influenced by rainfall variability in this semiarid region of Brazil. The estimated results of VSWI and VHI show the years with extremely wet and dry conditions from spatial and temporal perspectives. The relationship between estimated drought indices and observed relative humidity showed that VSWI (R-2 = 0.78) was best fitted when compared to VHI (R-2 = 0.46). Thus, it can be concluded that the VSWI index is better adapted because it presented more consistent results for the behavior of agricultural droughts when compared to the VHI. The results of the SPI analysis were used for the identification of the main drought events that affected the study basin. This combined technique of different drought indices easily produced an alternative method for comprehensive drought assessment.

TI  - A preliminary analysis of the secondary sex ratio decline after the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The secondary sex ratio (SSR, i.e., the number of male births per 100 female births) has long been proposed as a sentinel health indicator. Studies have suggested that exogenous environmental stressors reduce SSR after 3 to 6 months (via disproportionate male fetus deaths) and after 9 months (via reduced male conception). We aimed to examine whether SSR declined after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Japan. Methods We used monthly vital statistics records collected between January 2013 and April 2021 (the -number of male and female live births, in particular). Using information reported before the pandemic struck Japan (i.e., January 2013 to January 2020), we predicted SSRs for the months after the pandemic (i.e., February 2020 to April 2021) and compared reported and predicted SSRs. We also stratified the analysis by including two groups of prefectures with different degrees of possible influence from the pandemic. Results We observed a significant reduction in SSR during December 2020 of 102.81 (i.e., 9-10 months after the pandemic affected the country), which was below the lower bound of the 95% prediction intervals (103.12-106.33). This was the lowest SSR observed during the 100-month study period. In addition, the reduction in SSR during December 2020 was more pronounced in the more seriously affected prefectures. Conclusion In Japan, we found a significant reduction in SSR (i.e., fewer male live births) 9-10 months after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. This suggests the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was a significant population-level stressor.

TI  - FcγR-mediated SARS-CoV-2 infection of monocytes activates inflammation
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 can cause acute respiratory distress and death in some patients(1). Although severe COVID-19 is linked to substantial inflammation, how SARS-CoV-2 triggers inflammation is not clear(2). Monocytes and macrophages are sentinel cells that sense invasive infection to form inflammasomes that activate caspase-1 and gasdermin D, leading to inflammatory death (pyroptosis) and the release of potent inflammatory mediators3. Here we show that about 6% of blood monocytes of patients with COVID-19 are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Monocyte infection depends on the uptake of antibody-opsonized virus by Fc. receptors. The plasma of vaccine recipients does not promote antibody-dependent monocyte infection. SARS-CoV-2 begins to replicate in monocytes, but infection is aborted, and infectious virus is not detected in the supernatants of cultures of infected monocytes. Instead, infected cells undergo pyroptosis mediated by activation of NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, caspase-1 and gasdermin D. Moreover, tissue-resident macrophages, but not infected epithelial and endothelial cells, from lung autopsies from patients with COVID-19 have activated inflammasomes. Taken together, these findings suggest that antibody-mediated SARS-CoV-2 uptake by monocytes and macrophages triggers inflammatory cell death that aborts the production of infectious virus but causes systemic inflammation that contributes to COVID-19 pathogenesis.

TI  - Preclinical evaluation of a mannose-labeled magnetic tracer for enhanced sentinel lymph node retention in the head and neck,
T2  - NANOMEDICINE-NANOTECHNOLOGY BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in cancers of the head and neck offers demonstrated clinical and diagnostic value, but adoption is limited by concerns about the detrimental consequence to survival of false negative results in a highly curable setting. The aim of this study was to demonstrate potential to overcome this via application of a novel mannose-labeled magnetic iron oxide tracer. In a large animal model, preoperative imaging and intraoperative magnetometer detection were used to identify magnetic lymph nodes. Iron quantification mapped the distribution of tracer within lymphatic levels. Over a 4-week test period, uptake of magnetic tracer in lymph nodes increased in a linear-like fashion, with a substantial percentage of accumulated iron (83%) being retained in the sentinel node. This result indicates a high affinity of mannose-labeled particles to the sentinel node, while providing a means for the magnetometer probe to indicate node status based on intraoperative signal.

TI  - Breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer and their correlation with the expression of polyligand proteoglycan-1
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDBreast cancer is a malignant tumor with an unclear etiology and is the most common malignant tumor in women. Surgery is the main clinical treatment for breast cancer. Although traditional total mastectomy combined with axillary lymph node dissection is effective, it can result in shoulder dysfunction, especially in middle-aged and elderly patients with breast cancer with weak constitution and other underlying diseases. Furthermore, the postoperative quality of life is poor.AIM To assess breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer treatment and their correlation with polyligand proteoglycan-1.METHODSOverall, 80 patients with breast cancer treated in our hospital from January 2021 to July 2021 were retrospectively selected and divided into an observation group (n = 44) and control group (n = 36) according to the treatment plan. The observation group was treated with breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy, and the control group was treated with total breast resection. Simultaneously, immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the expression of syndecan-1 (SDC-1) in the lesions, and its relationship with clinicopathological findings was analyzed.RESULTSIntraoperative blood loss, operation time, and hospital stay in the observation group were 65.51 +/- 9.94 mL, 65.59 +/- 9.40 min, and 14.80 +/- 3.03 d, respectively, which were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The incidence of postoperative complications in the observation group was 11.36%, which was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The positive expression rate of SDC-1 in the observation group was 25.00%, and there was no significant difference between the groups (P > 0.05). The positive expression rate of SDC-1 in patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage II was 14.29%, which was significantly lower than that in patients with AJCC stage I (P < 0.05). The positive expression of SDC-1 had no significant relationship with age, course of disease, site, tissue type, and treatment plan (P > 0.05).CONCLUSIONBreast preservation surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer treatment have fewer complications and quicker recovery than those treated with total breast resection. Low SDC-1 expression in breast cancer lesions is related to AJCC staging.

TI  - Mapping the wildland-urban interface in California using remote sensing data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the mixed distribution of buildings and vegetation, wildland-urban interface (WUI) areas are characterized by complex fuel distributions and geographical environments. The behavior of wildfires occurring in the WUI often leads to severe hazards and significant damage to man-made structures. Therefore, WUI areas warrant more attention during the wildfire season. Due to the ever-changing dynamic nature of California's population and housing, the update frequency and resolution of WUI maps that are currently used can no longer meet the needs and challenges of wildfire management and resource allocation for suppression and mitigation efforts. Recent developments in remote sensing technology and data analysis algorithms pose new opportunities for improving WUI mapping methods. WUI areas in California were directly mapped using building footprints extracted from remote sensing data by Microsoft along with the fuel vegetation cover from the LANDFIRE dataset in this study. To accommodate the new type of datasets, we developed a threshold criteria for mapping WUI based on statistical analysis, as opposed to using more ad-hoc criteria as used in previous mapping approaches. This method removes the reliance on census data in WUI mapping, and does not require the calculation of housing density. Moreover, this approach designates the adjacent areas of each building with large and dense parcels of vegetation as WUI, which can not only refine the scope and resolution of the WUI areas to individual buildings, but also avoids zoning issues and uncertainties in housing density calculation. Besides, the new method has the capability of updating the WUI map in real-time according to the operational needs. Therefore, this method is suitable for local governments to map local WUI areas, as well as formulating detailed wildfire emergency plans, evacuation routes, and management measures.

TI  - Improved Parameterization of Snow Albedo in WRF plus Noah: Methodology Based on a Severe Snow Event on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowfall and the subsequent evolution of the snowpack have a large effect on the surface energy balance and water cycle of the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The effects of snow cover can be represented by the WRF coupled with a land surface scheme. The widely used Noah scheme is computationally efficient, but its poor representation of albedo needs considerable improvement. In this study, an improved albedo scheme is developed using a satellite-retrieved albedo that takes snow depth and age into account. Numerical experiments were then conducted to simulate a severe snow event in March 2017. The performance of the coupled WRF/Noah model, which implemented the improved albedo scheme, is compared against the model's performance using the default Noah albedo scheme and against the coupled WRF/CLM that applied CLM albedo scheme. When the improved albedo scheme is implemented, the albedo overestimation in the southeastern TP is reduced, reducing the RMSE of the air temperature by 0.7 degrees C. The improved albedo scheme also attains the highest correlation between the satellite-derived and the model-estimated albedo, which provides for a realistic representation of both the snow water equivalent (SWE) spatial distribution in the heavy snowbelt (SWE > 6 mm) and the maximum SWE in the eastern TP. The underestimated albedo in the coupled WRF/CLM leads to underestimating the regional maximum SWE and a consequent failure to estimate SWE in the heavy snowbelt accurately. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of improving the Noah albedo scheme and provides a theoretical reference for researchers aiming to improve albedo schemes further.

TI  - Variation in Deescalated Axillary Surgical Practices in Older Women with Early-Stage Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Randomized controlled trials show that certain axillary surgical practices can be safely deescalated in older adults with early-stage breast cancer. Hospital volume is often equated with surgical quality, but it is unclear whether this includes performance of low-value surgeries. We sought to describe how utilization of two low-value axillary surgeries has varied by time and hospital volume. Methods Women aged >= 70 years diagnosed with breast cancer from 2013 to 2016 were identified in the National Cancer Database. The outcomes of interest were sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in cT1N0 hormone receptor-positive cancer patients and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in cT1-2N0 patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery with <= 2 pathologically positive nodes. Time trends in procedure use and multivariable regression with restricted cubic splines were performed, adjusting for patient, disease, and hospital factors. Results Overall, 83.4% of 44,779 women eligible for omission of SLNB underwent SLNB and 20.0% of 7216 patients eligible for omission of ALND underwent ALND. SLNB rates did not change significantly over time and remained significantly different by age group (70-74 years: 93.5%; 75-79 years: 89.7%, 80-84 years: 76.7%, >= 85 years: 48.9%; p < 0.05). ALND rates decreased over the study period across all age groups included (22.5 to 16.9%, p < 0.001). In restricted cubic splines models, lower hospital volume was associated with higher likelihood of undergoing SLNB and ALND. Conclusions ALND omission has been more widely adopted than SLNB omission in older adults, but lower hospital volume is associated with higher likelihood of both procedures. Practice-specific deimplementation strategies are needed, especially for lower-volume hospitals.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat time-series with 10-year intervals from 1991 to 2021 were used to extract information on land use and land cover (LULC) changes in the Ternata oasis over the past thirty years by using maximum likelihood classification (MLC) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). MLC maps were classified in five LULC classes: cultivated land, desertified land, barren land, built-up area, and water bodies. While the NDVI maps were classified in two classes: cultivated and uncultivated land. The classes identified in the MLC maps have an overall accuracy higher than 90 percent. Results revealed a significant expansion of desertified lands (+168.09%) between 1991 and 2021. Cultivated lands, on the other hand, shrank by-29.6%. Furthermore, sixty additional Landsat images from 1991 to 2021 were analyzed and revealed a strong correlation between LULC changes in the oasis and the stored water in the upstream reservoir. The Ternata oasis has experienced significant desertification related to human and natural factors, particularly drought and the expansion of cultivated areas reliant on groundwater. Given the widespread land degradation, several local efforts are being implemented to mitigate the effects of desertification and conserve the Ternata oasis' natural resources.

TI  - Comparative analysis of the performance of the GOFS, PSY4 and AMSEAS ocean model frameworks in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico coastal ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This work compares the performance of three ocean model frameworks that currently produce outputs of the ocean properties specific to the US Caribbean ocean; the Global Ocean Forecast System (GOFS), US Navy Coastal Ocean Model for the American Seas (AMSEAS) and the Daily Global Physical Bulletin (PSY4). Separate comparisons are done for the ocean properties in the open ocean and nearshore regions. For the open ocean, the model outputs are compared with the AVISO satellite altimetry data for the sea-surface height anomaly (SSHA), the OSCAR data for surface current velocities and the G1SST satellite data for sea-surface temperature (SST). For the nearshore analysis, the model outputs are compared with in-situ buoy measurements and HOBO logger data in the nearshore regions. Our analysis shows that the PSY4 produces the most realistic outputs of SSHA and surface current velocities in the open ocean, whereas all the models produce a strong correlation in terms of the seasonal variability of the surface temperature when compared to the G1SST data. The AMSEAS model, despite being a fine resolution regional model, underperforms in terms of the surface current velocity outputs in the open ocean due to the influence of the simulated submesoscale turbulence on the mesoscale variability. In the nearshore regions, none of the models produce agreeable outputs on the SSHA and current velocities. These findings provide useful insight on the applicability of the model outputs for various operations that require oceanographic data specific to the US Caribbean ocean.

TI  - Clinical issues of surgery for uterine endometrial cancer in Japan
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The mainstay of treatment for uterine endometrial cancer is surgery, and recurrent-risk cases require multidisciplinary treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Methods The standard surgery for uterine endometrial cancer is hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooophorectomy, with additional retroperitoneal lymph node dissection and omentectomy, depending on the case. The appropriate treatment is determined based on the risk classification, such as the depth of invasion into the myometrium, diagnosis of histological type and grade, and risk assessment of lymph node metastasis. Results Recently, minimally invasive surgery has been widely used not only in low-risk patients but also in intermediate- and high-risk patients. In low-risk patients, the possibility of ovarian preservation is discussed from a healthcare perspective for young women. Determining the need for retroperitoneal lymph node dissection based on sentinel lymph node evaluation may contribute in minimizing the incidence of post-operative lymphedema while ensuring accurate diagnosis of lymph node metastasis. Recently, many studies using sentinel lymph nodes have been reported for patients with uterine endometrial cancer, and the feasibility of sentinel lymph node mapping surgery has been proven. Unfortunately, sentinel lymph node biopsy and sentinel lymph node mapping surgery have not been widely adopted in surgery for uterine cancer in Japan. In addition, the search for biomarkers, such as RNA sequencing using The Cancer Genome Atlas, metabolic profile and lipidomic profile for early detection and prognostic evaluation, has been actively pursued. Conclusions Gynecologic oncologists expect to be able to provide uterine endometrial cancer patients with appropriate treatment that preserves their quality of life without compromising oncologic outcomes in the near future.How minimally invasive surgery may contribute positively in both low- and high-risk endometrial cancer patients and that sentinel lymph node biopsy should be considered to avoid post-operative lymphedema.

TI  - Implementation of an ensemble Kalman filter in the Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ model v5.1) for data assimilation of ground-level PM2.5
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we developed a data assimilation (DA) system for chemical transport model (CTM) simulations using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique. This DA technique is easy to implement in an existing system without seriously modifying the original CTM and can provide flow-dependent corrections based on error covariance by short-term ensemble propagations. First, the PM2.5 observations at ground stations were assimilated in this DA system every 6 h over South Korea for the period of the KORUS-AQ campaign from 1 May to 12 June 2016. The DA performances with the EnKF were then compared to a control run (CTR) without DA and a run with three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) DA. Consistent improvements owing to the initial conditions (ICs) assimilated with the EnKF were found in the DA experiments at a 6 h interval compared to the CTR run and to the run with 3D-Var. In addition, we attempted to assimilate the ground observations from China to examine the impacts of improved boundary conditions (BCs) on the PM2.5 predictability over South Korea. The contributions of the ICs and BCs to improvements in the PM2.5 predictability were also quantified. For example, the relative reductions in terms of the normalized mean bias (NMB) were found to be approximately 27.2 % for the 6 h reanalysis run. A series of 24 h PM2.5 predictions were additionally conducted each day at 00:00 UTC with the optimized ICs. The relative reduction of the NMB was 17.3 % for the 24 h prediction run when the updated ICs were applied at 00:00 UTC. This means that after the application of the updated BCs, an additional 9.0 % reduction in the NMB was achieved for 24 h PM2.5 predictions in South Korea.

TI  - Global trends in grassland carrying capacity and relative stocking density of livestock
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the role of livestock in future food systems is debated, animal proteins are unlikely to completely disappear from our diet. Grasslands are a key source of primary productivity for livestock, and feed-food competition is often limited on such land. Previous research on the potential for sustainable grazing has focused on restricted geographical areas or does not consider inter-annual changes in grazing opportunities. Here, we developed a robust method to estimate trends and interannual variability (IV) in global livestock carrying capacity (number of grazing animals a piece of land can support) over 2001-2015, as well as relative stocking density (the reported livestock distribution relative to the estimated carrying capacity [CC]) in 2010. We first estimated the aboveground biomass that is available for grazers on global grasslands based on the MODIS Net Primary Production product. This was then used to calculate livestock carrying capacities using slopes, forest cover, and animal forage requirements as restrictions. We found that globally, CC decreased on 27% of total grasslands area, mostly in Europe and southeastern Brazil, while it increased on 15% of grasslands, particularly in Sudano-Sahel and some parts of South America. In 2010, livestock forage requirements exceeded forage availability in northwestern Europe, and southern and eastern Asia. Although our findings imply some opportunities to increase grazing pressures in cold regions, Central Africa, and Australia, the high IV or low biomass supply might prevent considerable increases in stocking densities. The approach and derived open access data sets can feed into global food system modelling, support conservation efforts to reduce land degradation associated with overgrazing, and help identify undergrazed areas for targeted sustainable intensification efforts or rewilding purposes.

TI  - Proposing Anti-LGBTQIAP Resolutions at the Municipal Level in Poland: Meeting the Social Demand or Making Use of the Available Resources?
T2  - EAST EUROPEAN POLITICS AND SOCIETIES
M3  - Article
AB  - During the eight months preceding the 2019 parliamentary election in Poland, resolutions aimed against the LGBTQIAP minority were adopted by over 60 out of 2,477 municipalities. They were proposed by a local right-wing organization called Ordo Iuris. Based on the prerequisites from the political opportunity structure approach, I test two sets of explanations as to why certain municipalities were targeted by the organization, while others were not. One set of hypotheses is associated with social demand; municipalities chosen by Ordo Iuris are expected to be more religious and supportive of the political right. The other approach assumes that the activity of the organization was determined by the resources available in the community, such as high percentage of members of the local council representing the right-wing Law and Justice party, electoral turnout, membership in religious organizations, and population density. The empirical analysis confirms the significance of resources and disproves the argument associated with social demand. The study has implications for understanding how the social movements of the radical right gain political influence in Eastern European countries. It shows that they do not serve a particular demand from the society for the worldview they represent, but they rather rely on the aid from political elites and the resources provided by them and the community to promote their agenda where they can.

TI  - Quantifying surface soil organic carbon distribution globally during the COVID-19 pandemic using satellite data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important soil parameter of agricultural soils, ensuring food security and agricultural sustainability. It plays a critical role in the global carbon budget and carbon sequestration. Spatial mapping of SOC can help develop sustainable management approaches to enhance soil carbon sequestration and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adverse environmental effects. However, quantifying Spatio-temporal distributions of SOC at the global level is complex because of high land heterogeneity and several climatic and hydrologic influential parameters. The main goal of this study was to quantify the annual global SOC change focusing on cropland using daily soil moisture active passive (SMAP) satellite SOC data. The specific objectives of this study were to assess annual SOC change globally, quantify the annual SOC distribution before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and evaluate change in SOC on cropland during the study period. Results showed an increase of annual SOC on cropland in several countries in 2020 compared to 2019, which can be attributed to the direct and indirect impact of partial and complete lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The change in SOC between 2015 and 2019 was considerably different from the SOC change between 2019 and 2020. For example, between 2019 and 2015, 45.6% of the global area showed a decrease in SOC 0 to 25 g C m(-2) and 30.4% area showed an increase in SOC 0 to 25 g C m(-2). However, between 2020 and 2019, 11.4% of the global area showed a decrease in SOC 0 to 25 g C m(-2,) and 55.4% area showed an increase in SOC 0 to 25 g C m(-2). There is a good relationship between lockdown measures and improvement in SOC, as 48 out of 50 highly infected countries showed increased SOC in 2020 than in 2019. This study suggests better land use management practices can help enhance carbon sequestration and improve soil health.

TI  - Evaluation and adjustment of the radiometric degradation of HY-1B satellite COCTS via a stable marine site
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Chinese Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (COCTS) on-board the Chinese second ocean color satellite, HY-1B, obtained approximately 6 years of data between 2007 and 2013 in China coastal seas and the adjacent waters. However, its radiometric performance has hardly been analyzed, which confuses its applicability in ocean remote sensing. This study tracked the long-term radiometric responsivity trend of HY-1B COCTS based on a stable marine target. Firstly, we identified a temporally stable maritime site of 12 degrees similar to 15 degrees N and 116 degrees similar to 119 degrees E according to the water and atmospheric optical properties using Aqua MODIS products. Then, the time-series of top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance was obtained for each band of HY-1B COCTS and Aqua MODIS over this site according to the criteria of sun-target-view geometry. Finally, exponential or linear degradation models were built and used to adjust the radiometric levels of HY-1B COCTS. Results indicate that the radiometric performance exhibited continuous degradation for all bands at varying levels between 0.4% and 8.1% yr(-1). The worst degradation occurred at 412 nm, with an annual average rate of 8.1%. The degradation at 443 nm reached 5.5% yr(-1) following 412 nm. The radiometric performance at 490 nm, 520 nm, and 565 nm was relatively stable with a drift of similar to 3% yr(-1). The 670 nm, 750 nm, and 865 nm bands remain most stable with the degradation of similar to 1% yr(-1). Taking Terra MODIS as a reference, the temporal consistency of HY-1B COCTS was significantly improved for each band after radiometric adjustment. Cloud-free imageries between 2007 and 2013 showed relatively high spatial consistency. The bias of TOA reflectance was similar to 5% in visible bands and similar to 10% in near-infrared bands after degradation correction. These improvements confirm the application potentials of HY-1B COCTS in ocean remote sensing.

TI  - [Epidemiological characteristics of Yersiniaenterocolitica in patients with diarrhea from 2013 to 2019 in Pudong New Area, Shanghai].
T2  - Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine]
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the epidemiological characteristics of Yersinia enterocolitica in patients with diarrhea in Pudong New Area, Shanghai. Methods: Active surveillance of diarrhea was conducted in 14 sentinel hospitals (three tertiary-level hospitals, nine secondary-level hospitals, and two primary-level hospitals) from January 2013 to December 2019 in Pudong New Area of Shanghai, China base on their location, catchment area, and patient volume. Cold enrichment method was used to isolate Y. enterocolitica and further detection of bioserotype, virulence genes and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates were conducted. The difference of rates was determined using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Results: A total of 12 941 diarrhea cases were included, and 0.7% (88/12 941) cases were confirmed with Yersinia enterocolitica infection. 67.0% (59/88) cases were single infection, 33.0% (29/88) cases were mixed infections. Detection rates of Y. enterocolitica increased annually (0.3%-1.2%) and were highest in children<5 years of age (1.1%, 37/3 218) and in spring (1.1%, 32/2 998) (chi2 were 18.64 and 9.76, respectively, P<0.05). 58.0% (51/88) cases had watery diarrhea, 15.9% (14/88) had fever and 14.8% (13/88) had vomiting. The predominant bioserotypes were 3/O:3 (53.4%, 47/88), followed by 1A/O:8 (15.9%, 14/88) and 1A/O:5(6.8%, 6/88), respectively. Bioserotype 3/O:3 counted for the highest proportions (89.2%, 33/37) in children <5 years of age. All the strains of bioserotype 3/O:3 harbored ail, ystA, yadA and virF genes, which encoded pathogenic Y. enterocolitica. 11/14 strain of 1A/O:8 and 4/6 strains of 1A/O:5 harbored ystB gene. Most strains were resistant to ampicillin (80.7%,71/88) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (71.6%,63/88), and 63.8% (56/88) strains were multidrug resistance (MDR). The difference of antimicrobial resistance rates between 3/O:3 and non 3/O:3 was statistically significant in ampicillin, cefoxitin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline and ampicillin/sulbactam (chi2 was 14.68, 43.80, 41.86, 30.54 and 5.07, respectively, P<0.05). Conclusion: The detection rate of Yersinia enterocolitica was higher in children than in adults in Pudong New Area, Shanghai. The predominant bioserotype was pathogenic 3/O:3 with multidrug resistance.

TI  - Antibiotic prescribing for respiratory tract infection across a national primary care network in 2019.
T2  - Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Respiratory tract infection (RTI) is the leading reason for avoidable antimicrobial use in primary care, yet provider-level feedback on its use is only available in some provinces. The aim of this study was to validate case definitions for RTI across the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) and determine baseline provider-level variability in antimicrobial prescribing in 2019.Methods: The RTI case definitions were developed using demographic, diagnostic coding and keywords in electronic medical record. Manual chart abstraction was performed to identify cases of acute otitis media. Remaining RTI definitions were validated using a random sample of 5,164 patients with encounters in 2019. The proportion of patients with an RTI treated with antibiotics was determined by provider, per patient, per episode and per patient encounter.Results: Negative predictive value, positive predictive value and prevalence were as follows: 1.00 (0.99-1.00), 0.99 (0.96-0.99) and 4.14% (4.10-4.19) for common cold; 1.00 (0.99-1.00), 0.94 (0.88-0.98) and 1.09% (1.07-1.12) for acute otitis media; 0.98 (0.96-1.00), 0.93 (0.87-0.97) and 1.2% (1.18-1.22) for acute pharyngitis; 0.99 (0.99-1.00), 0.88 (0.81-0.93) and 1.99% (1.96-2.02) for sinusitis; 0.99 (0.97-0.99), 0.95 (0.89-0.98) and 4.01% (3.97-4.05) for acute bronchitis/asthma. By provider, median (interquartile range [IQR]) proportion treated with antibiotics (per patient) was 6.72 (14.92) for common cold, 64.29 (40.00) for acute otitis media, 20.00 (38.89) for pharyngitis, 54.17 (38.09) for sinusitis, 8.33 (20.00) for acute bronchitis/asthma and 21.10 (20.56) for overall RTI.Conclusion: The CPCSSN can provide national surveillance of antimicrobial prescribing practices for RTI across primary care. Baseline variability underscores the need for provider feedback and quality improvement.

TI  - Affective-cognitive-behavioral heterogeneity of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): Emotional dysregulation as a sentinel symptom differentiating "ADHD-simplex" and "ADHD-complex" syndromes?
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Current DSM and ICD classifications of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) exclude emotional dysregulation (ED) in their diagnostic criteria, despite ED symptoms frequently co-occurring in ADHD and likely sharing common neurobiological substrates. In this study, we examined whether consideration of ED symptoms could delineate more informative "ADHD+ED " subphenotypes. Method: 4106 children with ADHD were recruited. ED and inattentive (IA) and hyperactive/impulsive (HI) symptoms were profiled using latent class analyses (LCA). The derived latent class (LC) subphenotypes were evaluated and validated in relation to comorbidity patterns, executive functions, and functional impairments. Results: Five LC subphenotypes with ED symptoms were identified: IA/HI + ED profile (LC1); HI + ED profile (LC2); IA + ED profile (LC3); IA/HI profile (LC4); and IA profile (LC5). Cross-validation of the LCA model using support vector machine analysis confirmed 83% accuracy. ED positive (ED+ve) subphenotypes were associated with higher rates of oppositional defiant disorder, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, as well as more severe autistic traits and sluggish cognitive tempo symptoms. Higher rates of ecological executive functioning im-pairments (BRIEF ratings) were found among ED+ve subphenotypes (though no differences were detected by laboratory-based measures). Functional impairments were also more severe among participants with ED+ve subphenotypes. Limitations: The data for our LCA were cross-sectional and based primarily on parent ratings. Conclusion: Our classification model has parcellated IA, HI, and ED symptoms into novel informative sub-phenotypes. These classifications provide preliminary evidence that ED symptoms could serve as sentinel features to identify a potential "ADHD-complex " syndrome, which demarcates a more pervasive condition of greater severity, complexity, and impairment.

TI  - Using an object-based machine learning ensemble approach to upscale evapotranspiration measured from eddy covariance towers in a subtropical wetland
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate prediction of evapotranspiration (ET) in wetlands is critical for understanding the coupling effects of water, carbon, and energy cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. Multiple years of eddy covariance (EC) tower ET measurements at five representative wetland ecosystems in the subtropical Big Cypress National Preserve (BCNP), Florida (USA) provide a unique opportunity to assess the performance of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ET operational product MOD16A2 and upscale tower measured ET to generate local/regional wetland ET maps. We developed an object-based machine learning ensemble approach to evaluate and map wetland ET by linking tower measured ET with key predictors from MODIS products and meteorological variables. The results showed MOD16A2 had poor performance in characterizing ET patterns and was unsatisfactory for estimating ET over four wetland communities where Nash-Sutcliffe model Efficiency (NSE) was less than 0.5. In contrast, the site-specific machine learning ensemble model had a high predictive power with a NSE larger than 0.75 across all EC sites. We mapped the ET rate for two distinctive seasons and quantified the prediction diversity to identify regions easier or more challenging to estimate from model-based analyses. An integration of MODIS products and other datasets through the machine learning upscaling paradigm is a promising tool for local wetland ET mapping to guide regional water resource management.

TI  - Evolution of geodetic mass balance over the largest lake-terminating glacier in the Tibetan Plateau with a revised radar penetration depth based on multi-source high-resolution satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The southeast Tibetan Plateau has become the region with the fastest rate of mass loss within High Mountain Asia (HMA), and the mass loss from lake-terminating glaciers in the region is the most significant. However, the evolution of the mass change of lake-terminating glaciers is still unclear, and accurate penetration depth estimates of C-band and X-band radar in glacierized areas are unknown, which greatly hinders the monitoring and understanding of the glacier evolution. Hence, in this study, taking the largest lake-terminating glacier in HMA (the Yanong Glacier) as the study object, we first evaluated the X-band penetration depth using Ple ' iades and TanDEM-X data, and further combined the penetration depth difference between the C-band and X-band radar (1.14 +/- 0.14 m) to estimate the C-band penetration depth based on a newly proposed area-weighted strategy, according to surface categories. The results indicate a region-wide average penetration depth of 1.84 +/- 0.59 m and 2.98 +/- 0.61 m for the X-band and C-band radar, respectively, demonstrating either an underestimation of 60% or an overestimation of 202% for the previous C-band penetration corrections. On this basis, we determined the multi-temporal glacier mass balance for the Yanong Glacier, using KH-9, SRTM DEM, SPOT-7, and multi-orbit TanDEM-X data. The results show that the Yanong Glacier has been in a state of serious mass loss (at a rate of -0.73 +/- 0.13 m w.e./a) during 1974-2015, and the rate of mass loss has doubled since 2000 (i.e., -0.48 +/- 0.20 (1974-2000), -0.95 +/- 0.20 (2000-2012), and - 1.02 +/- 0.53 m w.e./a (2012-2015)). Moreover, the interannual mass change has shown a highly volatile and accelerating trend during 2012-2015 (i.e., -0.47 +/- 0.85 (2011-2012), -0.87 +/- 0.66 (2012-2013), -1.26 +/- 0.72 (2013-2014), and - 1.58 +/- 0.44 m w.e./a (2014-2015)). By further analyzing the ERA5 reanalysis data and the changes in the proglacial lake and glacier dynamics, we can conclude that, qualitatively: 1) the long-term acceleration of mass loss at the Yanong Glacier has mainly been controlled by climate change, but has also been affected by the glacier dynamics to a limited extent; and 2) the inter-annual acceleration of mass loss has, to some extent, been affected by subglacial/englacial melting. The findings of this study will not only provide an accurate penetration depth correction for future relevant studies, but will also significantly improve the understanding of the evolution of lake-terminating glaciers in HMA and other high mountain areas of the world.

TI  - Assessment of drought conditions over Iraqi transboundary rivers using FLDAS and satellite datasets
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: Middle East. Study focus: Droughts are a major natural disaster in almost every region of the world, causing negative impacts on natural resources and water basin management. However, it is challenging to study drought mechanisms in transboundary rivers where hydrometeorological observations are often not available or limited due to administrative issues. This study aims to assess drought conditions at three Iraqi transboundary river basins - (a) Mosul River Basin (between Iraq and Turkey), (b) Qadisiyah River Basin (between Iraq, Syria and Turkey), and (c) Dukan River Basin (between Iraq and Iran). The Famine Early Warning Systems Network Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS) and satellite datasets have been used to calculate various drought indices and reservoir areas for the study period between 1987 and 2019. New hydrological insights for the regions: We exhibited the usefulness of FLDAS and satellite datasets in analyzing the variations and trends in hydro-meteorological variables and reservoirs surface areas over three transboundary river basins. Results exposed a significant drought exacerbation over the study regions during the periods of 1989-1991, 2000-2003, 2007-2012, and 2015-2018. Based on our analysis on drought duration and severity for inside-and outside-Iraq, we suggest the long-term meteorological drought indices (12-,24-month timescales) in monitoring drought conditions. Our results could be beneficial for water and natural resources managers in understanding spatial variability and impact of droughts.

TI  - Assessing the spatiotemporal changes, associated carbon stock, and potential emissions of mangroves in Bahrain using GIS and remote sensing data
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The gray mangrove (Avicennia marina (Forssk) Vierh) constructs one of Bahrain's most critical ecosystem, severly deteriorating, which has been severely deteriorated by increasing anthropogenic pressures. This study aimed to assess the spatiotemporal changes in the mangrove habitat around Tubli Bay, Kingdom of Bahrain, over the last 50 years through achieving the following: (1) detect the progressive reduction in the mangrove cover using Geographic Information Science and Systems (GISs) techniques and remote sensing data, (2) estimate the changes of above-below ground (AGB-BGB) carbon sequestered in the mangroves using a GIS-based spatial analysis approach, and (3) estimate the potential carbon emission changes from the loss of original mangrove habitats. Various GIS and remotely sensed data were employed in the study, including high-resolution satellite images from Worldview-3, Worldview-2, IKONOS, and QuickBird, coupled with true-color orthorectified aerial photographs. Additional data was acquired from fieldwork and the ancillary GIS maps. Image processing of the satellite data was conducted using ENVI 5.5 Software. ArcGIS 10.8 was used for digitizing the mangrove areas in all satellite imagery. The final maps were used to calculate mangrove area changes and carbon loss due to land reclamation activities. Our results indicated that Bahrain lost more than 95% of the natural mangrove cover from 1967 to 2020. The mangrove extent area's net loss reached 280 ha during 1967-2020, as it declined from 328 ha in 1967 to 48 ha in 2020. The primary cause of the decline was land reclamation associated with urban development. The rates and causes of the loss varied both spatially and temporally. Due to land clearing, the total carbon stored in the mangrove habitats declined from 34,932.2 Mg C ha(-1) in 1967 to 5112 Mg C ha(-1) in 2020. Consequently, the potential carbon Sequestration decreased from 128,200.44 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) in 1967 to 18,761.04 Mg CO2e ha(-1) in 2020. Our study urges for more efficient conservation of the remaining mangroves in Bahrain to sustain their valuable ecosystem services particularly carbon sequestration. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Facility-Level Variation of Low-Value Breast Cancer Treatments in Older Women with Early-Stage Breast Cancer: Analysis of a Statewide Claims Registry
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Since 2004, national guidelines have supported the omission of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and radiotherapy for women >= 70 years of age with early-stage, hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, but many women continue to receive at least one of these services. Provider- and patient-level factors may contribute to persistent utilization, but the role of facility-level factors is unknown. We aimed to determine facility-level variation of SLNB and adjuvant radiotherapy utilization in older women with early-stage, HR+ breast cancer undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Additionally, we aimed to explore factors associated with SLNB and radiotherapy utilization and the intra-facility correlation in their utilization. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a statewide registry of claims data. We included women >= 70 years of age diagnosed with breast cancer who underwent BCS from 2012 to 2019 at 80 hospitals in the Michigan Value Collaborative. The main outcome was inter-facility rates and variation of SLNB and radiotherapy, as well as intra-facility correlation in their utilization. Results The cohort included 7253 women (median age 77 years). Only 20% (n = 1440) underwent BCS alone, whereas 71% (n = 5122) underwent SLNB and 52% (n = 3793) received radiotherapy. Inter-facility rates of SLNB ranged from 35 to 82% (median 70%), and radiotherapy ranged from 19 to 72% (median 49%). SLNB and radiotherapy were positively correlated (r = 0.27, p = 0.016). Conclusions SLNB and radiotherapy rates remain high with significant variation in utilization at the facility level. High utilizers of SLNB are likely to be high utilizers of radiotherapy, suggesting the opportunity for strategic targeting of these facilities and their clinicians.

TI  - Preoperative axillary nodal staging of invasive lobular breast cancer with ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration in patients with suspicious ultrasound findings versus aspiration in all patients - A retrospective single institutional analysis
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: - At present, surgical strategies for breast cancer patients with >2 lymph nodes (LN) involved differ from those with no or lower degree of nodal involvement. Preoperative assessment of the axilla is less sensitive in patients with lobular carcinoma (ILC) than patients with other histological tumour types.Materials and methods: - A retrospective analysis of axillary staging by palpation, axillary ultrasound (AXUS) and AXUS-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of 153 patients with ILC diagnosed and operated on between January 2013 and December 2020 was performed. Patients had either sentinel node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection according to current practice. In period 1, patients had FNAC only when AXUS suggested nodal involvement (n = 106), and in period 2, all ILC patients had axillary FNAC (n = 47).Results: - Of the factors associated with >2LNs involvement, logistic regression suggested only AXUS/FNAC based staging as independent variable for all patients. Patients with AXUS-guided FNAC had a significantly higher proportion of true negative and lower proportion of true positive cases in the P2 period (0 vs 55% and 72% vs 11% for >2 LNs involvement, respectively; both p < 0.0001).Conclusions: - AXUS-guided FNAC of all ILC patients did not result in improved preoperative identifi-cation of patients with >2 metastatic LNs but increased the false-negative rate of the assessment by producing false-negative results in patients who would not have undergone a biopsy due to negative AXUS findings.

TI  - Regional and urban heat island studies in megacities: A systematic analysis of research methodology
T2  - INDOOR AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The paper provides a systematic review of satellite-based regional and urban heat island (RHI and UHI) studies in cities and their challenges, from 2010 to the present based on visualizing scientific landscapes (VOS) viewer analysis and Scopus and science database search using a set of standard criteria. The review results show that 52.17% of the studies used Landsat images followed by MODIS (36.65%). Based on VOS viewer analysis author keywords, remote sensing was strongly linked to urban heat island, urban greenspace, and improvise surface, respectively. Regarding, Co-authorship network China, Canada and the United kingdom's authors actively collaborated with different world researchers. The most frequently studied regions and periods of research are China and summer daytime, respectively. A total of 55% of the articles reported the use of a mono-window algorithm for retrieving LST from sensors. On the other hand, remotely sensed UHI studies have been facing a series of challenges, including differences between remote sensing satellite-derived LST and air temperature, impacts of clouds and other factors on LST data, methods to quantify UHI, accuracy assessment and attribution of RHI and UHI. Thus, consideration was given to the understudied cities, the methods to compute RHI and/or UHI intensity, inter-annual variability and modeling in the future.

TI  - The interrelated impacts of credit access, market access and forest proximity on livelihood strategies in Cambodia
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Livelihood diversification strategies in developing countries are influenced by access to financial credit, to markets and to forests. Understanding their interrelated impacts has important implications for develop-ment policy, for market access, credit provision, and forest conservation. Using a survey of 2,417 house-holds in 64 villages in four Provinces in Cambodia and satellite data on forest extent, we test hypotheses and quantify the relative contributions and first-order interactions effects of market and road access, for -est access, and formal and informal financial credit access on household expenditures and livelihood incomes. We test hypotheses about their statistical interactions, their relative contributions to incomes, and how their effects differ within and outside the Mekong River floodplain. Market and road access are significant with gross income and expenditures, as well as portfolio shifts to off-farm business activities. Forest access contributes significantly to gross income and expenditures. Credit utilization is significant with gross income, expenditures, off-farm business, and livestock activities. Households below the pov-erty line use financial credit primarily for consumption and agricultural investments, but above the pov-erty line for business investment and purchasing assets. Market access and financial credit are more important for incomes in the Mekong floodplain area, while forest access is more important outside it. Using dominance analysis, we find that financial credit contributes more than market or forest access to gross income, expenditures, and livestock income. However, market access is more important than credit for off-farm, on-farm and crop incomes, and forest access contributes more to gross income than formal credit access. We also test for first-order interactions between these effects and find they are sta-tistically significant, confirming a synergistic interaction between credit, market and forest access. Market access improves the impact of credit use, as credit use improves gross and off-farm incomes with improved access to large cities, and improves livestock incomes with improved road access. Forests and roads act synergistically to improve household incomes in areas with good city market access, as forest access contributes more to gross income, expenditures and off-farm incomes in areas with good primary road access, and to on-farm incomes in areas with good secondary road access. Our findings show that market, road, credit and forest effects are interconnected and interdependent, but support each other, and significant interaction effects between forest and market access suggest that policies for poverty reduction and forest conservation should be coordinated with the development of roads to improve potential forest returns.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Fluorescence-guided surgery in colorectal cancer; A review on clinical results and future perspectives
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Colorectal cancer is the fourth most diagnosed malignancy worldwide and surgery is one of the cornerstones of the treatment strategy. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging is a new and upcoming technique, which uses an NIR fluorescent agent combined with a specialised camera that can detect light in the NIR range. It aims for more precise surgery with improved oncological outcomes and a reduction in complications by improving discrimination between different structures.Methods: A systematic search was conducted in the Embase, Medline and Cochrane databases with search terms corresponding to 'fluorescence-guided surgery', 'colorectal surgery', and 'colorectal cancer' to identify all relevant trials.Results: The following clinical applications of fluorescence guided surgery for colorectal cancer were identified and discussed: (1) tumour imaging, (2) sentinel lymph node imaging, (3) imaging of distant metastases, (4) imaging of vital structures, (5) imaging of perfusion. Both experimental and FDA/EMA approved fluorescent agents are debated. Furthermore, promising future modalities are discussed.Conclusion: Fluorescence-guided surgery for colorectal cancer is a rapidly evolving field. The first studies show additional value of this technique regarding change in surgical management. Future trials should focus on patient related outcomes such as complication rates, disease free survival, and overall survival. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Importance of the forest state in estimating biomass losses from tropical forests: combining dynamic forest models and remote sensing
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbances, such as extreme weather events, fires, floods, and biotic agents, can have strong impacts on the dynamics and structures of tropical forests. In the future, the intensity of disturbances will likely further increase, which may have more serious consequences for tropical forests than those we have already observed. Thus, quantifying above-ground biomass loss of forest stands due to stem mortality (hereafter biomass loss rate) is important for the estimation of the role of tropical forests in the global carbon cycle. So far, the long-term impacts of altered stem mortality on rates of biomass loss have not been adequately described.This study aims to analyse the consequences of long-term elevated stem mortality rates on forest dynamics and biomass loss rate. We applied an individual-based forest model and investigated the impacts of permanently increased stem mortality rates on the growth dynamics of humid, terra firme forests in French Guiana. Here, we focused on biomass, leaf area index (LAI), forest height, productivity, forest age, quadratic mean stem diameter, and biomass loss rate. Based on the simulation data, we developed a multiple linear regression model to estimate biomass loss rates of forests in different successional states from the various forest attributes.The findings of our simulation study indicated that increased stem mortality altered the succession patterns of forests in favour of fast-growing species, which increased the old-growth forests' gross primary production, though net primary production remained stable. The stem mortality rate had a strong influence on the functional species composition and tree size distribution, which led to lower values in LAI, biomass, and forest height at the ecosystem level. We observed a strong influence of a change in stem mortality on biomass loss rate. Assuming a doubling of stem mortality rate, the biomass loss rate increased from 3.2 % yr(-1) to 4.5 % yr(-1) at equilibrium. We also obtained a multidimensional relationship that allowed for the estimation of biomass loss rates from forest height and LAI. Via an example, we applied this relationship to remote sensing data on LAI and forest height to map biomass loss rates for French Guiana. We estimated a countrywide mean biomass loss rate of 3.0 % yr(-1).The approach described here provides a novel methodology for quantifying biomass loss rates, taking the successional state of tropical forests into account. Quantifying biomass loss rates may help to reduce uncertainties in the analysis of the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Variations in glacier coverage in the Himalayas based on optical satellite data over the past 25 years
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the large area covered by glaciers, their extent and importance demands continuous assessment of the glaciers. In this study, we analysed the distribution and changes in glacier coverage throughout the Himalayas from 1990 to 2015. The results showed that 12,211 glaciers were identified in the whole mountain range, covering an area of 23229.27 km2 in 1990. Over the past 25 years, the glacier area decreased by 10.99% (2553.10 km(2)) with an accelerated shrinkage in the period 2010-2015. There was a normal distribution between glacial area and elevation with maximum glacier area between 5400-5600 m. The glacier area decreased at all elevations, and the highest absolute ice loss occurred in 5200-5400 m. The total area of debris-free glaciers was larger than debris-covered glaciers, and in consequence, the annual shrinking rate was three times higher (15.56% versus 5.22%). The features of these two types of glaciers suggest moraine can inhibit glacial ablation. The debris over Himalayas is mainly distributed in gentle zones where elevations are in the range of 4400-5200 m. The ice coverage of the temperate glaciers is larger than that of continental glaciers with greater area loss but lower shrinkage rate (9.84%.versus 13.73%) in 1990-2015. These findings provide detailed glacier inventory data for the entire Himalayan region and updated information for the study of glaciers on a large scale.

T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are among the least researched sectors of American higher education. This article addresses a portion of this knowledge deficit by focusing on the determinants of the full-time equivalent enrollments of 50 HBCUs between fiscal year FY 2005 and FY 2018 and then comparing them to a broad sample of 182 non-HBCUs. The most noteworthy specific results generated by our analyses are: (1) increased recruitment of white students by HBCUs may not hold the key to HBCU enrollment success; (2) the incomes of the households from which students emanate have a major positive influence on HBCU enrollments; (3) HBCU campuses whose resource allocations pay more attention to the instruction and student services have higher enrollments; (4) intercollegiate athletic expenditures in general and the operation of an Football Championship Subdivision (FBS)-level football program, in particular, are massively important determinants of HBCU enrollments; and (5) the predicted FY full-time equivalent enrollment (FTE) of an HBCU is less than one-half of what would hold true for a comparably situated non-HBCU.

AB  - BackgroundDue to the subsequent complications of pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients with early-stage cervical cancer, the sentinel lymph node (SLN) technique has been increasingly employed. This study aimed to investigate the detectability of SLN using methylene blue and explore the diagnostic accuracy of SLN biopsy.MethodologyA study was conducted from September 2015 to August 2018 and included 90 women with cervical cancer, FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics-2009) stage IA1-IIA1. Methylene blue was injected intracervically. Any detected dyed nodes were sent for frozen section biopsy, followed by bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. The predictive ability of SW was evaluated in statistical terms after comparison of intraoperative biopsy and final histopathology.ResultsThe sensitivity, specificity, false-negative rate, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value (NPV) were 55.6%, 95.1%, 4.9%, 55.6%, and 95.1%, respectively. The SLN performance in patients with tumor size <= 2.2 cm, negative lymphovascular space involvement, and depth of stromal invasion 45 mm was superior (sensitivity 100%, specificity 93.5%, NPV 100%).ConclusionsThe SLN technique with blue dye alone is a feasible and adequate alternative to systematic lymphadenectomy in early-stage cervical cancer in selected patients, given that a strict algorithm is applied.

TI  - Impact of dust radiation effect on simulations of temperature and wind - A case study in Taklimakan Desert
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust significantly influences the radiation budget by absorbing and scattering solar radiation, changing the heating/cooling rates, and reducing radiation incoming to change the atmospheric thermal and dynamics conditions, this subsequently affects the accuracy of weather forecasting itself. However, the currently operational numerical models for weather prediction systems rarely consider dust aerosol's impact. Two sets of experiments based on the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) were conducted in this study to simulate a heavy dust storm (6-9 June 2020) over Taklimakan Desert while considering the radiative effects of dust (called DUST) and ignoring them (NoDUST). The simulations were associated with in-situ measurements and MODIS aerosol optical to evaluate the dust effect. The results show that the overestimation of SW radiation reduced significantly in DUST compared with NoDUST, dust-induced radiative forcing had a net warming effect on the atmosphere (47.8 W/m(2)) and a cooling effect on the surface (-62.6 W/m(2)). The surface radiation budget also improved in DUST, which accompanied the considerable reduction in SW radiation in the sensible heat flux to 57 W/m(2), which was better agree with measurements. The interactions of dust radiation significantly adjusted the stability of the boundary layer and lowered its height. Further, the verification indicated that the warm biases in the 2 m temperature and the overestimation of wind speed reduced by 20.6% and 6.6%, respectively. The atmospheric temperature and wind speed in vertical dimension layers were verified by radio-sounding, indicating that the dust radiation effect helped to alleviate forecasting bias. Thus, the effect of dust radiation should be considered in the operational weather forecasting system to improve forecasting ac-curacy, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas dust-affected.

TI  - Mapping snow cover in forests using optical remote sensing, machine learning and time-lapse photography
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate spatial information of snow cover is useful for understanding the impact of global warming, and it is of high significance for hydrological disaster prediction, water resources management, and climate change research. The Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) based approach has been used extensively around the world for mapping snow, and they displayed high accuracy in open areas. However, capturing snow cover in forests remains problematic due to the obstruction effects of the forest canopy, which causes the snow cover area to be seriously underestimated. In this paper, we present a new algorithm based on machine learning (ML) technology to improve the accuracy of binary snow cover (BSC) mapping in forests, using the remotely sensed surface reflectance and ground truth data. A time-lapse photography network with a two-hour resolution was established in the eastern Qilian Mountains in northwestern China to obtain the ground truth data both in forests and open areas. We trained Random Forests (RF) with the 500-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data from bands 1-7 to generate BSC results (RF-BSC). Then we evaluated RF-BSC and the NDSI-derived BSC maps with three different NDSI thresholds (i.e., 0.10, 0.29, and 0.40) against ground truth data. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm has a high performance in forest BSC mapping in this area, compared to the NDSI-threshold approach. The RF-BSC can retrieve 67% of all real forest snow pixels, while the NDSI-based BSC can only detect 8-14%. We also find that the performance of the algorithm seems to be sensitive to changes in solar illumination conditions and forest coverage. This study suggests that machine learning with the fusion of optical remote sensing and ground-based observations is an effective approach for improving the accuracy of forest snow cover mapping at regional scales.

M3  - Article
AB  - To assess the quality and performance of ALOS World3D-30m (AW3D30-30m) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) on the Nigerian terrain, this study evaluates the accuracy of three versions of AW3D30 - the average (v1.1AVE) and median (v1.1MED) products of version 1.1, and version 2.1 (v2.1). Tested against highly accurate Ground Control Points in Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Nigeria, emerging results showed that v1.1MED had the highest accuracy over Lagos (RMSE: 4.38 m; SD: 4.13 m) while v1.1AVE had the highest accuracy over FCT (RMSE: 9.10 m; SD: 9.01 m). However, at a terrain level of 0-200 m in FCT which has some level of correspondence with the height level of Lagos, the accuracy of all three versions surpassed accuracy values obtained in Lagos, with the highest accuracy observed in version 2.1. Although v2.1 is more recent, it did not show an overarching superiority over the previous versions in terms of accuracy at both locations.

TI  - Drivers of Biomass and Biodiversity of Non-Chemosynthetic Benthic Fauna of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the North Atlantic
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine the main drivers that may elevate biomass and biodiversity of non-chemosynthetic benthic megafauna of the lower bathyal (800-3500m depth) of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the North Atlantic Ocean (MAR). Specifically: 1. Primary production in surface waters (10 degrees-48 degrees N) from remote sensing data 2002-2020 over the MAR was not significantly different from abyssal regions to the east and west. We reject the hypothesis that presence of a mid ocean ridge may enhance surface primary production. 2. The quantity of particulate organic matter reaching the sea floor was estimated as a proportion of surface export production scaled by bathymetry. Flux was 1.3 to 3.0 times greater on the MAR as a function of shorter vertical transport distance from the surface than on adjacent abyssal regions. 3. Depth variation effect on species richness. Demersal fishes living between 41 degrees and 60 degrees N showed a maximum of species richness at 2000 m depth and linear increase in regional (Gamma) diversity of 32 species per 1,000 m elevation of the MAR above the abyss. Elevated topography provides niches for species that cannot otherwise survive. 4. Substrate heterogeneity. The MAR >95% covered with soft sediment with frequent hard rocky patches spaced at a mean nearest neighbour distance of <500 m. Over 90% were <1 km apart. Animals are readily able to disperse between such patches increasing biodiversity through the additive effect of soft and hard substrate fauna on the MAR. 5. Presence of a biogeographic overlap zone. The MAR harbours bathyal species known from Western Atlantic and Eastern Atlantic continental slopes with meridional asymmetry resulting in bias toward predominance of Eastern species. The mix of species contributes to increased diversity to the east of the MAR. Multiple factors support increase in biomass and biodiversity on the MAR. Biological data are almost entirely absent from 12 degrees to 33 degrees N, the part of the MAR which may be mined for polymetallic sulphide ore deposits. This study enables some predictions of biomass and biodiversity but there is urgent need for intensive biological sampling across the MAR throughout the proposed mining areas south of the Azores.

TI  - Towards evaluating gully erosion volume and erosion rates in the Chambal badlands, Central India
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution multi-temporal digital elevation model (DEM) are key to accurate mapping of gully erosion volume change studies. Owing to the lack of multi-temporal DEM at a high spatial resolution, gully development rate, and gully erosion-fill volume change estimates in the Indian badlands are poorly studied. Our study explored the use of multi-temporal TerraSAR-X add-on for digital elevation measurement (TanDEM-X) derived elevation models to quantify the erosion volume and gully susceptibility mapping in the Chambal badlands, Central India. The average volume of gully erosion based on the DEM subtraction method in the study area was found to be 135 x 10(5) m(3), and the estimated annual rate of soil erosion was similar to 284 t hr(-1) yr(-1). Using machine learning models, we trained these data for gully erosion susceptibilities and volume prediction for a larger study region; and validated the results with independent samples. The accuracy of the model in terms of area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) values has reached 0.85 for training and 0.87 for validation, indicating satisfactory model performance. After validation, the best fit model was implemented onto a testing site (no multi-temporal DEM available) in order to predict erosion zones and erosion volume estimation. The model predicted that about 40% of the area is highly affected by gully erosion, with the maximum gullying process in the north-Central and lowest in the southwest parts of the testing area. The research framework presented in this study can be useful in estimating the erosion rate in the badlands of the Chambal Valley and can be used effectively in ravine reclamation projects.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evolution and driving mechanisms of vegetation in the Yellow River Basin, China during 2000-2020
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the spatiotemporal evolution and driving mechanisms of vegetation in the Yellow River Basin, as well as to promote regional ecological construction, we used MODIS NDVI data as the vegetation growth indicator, and the methods of Theil-Sen slope statistics, Mann-Kendall, GeoDetector, correlation analysis, and residual trend analysis. The results show that the spatial distribution of NDVI grows stepwise from northwest to southeast, leached soil with high organic matter content and weak water erosion can make vegetation grow better. The growing season average NDVI is a fluctuating upward trend of 0.005/a during 2000-2020, areas with obviously improved vegetation mainly distributed in the Qinling Mountains, the Northern Shaanxi Plateau, and the Lvliang Mountains in the basin. The partial correlation coefficients of NDVI with precipitation and temperature are 0.57 and 0.53, respectively, and the impact of precipitation on vegetation is higher than temperature. The areas where human activities increase vegetation rapidly are mainly distributed in the northern Shaanxi Plateau, the Lvliang Mountains, and southern Ningxia. The areas where human activities decrease vegetation growth are mainly distributed in cities with strong human activities such as Yinchuan, Baotou, Xi'an, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, and Taiyuan. Human activities and climate change contribute 66% and 34% of the vegetation change respectively in the YRB.

TI  - Niche separation between two dominant crustacean predators in European estuarine soft-bottom habitats
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Epibenthic predators in estuarine shallow soft-bottom environments are generally considered to have broad ecological niches with a wide overlap. This allows them to cope with abundant but highly variable prey communities. The assessment of trophic relationships in shallow soft-bottom habitats is, however, challenging and often complicated by the bias and low resolution of the analytical tools available to study diet in relatively small invertebrates. This study investigates niche overlap between two dominant epibenthic predators in European estuarine soft-bottom environments, the brown shrimp (Crangon crangon L.) and the European green crab (Carcinus maenas L.), by means of trophic DNA-metabarcoding with universal primers for cytochrome c oxidase I (COI). Results show differences in diet composition between the two predators, despite the fact that both species are opportunistic generalists with a high overlap in prey items (218 overlapping Molecular Taxonomic Units). The European green crab showed a richer, more even, and more geographically consistent diet than the brown shrimp, with fairly balanced consumption of algal, arthropod, annelid and mollusc food items. The brown shrimp instead preferred arthropods and annelids, and showed more spatial variation in diet. The observed niche separation could be linked to behavioural variation between the two predators, with European green crab showing more active movements over shallow soft-bottom environments compared to the brown shrimp, which regularly stays buried in the sediment, ambushing its prey. An accurate understanding of the trophic ecology of these estuarine crustaceans is important to capitalise on their role as sentinel organisms since their diet reflects local diversity and can result in toxin bioaccumulation. This study provides new insights in the predator-prey relationships and food web dynamics in European estuaries and highlights the importance of trophic DNAmetabarcoding to study marine food webs.

TI  - Sentinel-5P TROPOMI NO<sub>2</sub> retrieval: impact of version v2.2 improvements and comparisons with OMI and ground-based data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of the main data products measured by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite, which combines a high signal-to-noise ratio with daily global coverage and high spatial resolution. TROPOMI provides a valuable source of information to monitor emissions from local sources such as power plants, industry, cities, traffic and ships, and variability of these sources in time. Validation exercises of NO2 v1.2-v1.3 data, however, have revealed that TROPOMI's tropospheric vertical column densities (VCDs) are too low by up to 50 % over highly polluted areas. These findings are mainly attributed to biases in the cloud pressure retrieval, the surface albedo climatology and the low resolution of the a priori profiles derived from global simulations of the TM5-MP chemistry model.This study describes improvements in the TROPOMI NO2 retrieval leading to version v2.2, operational since 1 July 2021. Compared to v1.x, the main changes are the following. (1) The NO2-v2.2 data are based on version-2 level-lb (ir)radiance spectra with improved calibration, which results in a small and fairly homogeneous increase in the NO2 slant columns of 3 % to 4 %, most of which ends up as a small increase in the stratospheric columns. (2) The cloud pressures are derived with a new version of the FRESCO cloud retrieval already introduced in NO2-v1.4, which led to a lowering of the cloud pressure, resulting in larger tropospheric NO2 columns over polluted scenes with a small but non-zero cloud coverage. (3) For cloud-free scenes a surface albedo correction is introduced based on the observed reflectance, which also leads to a general increase in the tropospheric NO2 columns over polluted scenes of order 15 %. (4) An outlier removal was implemented in the spectral fit, which increases the number of good-quality retrievals over the South Atlantic Anomaly region and over bright clouds where saturation may occur. (5) Snow/ice information is now obtained from ECMWF weather data, increasing the number of valid retrievals at high latitudes.On average the NO2-v2.2 data have tropospheric VCDs that are between 10 % and 40 % larger than the v1 .x data, depending on the level of pollution and season; the largest impact is found at mid and high latitudes in wintertime. This has brought these tropospheric NO2 closer to Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) observations. Ground-based validation shows on average an improvement of the negative bias of the stratospheric (from -6 % to -3 %), tropospheric (from -32 % to -23 %) and total (from -12 % to -5 %) columns. For individual measurement stations, however, the picture is more complex, in particular for the tropospheric and total columns.

TI  - Robust secure beamforming algorithm for intelligent reflecting surface-assisted satellite-terrestrial integrated networks
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - For intelligent reflection surface (IRS) assisted satellite-terrestrial integrated network (STIN), a robust secure beamforming method based on the imperfect channel state information (CSI) of eavesdroppers is proposed. First of all, considering that the satellite uses spot beam technology to serve the earth station, while the ground base station (BS) serves multiple ground users through multicast technology, and in the case of frequency spectrum shared between the two networks, a joint optimization problem is formulated to minimize the total transmit power of STIN while satisfying the quality of service constraints of the BS users and the achievable secrecy rate constraints of the earth station. Secondly, in order to solve this non-convex problem, the upper bound and the lower bound of the eavesdroppers' output signal-to-noise ratio under the condition of imperfect CSI are derived by employing triangle inequality together with Holder inequality. Then, a joint optimization scheme of robust BF and power control based on semi-positive definite programming and penalty function method is proposed to realize the secure and reliable transmission in STIN. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.

TI  - A stratified environmental reference system for better understanding of the relationship between remote sensing observations and ground monitoring of karst rocky desertification
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quickly and accurately monitoring karst rocky desertification via remote sensing could assist in its mitigation. Yet this is limited by high environmental heterogeneity that introduces uncertainty into satellite observations' relationships with ground-based karst rocky desertification. Influenced by variations of environmental factors, the relevance of satellite data for karst rocky desertification is questionable, especially at a large geographic scale. Here a novel stratified degradation reference system was built to describe this complex relationship. The method was applied in Guizhou-Guangxi Karst Mountainous Region, a typical karst region in China undergoing severe karst rocky desertification. A stratified procedure of elevation-based initial division and sub-division of lithology and land use was designed using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. MODIS values of surface vegetation, albedo, and temperature products were standardized by percentiles to reveal their relevance for evaluating each environmental stratification of land degradation. We found a substantial spatial variation of MODIS observations across elevation gradients and different land uses. This was corrected using our proposed reference method, wherein standardized MODIS observations show a nonlinear but clear downward trend with increasing karst rocky desertification intensities. Most areas affected by karst rocky desertification had lower MODIS values. Using the stratified environmental reference approach between MODIS observations and karst rocky desertification can enable the cost-effective screening of high-heterogeneity karst areas, to better support monitoring and identify desertification hotspots.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: The lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China.Study focus: A novel framework for analysis and evaluation of surface water changes in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River was proposed in this study, which was carried out using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. The Sentinel-1A images of dry and wet seasons in the study area during 2016 and 2020 were initially synthesized based on the median value of the backscatter coefficient. Then, water extraction results were obtained from the combination of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, digital elevation model (DEM), and mathematical morphology model according to preferred textural features.New hydrological insights for the region: Verification regions were selected to evaluate the performance of proposed framework; the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (Kappa) of the proposed method was 94.13% and 0.89, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed water extraction framework can provide a better performance when compared with state-of-the-art methods (Otsu threshold method, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms) regarding qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The mountain shadows could be eliminated and water continuity improved when the DEM and mathematical morphology model were introduced in the proposed framework. The results indicate that frequent floods and droughts occur in the study area. Additionally, this area is experiencing because of the increases in the water levels and a decline in the regulation and storage capacity of lakes.

TI  - Stand density estimation based on fractional vegetation coverage from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Given that forest stand density is an important parameter for studies of carbon, water, and energy cycles and a core indicator for forest management, it requires accurate mapping to better assess how it impacts the ecoenvironment. Unfortunately, the calculation of stand density has long relied on the identification of individual trees for small-scale fine mapping or on empirical methods for macro estimations of large areas, making it difficult to balance cost and accuracy. Thus, this work proposes a more efficient method to estimate absolute stand density (n/ha) based on the fractional vegetation coverage retrieved from remote sensing image by establishing the correlation between the large-and small-scale approaches from the perspective of the hectare scale. The study area covered by planted evergreen coniferous forests featuring Pinus tabulaeformis and Pinus sylvestris in Shaanxi province, China. Taking into account that FVC is made up of contributions from evergreen and deciduous vegetation, phenological factors were considered to minimize the influence of background deciduous vegetation in the forest. A Sentinel-2 satellite multispectral remote sensing image sensed at late November 2020 was selected to estimate stand density when the deciduous vegetation is negligible. The accuracy was verified by using WorldView-3 satellite image with high spatial resolution images. The regression relationship was established by using 22 sample plots, and the stand density was estimated with fractional vegetation coverage in other 108 sample plots. The result shows that mean absolute error and root mean square error was 41.69 n/ha and 117 n/ha for sample plots, respectively, and the relative estimation accuracy of the total number of evergreen coniferous trees in the entire study area reached 81.57%. We thus conclude that this proposed approach to estimate the absolute stand density using Sentinel-2 MSI data with spatial resolution of 10 m is a feasible way on the hectare scale.

TI  - Drawing the borders of the mesophotic zone of the Mediterranean Sea using satellite data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 30-150 m bathymetric range is commonly adopted in the literature to constrain the mesophotic zone. However, such depth interval varies depending on sunlight penetration, which is primarily a function of solar radiation incidence and water clarity. This is especially obvious in the Mediterranean Sea with its peculiar biophysical properties. Integrating information on light regime in the estimation of the bathymetric range of the mesophotic zone would provide a more robust definition, orienting conservation actions targeting its ecosystems. We present a first assessment of the spatial and vertical extension of the mesophotic zone in the Mediterranean Sea based upon light penetration, comparing our prediction with literature data. Our study also represents a baseline to monitor future variations in the bathymetric interval associated with the mesophotic zone in the Mediterranean Sea in relation to global changes.

TI  - Cultural consequences of brands? masstige: An emerging market perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in disposable income and the luxury aspirations of the middle-class have led to the introduction of a new genre of luxury, known as masstige luxury. The extant research has yet to investigate the role of acculturation - changes in an individual's thoughts and behavior that result from (in)direct exposure to culturally dissimilar individuals or groups - in shaping the masstige perception of a brand. The current study addresses this gap by examining how various acculturation patterns (i.e., integration, assimilation, separation, and marginalization) assess the mass-prestige quotient of fashion accessory brands (sunglasses). The study identifies RayBan as a masstige brand in the sunglasses category and observes that the assimilation acculturation group assigned RayBan the highest masstige score, followed by the integration, marginalization, and separation groups. Furthermore, cultural worldview is identified as the underlying mechanism for differences in the masstige scores across various acculturation groups. By explaining the cultural consequences of masstige-based brand consumption, this study contributes to the growing masstige academic literature.

TI  - Assessing the synergic effect of land use and climate change on the upper Betwa River catchment in Central India under present, past, and future climate scenarios
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - We use Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate the combined effects of land use/land cover (LU/LC) and climate change on the hydrological response of the Upper Betwa River Catchment (UBRC), a semi-arid region in Central India. We execute this model for two different time periods, 1982-2000 and 2001-2018, using the LU/LC data of 1990 and 2018, respectively. We classified the Landsat satellite images of 1990 and 2018 to obtain the dominant LU/LC classes (water body, built-up, forest, agriculture, and open land) in the catchment. The water body, built-up areas, and cropland have increased by 63%, 65%, and 3%, respectively, whereas forest cover and open land decreased by 16% and 23% in the UBRC from 1990 to 2018. The observed climate data in UBRC shows an increase in the average temperature and decrease in the total rainfall during the period between 1980 to 2018. Once the model is set up, we perform the calibration and validation by using the SWAT Calibration Uncertainty Program (SWAT-CUP). We considered two time periods (1991-1994 and 2001-2007) for the calibration and (1995-1998 and 2008-2014) for the validation. For both these time periods, the calibration and validation result of our model is satisfactory. The output of our calibrated model shows a relative decrease in rainfall (12%), surface runoff (21%), and percolation (9%) in the catchment during the period between 2001-2018 as compared to 1982-2000. Finally, we simulate the surface runoff and percolation in the UBRC using the future climate change scenario. We used the bias-corrected multi-model ensemble of CMIP6 GCMs for four different climate scenarios (2023-2100) by assuming no change in the existing LU/LC. We do this for two different time slices: one from 2023-2060 and the other from 2061-2100. For all the climate scenarios, rainfall and surface runoff in the catchment are expected to decrease by 15-40% and 50-79% as compared to the baseline period of 1982-2018. Percolation in the catchment will have a mixed response. It is expected to decrease by 18% in the middle part of the catchment and increase about 25% in the remaining parts of the catchment.

TI  - A land clearing index for high-frequency unsupervised monitoring of land development using multi-source optical remote sensing images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely information on land development is critical for preventing illegal construction, which is an increasingly serious problem in rapidly urbanizing countries. Although remote sensing has been widely used to observe land cover change, monitoring land development at a high frequency (e.g., weekly or daily) remains a challenge because of the lack of images with sufficient temporal resolution and methods independent of human supervision. This study developed a novel unsupervised method, namely, land clearing index (LCI)-based method, for monitoring land development at high frequencies. The LCI was proposed by examining the characteristics of the spectral change caused by the land clearing in the initial stage of land development. It is calculated with two images acquired at different times and can be used with an appropriate threshold to detect land development areas. Top-of-atmosphere reflectance (TOAR) data were found to be better than surface reflectance (SR) data for the use with the LCI-based method because the atmosphere effect played a positive role in distinguishing developed land from undeveloped land and suppressing the false alarms caused by the season change in vegetation. The major innovations of the LCI-based method are as follows: 1) applicable to the land development detection between images acquired by different optical sensors to allow for high-frequency detection; 2) can detect land development without training data and human supervision; 3) can detect various types of land development, such as converting farmland for building purposes, urban redevelopment, and land reclamation; and 4) simple, straightforward, and easy to implement. The LCI-based method was tested with different satellite images (Landsat-5, Landsat-7, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2) for land development detection in nine cities selected worldwide. The average detection accuracy (DA), false-alarm rate (FR), and overall accuracy (OA) were 88.62%, 1.68%, and 98.22%, respectively. Compared with the traditional post-classification comparison based on the random forest algorithm, the LCI-based method produced better results and avoided the time-consuming work on sample selection. The LCI was also tested in each of the cities to detect land development at the various time intervals (5 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year) in the different seasons (January to March, April to June, July to September, and October to December). Approximately all the DAs were higher than 90.00%, while the FRs were highly related to the detection interval and ranged from 0.00% to 71.60%. The false alarms were mainly caused by the seasonal change in croplands, natural vegetation, shadows of mountains and buildings, and suspended sediment in the water. An approach was developed to calibrate the detection results of the LCI-based method for false alarm suppression. The false alarms were reduced by as much as 99.98% by reinforcing the LCIbased method with this calibration approach. The testing indicated that the LCI-based method is applicable and reliable for monitoring land development at a short time interval; thus, it is capable of preventing illegal construction.

TI  - Assimilation of FY-3D MWTS-II Radiance with 3D Precipitation Detection and the Impacts on Typhoon Forecasts
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation detection is an essential step in radiance assimilation because the uncertainties in precipitation would affect the radiative transfer calculation and observation errors. The traditional precipitation detection method for microwave only detects clouds and precipitation horizontally, without considering the three-dimensional distribution of clouds. Extending precipitation detection from 2D to 3D is expected to bring more useful information to the data assimilation without using the all-sky approach. In this study, the 3D precipitation detection method is adopted to assimilate Microwave Temperature Sounder-2 (MWTS-II) onboard the Fengyun-3D, which can dynamically detect the channels above precipitating clouds by considering the near-real-time cloud parameters. Cycling data assimilation and forecasting experiments for Typhoons Lekima (2019) and Mitag (2019) are carried out. Compared with the control experiment, the quantity of assimilated data with the 3D precipitation detection increases by approximately 23%. The quality of the additional MWTS-II radiance data is close to the clear-sky data. The case studies show that the average root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of prognostic variables are reduced by 1.7% in the upper troposphere, leading to an average reduction of 4.53% in typhoon track forecasts. The detailed diagnoses of Typhoon Lekima (2019) further show that the additional MWTS-II radiances brought by the 3D precipitation detection facilitate portraying a more reasonable circulation situation, thus providing more precise structures. This paper preliminarily proves that 3D precipitation detection has potential added value for increasing satellite data utilization and improving typhoon forecasts.

TI  - Towards improved analysis of short mesoscale sea level signals from satellite altimetry
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Satellite altimeters routinely supply sea surface height (SSH) measurements, which are key observations for monitoring ocean dynamics. However, below a wavelength of about 70 km, along-track altimeter measurements are often characterized by a dramatic drop in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), making it very challenging to fully exploit the available altimeter observations to precisely analyze small mesoscale variations in SSH. Although various approaches have been proposed and applied to identify and filter noise from measurements, no distinct methodology has emerged for systematic application in operational products. To best address this unresolved issue, the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) actually provides simple band-pass filtered data to mitigate noise contamination of along-track SSH signals. More innovative and suitable noise filtering methods are thus left to users seeking to unveil small-scale altimeter signals. As demonstrated here, a fully data-driven approach is developed and applied successfully to provide robust estimates of noise-free sea level anomaly (SLA) signals (Quilfen, 2021). The method combines empirical mode decomposition (EMD), used to help analyze non-stationary and non-linear processes, and an adaptive noise filtering technique inspired by discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decompositions. It is found to best resolve the distribution of SLA variability in the 30-120 km mesoscale wavelength band. A practical uncertainty variable is attached to the denoised SLA estimates that accounts for errors related to the local SNR but also for uncertainties in the denoising process, which assumes that the SLA variability results in part from a stochastic process. For the available period, measurements from the Jason-3, Sentinel-3, and SARAL/AltiKa missions are processed and analyzed, and their energy spectral and seasonal distributions are characterized in the small mesoscale domain. In anticipation of the upcoming SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) mission data, the SASSA (Satellite Altimeter Short-scale Signals Analysis, https://doi.org/10.12770/1126742b-a5da-4fe2-b687-e64d585e138c, Quilfen and Piolle, 2021) data set of denoised SLA measurements for three reference altimeter missions has already been shown to yield valuable opportunities to evaluate global small mesoscale kinetic energy distributions.

TI  - Monitoring and Predicting Temporal Changes of Urmia Lake and its Basin Using Satellite Multi-Sensor Data and Deep-Learning Algorithms
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, Urmia lake and its basin, which are vital regions in the northwest of Iran, were monitored using satellite data and modeling methods. Monthly precipitation was computed using TRMM satellite dataset. Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS), evaporation, temperature, and TWS Anomaly (TWSA) were estimated from GLDAS dataset and GRACE missions. Moreover, Jason satellite altimetry series and MODIS were used to assess the lake Water Level (WL) and area variations. These seven parameters were estimated from April 2002 to June 2019. This study adopted and evaluated four deep-learning methods based on feed-forward and recurrent architectures for data modeling, and, subsequently, predicting the water area variations. According to the obtained results, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models had some malfunctions in predicting lake area, while Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) acquired results close to real variations of Urmia lake area. Taking Mean Absolute Error, Mean Relative Error, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (r) as evaluation parameters, LSTM achieved the superior quantities, 175.07 km(2), 18.87%, 231.7 km(2), and 0.83, respectively. Results also indicate that LSTM is more accurate while predicting the variation of critical situations.

TI  - Hematoxylin and eosin or double stain for CD34/SOX10: Which is better for the detection of lymphovascular invasion in cutaneous melanoma?
T2  - PATHOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is considered an unfavorable prognostic factor in cutaneous melanoma (CM). However, its detection by hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) is challenging, with discordant data about its association with clinical-pathological features and no previous studies investigating the inter-(IrOA) and intra-observer (IaOA) agreement. Herein, we tested H & E and double staining (DS) for CD34/SOX10 to detect the LVI in a cohort of 92 CMs, evaluating the IrOA, the IaOA, and the association with the other clinical-pathological features. Methods: Five authors independently evaluated 92 consecutive and retrospectively enrolled cases of CMs. We assessed the IrOA (Fleiss's Kappa/FK and intraclass correlation coefficient/ICC) and the IaOA (Cohen's Kappa/CK) with both H & E and CD34/SOX10. Furthermore, we compared the LVI assessment with the two stains and analyzed the association with other clinical-pathological features [chi(2) tests for dichotomous and categorical data; Student t-test (normal distribution) and Mann-Whitney U-test (non-normal distribution) for continuous data]. Results: The IrOA was almost identical with H & E (FK=0.446; ICC=0.805) and CD34/SOX10 (FK=0.454; ICC=0.810); by contrast, the IaOA was higher with H & E for one pathologist (CK: 0.809) and with CD34/SOX10 for the other one (CK: 0.563). Applying previously defined criteria, LVI was detected in 10 (9.2%) and 11 (10.1%) cases with H & E and CD34/SOX10, respectively (p = 1.000). Both H & E and CD34/SOX10 were significantly associated with vertical growth phase (H & E, p: 0.014; CD34/SOX10, p: 0.010), mitosis >= 1/mm2 (H & E, p: 0.000; CD34/SOX10, p: 0.004), pT (H & E, p: 0.000; CD34/SOX10, p: 0.001), Breslow thickness (H & E, p: 0.000; CD34/SOX10, p: 0.001), and lymph node and/or distant metastasis (H & E, p: 0.005; CD34/SOX10, p: 0.000); only H & E was associated with ulceration (p: 0.002) and distant metastasis (p: 0.000), conversely, only CD34/SOX10 was associated with lymph node metastasis (p: 0.003). Conclusions: CD34/SOX10 does not improve the IrOA and the IaOA of the LVI assessment in CM; furthermore, H & E and CD34/SOX10 show a similar profile of association with the other unfavorable clinical-pathological features of CM. As result, CD34/SOX10 could be a redundant diagnostic tool if applied for the prognostic characterization of not-selected CM in a routine diagnostic scenario.

TI  - Phase-Resolved Lockdown Features of Pollution Parameters Over an Urban and Adjoining Rural Region During COVID-19
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigate the temporal variations in columnar aerosol pollutants and their possible association with the simultaneously measured black carbon (BC) aerosol mass concentration and associated biomass burning (BB) over urban (Delhi) and rural (Panchgaon) sites during the lockdown phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also show the impact of lockdown measures on boundary layer ozone and its primary precursors, NO2, and water vapor (H2O), potent greenhouse gases that destroy protective ozone. For this purpose, we used multiple datasets, namely, black carbon (BC) aerosol mass concentration and biomass burning (BB) aerosols using an aethalometer at Amity University Haryana (AUH), Panchgaon, India, and satellite retrievals from NASA's MODIS and OMI at both the stations. The analysis was conducted during the pre-lockdown period (1-25 March), lockdown 1st phase (25 March-14 April), lockdown 2nd phase (15 April-3 May), lockdown 3rd phase (4-17 May), lockdown 4th phase (18-31 May), and post-lockdown (1-30 June) period in 2020. Our diagnostic analysis shows a substantial reduction in AOD (Delhi: -20% to -80%, Panchgaon: -20% to -80%) and NO2 (Delhi: -10% to -42.03%, Panchgaon -10% to -46.54%) in comparison with climatology (2010-2019) during all four phases of lockdown. The reduction in AOD is attributed to lockdown measures and less transport of dust from west Asia than climatology. Despite a reduction in NO2, there is an increase in the ozone amount (Delhi: 1% to 8% and Panchgaon: 1% to 10%) during lockdown I, II, and III phases. The observed enhancement in ozone may be resultant from the complex photochemical processes that involve the presence of NO2, CO, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and water vapor. The reduction in AOD and NO2 and enhancement in ozone are stronger at the rural site, Panchgaon than that at the urban site, Delhi.

TI  - Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI radiomics nomogram for predicting axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer
T2  - CANCER IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The goal of this study is to develop and validate a radiomics nomogram integrating the radiomics features from DCE-MRI and clinical factors for the preoperative diagnosis of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis in breast cancer patients. Procedures A total of 432 patients with breast cancer were enrolled in this retrospective study and divided into a training cohort (n = 296) and a validation cohort (n = 136). Radiomics features were extracted from the second phase of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method was used to screen optimal features and construct a radiomics signature in the training cohort. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to establish a radiomics nomogram model based on the radiomics signature and clinical factors. The predictive performance of the nomogram was quantified with respect to discrimination and calibration, which was further evaluated in the independent validation cohort. Results Fourteen ALN metastasis-related features were selected to construct the radiomics signature, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.847 and 0.805 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The nomogram was established by incorporating the histological grade, multifocality, MRI report lymph node status and radiomics signature and showed good calibration and excellent performance for ALN detection (AUC of 0.907 and 0.874 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively). The decision curve, which demonstrated the radiomics nomogram, displayed promising clinical utility. Conclusions The radiomics nomogram can be used as a noninvasive and reliable tool to assist clinicians in accurately predicting ALN metastasis in breast cancer preoperatively.

TI  - A Graphic Transformation: A Qualitative Study of Transformative Learning in Medical Trainees during COVID-19 Using Comics as Data Presentation
T2  - TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenomenon: Transformative learning is a theory in which individuals construct new or revised interpretations of the meaning of an experience. COVID-19 offers a rare opportunity to better understand how individuals respond to and make meaning within the shared context of an extraordinary event. We aimed to examine if and how residents and fellows engaged in transformative learning when caring for COVID-19 positive patients during the initial peak of the pandemic (Spring 2020). Approach: We conducted an interpretive qualitative study to identify themes pertaining to transformative learning. We used semi-structured interviews of residents and fellows who were directly or indirectly involved in the care of COVID-19 positive patients admitted to the inpatient wards or the intensive care units during the first peak of the pandemic (defined as March 11th - May 28th, 2020) at our Mid-Atlantic academic health system. We used the medium of comics to depict select interviewees' experiences during the pandemic as a novel way to represent themes from the interviews. Findings: Three main themes arose from our qualitative analysis. These included "a sense of guilt," "the impact on training," and "venues and processes for reflection." In comparing their experiences with colleagues and friends at other institutions with higher COVID-19 case volume, trainees reflected on how they felt lucky, and this led to guilt, although not necessarily transformation. The impact of COVID-19 on the training environment had transformative potential. Trainees challenged their previously held assumptions on the necessity of various surgeries, in-person visits, and physical examination maneuvers when COVID-19 posed a barrier. Finally, while trainees recalled multiple situations throughout the pandemic when they believed they were engaging in reflection, such reflection did not appear to reach so deep as to alter participants' underlying assumptions until the research interview itself, suggesting that transformation was incomplete. Insights: Our purposive sample of residents and fellows who cared for COVID-19 positive patients during the initial peak of the pandemic made meaning of their experience in multiple ways. The largest shift in worldview due to the pandemic appeared to be related to the instrumental utility of certain common medical practices or procedures. This, in turn, was the most prominent influence on how these trainees felt they would practice in the future, and translated to a shift in how they appraised evidence. However, lack of opportunity for reflection may have adversely impacted the ability for transformation to take place. Given that multiple trainees showed appreciation for the critical reflection venue that was the research interview, academic leadership should ensure similar venues exist during training, even after the pandemic ends.

TI  - Enhanced dynamic landslide hazard mapping using MT-InSAR method in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide hazard mapping is essential for disaster reduction and mitigation. The hazard map produced by the spatiotemporal probability analysis is usually static with false-negative and false-positive errors due to limited data resolution. Here we propose a new method to obtain dynamic landslide hazard maps over the Wushan section of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area by introducing the ground deformation measured by the spaceborne Copernicus Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery collected from 9/30/2016 to 9/13/2017. We first determine the spatial probability of landslide occurrence predicted by the support vector machine algorithm. We also conducted the statistical analysis on the temporal probability of landslide occurrence under various rainfall conditions (0, 0-50, 50-100, and> 100 mm for the antecedent 5-day total). We initialize a preliminary landslide hazard map by combining the spatial and temporal landslide probabilities. Meanwhile, the ground deformation velocities during the representative dry and wet seasons can be extracted from multi-temporal interferometric SAR (MT-InSAR). Thereafter, the landslide hazard map can be finalized by an empirical assessment matrix considering both the preliminary landslide hazard map and deformation velocities. Our results demonstrate that false-negative and false-positive errors in the landslide hazard map can be effectively reduced with the assistance of the deformation information. Our proposed method can be used to assess the dynamic landslide hazard at higher accuracy.

T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade or so, some substantive work on disability in Africa has been done. Nonetheless, and this is so for different reasons, the nature and substance of disability in intellectual discourses in Africa still largely remain undefined and uncategorised. In this article, I aim to contribute to the scholarship on disability by examining if and whether one can talk meaningfully of metaphysical disability and how this notion of disability is related to other forms of disability or particular incidences of disability in an African cultural worldview. This discussion and exercise I believe not only sheds light on possible metaphysical underpinnings of disabilities in Africa, but also illuminates some aspects of the nature and substance of disability on the continent.

TI  - Comparison of contrasting optical and LiDAR fire severity remote sensing methods in a heterogeneous forested landscape in south-eastern Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral indices derived from satellite optical remote sensing data have typically been used for fire severity estimation, although other remote sensing systems such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) are increasingly applied. Despite a multitude of remotely sensed fire severity estimation methods, comparisons of method performance are few. Insights into the merits and limitations of remotely sensed fire severity methods help develop appropriate spatial tools for the management of fire-affected areas. We evaluated the performance of seven passive (optical) and active (LiDAR) remotely sensed fire severity estimation methods in classifying and explaining variation in a field-estimated modified Composite Burn Index (MCBI) for a recent large wildfire in south-eastern Australia. Our evaluation included three commonly applied indices; the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), Relative dNBR (RdNBR) and Relative Burn Ratio (RBR). We compared these NBR indices against two recently proposed fire severity estimation methods that have not previously been evaluated with CBI field data - the Vegetation Structure Perpendicular Index (VSPI) spectral index and the LiDAR point cloud-derived Profile Area Change (PAC), along with experimental relativized forms of these indices (RVSPI and RPAC, respectively). The RVSPI (kappa = 0.47) demonstrated similar overall classification accuracy (N classes = 4) to the PAC (kappa = 0.48), however both indices had lower classification accuracy than the dNBR (kappa = 0.59), RdNBR (kappa = 0.59) and RBR (kappa = 0.61). The VSPI and PAC were unable to accurately represent non-structural changes caused by lower severity fire. Application of these optical and LiDAR indices should consider their discussed limitations in relation to the objectives of their application.

TI  - Eastward propagating surface salinity anomalies in the tropical North Atlantic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Upper ocean variations across the tropical Atlantic are strongly seasonal due to corresponding seasonality in surface forcing and continental runoff. This implies that many features in regional upper ocean state or transport anomalies may also be seasonally locked. In the boreal summer and autumn, remote sensing sea surface salinity (SSS) observations show the presence of eastward propagating anomalies concurrent with the seasonal development of fresh Amazon plume and acceleration of the eastward North Equatorial Countercurrent. Interannual variations in these eastward cross-Atlantic SSS signals are investigated in connection with their forcing by wind and circulation patterns. Satellite data show that these SSS anomalies are advected zonally across the entire Atlantic. It is suggested that they originate due to wind-induced changes in the Amazon plume areal extent, which are notorious in the North Brazil Current retroflection. Satellite SSS is instrumental for exploring such signals because in-situ observations do not always capture them due to the limitation in resolved spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Analysis of fine-scale dynamics of the Drygalski ice tongue in Antarctica using satellite SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focused on the analysis of the time variability of the morphology of the Drygalski ice tongue (DIT), Antarctica, using - for the first time - satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. A time series of Sentinel-1 interferometric wide swath SAR imagery collected from 2016 to 2021 is considered and an unsupervised methodology, based on a global threshold constant false alarm rate approach, is used to extract the boundary between the DIT and the surrounding ice-free/ice-infested sea water. The most prominent rifts/fractures identified on the extracted profiles and the ice front are selected to analyse the DIT time variability. The feature tracking allows deriving information on the morphological evolution of the DIT, including the annual displacement and average surface velocity. Experimental results show that the DIT ice front calls for a relatively stable motion trend towards the sea with an average surface velocity of about 670 m per year. Our outcomes show a fairly good agreement with similar studies appeared in the scientific literature, which are mostly based on optical imagery.

TI  - From God's hand to the hand of the artisan: the turned ivory sphere and the polyhedron in Qing China
T2  - STUDIES IN CHINESE RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on the mechanized worldview of eighteenth-century China as expressed in the multilayered, geometric, turned ivory spheres known as guigong qiu (magic or demon's-work ball), a name which implies that the balls were not created by human hands. Although these turned ivory spheres in China have been associated exclusively with domestic craftsmanship, records from the eighteenth century show that a German lathe used for ivory carving, along with a Contrefaitkugel (a concentric, hollow ivory ball decorated with an openwork pattern), were given as gifts to the Chinese emperor. This article explores the relationship of the Contrefaitkugel to the Chinese tradition of producing decorative and mathematical forms based on polyhedral geometry. The article also discusses the role of ornamentation in the Qing dynasty as well as the spheres' pivotal role in the evolution of a self-conscious craft ingenuity. It offers a new perspective on 'turning the globe' through the hand of the artisan, whose work was believed to mimic that of the creative deity, activating a complex analogy between human and divine production.

TI  - How to lose gracefully in an internationally selfish world: gender, the "New Jew" and the underestimation of athletic performance in interwar Palestine
T2  - JOURNAL OF MODERN JEWISH STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - During the interwar years, competitive sport become a global phenomenon, in which competitive games were organized by international bodies and professional athletes performed as (inter)national icons of health, beauty, and social success. The following article explores the nature of this transnational change in one particular place: the Jewish community of Mandate Palestine. By focusing primarily on two Zionist athletic delegations (male and female), the paper illustrates the particular way in which the Hebrew worldview positioned athletic performance within its emerging national project. Specifically, it highlights the way in which, unlike the athletes of many other societies at the time, the Hebrew athlete was not embraced as a national symbol. In incorporating the story of the Hebrew athlete's marginalization, the article advances a necessary (re)examination of "big" Zionist phrases - like "new Jew" or "Muscular Judaism" - not as mere cliches, but in their historical context, as powerful reflections through which a specific group of people perceived themselves and their bodies.

TI  - The changing landscape of general surgery in the elderly - trends over a decade in a tertiary centre in Singapore
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - An ageing population with higher rates of helping seeking behaviour and treatment utilization is a worldwide phenomenon with no exception to Singapore. As elderly patients are fast becoming an increasing large part of our surgical practice, their long term outcomes are particularly important. Objective We take stock of our local experience in a high volume tertiary centre in Singapore, Tan Tock Seng Hospital by reviewing the number of surgical procedures performed for elderly patients (65 years old and above) across a decade and reviewing their post-operative outcomes. Methods This retrospective cohort study included elderly patients (>= aged 65) who underwent surgical procedures under general anaesthesia from January 2008 to December 2019. Demographic data, nature of operation, preoperative American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) status of patients and surrogate markers of outcome including average length of stay (ALOS), 30 and 90-day mortality were retrospectively analysed. Results Across a 12-year period, we observed a nearly overall two-fold increase in the number of surgical procedures for elderly patients from 1,129 cases in 2008 to 2,118 cases in 2019. The ALOS for elderly surgical patients trended downwards from an average of 12.3 days in 2008 to 9.0 days in 2019. All cause 30-day mortality rate of elderly patients dropped from 5.8% in 2008 to 2.7% in 2019. Conclusion The landscape for general surgery in the elderly is changing in the context of advances in health care and a paradigm shift in treatment beliefs and perspectives. Ultimately, informed decision making, patient engagement and empowerment by the surgeon are keys to better outcomes and improved patient experience.

TI  - Parallel interactive delayed attention network for pansharpening
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As deep learning has gained wide attention in computer vision tasks, researchers have also started to explore the application of deep learning in panchromatic sharpening. In recent years, various convolutional neural network-based methods for panchromatic sharpening have been proposed, and these methods have achieved good results. However, shallower networks are unable to learn complex mapping relationships. Networks that are too deep are prone to overfitting, which leads to the degradation of the fusion effect. Moreover, since the convolutional operations are concentrated in local regions, it is difficult to obtain the association information with other regions even in deep networks. Therefore, more accurate feature selection and representation with limited network depth is needed. In this paper, a parallel interactive delayed attention network for panchromatic sharpening (PIDAN) is proposed. The network consists of multiple resolution subnetworks with parallel inputs to improve the representation of high-resolution feature maps by multiscale low-resolution features of the same depth and similar level. In addition, we propose a delayed channel attention module. This module obtains correlations between low-frequency and high-frequency information through adaptive learning, making the network more flexible in processing different types of information. The depth feature reweighting restriction combined with the residual unit can further avoid the overfitting representation of features as the network deepens. Experimental results on Gaofen-2 and WorldView-2 datasets show that the proposed method is competitive in both quality assessment and visual perception.

TI  - A large-region fog detection algorithm at dawn and dusk for high-frequency Himawari-8 satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing provides effective methods for fog detection at large scales. At dawn or dusk, however, the separation of fog from the surface remains a great challenge because of the minor radiation difference between fog and the surface. This study develops a novel algorithm for fog detection suitable for dawn and dusk from high-frequency data of the Himawari-8 satellite. Methodologically, the area was divided into three subregions according to the distance of the terminator line. In regions at daytime that are far from the terminator line, a fog detection index of the low solar altitude angle (FDI (LSAA)) was built to isolate the fog through the relationship between the mid-infrared (MIR) brightness temperature (I ( MIR )) and its difference with the thermal infrared (TIR) brightness temperature (BTD = I ( MIR ) - I ( TIR ), where I ( MIR ) and I ( TIR ) are the brightness temperatures at the MIR and TIR bands). In regions near the terminator line, the fog was extracted from the surface by a Gaussian mixture model (FD-GMM (NTL)) by the differences in MIR and TIR radiation changes. After that, the fog was further extracted from the low and mid-high clouds by the enhanced low cloud detection index (ELCDI) and by the difference in BTD and TIR characteristics. In regions at night, a BTD threshold value was adopted to detect fog. Validation results demonstrated that the algorithm in this study could precisely detect large-region radiation fog including dawn and dusk, with the overall probability of detection (POD) accuracies range from 76.3% to 89.2% at dawn and 67.3% to 77.0% at dusk. The relatively low accuracy at dusk was mainly attributed to desert in the study area, which has a similar BTD with fog after a day of solar radiation. Results of this study provide new insight for fog detection at dawn and dusk, which enhances the application of remote sensing in meteorology forecasting.

TI  - Dramaturgy of Extinction: Sentient Landscapes, Spectral Bodies, and Unthought Worlds in Kris Verdonck's <i>Conversations (at the end of the world)</i> and <i>SOMETHING (out of nothing)</i>
T2  - CONTEMPORARY THEATRE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the challenges posed by the Anthropocene, perhaps none has been more central than redefining 'the human' that this epoch seems to name. It is no secret that the European liberal subject has been the directing force of the Anthropocene and the model from which a global humanity, and its globalising technology, has been envisioned. This essay begins by bringing together a diversity interdisciplinary and cross-cultural perspectives to ask: does the Anthropocene mark the realisation of this homogenous human subject, or its end? Extinction seems constitutive of a climate narrative dominated by a Euro-American imaginary, wherein a fixation on endings suggests the anxieties - and the possibilities - of that imaginary coming to an end as a globalising worldview. Two recent performances by Kris Verdonck / A Two Dogs Company, Conversations (at the end of the world) (2017) and SOMETHING (out of nothing) (2019), imagine extinction through scenarios depicting human figures displaced and overtaken by sentient landscapes. Composed of synthetic materials and activated by bio-technical forces, these landscapes scale down a computational planet, embodying an accumulated history of technological progress and human interventions in environments. Extinction, in these works, is not the end, however, but rather the slow dying out of a singular idea of the human subject, if not its singular narrative of technological progress

TI  - The relationship between land use land cover and land surface temperature using remote sensing: systematic reviews of studies globally over the past 5 years
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The land surface temperature (LST) has been increased worldwide from time to time with the rapid increase of impervious surfaces such as built-up areas, parking lots, and asphalt and concrete roads. Several studies have examined the impacts of spatial dynamics of land use land cover (LULC) on the spatial variability of LST. However, there have not been systematic reviews conducted about the relationship between LULC and LST. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the relationship between LULC and LST with the main objective of synthesizing the relationship between LULC and LST using remote sensing data. An extensive literature search was conducted from the most familiar electronic databases such as Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar between 27/08/2021 and 28/08/2021. The studies that are focussed on the relationship between LULC and LST and/or the impacts of LULC change on the LST using remote sensing were included for the analysis. Besides, papers conducted over the last 5 years (January/2016 to August/2021) were selected in this systematic study since this study focused on the most recent studies. In this systematic review, 100 studies were included for the study analysis. Based on the analysis of this study, built-up land has the first highest LST from the thirteen LULC types. Besides, bare land has a higher LST next to built-up land. On the other side, snow cover has the lowest LST among the LULC types. Lastly, waterbodies have a lower LST compared to vegetation cover.

AB  - Rice is the most important food crop in China, which is of great significance to the country's food security and regional stability. Therefore, it is very important to accurately monitor the paddy rice planting area and its changes. In this study, an adaptive-stacking method based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) was proposed to identify paddy rice using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 remote sensing data. The classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient are 88.53% and 0.85, respectively. Moreover, the user accuracy and producer accuracy of paddy rice reached 86.58% and 86.92%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the superiority of the strategy that integrates multi-temporal optical and SAR data, and the potential of using adaptive-Stacking algorithm based on the GEE for paddy classification.

TI  - Ship detection based on medium-low resolution remote sensing data and super-resolved feature representation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing methods enhance medium-low resolution remote sensing ship detection by feeding super-resolved images to the detectors. Although these methods marginally improve the detection accuracy, the correlation between image super-resolution (SR) and ship detection is under-exploited. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective ship detection method called ShipSR-Det, in which both the output image and the intermediate features of the SR module are fed to the detection module. Using the super-resolved feature representation, the potential benefit introduced by image SR can be fully used for ship detection. We apply our method to the SSD and Faster-RCNN detectors and develop ShipSR-SSD and ShipSR-Faster-RCNN, respectively. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness and generality of our method. Moreover, we compare ShipSR-Faster-RCNN with several state-of-the-art ship detection methods. Comparative results on the HRSC2016, DOTA and NWPU VHR-10 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.

TI  - A joint learning Im-BiLSTM model for incomplete time-series Sentinel-2A data imputation and crop classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal deep learning approaches can make full use of crop growth patterns and phenological characteristics, resulting in excellent crop classification performance in large areas. However, obtaining complete time series remote sensing images during the growing season is challenging due to cloud contamination. Hence, given time-series multispectral data, it is important to impute missing data and accurately classify crops. A novel Imputation-BiLSTM model (Im-BiLSTM) was developed based on Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory network (BiLSTM) to jointly perform missing data imputation and crop classification. The Im-BiLSTM model regards missing data as network variables, which are efficiently updated during backpropagation. Im-BiLSTM treats the interaction between imputation and classification tasks, reducing the error and uncertainty caused by the separation operation of imputation to classification. Furthermore, we improved the interpretability of the ImBiLSTM model by evaluating the importance of input features and visualizing hidden state units. In Shawan County, Xinjiang, China, we acquired a total of 10 Sentinel-2A images from April to October 2016, of which 3 images lost partial data due to cloud cover. The Im-BiLSTM model was applied to incomplete time-series data containing 10 time-steps for pixel-level crop classification, and the BiLSTM model was constructed based on cloud-free images for comparison. The performance of the proposed model was tested in four different cases of images missing and missing rates. The results showed that the classification of the Im-BiLSTM model outperformed the BiLSTM model, the overall accuracy was improved by a maximum of 4.2%, and the F1-scores of spring corn and tomato was improved by a maximum of 16.1% and 21.4%, respectively. Therefore, the ImBiLSTM model can effectively improve classification performance by jointly imputing missing data. The imputation results (the coefficient of determination values range 0.4 ~ 0.9) indicated that the bands with the larger contribution to the classification had higher imputation accuracy. Feature importance evaluation showed that the Im-BiLSTM model captured the key phenological periods and features from time-series input. The visualization of hidden units demonstrated that the Im-BiLSTM model accumulated useful information over time, and the learned high-level features made the crops more separable than the original inputs.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind erosion is one of the most serious forms of land degradation in arid and semi-arid regions because it affects agricultural land, which in turn leads to a decrease in the quality of the soil leading to economic losses. As a perfect area of study, the northeastern region of the Kingdom of Morocco, specifically the Moulouya Basin, is considered the first on the list of areas threatened by this alarming environmental phenomenon. This study aims to apply the fuzzy logic approach, remote sensing data, and geographic information systems (GIS) to analyze wind erosion and sensitivity mapping data in the basins of Middle Moulouya and Guercif. To this end, the reliance is based on three causative factors obtained using fuzzy logic approach functions for each parameter: soil, vegetation, and climate. Furthermore, the fuzzy operator "GAMMA " was applied to create a wind erosion sensitivity map. The success rate curves revealed that the fuzzy gamma factor (y), with gamma = 0.9, gave the best predictive accuracy of 85.2% for the area under the curve. The wind erosion sensitivity map includes areas with regions of five relative sensitivity classes: very high, high, moderate, low, and very low. The estimated result was verified by field measurements and the statistically significant high value of the chi-square test.

TI  - Estimating groundwater use and demand in arid Kenya through assimilation of satellite data and in-situ sensors with machine learning toward drought early action
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is an important source of water for people, livestock, and agriculture during drought in the Horn of Africa. In this work, areas of high groundwater use and demand in drought-prone Kenya were identified and forecasted prior to the dry season. Estimates of groundwater use were extended from a sentinel network of 69 in-situ sensored mechanical boreholes to the region with satellite data and a machine learning model. The sensors contributed 756 site-month observations from June 2017 to September 2021 for model building and validation at a density of approx-imately one sensor per 3700 km2. An ensemble of 19 parameterized algorithms was informed by features including satellite-derived precipitation, surface water availability, vegetation indices, hydrologic land surface modeling, and site characteristics to dichotomize high groundwater pump utilization. Three operational definitions of high demand on groundwater infrastructure were considered: 1) mechanical runtime of pumps greater than a quarter of a day (6+ hr) and daily per capita volume extractions indicative of 2) domestic water needs (35+ L), and 3) intermediate needs including livestock (75+ L). Gridded interpolation of localized groundwater use and demand was provided from 2017 to 2020 and forecasted for the 2021 dry season, June-September 2021. Cross-validated skill for contemporary estimates of daily pump runtime and daily volume extraction to meet domestic and intermediate water needs was 68%, 69%, and 75%, respectively. Forecasts were externally validated with an accuracy of at least 56%, 70%, or 72% for each groundwater use definition. The groundwater maps are accessible to stakeholders including the Kenya National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) and the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). These maps represent the first operational spatially-explicit sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) estimates of groundwater use and demand in the literature. Knowledge of historical and forecasted groundwater use is anticipated to improve decision-making and resource allocation for a range of early warning early action applications.

TI  - Estimation of actual evapotranspiration: A novel hybrid method based on remote sensing and artificial intelligence
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual evapotranspiration (AET) is one of the decisive factors controlling the water balance at the catchment level, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, but measured data for which are generally unavailable. In this study, performance of a base artificial intelligence (AI) model, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and its hybrids with two bio-inspired optimization algorithms, namely shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) and grey wolf optimization (GWO), in estimating monthly AET was evaluated over 2001-2010 across Neishaboor watershed in Iran. The inputs of these models were categorized into three groups including meteorological, remotely sensed, and hybrid-based predictors, and defined in the form of 8 different scenarios. Net radiation (Rn), land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and soil wetness deficit index (SWDI) were the remotely sensed predictors, computed using MODIS satellite images on the monthly scale for the study area. The results showed that the SWDI predictor has played a significant role in improving the accuracy of AET estimation, with the highest error reduction (12.5, 17 and 26.5% for ANFIS, ANFIS-SFLA, and ANFIS-GWO, respectively) obtained under scenarios including SWDI compared to corresponding scenarios excluding this predictor. In testing set, the three aforementioned models exhibited their best performance under Scenario 8 (RMSE = 11.93, NSE = 0.69, RRMSE = 0.37), Scenario 4 (RMSE = 11.06, NSE = 0.74, RRMSE = 0.37) and Scenario 4 (RMSE = 10.9, NSE = 0.76, RRMSE = 0.36), respectively. Coupling the SFLA and GWO optimization algorithms to the base model improved the accuracy of AET estimation, with the maximum error reduction for the two algorithms being about 12% (Scenarios 2 and 4) and 14% (Scenario 4), respectively. Examining the performance of the best scenarios of the three models in three intervals including the first, middle, and last third of measured AET values showed that all models were the most accurate in the first third interval. The results also indicated that all models have had higher accuracies in the first and middle third intervals of under-estimation set and the last interval of over-estimation set.

TI  - Coupling with high-resolution remote sensing data to evaluate urban non-point source pollution in Tongzhou, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban non-point source (NPS) pollution has gradually become one of the important factors affecting the urban water environment. The quantitative evaluation of urban NPS pollution is the priority to identify key control area of urban NPS pollution. Current model applied in China is mainly focused on small-scale area, large-scale spatial continuous simulation is lacking. In this study A spatial continuous evaluation method coupled with high-resolution remote sensing data has been established and the method was applied to Tongzhou, China. With the spatial distribution of land-use type and built-up area which were been obtained by remote sensing technology, the accumulative and wash-off load of urban NPS nitrogen and phosphorus were estimated for the prominent problems of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient pollution in the rivers in the study area. The main sources of urban NPS Nitrogen and phosphorus pollution are roof and road rainfall runoff respectively. Compared to other urban NPS pollution models, the method developed in this study can quickly realize spatial visualization assessment of urban NPS pollution and provide a means to estimate urban NPS loads in entire city or urban agglomeration, it is applicable for common urban NPS pollutants and also has advantages in areas without data.

TI  - Estimation of aboveground mangrove carbon stocks from WorldView-2 imagery based on generic and species-specific allometric equations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aboveground mangrove carbon stock can be estimated and mapped from remote-sensing data using allometric equations. However, the distinct effects of applying the generic or species specific allometric equations remain unclear in the mangrove environment. The aims of this study are to (1) describe the relationship between field biomass and image pixels using generic and species-specific allometric equations, (2) estimate and map the mangrove carbon stock at the generic and species-specific levels, and (3) compare the accuracy and distribution of the resulting mangrove carbon stock maps. We tested the performance of these allometric equations using a resampled WorldView-2 image (6 m pixel size). The study site was in Clungup Mangrove Conservation (CMC), Malang, East Java and included natural mangrove forests and well-planted mangroves. We used the simple ratio (SR) vegetation index to estimate and map the aboveground carbon stock (AGC) of the mangroves based on the WorldView-2 image. Overall, the results indicate that the use of a generic allometric equation estimates mangrove AGC more accurately than the species-specific equations. However, we found a low coefficient of determination (R2) for both models: 0.2175 for the generic model and 0.1801 for the species-specific one. This may be due to the mangrove objects' high variation in internal spectral reflectance at the tested image pixel size. The total estimated mangrove AGC obtained was 3,834.15 tons with a standard error of 0.12 for the generic model and 4,927.90 tons with a standard error of 0.17 for the species-specific model. Our findings substantiate the importance of the selection of allometric equations for mangrove AGC studies based on remote-sensing images.

TI  - Ultra-minimally invasive surgery in gynecological patients: a review of the literature
T2  - UPDATES IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - In the last decade, Ultra-minimally invasive surgery (UMIS) including both minilaparoscopic (MH) and percutaneous (PH) endoscopic surgery achieved widespread use around the world. Despite UMIS has been reported as safe and feasible surgical procedure, most of the available data are drawn from retrospective studies, with a limited number of cases and heterogeneous surgical procedures included in the analysis. This literature review aimed to analyze the most methodologically valid studies concerning major gynecological surgeries performed in UMIS. A literature review was performed double blind from January to April 2021. The keywords 'minilaparoscopy'; 'ultra minimally invasive surgery'; '3 mm'; 'percutaneous'; and 'Hysterectomy' were selected in Pubmed, Medscape, Scopus, and Google scholar search engines. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed for the drafting of the systematic review. The systematic literature research provided 298 studies, of which 9 fell within the inclusion criteria. Two hundred ninety-six total patients were included, 148 for both PH and MH groups. Median age (48 years), BMI (24 kg/m(2)), OT (90 min), EBL (50 ml), time to discharge (1 day), self scar evaluation (10/10), and VAS (3/10) were reported. The most frequent intraoperative complication in both the PH and MH groups was surgical bleeding. The UMIS approaches were feasible and safe even for complex gynecological procedures. Operative times and complications were superimposable to the "classical" minimally invasive approaches reported in the literature. The reported results apply only to experienced surgeons.

TI  - A Study on Algae Bloom Pigment in the Eutrophic Lake Using Bio-Optical Modelling: Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Approach
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland lake is one of the important sources of freshwater ecosystem and serves as a sentinel to the changing aquatic biodiversity. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is a major biological indicator and essential measure of the eutrophic status of lake water because it is strongly related to algae biomass. In the present research, bio-optical algorithms were developed based on the semi-empirical approach using the spectral wavelengths of 400 to 800 nm from hyperspectral remote sensing measurement and compared with Sentinel-2MSI image for estimation of Chl-a concentration in the lake water. The results show that the bio-optical algorithm can estimate and predict the algae pigment (Chl-a) concentration in the eutrophic lake with good accuracy of R-2 of 0.8958, root mean squared error of 13.028, and mean absolute percentage error of 8.44%. The developed algorithm will be suitable and potential for monitoring algae spatial dynamics and assessment in an inland lake.

TI  - Terrain deformation measurements from optical satellite imagery: The MPIC-OPT processing services for geohazards monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring terrain deformation over several spatial and temporal scales is relevant for many applications in Earth Sciences (i.e. active faults, volcanoes, landslides or glaciers understanding). The growing volume of freely available data represents nowadays a challenge in terms of storage capacity and computing resources which, together with the complexity of the processing (code parameterization, combination of the image sequences, coregistration of the images) may prevent the exploitation of long time series. We propose here a new version of the Multiple-Pairwise Image Correlation toolbox for processing OPTical images (MPIC-OPT). The toolbox proposes an end-to-end solution to compute the horizontal sub-pixel ground deformation time series from large Sentinel-2 datasets. In addition to time series inversion, several corrections and filtering options are integrated to reduce the noise and improve the accuracy and precision of the measurements. In particular, an automatic jitter correction based on wavelet filtering is proposed. Moreover, the MPIC-OPT service is deployed on the Tier 1.5 HighPerformance Computing cluster (e.g. Datacentre/EOST-A2S) of the University of Strasbourg and is accessible on-line through the ESA Geohazards Exploitation Platform (GEP) and the ForM@Ter Solid Earth computing infrastructure with a user-friendly environment to query the satellite data catalogues, parameterize the processing and visualize the outputs. We test the performances of MPIC-OPT on several use cases: the measurement of the co-seismic ground deformation of the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence (USA), of the rapid motion of the Slumgullion landslide (USA) and of the glaciers of the Mont-Blanc massif (France/Italy). We show that the results of MPIC-OPT are in agreement with in-situ data. The jitter correction significantly improves the precision (RMSEjitter=0.3m vs. RMSEnojitter=0.5m) and the accuracy (RMSEjitter=0.3m vs. RMSEnojitter=1.3m) of the measurement of the co-seismic displacement of the Rigdecrest seismic deformation. We show that the precision and accuracy of the terrain deformation estimation depend mainly on the correlation threshold and the temporal matching range parameters and we quantify and discuss their impacts. This work opens new perspectives to monitor automatically surface displacements/velocities of natural hazards over large scales and large periods of time.

TI  - A large-scale domal relief due to intraplate neotectonic compression in central Amazonia
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In intracratonic South America, the origin of neotectonic activity and its impact on large Amazonian rivers have been of continuous research interest. Despite the low relief of the land surface, which has generally been attributed to tectonic stability, there is increasing evidence of Neogene fault reactivation within central Amazonia. Recent research has also reported surface folding during the Quaternary, but this record was based only on morphological analysis of remote sensing data. This investigation focuses on a megascale (~60,000 km2) domal relief from central Amazonia (the Juru ' a dome). It firstly aims to verify the domal relief relationship to folding. It then explores the origin of the stress field from which it has developed within the context of Andean uplift and the westward movement of the South American plate. The approach consisted of analyzing river adjustments based on morphological and morphometric information from remote sensing imagery, integrated with subsurface data Bouguer gravity and magnetic anomaly maps, well logs, and seismic reflection sections. The results revealed that the Juru ' a dome coincides with the location of a basin depocenter. Subsurface evidence exists for the growth of a broad anticline producing thicker sedimentary units away from the dome core. NE- and NW-striking normal and reverse faults with flower structure geometries are abundant and suggest deformation from strike-slip tectonics. Gravity and magnetic data revealed that the fold and many of its associated faults are deep-rooted into basement rocks. Within the analyzed stratigraphic interval, faults are mostly developed into pre-Cretaceous units, but often propagate to the surface, where they define the edges of the dome and partly deform its overall shape. The fold and its related faults have modified the course of several rivers within the domal relief area, including the Juru ' a River, which is entrenched along NE-striking faults that are configured to release stress along the fold axis. The geomorphological and structural data are collectively compatible with a long-term NWtrending maximum horizontal compressive stress-field that is driving basin inversion. This neotectonic activity can be linked to far-field stresses from the pushes from the Andean orogeny and the movement of the South American plate against the North Andean and Nazca plates.

TI  - Development of automated marine floating plastic detection system using Sentinel-2 imagery and machine learning models
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing level of marine plastic pollution poses severe threats to the marine ecosystem and biodiversity. Open remote sensing data and advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms could be a cost-effective solution for identifying large plastic patches across the scale. The potential application of such resources in detecting and discriminating marine floating plastics (MFP) are not fully explored. Therefore, the present study attempted to explore the full functionality of open Sentinel satellite data and ML models for detecting and classifying the MFP in Mytilene (Greece), Limassol (Cyprus), Skala Loutron, Greece, Calabria (Italy), and Beirut (Lebanon). Two ML models, i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), were utilized to perform the classification analysis. In-situ plastic location data was collected from the control experiments conducted in Mytilene, Greece (in 2018 and 2019), Skala Loutron, Greece (2021), and Limassol, Cyprus (2018), and the same was considered for training the models. The accuracy and performances of the trained models were further tested on unseen new data collected from Calabria, Italy and Beirut, Lebanon. Both remote sensing bands and spectral indices were used for developing the ML models. A spectral signature profile for marine plastic was created for discriminating the floating plastic from other marine debris. A newly developed index, kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (kNDVI), was incorporated into the modelling to examine its contribution to model performances. Both SVM and RF were performed well in five models and test case combinations. Among the two ML models, the highest performance was measured for the RF. The inclusion of kNDVI was found effective and increased the model performances, reflected by high balanced accuracy measured for model 2 (-89% to-100% for SVM and-92% to-98% for RF). An automated floating plastic detection system was developed and tested in Calabria and Beirut using the best-performed model. The trained model had detected the floating plastic for both sites with-80%-90%% accuracy. Among the six predictors, the Floating Debris Index (FDI) was the most important variable for detecting marine floating plastic. These findings collectively suggest that high-resolution remote sensing imagery and the automated ML models can be an effective alternative for the cost-effective detection of MFP. Future research will be directed toward collecting quality training data to develop robust automated models and prepare a spectral library for different plastic objects for discriminating plastic from other marine floating debris and advancing the marine plastic pollution research by taking full advantage of open-source data and technologies.

TI  - Risk perceptions and COVID-19 protective behaviors: A two-wave longitudinal study of epidemic and post-epidemic periods
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated how perceived risk and protective behaviors changed as the coronavirus epidemic progressed. A longitudinal sample of 538 people responded to a COVID-19 risk perception questionnaire during the outbreak and post-epidemic periods. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), we examined the mean level change of selected constructs and differences in their relationships. We tested a risk perception pathway in which affective attitude, informed by experience, shaped risk perceptions and protective behaviors. The model also postulated a social pathway in which cultural worldviews, like individualism and hierarchy, predicted risk perceptions and protective behaviors through social norms. Latent mean difference analyses revealed a decrease in social distancing behaviors and an increase in hygiene-cleanliness, corresponding to a reduction in risk perceptions and social norms and a rise in direct and indirect experience, while affective attitude remained substantially stable. Cross-sectional and longitudinal path analyses showed that affective risk perception, primarily informed by affective attitude, and social norms promoted behavior consistency regardless of epidemic contingencies. Instead, analytic risk perceptions were linked to protective behaviors only during the outbreak. Although risk perceptions dropped over time, analytic risk perceptions dropped more steeply than affective risk perceptions. Our findings supported the distinction between affective and deliberative processes in risk perception, reinforcing the view that affective reactions are needed to deploy analytic processes. Our study also supports the claim that perceived social norms are essential to understanding cultural worldview-related protective behaviors variability.

TI  - Interference-sensitive coastal SAR altimetry retracking strategy for measuring significant wave height
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimetry is a radar remote sensing technology for the precise observation of the ocean surface and its changes over time. Its measurements allow the determination of geometric and physical parameters such as sea level, significant wave height or wind speed. This work presents a novel coastal retracking algorithm for SAR altimetry to estimate the significant wave height. The concept includes an adaptive interference masking scheme to sense and mitigate spurious interfering signals that typically arise from strongly reflective targets in the coastal zone. The described procedure aims at increasing the number of valid records in the coastal zone. The effec-tiveness of the novel retracking algorithm is validated using the methodology recently developed in the framework of the European Space Agency Sea State Climate Change Initiative project. Several different metrics were extracted as functions of sea state and distance to the nearest coast: outliers, number of valid records, intrinsic noise, power spectral density, and correlation statistics for the comparison with wave model and in-situ data. Two coastal case study scenarios complement the validation. The results show that with the presented novel retracking algorithm, the number of valid 20-Hz records in the near coastal zone of less than 5 km off the coast is increased by more than 25% compared to the best competing coastal retracking algorithm with no degradation of quality of the estimated records. We emphasise the importance of the correct choice of the quality flag that is provided together with the significant wave height. Our findings suggest that the strategy for the significant wave height quality flag of the official baseline Level-2 product of the Sentinel-3 mission can be redefined to obtain more robust significant wave height estimates in the coastal zone.

TI  - Mapping actual evapotranspiration using Landsat for the conterminous United States: Google Earth Engine implementation and assessment of the SSEBop model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation and mapping of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) is an active area of applied research in the fields of agriculture and water resources. Thermal remote sensing-based methods, using coarse resolution satellites, have been successful at estimating ETa over the conterminous United States (CONUS) and other regions of the world. In this study, we present CONUS-wide ETa from Landsat thermal imagery-using the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Over 150,000 Landsat satellite images were used to produce 10 years of annual ETa (2010-2019) at unprecedented scale. The accuracy assessment of the SSEBop results included point-based evaluation using monthly Eddy Covariance (EC) data from 25 AmeriFlux stations as well as basin-scale comparison with annual Water Balance ETa (WBET) for more than 1000 sub-basins. Evaluations using EC data showed generally mixed performance with weaker (R-2 < 0.6) correlation on sparsely vegetated surfaces such as grasslands or woody savanna and stronger correlation (R-2 > 0.7) over well-vegetated surfaces such as croplands and forests, but location-specific conditions rather than cover type were attributed to the variability in accuracy. Croplands performed best with R-2 of 0.82, root mean square error of 29 mm/month, and average bias of 12%. The WBET evaluation indicated that the SSEBop model is strong in explaining the spatial variability (up to R-2 > 0.90) of ETa across large basins, but it also identified broad hydro-climatic regions where the SSEBop ETa showed directional biases, requiring region-specific model parameter improvement and/or bias correction with an overall 7% bias nationwide. Annual ETa anomalies over the 10-year period captured widely reported drought-affected regions, for the most part, in different parts of the CONUS, indicating their potential applications for mapping regional-and field-scale drought and fire effects. Due to the coverage of the Landsat Path/Row system, the availability of cloud-free image pixels ranged from less than 12 (mountainous cloud-prone regions and U.S. Northeast) to more than 60 (U.S. Southwest) per year. However, this study reinforces a promising application of Landsat satellite data with cloud computing for quick and efficient mapping of ETa for agricultural and water resources assessments at the field scale.

Polarimetric SAR (POLSAR) data are acquired in a quad-polarization mode, and L-band POLSAR data in particular are one of the few SAR data types that preserve the dielectric properties and structures of the scatterer. POLSAR data consist of 2 x 2 scattering matrices and consequently offer superior target recognition compared with dual-polarization data. In this study, we applied scattering power decomposition suitable for detecting deforestation in near real-time to POLSAR data obtained from the Earth observation sensor Phased Array type L band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2). The reflection symmetry condition is known to apply to natural distributed objects (i.e., the cross-correlation between co-and cross-polarization data is zero). Inspired by this, we theoretically and experimentally examined the volume scattering power component to distinguish natural forests from the surrounding area. Two important results were verified for natural forests: as the window size of the ensemble average increases, (i) the coherency matrix approaches a simple theoretical form and (ii) the volume scattering power becomes dominant among the scattering power components. Based on these results, we constructed an algorithm that applies scattering power decomposition for detecting deforestation. We produced reference data using high-resolution optical images and evaluated the performance of the derived deforestation map in the Amazon natural forest when employing various window sizes for the ensemble average. At an optimal window size of 15 x 15 pixels, the deforestation detection performance reached a user's accuracy of 94.9% +/- 1.5%, a producer's accuracy of 72.3% +/- 1.2%, and a kappa coefficient of 0.816 +/- 0.0039. Sparse trees left after logging increased the volume scattering power and reduced the producer's accuracy. The proposed algorithm can contribute to deforestation detection with slightly lower accuracy than that of the annual map provided by Global Forest Change. Further, the proposed algorithm is robust to the seasonal variations in tropical rainforests and temporal variations in the deforestation process. Consequently, the proposed algorithm employing the six component scattering power decomposition method can be utilized in near real-time without considering applicable areas in tropical rainforests. Subsequently, we applied our algorithm to dual-polarization data, which are acquired by PALSAR-2 much more frequently than POLSAR data. The false detection rate did not increase when using the dual-polarization data; however, the omission error increased considerably compared with that when using POLSAR data owing to the low total power obtained from the dual-polarization data.

TI  - Intranodal Neurofibroma: A Case Report and Literature Review
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose: To report a case of neurofibroma involving the lymph nodes and to perform a literature review on this topic. Observations: A 72-year-old woman with a history of neurofibromatosis and biopsy-proven malignant melanoma of the left forearm underwent wide local excision of the malignant lesion along with sentinel axillary lymph node biopsy. Histological examination of axillary nodes revealed diffuse neurofibromatosis within 2 lymph node capsules. A thorough review of the English literature pertaining to intranodal neurofibroma was performed by querying Google Scholar and PubMed. Only 5 cases of intranodal neurofibroma have been described until now. Conclusions and Importance: Neurofibroma involving the lymph nodes is rare and this is the first reported case that is shown to diffusely involve the intracapsular space. Furthermore, intranodal neurofibroma can represent a diagnostic pitfall in the evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes for metastatic melanoma.

TI  - Long-Term Dynamics and Response to Climate Change of Different Vegetation Types Using GIMMS NDVI3g Data over Amathole District in South Africa
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring vegetation dynamics is essential for improving our understanding of how natural and managed agricultural landscapes respond to climate variability and change in the long term. Amathole District Municipality (ADM) in Eastern Cape Province of South Africa has been majorly threatened by climate variability and change during the last decades. This study explored long-term dynamics of vegetation and its response to climate variations using the satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index from the third-generation Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS NDVI3g) and the ERA5-Land global reanalysis product. A non-parametric trend and partial correlation analyses were used to evaluate the long-term vegetation changes and the role of climatic variables (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation and wind speed) during the period 1981-2015. The results of the ADM's seasonal NDVI3g characteristics suggested that negative vegetation changes (browning trends) dominated most of the landscape from winter to summer while positive (greening) trends dominated in autumn during the study period. Much of these changes were reflected in forest landscapes with a higher coefficient of variation (CV approximate to 15) than other vegetation types (CV approximate to 10). In addition, the pixel-wise correlation analyses indicated a positive (negative) relationship between the NDVI3g and the ERA5-Land precipitation in spring-autumn (winter) seasons, while the reverse was the case with other climatic variables across vegetation types. However, the relationships between the NDVI3g and the climatic variables were relatively low (R < 0.5) across vegetation types and seasons, the results somewhat suggest the potential role of atmospheric variations in vegetation changes in ADM. The findings of this study provide invaluable insights into potential consequences of climate change and the need for well-informed decisions that underpin the evaluation and management of regional vegetation and forest resources.

TI  - Psychotropic prescribing rates and pharmacogenomic testing implications for autism in the Canadian primary care sentinel surveillance network
T2  - PHARMACOGENETICS AND GENOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To estimate prescribing rates of psychotropic drugs to individuals with autism and the proportion of these individuals who could benefit from pharmacogenetic testing. Methods Prescribing data for 92 psychotropic drugs, including 31 antidepressants, 22 antipsychotics, 14 mood stabilizer/antiepileptics, 17 anxiolytic/hypnotics and eight antiadrenergic/psychostimulant were retrieved from medical records of 787 (613 males) autistic individuals who sought treatment from a primary care office enrolled in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network between 2012 and 2014. Each prescribed drug was cross-referenced with pharmacogenomic-based prescribing guidelines published by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium, the Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group, and the Canadian Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug Safety. Results More than half (58%) of the participants were prescribed a psychotropic drug and 37% were prescribed two or more psychotropic drugs concurrently. Among the 83 psychotropic drugs examined, 54 (65%) were prescribed to one or more participants during the study's observation period. The ten most frequently prescribed psychotropics were methylphenidate (16.3%), risperidone (12.8%), lorazepam (12.1%), fluoxetine (7.9%), sertraline (7.1%), quetiapine (6.9%), aripiprazole (6.1%), lisdexamfetamine (5.8%), citalopram (5.6%) and clonazepam (4.8%). Seventeen (32%) of the 54 psychotropic drugs prescribed were linked to a pharmacogenomic-based prescribing guideline, including risperidone, sertraline, aripiprazole and citalopram. Conclusions Our findings suggest primary care providers in Canada prescribe a wide range of psychotropics to their patients with autism, some of which may benefit from the integration of pharmacogenomic information into their treatment planning.

TI  - AIS Data Aided Rayleigh CFAR Ship Detection Algorithm of Multiple-Target Environment in SAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes an automatic identification system (AIS) data aided Rayleigh constant false alarm rate (AIS-RCFAR) ship detection algorithm of multiple-target environment in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. This method aims to improve the detection performance in complex environment with the aid of AIS data. Traditional CFAR detectors generally use all the samples in the local background window for parameter estimation. However, in multiple-target environment, clutter edges and transition areas, due to the interference of the high-intensity outliers, such as target pixels, ghosts, and other interfering pixels, the parameters are often overestimated, causing degradation of the detection performance. Aiming at solving this problem, AIS-RCFAR designs an adaptive-threshold based clutter trimming method with an adaptive-trimming-depth aided by AIS data to effectively eliminate the high-intensity outliers in the local background window while greatly sustaining the real sea clutter samples. Maximum-likelihood-estimator with a closed-form solution is proposed to precisely estimate the parameters using the adaptively-trimmed clutter samples, the probability density function of the sea clutter following Rayleigh distribution can be accurately modeled. AIS-RCFAR greatly enhances the detection rate in both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous multiple-target environment, it also achieves a very low false alarm rate. In addition, the whole procedure of AIS-RCFAR is simple and efficient. Simulated data and real SAR images with corresponding matched AIS data are used for experiments to validate the superiority and feasibility of AIS-RCFAR.

TI  - Brazil's Stealth Military Intervention
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLITICS IN LATIN AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Between 2016 and 2020, a group of activist generals successfully plotted the Brazilian military's gradual return to the political center stage with powers unseen since the dictatorship. They achieved this without formally breaking the law, suspending the democratic process or overthrowing the government. We call this a "stealth intervention," an incremental yet systematic attempt to redesign politics without causing a rupture, that fits neither in the existing typology of coups nor in the literature on democratic backsliding. We argue that Brazil's stealth intervention, built upon the military's existing tutelary prerogatives and driven by an unreformed praetorian worldview that resurfaced amidst a sustained crisis of democracy, challenges the prevalent view of the armed forces as a reactive force that intervenes in civilian politics only when its institutional interests are threatened. Finally, we show that democratic backsliding in Brazil started under Bolsonaro's predecessor, Michel Temer, and point to the generals' understudied role in this process.

TI  - Urban Land Cover/Use Mapping and Change Detection Analysis Using Multi-Temporal Landsat OLI with Lidar-DEM and Derived TPI
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The mapping and change detection of land cover and land use are essential for urban management. The aim of this study was to map and monitor the spatial and temporal change in urban land cover and land use in Davidson County, Tennessee in the periods of 2013, 2016, and 2020. The urban land cover and land use categories were classified and mapped using Random Forest algorithm. A combina-tion of Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite data with Light Detection and Ranging (lidar)-Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and derived Topographic Position Index (TPI) were used in the clas-sification and monitoring of urban land cover and land use change. The urban land cover and land use types were mapped with aver-age overall accuracies of about 87% in 2020, 85% in 2016 and 2013. The overall accuracy increased by around 8%, 9%, and 6% in 2020, 2016, and 2013 classifications respectively when lidar-DEM and derived TPI were added to Landsat OLI satellite data in the classification relative to standalone Landsat OLI. Total change occurred in about 63% of Davidson County between 2016 and 2020 with significant net gains and losses among land cover and land use types. This information could support land use planning.

TI  - Methodology for laboratory-based antimicrobial resistance surveillance in animals
T2  - VETERINARY WORLD
M3  - Article
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a crucial and emerging multifactorial "One Health" problem involving human and animal health, agriculture, aquaculture, and environment; and posing a potential public health hazard globally. The containment of AMR justifies effective surveillance programs to explicate the magnitude of the problem across the contributing sectors. Laboratory-based AMR testing and characterization is the key component of an AMR surveillance program. An AMR surveillance program should have a "top management" for fund mobilization. planning, formulating, and multilateral coordinating of the surveillance activities. The top management should identify competent participating laboratories to form a network comprising a reference laboratory and an adequate number of sentinel laboratories. The responsibilities of the reference laboratory include the development of standardized test methods for ensuring quality and homogeneity of surveillance activities, providing training to the laboratory personnel. and in-depth AMR characterization. The sentinel laboratories will take the responsibilities of receiving samples, isolation and identification of microbes, and initial AMR characterization. The sentinel laboratories will use simple antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) methods such as disk diffusion tests, whereas the reference laboratories should use automated quantitative AST methods as well as advanced molecular methods to explicit AMR emergence mechanisms. Standard guidelines set by Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute or the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, should be followed to bring about conformity and harmonization in the AST procedures. AMR surveillance program in animals is eventually similar to that in human health with the exception is that veterinary antibiotics and veterinary pathogens should be given preference here. Hence, the review study was envisaged to look deep into the structure of the AMR surveillance program with significance on laboratory-based AMR testing and characterization methods.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Agricultural Water Accounting for the North Jordan Valley
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing can provide important and updated information for agricultural water accounting (AWA). In this study, data from the open-access portal (WaPOR) of the Food and Agricultural Organization was used in AWA to assess levels of agricultural water consumption and to provide possible solutions for water deficiency in the North Jordan Valley (NJV). Consolidated procedures have been applied to complement and validate the WaPOR products. These included the use of climatic and ground data, the multispectral remote-sensing data of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 to derive land use/cover maps, GIS layers, and calibrated evapotranspiration (ET) estimates using the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL). The data of water inflows and outflows were analyzed using the water accounting plus (WA+) system. Results showed that the WaPOR data of actual ET and interception (AETI) were highly correlated with SEBAL-ET, with WaPOR data overestimating ET for irrigated areas. Precipitation data from WaPOR, on the other hand, were underestimating inflow from rainfall, although significant correlations were observed between these data and rainfall records. As a result, the quality of WaPOR data affected the outputs from agricultural water accounting. The main impact on water accounting outputs was the underestimation of percolated water that could be utilized as a possible solution to water deficiency in the NJV. In addition, the water accounting performance indicators were relatively affected, although they reflected the nature of the study area where water deficiency predominated as a result of inter-basin transfer. The study compared outputs from water accounting in terms of the possible solutions to water deficiency in the NJV and concluded that considerable amounts of recoverable water could be developed when compared with the option of developing surface water from the side wadis. Also, it emphasized the important role of remote-sensing sources for providing information for AWA needed for improved water management and governance.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Inversion of Land Surface Temperature along Coastal Cities in Arid Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is undoubtedly affecting the global weather of the Earth. Rapid human civilization has mainly caused this in the last few decades. This research examined the spatial and temporal land surface temperature (LST) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) coastal cities located in an arid region that faced massive urbanization over the last 50 years. We estimated the LST using by-products of Landsat and MODIS images covering 2000 until 2020. The assessment of LST was performed in two contexts, i.e., spatially and temporally, covering daytime vs. nighttime during the summer and winter seasons. Additionally, a supervised classification technique was adopted to extract the land use and land cover in the study area from the late 1970s until 2018. Unexpectedly, the results indicated that daytime LST in districts near the coastlines (heavily urbanized areas) are lower than the ones far away from the coast (about 9 degrees C). This observation represents the spatial LST inversion in the study area. Nevertheless, this difference was not observed during nighttime LST temporally, the daytime LST did not increase significantly during either summer or winter seasons. However, the nighttime LST has increased temporally by about 17% since 2000 (the temporal LST inversion). Both LST inversions could be attributed to the uniqueness of the study area, given that bare land desert was replaced by vegetation, high-rise buildings, and industrial activities. Additionally, the wind breeze blowing from the gulf might potentially contribute to cooling the coastal urban area during the daytime. Furthermore, in-depth zonal statistics were conducted to visualize the effect of land use on LST. The study observed that fully built-up areas with vegetation have lower LST than built-up areas without vegetation or a combination of sand and vegetation. The research outcomes are invaluable for decision-makers and researchers in achieving sustainable urban development.

TI  - Normalized Burn Ratio Plus (NBR plus ): A New Index for Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of burned areas can easily be performed using satellite multispectral images: several indices are available in the literature for highlighting the differences between healthy vegetation areas and burned areas, in consideration of their different signatures. However, these indices may have limitations determined, for example, by the presence of clouds or water bodies that produce false alarms. To avoid these inaccuracies and optimize the results, this work proposes a new index for detecting burned areas named Normalized Burn Ratio Plus (NBR+), based on the involvement of Sentinel-2 bands. The efficiency of this index is verified by comparing it with five other existing indices, all applied on an area with a surface of about 500 km(2) and covering the north-eastern part of Sicily (Italy). To achieve this aim, both a uni-temporal approach (single date image) and a bi-temporal approach (two date images) are adopted. The maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) is applied to each resulting index map to define the threshold separating burned pixels from non-burned ones. To evaluate the efficiency of the indices, confusion matrices are constructed and compared with each other. The NBR+ shows excellent results, especially because it excludes a large part of the areas incorrectly classified as burned by other indices, despite being clouds or water bodies.

TI  - Using InSAR Time Series to Monitor Surface Fractures and Fissures in the Al-Yutamah Valley, Western Arabia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Western Arabia routinely experiences geophysical phenomena that deform the surface of the earth in a variety of ways. These phenomena include earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, sinkholes, and earth fissuring and fracturing. We perform a time-series analysis of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations derived from the ESA Sentinel-1 radar satellite constellation to map regional surface displacements in western Arabia as a function of time. We rely on InSAR products generated by the JPL-Caltech ARIA project to detect regions with short wavelength anomalies, and then manually reprocess InSAR products at a higher resolution for these regions to maximize spatial and temporal coverage. We post-process InSAR products using MintPy workflows to develop the InSAR time series. We report short wavelength anomalies localized within alluvial valleys across western Arabia and find a 5 cm/year line-of-sight surface displacement within the Al-Yutamah Valley. Part of the observed subsidence is correlated with surface fractures that developed in conjunction with severe rainfall events in regions characterized mainly by alluvial sediments at the surface. Regions of observed subsidence that are not associated with any surface fractures or fissures are correlated with the presence of basalt layers at the surface. Both regions are subject to groundwater exploitation. The observed subsidence is inferred to be driven by groundwater withdrawal perhaps modulated by the presence of a preexisting depositional environment (e.g., paleo-lake deposits) that promotes unconsolidated soil compaction.

TI  - Multi-Season Phenology Mapping of Nile Delta Croplands Using Time Series of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 Green LAI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-based cropland phenology monitoring substantially assists agricultural managing practices and plays an important role in crop yield predictions. Multitemporal satellite observations allow analyzing vegetation seasonal dynamics over large areas by using vegetation indices or by deriving biophysical variables. The Nile Delta represents about half of all agricultural lands of Egypt. In this region, intensifying farming systems are predominant and multi-cropping rotations schemes are increasing, requiring a high temporal and spatial resolution monitoring for capturing successive crop growth cycles. This study presents a workflow for cropland phenology characterization and mapping based on time series of green Leaf Area Index (LAI) generated from NASA's Harmonized Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) surface reflectance dataset from 2016 to 2019. LAI time series were processed for each satellite dataset, which were used separately and combined to identify seasonal dynamics for a selection of crop types (wheat, clover, maize and rice). For the combination of L8 with S2 LAI products, we proposed two time series smoothing and fitting methods: (1) the Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter and (2) the Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR) fitting function. Single-sensor and L8-S2 combined LAI time series were used for the calculation of key crop Land Surface Phenology (LSP) metrics (start of season, end of season, length of season), whereby the detection of cropland growing seasons was based on two established threshold methods, i.e., a seasonal or a relative amplitude value. Overall, the developed phenology extraction scheme enabled identifying up to two successive crop cycles within a year, with a superior performance observed for the seasonal than for the relative threshold method, in terms of consistency and cropland season detection capability. Differences between the time series collections were analyzed by comparing the phenology metrics per crop type and year. Results suggest that L8-S2 combined LAI data streams with GPR led to a more precise detection of the start and end of growing seasons for most crop types, reaching an overall detection of 74% over the total planted crops versus 69% with S2 and 63% with L8 alone. Finally, the phenology mapping allowed us to evaluate the spatial and temporal evolution of the croplands over the agroecosystem in the Nile Delta.

TI  - Inversion Method of Chlorophyll Concentration Based on Relative Reflection Depths
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll concentration in ocean waters is the main parameter for describing marine primary productivity, estimating phytoplankton abundance and variation, assessing environmental quality and forecasting ecological disasters. The general inversion model of chlorophyll products used by satellite remote sensing at home and abroad is the OCx (x=2 similar to 6) algorithms based on the intensity ratio of remote sensing reflection spectra in different bands. When applied to case-1 glasses of waters, the mean relative error on a global scale is about 35%. However, for case-2 waters with complex inherent optical properties and large regional differences, OCx algorithms have large errors or even fail. The previous research results show that the relative spectral height is beneficial to extracting the feature information and improving the signal-to-noise ratio of ocean color. However, the inversion model based on relative height still has problems, such as single band selection and a narrow application range. In China coastal, the construction method and application effect of the relative height model need to be further studied and verified. Based on in-situ measured chlorophyll concentration data and apparent optical parameters in Qinhuangdao coastal waters, after normalizing hyperspectral data and selecting characteristic bands, the inversion model has been constructed based on relative reflection depths of characteristic bands in this paper. The related coefficient between the inversion and the measured values is 0. 883 58, and the mean relative error is 28. 33%. Compared with the OCx algorithms, the average relative errors are reduced by more than 27%similar to 50%. The model is verified, and the mean relative error is 31. 17%. On this basis, correlation analysis was carried out on the multi-spectral data of HY-1C China Ocean Color & Temperature Scanner and the measured chlorophyll concentration, and the inversion model was established based on the relative reflection depths at 443 and 520 nm. The mean relative error of the model was reduced by 53. 44% compared with that of the L2B product at the same time. The results show that the inversion model based on relative reflection depths can make full use of the information of chlorophyll characteristic bands, reduce the sensitivity to noise, and improve the signal-to-noise ratio of ocean color constituents, thus greatly improving the inversion accuracy and robustness of the model. This research has important scientific significance and substantial application value for constructing hyperspectral and multi-spectral inversion models of ocean color elements, measurement of water optical parameters, popularization and application of satellite products, estimation of primary productivity, ecological environment monitoring, hydrodynamic process research and other fields.

TI  - Intercalibration of the reflective solar bands of MODIS and MISR instruments on the Terra platform
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a part of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS), the Terra spacecraft was launched on December 18, 1999, with the goal of understanding the changes of the Earth, by examining the Earth's hydrological, geophysical, and climatic processes. The Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) instruments on the Terra platform, combined with their continuous operation, broad spectral coverage, and different spatial resolutions, have played an important role to achieve the goals of the EOS. Over two decades of successful operations, these multispectral imaging instruments have benefited a variety of scientific applications. Being on the same platform, the two sensors complement each other in terms of spatial coverage (and target viewing geometry) and facilitate synergistic applications using multispectral data. A consistent radiometric calibration between these sensors is a prerequisite for creating high-quality science products from their observations. Both instruments underwent intensive prelaunch characterization and their on-orbit calibrations are monitored using their onboard calibrators. We perform a calibration inter-comparison of the spectrally matching bands of the two instruments using vicarious techniques. These techniques include multiyear simultaneous views of the North African desert, North Atlantic Ocean, and Dome Concordia; therefore, covering different reflectance regimes. Moreover, the near-simultaneous top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance measurements from Railroad Valley (RRV), as provided by the radiometric calibration network (RadCalNet) (converted to TOA), are also included, which is used as a calibration reference to compare the on-orbit observations between MODIS and MISR. Simultaneous overpasses from desert, ocean, Dome C, and RadCalNet over RRV reveal that the agreement between the four spectrally matching bands is within 3% for the time-period between 2014 and 2020. Furthermore, some long-term drifts are observed in the TOA reflectance time-series from MISR for the red and NIR bands that are expected to be corrected in a future calibration reprocess.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To design a software-applied predictive model relating patients clinical and pathological traits associated with sentinel lymph-node total tumor load to individually establish the need to perform an axillary lymph-node dissection. Methods: Retrospective observational study including 127 patients with breast cancer in which a sentinel lymph-node biopsy was performed with the one step nucleic acid amplification method and a subsequent axillary lymph-node dissection. We created various binary multivariate logistic regression models using non-automated methods to predict the presence of metastasis in non-sentinel lymph-nodes, including Log total tumor load, immunohistochemistry, multicentricity and progesterone receptors. These parameters were progressively added according to the simplicity of their evaluation and their predictive value to detect metastasis in non-sentinel lymph-nodes. Results: The final model was selected for having maximum discriminatory capability, good calibration, along with parsimony and interpretability. The binary logistic regression model chosen was the one which identified the variables Log total tumor load, immunohistochemistry, multicentricity and progesterone receptors as predictors of metastasis in non-sentinel lymph-nodes. liarrell's C-index obtained from the area under the curve of the predicted probabilities by Model 4 was 0.77 (95% CI, (1.689-0.85; p < 0.0(X)5). Conclusions: the combination of total tumor load, immunohistochemistry, multicentricity and progesterone receptors can predict 77% of patients with metastasis in non-sentinel lymph-nodes and said prediction may be made intraoperatively in a feasible manner.

TI  - Assessment of Sea Level and Morphological Changes along the Eastern Coast of Bangladesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bangladesh is one of the climate risk-prone countries in South Asia facing tremendous challenges to combat sea-level rise and its associated coastal morphological changes. This study aimed to determine the interaction of the sea-level rise and morphological changes, particularly at Cox's Bazar and Kutubdia Island along the eastern coast of Bangladesh. Available hourly tide gauge data, daily temperature, daily rainfall data, and 15 LANDSAT satellite images for the period of 1983-2016 were analyzed to examine the sea level shore morphological change and associated climate change phenomenon. First, we identified the historical nonlinear sea-level trend using Hilbert-Huang Transformation (HHT) based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) technique. We divided the study period into three distinct sea-level change periods of 1983-1993, 1993-2003, and 2003-2014 based on nonlinear sea-level trend analysis. The study revealed that the sea level on the east coast of Bangladesh had a moderate rising trend during 1983-1993, slight decrease during 1993-2003, and steep rising trend during 2003-2014. We also observed that a sea-level change within a particular period impacted the shore morphological change after approximately two years, such that the average sea-level change during the period of 1993-2003 might have affected the shore morphology for 1996-2005. Alarming shore erosion was found for the period of 2005-2016 compared to the previous periods of 1989-1996 and 1996-2005 for both Cox's Bazar and Kutubdia Island. The shore morphology of some segments was also substantially affected due to the geometric shape of the land, significant waves, and shore protection works. This study encourages policymakers to minimize the threats of sea-level rise and ensure sustainable coastal management strategies are introduced to sustain the vital eastern coast of Bangladesh.

TI  - Method for Estimation of Oleic Acid Content in Soy Plants using Green Band Data of Sentinel-2/MSI
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for estimation of oleic acid content in soy plants using green band data of Sentinel-2/MSI: Multi Spectral Imager is proposed. Conventionally, vitality of agricultural plants is estimated with NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Spatial resolution of Near Infrared: NIR band of Sentinel-2/MSI for calculation of NDVI, however, is 20 m. Therefore, a method for estimation of vitality with only green band data of Sentinel-2/MSI is proposed here. Through regressive analysis with the satellite data as well as drone mounted NDVI camera data together with component analysis data by gas chromatography, it is found the correlation between NDVI and green band data of the optical sensor (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 as well as the component analysis data. It is also found that the new variety of soy plant, Saga University brand: HO1 contains about 50% much oleic acid in comparison to the conventional variety of soy plant, Fukuyutaka.

TI  - HUMANITARIAN MISSION OF THE SCIENCES OF HUMANS
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present article provides a critical reflection and answer to the ideas articulated in Ilya T. Kasavin's book Science - A Humanistic Project (2020). It attempts to define what must be named a humanistic science and what the mission of science is in the current world. The mission of science is not separated from its functions in society, and actually from the unique conditions of knowledge production. As Kasavin presupposes, the sciences of humans produce social technologies. Science is connected with humanism via the ethics of science and the epistemology of virtues, which introduce the regulating principles into routine practice. This kind of vision can be augmented by a thesis about the decisive role of humanitarian ideas in the renovation of culture, concerning the foundational significance of humanitarian projections for programming social codes and influence on events and people. The division between inner and outer trading zones allows conceptualizing traits of collective construction of meanings inside humanitarian laboratories or within research units intentionally designed for scholars in human sciences. Humanitarian laboratories change historically like it is so with Galison's trading zones for the case of natural sciences. They evolved from informal scientific communities, social clubs and literary salons to contemporary analytical centers and intellectual thinktanks. Human science laboratories have always formed outer trading zones and built firm bridges between theory and practice, between scholars and other social actors. Moreover, society itself must be compared with an experimental playground for testing ideas and theories, where through the sieve of experience they prove own viability and resilience. Non-reducibility of the social context of science reveals its humanistic essence. Humanistic science absorbs the potential acquired by humanity for meeting new global challenges. Thus, it requires the improvement of human living conditions and aims to resolve urgent social problems. Rejoining with the new education and new enlightenment, humanistic science shapes human worldview overcoming existential barriers and turning minds to creativity instead of destruction.

TI  - Mapping natural oil seeps in the Middle Magdalena Basin (Colombia) using WorldView-3 satellite data
T2  - AAPG BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Seeps are natural occurrences of oil and gas on the surface that originate from various sources, including subsurface petroleum accumulations. Despite the significance of hydrocarbon seeps in petroleum exploration, onshore seeps have been continually detected by visual inspections in the field. This work explores the use of WorldView-3 multispectral data for detecting hydrocarbon seepage in the Middle Magdalena Valley Basin, Colombia. The basin consists of successions of marine to terrestrial sediments of Cretaceous to Cenozoic age deformed into thrust-related structures. The area hosts numerous seeps that emanate from underlying petroleum accumulations. WorldView-3 data are highly effective in mapping oil shows arising from various sources, including from natural oil seeps. It detected >250 highly probable seeps, of which at least 35% were unknown a priori, and account for two-thirds of the oil targets, with the rest from anthropogenic sources. The seeps' spatial extents range from a few up to tens of thousands of square meters, albeit the majority cover an area between similar to 1.5 and 10 m(2). In approximately half of the cases, seeps are associated with diagenetic alterations and/or geobotanical anomalies induced by the diffuse flow of gaseous hydrocarbons. In spatial terms, seeps occur in the vicinity (i.e., <150 m) of major thrust faults. In conclusion, WorldView-3 data can provide a framework for systematic mapping, monitoring, and updating of seepage occurrences (and analogous oil targets) in petroleum provinces worldwide.

TI  - Evaluation and performance of satellite-derived bathymetry algorithms in turbid coastal water: a case study of Vengurla rocks
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal region bathymetry is increasingly becoming necessary for emerging needs of navigation and development along coasts. Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) has been examined as a viable alternative for hydrographic surveys for the past few decades to reduce the data acquisition efforts in coastal regions and augmentation of periodic updating of Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs). The previous studies have applied SDB algorithms in less complex waters due to the limitations of SDB algorithms in turbid and varying shallow waters. This paper analyses three different medium -resolution satellite imagery data to derive bathymetry in a navigably very complex and highly turbid region, Vengurla rocks, situated on the west coast of India. The objective of the study was to evaluate the best suitable technique for SDB in turbid water. The bathymetry product images have been derived using the two most commonly utilized log ratio, and linear ratio transformation; three semi-automated methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and ratio transform; and Machine Learning (ML) regression algorithms. Among the applied transform and algorithms, the ML algorithm using 561 nm band data performed the best, resulting in R-2 of 0.77, RMSE of 3.4 m, and MAE of 2.8 m. This work established that open source images of sensor OLI/Landsat-8 satellite provide the best results of SDB estimation in complex turbid water by applying ML algorithms. However, extreme turbid and complex regions resulted in more erroneous SDB estimation specifying the need for refining algorithms using bio-optical parameters.

TI  - Ship tracking method for resisting similar shape information under satellite videos
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In maritime management, satellite videos with a wide imaging range can provide beneficial data supplements for ground monitoring systems and improve the comprehensive management level. But there are few ships detailed features and a large amount of similar shape information in ship tracking by satellite videos, which lead to tracking drift even false tracking. A ship tracking method is proposed to resisting the interference information of ship-similar shapes. First, the mutual convolution Siamese network is used to calculate the similarity between the object template and the search area to improve the significance of the ship in the feature map. Second, the region proposal network with hierarchical double regression is proposed. Double regression of candidate boxes according to intersection over union (IOU) thresholds can reduce the influence of the non-rigid motion of the water surface on tracking and improve the IOU between candidate boxes and object ships. Finally, the object discrimination model is designed to enhance the screening ability of candidate boxes using deep and shallow classification head fusion and online training. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, tests were conducted on Jilin-1 satellite videos and public remote sensing data sets. The results show that, compared with the existing methods, the proposed method can effectively reduce the interference of similar shape information to ship detail features, and the tracking accuracy and success rate are 83.4% and 58.9%, respectively.

AB  - Bakri S, Monik DT, Setiawan A, Winarno GD. 2022. Short Communication: Assessing the relationship of Sumatran elephant's movement (Elephas maximus sumatranus) with vegetation intensity in Kotaagung Utara, Lampung Province, Indonesia using NDVI method. Biodiversitas 23: 1920-1928. The Indonesian Elephant Conservation Forum stated that the population of Sumatran elephants (Elephas maximus sumatranus) had decreased dramatically up to 70% in the last 20-30 years due to illegal hunting, land conversion, and encroachment, so the availability of elephant food in the wild is gradually inadequate. With the decline of the elephant population in Indonesia, several parties such as the government, NGO, and the public are beginning to monitor the Sumatran elephant. The monitoring is carried out by observing and studying the movements of elephants using a GPS Collar. The research aims to find out the consistency of elephant movement and its relationship to the availability of feed as indicated by the intensity of vegetation in KPH Kotaagung Utara, Lampung Province, Indonesia. This research used GIS technology (Correlation Citra Landsat 8 OLI and BIG Demnas Data), elephant movement data using GPS Collar in 2020, and land use data by BPKH Lampung. The results showed that the monthly movement pattern of elephants in 2020 was consistently monitored. From January-July, elephants are in the North area, while in August-December are in the South. The intensity of elephant movement in the Mixed Shrub Dryland Agriculture area is higher than in the other areas, at 107 points or about 90% of all the areas in KPH Kotaagung Utara. Meanwhile, in the Dryland and Shrub Agriculture areas, there are 6 points each, or about 5% of all the areas. The vegetation classification in KPH Kotaagung Utara is dense with an NDVI value range of 0.63-0.85. Furthermore, the regression results prove that NDVI and the monthly season affect the movement of elephants with a p-value of <0.001.

TI  - Outbreak of <i>Leptospira borgpetersenii</i> Serogroup Sejroe Infection in Kennel: The Role of Dogs as Sentinel in Specific Environments
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Kennels may represent high-risk environments for the diffusion of Leptospira infection in dogs and consequently a threat to public health. This study describes an outbreak of Leptospira infection in a kennel in Italy in 2020, both with clinically ill and asymptomatic dogs. Fifty-nine dogs, including three ill dogs, were tested for Leptospira spp. infection by the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and real-time qPCR. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was used to genotype the identified leptospires. Thirty of the fifty-nine (50.9%) dogs had MAT titer and/or molecular positivity indicative of Leptospira infection. Twenty-two of the fifty-nine (37.3%) dogs exhibited seropositivity against at least one serovar belonging to the Sejroe serogroup, and MLST analysis identified L. borgpetersenii serogroup Sejroe (Leptospira ST155) as responsible for the outbreak. Up to now, Sejroe serogroup infection was sporadically reported in dogs. The extension of the MAT antigen panel to several serovars belonging to the serogroup Sejroe could be useful in the diagnosis of canine leptospirosis. Dogs may serve as sentinel of leptospires in specific environments, and surveillance of Leptospira infection in kennels is strongly recommended even when the correct vaccine prophylaxis is administered, because the vaccines currently available are not able to protect from all of the serogroups.

TI  - Land Cover Change and Water Quality: How Remote Sensing Can Help Understand Driver-Impact Relations in the Lake Titicaca Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase of human interventions and developments are modifying the land use/land cover (LULC) of the global landscape, thus severely affecting the water quality of rivers and lakes. Appropriate management and effective policy developments are required to deal with the problems of surface water contamination around the globe. However, spatiotemporal variations of water quality and its complex relation with land cover (LC) changes, challenge adequate water resources management. In this study, we explored the use of remote sensing to relate LC change in the Katari River Basin (KRB) located in the Bolivian Andes and water quality on the shores of Lake Titicaca, in order to support water management. An unsupervised classification of Landsat 7 satellite images and trajectory analysis was applied to understand the modifications of LC through time. In addition, water-quality indicators at the outlet of the basin were retrieved from remote-sensing images and its temporal behavior was analyzed. The results show that the expansion of urban areas is the predominant environmental driver in the KRB, which has great impact on the water quality of Lake Titicaca. We conclude that there is a strong link between the rapid growth of urban and industrial areas with the detriment of river and lake water quality. This case study shows how remote sensing can help understand driver-impact relations.

Here we propose an analytical framework to estimate the impact of the net cloud radiative forcing (CRF) trend on the observed T-s trend for the duration of 2000-2019. The cloud sensitivity (lambda(cld)) estimated from the satellite observations vary in the range -0.180 to 0.241 K per W m(-2) across the seven T-s homogeneous zones in India. Net average (+/- 1 sigma) CRFs over the Indian landmass during 2000-2019 in the shortwave and longwave are -15.5 +/- 11.3 and 12.4 +/- 7.4 W m (2 ), -28.1 +/- 22.4 and 24.6 +/- 9.8 W m(-2), -75.1 +/- 20.4 and 55.0 +/- 13.8 W m(-2) and -23.3 +/- 14.9 and 21.6 +/- 14.8 W m(-2), respectively for the winter (Dec-Feb), pre-monsoon (Mar- May), monsoon (Jun-Sep) and post-monsoon (Oct-Nov) seasons. We find that in some of the T-s homogeneous regions, seasonal T-s trends are suppressed, whereas in some other T-s homogeneous regions, seasonal T-s trends are accelerated by the net CRF. Our framework can be useful in studying the role of clouds in observed surface warming trends.

TI  - Fast CO<sub>2</sub> Retrieval Using a Semi-Physical Statistical Model for the High-Resolution Spectrometer on the <i>Fengyun-3D</i> Satellite
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - China's Fengyun-3D meteorological satellite launched in December 2016 carries the high-resolution greenhouse-gases absorption spectrometer (GAS) aimed at providing global observations of carbon dioxide (CO2). To date, GAS is one of the few instruments measuring CO2 from the near-infrared spectrum. On orbit, the oxygen (O-2) A band suffers a disturbance, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is significantly lower than the nominal specification. This leads to difficulties in the retrieval of surface pressure and hence a degradation of the retrieval of the column-averaged CO2 dry air mole fraction (XCO2) if a full physics retrieval algorithm is used. Thus, a fast CO2 inverse method, named semi-physical statistical algorithm, was developed to overcome this deficiency. The instrument characteristics, the semi-physical statistical algorithm, and the results of comparison with ground-based measurements over land were introduced in this paper. XCO2 can be obtained from three bands, namely, the O-2 A, weak CO2, and strong CO2 bands, with compensation from the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager-2 (MERSI-2) products, ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA-5) data, and Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) data. The eigenvectors of covariance matrices and the least square fits were used to derive retrieval coefficients and yield cloud-free solutions. In addition to the GAS radiance, some key factors necessary for the accurate estimations of XCO2 were also taken as input information (e.g., air mass, surface pressure, and a priori XCO2). The global GAS XCO2 restricted over land was compared against the simultaneously collocated observations from TCCON. The retrieval algorithm can mitigate the issue caused by the low SNR of the O-2 A band to a certain extent. Overall, through site-by-site comparisons, GAS XCO2 agreed well with the average precision (1 sigma) of 1.52 ppm and bias of -0.007 ppm. The seasonal variation trends of GAS XCO2 can be clearly seen at TCCON sites on the 1-yr timescale.

TI  - Floating Solar Park Impacts Urban Land Surface Temperature Distribution Pattern
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the global photovoltaic industry has developed rapidly. It is significant for evaluating the impact of large-scale solar parks on the environment for the sustainable development of the photovoltaic industry. At present, researchers have paid attention to changes in the local thermal environment caused by solar parks. As a new type of solar park, the influence of floating solar parks on urban land surface temperature distribution patterns is still unclear. In this article, we (1) take the floating solar parks in Huainan City, China, as the study area; (2) calculate the land surface temperature (LST) of the study area and its adjacent areas by using Landsat 8 remote sensing data and the radiation transfer equation method; and (3) judge the influence of solar parks on the distribution pattern of LST. On this basis, we analyzed the influence range and seasonal differences of floating solar parks on LST. Our results revealed that, first, the floating solar park has a warming effect in the summer and winter, and the warming area is concentrated mainly within 200 m of the photovoltaic panels' coverage area. Second, during the construction phase and after the completion of the floating solar parks, the average monthly LST of the solar panels is generally higher than the water, and the average annual temperature increase in the above two stages is 3.26 degrees C and 4.50 degrees C, respectively. The change of floating solar parks on urban LST distribution patterns may impact the local ecosystem. In the future, it is necessary to consider the impact of floating solar parks on local LST during the construction of floating solar parks.

TI  - Earth Observation to Investigate Occurrence, Characteristics and Changes of Glaciers, Glacial Lakes and Rock Glaciers in the Poiqu River Basin (Central Himalaya)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Meltwater from the cryosphere contributes a significant fraction of the freshwater resources in the countries receiving water from the Third Pole. Within the ESA-MOST Dragon 4 project, we addressed in particular changes of glaciers and proglacial lakes and their interaction. In addition, we investigated rock glaciers in permafrost environments. Here, we focus on the detailed investigations which have been performed in the Poiqu River Basin, central Himalaya. We used in particular multi-temporal stereo satellite imagery, including high-resolution 1960/70s Corona and Hexagon spy images and contemporary Pleiades data. Sentinel-2 data was applied to assess the glacier flow. The results reveal that glacier mass loss continuously increased with a mass budget of -0.42 +/- 0.11 m w.e.a(-1) for the period 2004-2018. The mass loss has been primarily driven by an increase in summer temperature and is further accelerated by proglacial lakes, which have become abundant. The glacial lake area more than doubled between 1964 and 2017. The termini of glaciers that flow into lakes moved on average twice as fast as glaciers terminating on land, indicating that dynamical thinning plays an important role. Rock glaciers are abundant, covering approximately 21 km(2), which was more than 10% of the glacier area (approximately 190 km(2)) in 2015. With ongoing glacier wastage, rock glaciers can become an increasingly important water resource.

TI  - Ensemble Machine Learning Outperforms Empirical Equations for the Ground Heat Flux Estimation with Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating evapotranspiration at the field scale is a major component of sustainable water management. Due to the difficulty to assess some major unknowns of the water cycle at that scale, including irrigation amounts, evapotranspiration is often computed as the residual of the instantaneous surface energy budget. One of the Surface Energy Balance components with the largest uncertainties in their quantification over bare soils and sparse vegetation areas is the ground heat flux (G). Over the last decades, the estimation of G with remote sensing (RS) data has been mainly achieved with empirical equations, on the basis of the G and net radiation (Rn) ratio, G/Rn. The G/Rn empirical equations generally require vegetation data (Type I empirical equations), in combination with surface temperature (Ts) and albedo (Type II empirical equations). In this article, we aim to evaluate the estimation of G with RS data. Here, we compared eight G/Rn empirical equations against two types of machine learning (ML) methods: an ensemble ML type, the Random Forest (RF), and the Neural Networks (NN). The comparison of each method was evaluated using a wide range of climate and land cover datasets, including data from Eddy-Covariance towers that extend along the mid-latitude areas that encompass the European and African continents. Our results have shown evidence that the driver of G in bare soils and sparse vegetation areas (Fraction of Vegetation, Fv <= 0.25) is Ts, instead of vegetation greenness indexes. On the other hand, the accuracy in the estimation of G with Rn, Ts or Fv decreases in densely vegetated areas (Fv >= 0.50). There are no significant differences between the most accurate Type I and II empirical equations. For bare soils and sparse vegetation areas the empirical equation which combines the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Ts (E7) estimates G best. In densely vegetated areas, an exponential empirical equation based on Fv (E4), shows the best performance. However, ML better estimates G than the empirical equations, independently of the Fv ranges. An RF model with Rn, LAI and Ts as predictor variables shows the best accuracy and performance metrics, outperforming the NN model.

TI  - Navakanta Barua's Posthuman Wonderland in Siyali Palegoi Ratanpur
T2  - RUPKATHA JOURNAL ON INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the wake of the emerging body of scholarship on Posthumanism and Animality studies, the borderline between the human and the `non-human' has been `thoroughly breached'. Interestingly, one of the key areas where the boundaries between the human and the animal are problematized is the field of children's literature. Children's literature has the potential to radically challenge the anthropocentric worldview of Man as an `exceptional' being by deploying a playful, but subversive logic. The paper attempts to examine how Navakanta Barua deploys nonsense and fantasy in his novella, Siyali Palegoi Ratanpur to challenge this very prospect of human supremacy as opposed to the non-human `other'. The paper also seeks to examine how the fantastic encounters between Barua's child-protagonist and the mysterious non-human entities challenge the centrality and superiority of the ` human', and, in doing so, how the text draws attention to the complexities of our lived relations with non-human others.

TI  - Are foxes (<i>Vulpes</i> spp.) good sentinel species for <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> in northern Canada?
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In changing northern ecosystems, understanding the mechanisms of transmission of zoonotic pathogens, including the coccidian parasite Toxoplasma gondii, is essential to protect the health of vulnerable animals and humans. As high-level predators and scavengers, foxes represent a potentially sensitive indicator of the circulation of T. gondii in environments where humans co-exist. The objectives of our research were to compare serological and molecular assays to detect T. gondii, generate baseline data on T. gondii antibody and tissue prevalence in foxes in northern Canada, and compare regional seroprevalence in foxes with that in people from recently published surveys across northern Canada.Methods: Fox carcasses (Vulpes vulpes/Vulpes lagopus, n = 749) were collected by local trappers from the eastern (Labrador and Quebec) and western Canadian Arctic (northern Manitoba, Nunavut, and the Northwest Territories) during the winters of 2015-2019. Antibodies in heart fluid were detected using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Toxoplasma gondii DNA was detected in hearts and brains using a magnetic capture DNA extraction and real-time PCR assay.Results: Antibodies against T. gondii and DNA were detected in 36% and 27% of foxes, respectively. Detection of antibodies was higher in older (64%) compared to younger foxes (22%). More males (36%) than females (31%) were positive for antibodies to T. gondii. Tissue prevalence in foxes from western Nunavik (51%) was higher than in eastern Nunavik (19%). At the Canadian scale, T. gondii exposure was lower in western Inuit regions (13%) compared to eastern Inuit regions (39%), possibly because of regional differences in fox diet and/or environment. Exposure to T. gondii decreased at higher latitude and in foxes having moderate to little fat. Higher mean infection intensity was observed in Arctic foxes compared to red foxes. Fox and human seroprevalence showed similar trends across Inuit regions of Canada, but were less correlated in the eastern sub-Arctic, which may reflect regional differences in human dietary preferences.Conclusions: Our study sheds new light on the current status of T. gondii in foxes in northern Canada and shows that foxes serve as a good sentinel species for environmental circulation and, in some regions, human exposure to this parasite in the Arctic.

TI  - Sea Ice Rheology Experiment (SIREx): 1. Scaling and Statistical Properties of Sea-Ice Deformation Fields
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the sea-ice modeling community is shifting to advanced numerical frameworks, developing new sea-ice rheologies, and increasing model spatial resolution, ubiquitous deformation features in the Arctic sea ice are now being resolved by sea-ice models. Initiated at the Forum for Arctic Modeling and Observational Synthesis, the Sea Ice Rheology Experiment (SIREx) aims at evaluating state-of-the-art sea-ice models using existing and new metrics to understand how the simulated deformation fields are affected by different representations of sea-ice physics (rheology) and by model configuration. Part 1 of the SIREx analysis is concerned with evaluation of the statistical distribution and scaling properties of sea-ice deformation fields from 35 different simulations against those from the RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System (RGPS). For the first time, the viscous-plastic (and the elastic-viscous-plastic variant), elastic-anisotropic-plastic, and Maxwell-elasto-brittle rheologies are compared in a single study. We find that both plastic and brittle sea-ice rheologies have the potential to reproduce the observed RGPS deformation statistics, including multi-fractality. Model configuration (e.g., numerical convergence, atmospheric representation, spatial resolution) and physical parameterizations (e.g., ice strength parameters and ice thickness distribution) both have effects as important as the choice of sea-ice rheology on the deformation statistics. It is therefore not straightforward to attribute model performance to a specific rheological framework using current deformation metrics. In light of these results, we further evaluate the statistical properties of simulated Linear Kinematic Features in a SIREx Part 2 companion paper.

TI  - Assessing the Potential of Long, Multi-Temporal SAR Interferometry Time Series for Slope Instability Monitoring: Two Case Studies in Southern Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal SAR interferometry (MTInSAR), by providing both mean displacement maps and displacement time series over coherent objects on the Earth's surface, allows analyzing wide areas, identifying ground displacements, and studying the phenomenon evolution at a long time scale. This technique has also been proven to be very useful for detecting and monitoring slope instabilities. For this type of hazard, detection of velocity variations over short time intervals should be useful for early warning of damaging events. In this work, we present the results obtained by using both COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and Sentinel-1 (S1) data for investigating the ground stability of two hilly villages located in the Southern Italian Apennines (Basilicata region), namely the towns of Montescaglioso and Pomarico. In these two municipalities, landslides occurred in the recent past (in Montescaglioso in 2013) and more recently (in Pomarico in 2019), causing damage to houses, commercial buildings, and infrastructures. SAR datasets acquired by CSK and S1 from both ascending and descending orbits were processed using the SPINUA MTInSAR algorithm. Mean velocity maps and displacement time series were analyzed, also by means of innovative ad hoc procedures, looking, in particular, for non-linear trends. Results evidenced the presence of nonlinear displacements in correspondence of some key infrastructures. In particular, the analysis of accelerations and decelerations of PS objects corresponding to structures affected by recent stabilization measures helps to shed new light in relation to known events that occurred in the area of interest.

TI  - Parotid lymph nodes in primary malignant salivary neoplasms
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN OTOLARYNGOLOGY & HEAD AND NECK SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review To review the literature on parotid lymph nodes and their involvement in primary malignant epithelial salivary gland neoplasms (PMESGN). The parotid gland has two identifiable lymphatic systems - extraglandular and intraglandular both topographically separate but functioning as a single unit. Recent findings The publications available have concentrated on intraparotid lymph nodal metastatic (IPLN) disease only. The data reported was retrospective and observational. The limitations encountered was the variability of extent of the parotid surgery, unclear evaluation of IPLN limited or inconsistent follow-up periods, small subgroups limiting the explanatory power and the multivariate analysis. One multicentric publication reported on 289 patients with parotid PMESGN treated by surgery between 1995 and 2018 at four centres: three Italian and one in the United Kingdom. IPLN+ was proven in 22.1%, preoperative imaging failed to identify occult IPLN+ in 20.1%, IPLN+ and cervical nodal metastasis (cpN+) was 47.4% and cpN+ was 100% in patients bearing greater than 4 IPLN+ nodes. A multicentric prospective study is required detailing preoperative imaging, using a standardized surgical management, pathological specimen search, histopathological grading and patient outcome analysis specifically designed to resolve the role of IPLN in patients diagnosed with PMESGN.

TI  - Distant Theory in Comparative Literary Studies
T2  - THEORY IN ACTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper I want to propose a hermeneutical approach that I call "distant theory". I start from the premise that mythology, literature and art, especially antique, medieval and early modern, in order to be fully comprehended need a reconstruction of the respective visions of the world and of human nature in which they were created and read by their public. This is also true for modern and contemporary works, but while pre-modern metaphysical and anthropological systems have been acculturated and are no longer in use, current systems, belonging to the scientific "vulgate" of our days, are spontaneously endorsed and accepted by literary and art critics as valid and true. I call this unquestionable use by commentators of cosmological and psychological theories "close theory". In contrast, in order to avoid anachronistic mismatching of works belonging to a certain historical cultural paradigm with methods deriving from other paradigms, I propose an approach in which all ontological and psychological systems, be they antique or present, should be considered mere intellectual artefacts, "master narratives", dependent on their respective epochs. This relativistic attitude would allow a "distant approach" especially to nowadays theories, freeing the literary and art analysts of the task of having to certify themselves theories that belong to other domains.

TI  - Deforestation by Afforestation: Land Use Change in the Coastal Range of Chile
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In southern Chile, an establishment of a plantation-based forest industry occurred early in the industrial era. Forest companies claim that plantations were established on eroded lands. However, the plantation industry is under suspicion to have expanded its activities by clearing near-natural forests since the early 1970s. This paper uses a methodologically complex classification approach from own previously published research to elucidate land use dynamics in southern Chile. It uses spatial data (extended morphological profiles) in addition to spectral data from historical Landsat imagery, which are fusioned by kernel composition and then classified in a multiple classifier system (based on support, import and relevance vector machines). In a large study area (similar to 67,000 km(2)), land use change is investigated in a narrow time frame (five-year steps from 1975 to 2010) in a twoway (prospective and retrospective) analysis. The results are discussed synoptically with other results on Chile. Two conclusions can be drawn for the coastal range. Near-natural forests have always been felled primarily in favor of the plantation industry. Vice versa, industrial plantations have always been primarily established on sites, that were formerly forest covered. This refutes the claim that Chilean plantations were established primarily to restore eroded lands; also known as badlands. The article further shows that Chile is not an isolated case of deforestation by afforestation, which has occurred in other countries alike. Based on the findings, it raises the question of the extent to which the Chilean example could be replicated in other countries through afforestation by market economy and climate change mitigation.

TI  - Remote sensing of invasive alien wattle using image texture ratios in the low-lying Midlands of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of invasive alien plants (IAPs) cause dynamic structural and ecological change, since they encroach on the productivity of ecosystems with their high-water consumption, ability to rapidly spread and reduce natural biodiversity. Remote sensing techniques utilised for early detection and mapping of invasive alien wattle (Acacia mearnsii) are pivotal towards under-standing the spatial distribution of IAPs for control and management. In this study, we assessed the utility of image texture ratios computed from a 6 m SPOT-6 image combined with the sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (SPLS-DA) algorithm to detect and map invasive alien wattle, based on field information related to the presence of these invasive species. We specif-ically tested the performance of single band and multi-band texture metrices, as well as vegeta-tion indices in detecting and mapping invasive alien wattle. The results revealed that the image texture ratio model (overall accuracy = 74%; kappa statistic = 0.70) outcompeted the single image texture model (overall accuracy = 68%; kappa statistic = 0.65) and vegetation indices model (overall accuracy = 62%; kappa statistic = 0.59). The most significant texture filters selected by the SPLS-DA model were correlation, second moment and homogeneity, which were predominantly computed from the NIR and red bands. In addition, the 5 x 5 moving window was the most optimal window-size for detecting the alien invasive. Moreover, the SPLS-DA model outcompeted the partial least squares linear discriminant analysis (PLS-LDA) model in detecting invasive alien wattle over the entire study area. Overall, this study underscores the potential of image texture ratios in concert with SPLS-DA in effectively detecting and mapping invasive alien wattle.

TI  - Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 Activity with Sentinel Surveillance: Lessons Learned from the First Wave in Israel
T2  - ISRAEL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Guidelines for pandemic preparedness emphasize the role of sentinel and syndromic surveillance in monitoring pandemic spread.Objectives: To examine advantages and obstacles of utilizing a sentinel influenza surveillance system to monitor community severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) activity based on Israel's experience from mid-March to mid-May 2020.Methods: Several modifications were applied to the influenza surveillance system. The clinical component relied mainly on pneumonia and upper respiratory infection (URI) consultations with primary care physicians as well as visits to emergency departments (ED) due to pneumonia. The virological data were based on nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from symptomatic patients who visited outpatient clinics.Results: By epidemiological week 12 of 2020, the crude and age-specific primary physician consultation rates due to URI and pneumonia declined below the expected level, reaching nadir that lasted from week 15 until week 20. Similarly, ED visits due to pneumonia were significantly lower than expected from weeks 14 and 15 to week 20. The virological surveillance started on week 13 with 6/253 of the swabs (2.3%) positive for SARS-CoV-2. There was a peak of 13/225 positive swabs on week 14 (5.8%). During weeks 17-20, none of the swabs (47-97 per week) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. This trend was similar to national data.Conclusions: The virological component of the surveillance system showed the SARS-CoV-2 community spread, but had low sensitivity when virus activity was low. The clinical component, however, had no yield. Sentinel surveillance can assist in monitoring future novel pandemics and should be augmented in revised preparedness plans.

TI  - Land-Use Impact on Water Quality of the Opak Sub-Watershed, Yogyakarta, Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The integrated monitoring system of water quality is eminently reliant on water quality trend data. This study aims to obtain water quality patterns related to land-use change over a periodic observation in the Opak sub-watershed, Indonesia, both from a seasonal and spatial point of view. Landsat image data from 2013 to 2020 and water quality data comprising 25 parameters were compiled and analyzed. This study observed that land use remarkably correlated to water quality, especially the building area representing the dense population and various anthropogenic activities, to pollute the water sources. Three types of pollutant sources were identified using principal component analysis (PCA), including domestic, industrial, and agricultural activities, which all influenced the variance in river water quality. The use of spatiotemporal-based and multivariate analysis was to interpret water quality trend data, which can help the stakeholders to monitor pollution and take control in the Opak sub-watershed. The results investigated 17 out of 25 water quality parameters, which showed an increasing trend from upstream to downstream during the observation time. The concentration of biological oxygen demand over five days (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrite, sulfide, phenol, phosphate, oil and grease, lead, Escherichia coli (E. coli), and total coli, surpassed the water quality standard through spatial analysis.

TI  - Resolution Enhancement of SMAP Passive Soil Moisture Estimates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission includes a unique combination of instruments intended to provide daily global soil moisture data with high accuracy and resolution. Due to radar instrument failure, the default resolution of the data product decreased from the intended 9 km to 36 km shortly after the mission started to return data. To improve this, we employed the Scatterometer Image Reconstruction algorithm in its radiometer form (rSIR) to enhance the resolution of the radiometer brightness temperature measurements from which the soil moisture was derived. This paper compares the soil moisture estimates created from the rSIR-enhanced brightness temperatures with SMAP project radiometer L2_SM_SP and SMAP-Sentinel L2_SM_P products reported on 9 km and 3 km grids, respectively. We find that the difference of the rSIR-enhanced passive soil moisture product is generally within 0.020 cm(3) cm(-3) RMS of the 9 km SMAP radiometer L2_SM_SP and 0.045 cm(3) cm(-3) RMS of the 3 km SMAP-Sentinel L2_SM_P soil moisture products. The accuracy of the rSIR soil moisture can be improved by including better antenna pattern correction methods applied to the input TB measurements.

TI  - Monitoring the Chl-a Distribution Details in the Yangtze River Mouth Using Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the Yangtze River Mouth area was analyzed using a new Chl-a inversion model (PMS-C) based on the relationship between in situ Chl-a and GF-4 PMS band combinations. Combining GF-4 PMS with HY-C CZI, this paper revealed that: (1) Chl-a concentration in Yangtze River Mouth was in the range of 2-6 mu g/L, being higher in the west than in the east. The high Chl-a area was mainly distributed near the mouth of the Yangtze River and the Chl-a value was in the range of 3.7 mu g/L to 5.9 mu g/L. Chl-a concentration is higher in spring and summer than in autumn and winter, with a Chl-a concentration difference of 1-2 mu g/L. Chl-a downstream of islands and bridges increased by 0.5-1.7 mu g/L compared with upstream. (2) Short-term (within 3 h) changes of Chl-a concentration were effectively detected. In summer and autumn, Chl-a obtained at 13:30 in the noon was generally lower than Chl-a obtained at around 10:30 in the morning and it decreased by nearly 0.1-4 mu g/L within three hours on the same day. In winter, the concentration of Chl-a decreased in the range of 0-1.9 mu g/L. Generally, within three hours, Chl-a in the downstream of the island decreased significantly from 5 mu g/L to about 3.8 mu g/L, and Chl-a downstream of piers decreased from 3.7 mu g/L to about 3 mu g/L. (3) Environmental factors including seawater temperature, illumination, and nutrients, as well as dynamic factors such as wind and tidal current can induce Chl-a change in the Yangtze River Mouth. Short-term change of Chl-a concentration is closely related to the specific hydrodynamic conditions, nutrients, and lighting conditions.

TI  - Methylene Blue Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging in Breast Cancer Sentinel Node Biopsy
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Currently the gold standard for sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer patients is radioactive nanocolloid and a blue dye. In the age of fluorescence guided surgery new fluorophores are used and methylene blue presents some fluorescent properties. This study is the first in a clinical series presenting the possible use of methylene blue as a fluorescent dye for the identification of sentinel nodes in breast cancer sentinel node biopsy. We presented a feasibility of this new method and also in additional experiments because of the quenching effect limitation, found possible dilution of methylene blue presenting improved fluorescence. Introduction: Fluorescence-based navigation for breast cancer sentinel node biopsy is a novel method that uses indocyanine green as a fluorophore. However, methylene blue (MB) also has some fluorescent properties. This study is the first in a clinical series presenting the possible use of MB as a fluorescent dye for the identification of sentinel nodes in breast sentinel node biopsy. Material and methods: Forty-nine patients with breast cancer who underwent sentinel node biopsy procedures were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent standard simultaneous injection of nanocolloid and MB. We visualized and assessed the sentinel nodes and the lymphatic channels transcutaneously, with and without fluorescence, and calculated the signal-to-background ratio (SBR). We also analyzed the corresponding fluorescence intensity of various dilutions of MB. Results: In twenty-three patients (46.9%), the location of the sentinel node, or the end of the lymphatic path, was visible transcutaneously. The median SBR for transcutaneous sentinel node location was 1.69 (range 1.66-4.35). Lymphatic channels were visible under fluorescence in 14 patients (28.6%) prior to visualization by the naked eye, with an average SBR of 2.01 (range 1.14-5.6). The sentinel node was visible under fluorescence in 25 patients (51%). The median SBR for sentinel node visualization with MB fluorescence was 2.54 (range 1.34-6.86). Sentinel nodes were visualized faster under fluorescence during sentinel node preparation. Factors associated with the rate of visualization included diabetes (p = 0.001), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.003), and multifocality (p = 0.004). The best fluorescence was obtained using 40 mu M (0.0128 mg/mL) MB, but we also observed a clinically relevant dilution range between 20 mu M (0.0064 mg/mL) and 100 mu M (0.032 mg/mL). Conclusions: For the first time, we propose the clinical usage of MB as a fluorophore for fluorescence-guided sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer patients. The quenching effect of the dye may be the reason for its poor detection rate. Our analysis of different concentrations of MB suggests a need for a detailed clinical analysis to highlight the practical usefulness of the dye.

TI  - Monitoring rewilding from space: The Knepp estate as a case study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rewilding is increasingly considered as an option for environmental regeneration, with potential for enhancing both biodiversity and ecosystem services. So far, however, there is little practical information on how to gauge the benefits and limitations of rewilding schemes on ecosystem composition, structure and functioning. To address this knowledge gap, we explored how satellite remote sensing can contribute to informing the moni-toring and evaluation of rewilding projects, using the Knepp estate as a case study. To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the impacts of rewilding as an ecological regeneration strategy on landscape structure and functioning over several decades. Results show significant changes in land cover distribution over the past 20 years inside rewilded areas in the Knepp estate, with a 41.4% decrease in areas with brown agriculture and grass, a roughly sixfold increase in areas covered with shrubs, and a 40.9% increase in areas with trees; vegetation in the rewilded areas also showed a widespread increase in annual primary productivity. Changes in land cover and primary productivity are particularly pronounced in the part of the estate that began its rewilding journey with a period of large herbivore absence. Altogether, our approach clearly demonstrates how freely available satellite data can (1) provide vital insights about long-term changes in ecosystem composition, structure and functioning, even for small, heterogeneous and relatively intensively used landscapes; and (2) help deepen our understanding of the impacts of rewilding on vegetation distribution and dynamics, in ways that complement existing ground-based studies on the impacts of this approach on ecological communities.

TI  - Applying Google earth engine for flood mapping and monitoring in the downstream provinces of Mekong river
T2  - PROGRESS IN DISASTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood is a hazard, but it is also essential for the local communities in the Mekong Delta, as it also provides nutrients for agriculture and resists saltwater intrusion. In recent years, changes in flood patterns have been observed in the Mekong Delta with erratic fluctuations in the flooded area, especially in the downstream provinces. It causes a lot of difficulties in flood monitoring and management in this area. Therefore, a robust assessment of flood shifting is essential in the Mekong Delta. This work addresses the development of a logical model based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to assess floods in the downstream Mekong River basin. In the present study, the observed data of Tan Chau and Chau Doc hydrological stations have been used to test and prove the reliability of this application. The inundation scenario generated from this study showed a gradual shift in flooding patterns of the downstream provinces of the Mekong Delta. Overall, the flooded area is decreasing; however, the same is increasing in Bac Lieu province. This research will help to construct a professional support system to monitor the flood inundation in the Mekong Delta. They can give local authorities a big picture of inundation to decide on flood disaster preparedness, mitigation, and adaptation.

TI  - Nitrogen efficiency by soil quality and management regimes on Malawi farms: Can fertilizer use remain profitable?
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize is the primary economic and dietary staple crop for most poor farmers in Southern Africa, yet low yields have persisted in the region for decades. Intensifying maize production in a sustainable way using the same land will be increasingly important as virgin land becomes scarcer and fallowing becomes less common. This study investigates the sustainability of intensification underway in the African smallholder sector using a uniquely detailed panel survey that combines remote sensing data, soil analysis, yield cuts, GPS area measurements, and detailed field management surveys. Specifically, we quantify the on-farm yield response to nitrogen (N) fertilizer in relationship to 16 soil and field management regimes, adding to the scant literature that combines precise and objective measures of inputs, outputs, and ecological conditions on fields managed by farmers. Furthermore, we examine drivers of soil health using a measure of labile carbon that, unlike total carbon, can be responsive to farm management over the observable time period. Results are based on a representative sampling of Malawi's diverse agroecosystems through a multi-year study for over 1000 fields. We find surprisingly low yield response to N applications, high-lighting that fertilizer access alone is not sufficient for sustainable intensification. We find complimentary "good agronomy", including effective weed management, crop rotations, and organic fertilizer applications are positive influences on maize yield response to inorganic fertilizers. Encouragingly, results show management practices such as incorporating diverse crop residues and manure for a few years can raise labile carbon levels, improving the soil base on which factors jointly determine yields. These findings underscore the importance of education, livestock and crop diversification, and farmer utilization of good agronomy to improve fertilizer use efficiency as a means to promote sustainable agricultural productivity.

TI  - Diagnostic Quantification of the Cloud Water Resource in China during 2000-2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - By using the diagnostic quantification method for cloud water resource (CWR), the three-dimensional (3D) cloud fields of 1 degrees x 1 degrees resolution during 2000-2019 in China are firstly obtained based on the NCEP reanalysis data and related satellite data. Then, combined with the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) products, a 1 degrees x 1 degrees gridded CWR dataset of China in recent 20 years is established. On this basis, the monthly and annual CWR and related variables in China and its six weather modification operation sub-regions are obtained, and the CWR characteristics in different regions are analyzed finally. The results show that in the past 20 years, the annual total amount of atmospheric hydrometeors (GM(h)) and water vapor (GM(v)) in the Chinese mainland are about 838.1 and 3835.9 mm, respectively. After deducting the annual mean precipitation of China (P-s, 661.7 mm), the annual CWR is about 176.4 mm. Among the six sub-regions, the southeast region has the largest amount of cloud condensation (C-vh) and precipitation, leading to the largest GM(h) and CWR there. In contrast, the annual P-s, GM(h), and CWR are all the least in the northwest region. Furthermore, the monthly and interannual variation trends of P-s, C-vh, and GM(h) in different regions are identical, and the evolution characteristics of CWR are also consistent with the hydrometeor inflow (Q(hi)). For the north, northwest, and northeast regions, in spring and autumn the precipitation efficiency of hydrometeors (PEh) is not high (20%-60%), the renewal time of hydrometeors (RTh) is relatively long (5-25 h), and GM(h) is relatively high. Therefore, there is great potential for the development of CWR through artificial precipitation enhancement (APE). For the central region, spring, autumn, and winter are suitable seasons for CWR development. For the southeast and southwest regions, P-s and PEh in summer are so high that the development of CWR should be avoided. For different spatial scales, there are significant differences in the characteristics of CWR.

TI  - Change Detection of Amazonian Alluvial Gold Mining Using Deep Learning and Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring changes within the land surface and open water bodies is critical for natural resource management, conservation, and environmental policy. While the use of satellite imagery for these purposes is common, fine-scale change detection can be a technical challenge. Difficulties arise from variable atmospheric conditions and the problem of assigning pixels to individual objects. We examined the degree to which two machine learning approaches can better characterize change detection in the context of a current conservation challenge, artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM). We obtained Sentinel-2 imagery and consulted with domain experts to construct an open-source labeled land-cover change dataset. The focus of this dataset is the Madre de Dios (MDD) region in Peru, a hotspot of ASGM activity. We also generated datasets of active ASGM areas in other countries (Venezuela, Indonesia, and Myanmar) for out-of-sample testing. With these labeled data, we utilized a supervised (E-ReCNN) and semi-supervised (SVM-STV) approach to study binary and multi-class change within mining ponds in the MDD region. Additionally, we tested how the inclusion of multiple channels, histogram matching, and La*b* color metrics improved the performance of the models and reduced the influence of atmospheric effects. Empirical results show that the supervised E-ReCNN method on 6-Channel histogram-matched images generated the most accurate detection of change not only in the focal region (Kappa: 0.92 (+/- 0.04), Jaccard: 0.88 (+/- 0.07), F1: 0.88 (+/- 0.05)) but also in the out-of-sample prediction regions (Kappa: 0.90 (+/- 0.03), Jaccard: 0.84 (+/- 0.04), and F1: 0.77 (+/- 0.04)). While semi-supervised methods did not perform as accurately on 6- or 10-channel imagery, histogram matching and the inclusion of La*b* metrics generated accurate results with low memory and resource costs. These results show that E-ReCNN is capable of accurately detecting specific and object-oriented environmental changes related to ASGM. E-ReCNN is scalable to areas outside the focal area and is a method of change detection that can be extended to other forms of land-use modification.

TI  - Effectiveness of treatment with Pygeum africanum in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and benign prostatic hyperplasia: a cross-sectional study in the real-world clinical practice in Spain (The PROFIT Study)
T2  - ARCHIVOS ESPANOLES DE UROLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and tolerability of treatment with P africanum (P. africanum) in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in routine clinical practice.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cross-sectional observational study in which 115 patients with LUTS/BPH treated for 6 months with P. africanum (Tebetane (R) compuesto) in real-world clinical practice conditions were included. The primary objective was to assess the quality of life (QoL) according to changes in the scores of item 8 of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire (a score >= 4 indicates a significant impairment of QoL). Secondary objectives included improvement of urinary symptoms, urinary flow, satisfaction and compliance with treatment as well as tolerability. Data were collected in a single scheduled visit at 6 months of treatment with P. africanum and were compared with data registered in the medical records at the beginning of treatment.RESULTS: After 6 months of treatment with P. africanum, the percentage of patient with significant impairment of QoL was 22.6% as compared with 45.2% at the initiation of treatment (P < 0,-001). The overall IPSS score showed a mean decreas of -4,-5 points (median -4,0, interquartile range [IQR] -7,-0 to -2,0) and 69 patients (60%) showed a clinically significant improvement (reduction of >= 4 points). There were significant decreases in IPSS subscales of storage (mean -1,-8; median -2,-0, IQR -3,-0 to 0 (P < 0,-001) and voiding (mean -1,-9; median -2,-0, IQR -3,-0 to 0) (P < 0,-001) symptoms. The degree of satisfaction and compliance with treatment was high with mean scores (median) of 6,9 (7,0) and 9,2 (10), respectively in the 1-10 visual analogue scale. Treatment-related adverse effects did not occur.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with P. africanum during 6 months improved significantly QoL and LUTS in patients with BPH, with a high level of satisfaction and compliance with treatment, without adverse events.

TI  - Improving the Forecasting of Winter Wheat Yields in Northern China with Machine Learning-Dynamical Hybrid Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Ensemble Prediction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) prediction of winter wheat yields is crucial for farmers and decision-makers to reduce yield losses and ensure food security. Recently, numerous researchers have utilized machine learning (ML) methods to predict crop yield, using observational climate variables and satellite data. Meanwhile, some studies also illustrated the potential of state-of-the-art dynamical atmospheric prediction in crop yield forecasting. However, the potential of coupling both methods has not been fully explored. Herein, we aimed to establish a skilled ML-dynamical hybrid model for crop yield forecasting (MHCF v1.0), which hybridizes ML and a global dynamical atmospheric prediction system, and applied it to northern China at the S2S time scale. In this study, we adopted three mainstream machining learning algorithms (XGBoost, RF, and SVR) and the multiple linear regression (MLR) model, and three major datasets, including satellite data from MOD13C1, observational climate data from CRU, and S2S atmospheric prediction data from IAP CAS, used to predict winter wheat yield from 2005 to 2014, at the grid level. We found that, among the four models examined in this work, XGBoost reached the highest skill with the S2S prediction as inputs, scoring R-2 of 0.85 and RMSE of 0.78 t/ha 3-4 months, leading the winter wheat harvest. Moreover, the results demonstrated that crop yield forecasting with S2S dynamical predictions generally outperforms that with observational climate data. Our findings highlighted that the coupling of ML and S2S dynamical atmospheric prediction provided a useful tool for yield forecasting, which could guide agricultural practices, policy-making and agricultural insurance.

TI  - An Integrated, Tentative Remote-Sensing Approach Based on NDVI Entropy to Model Canine Distemper Virus in Wildlife and to Prompt Science-Based Management Policies
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a pathogen that affects wildlife with particular regard to Canidae family such as red foxes, wolves, etc. In this study, we focus on CDV outbreaks in the Aosta Valley territory, an alpine region in the NW of Italy which was affected by important waves of this disease during the years 2015-2020 (hereinafter called tau). Ground data are collected on the entire territory at a municipality level. The detection of the canine distemper virus is performed by means of real-time PCR. By adopting satellite remote-sensing data, we notice that CDV trends are strongly related to anomalies in the NDVI entropy changes through (tau). A tentative local model is developed concerning on-the-ground data, helping veterinarians, foresters, and wildlife ecologists enforce management health policies in a One Health perspective. Changes in land use and land cover as well as feedback on the climate deeply affect the landscape worldwide. This phenomenon has also enlarged the human-wildlife interface and amplified the risk of potential new zoonoses. The expansion of the human settlement is supposed to affect the spread and distribution of wildlife diseases such as canine distemper virus (CDV), by shaping the distribution, density, and movements of wildlife. Nevertheless, there is very little evidence in the scientific literature on how remote sensing and GIS tools may help the veterinary sector to better monitor the spread of CDV in wildlife and to enforce ecological studies and new management policies in the near future. Thus, we perform a study in Northwestern Italy (Aosta Valley Autonomous Region), focusing on the relative epidemic waves of CDV that cause a virulent disease infecting different animal species with high host mortality. CDV has been detected in several mammalian from Canidae, Mustelidae, Procyonidae, Ursidae, and Viverridae families. In this study, the prevalence is determined at 60% in red fox (Vulpes vulpes, n = 296), 14% in wolf (Canis lupus, n = 157), 47% in badger (Meles meles, n = 103), and 51% in beech marten (Martes foina, n = 51). The detection of CDV is performed by means of real-time PCR. All the analyses are done using the TaqMan approach, targeting the chromosomal gene for phosphoprotein, gene P, that is involved in the transcription and replication of the virus. By adopting Earth Observation Data, we notice that CDV trends are strongly related to an altitude gradient and NDVI entropy changes through the years. A tentative model is developed concerning the ground data collected in the Aosta Valley region. According to our preliminary study, entropy computed from remote-sensing data can represent a valuable tool to monitor CDV spread as a proxy data predictor of the intensity of fragmentation of a given landscape and therefore also to monitor CDV. In conclusion, the evaluation from space of the landscape variations regarding the wildlife ecological corridors due to anthropic or natural disturbances may assist veterinarians and wildlife ecologists to enforce management health policies in a One Health perspective by pointing out the time and spatial conditions of interaction between wildlife. Surveillance and disease control actions are supposed to be carried out to strengthen the usage of geospatial analysis tools and techniques. These tools and techniques can deeply assist in better understanding and monitoring diseases affecting wildlife thanks to an integrated management approach.

TI  - Cyclicity in Earth sciences, quo vadis? Essay on cycle concepts in geological thinking and their historical influence on stratigraphic practices
T2  - HISTORY OF GEO- AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The archetype of a cycle has played an essential role in explaining observations of nature over thousands of years. At present, this perception significantly influences the worldview of modern societies, including several areas of science. In the Earth sciences, the concept of cyclicity offers simple analytical solutions in the face of complex events and their respective products, in both time and space. Current stratigraphic research integrates several methods to identify repetitive patterns in the stratigraphic record and to interpret oscillatory geological processes. This essay proposes a historical review of the cyclic conceptions from the earliest phases in the Earth sciences to their subsequent evolution into current stratigraphic principles and practices, contributing to identifying opportunities in integrating methodologies and developing future research mainly associated with quantitative approaches.

TI  - Using Satellite-Based Data to Facilitate Consistent Monitoring of the Marine Environment around Ireland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an island nation, Ireland needs to ensure effective management measures to protect marine ecosystems and their services, such as the provision of fishery resources. The characterization of marine waters using satellite data can contribute to a better understanding of variations in the upper ocean and, consequently, the effect of their changes on species populations. In this study, nineteen years (1998-2016) of monthly data of essential climate variables (ECVs), chlorophyll (Chl-a), and the diffuse attenuation coefficient (K490) were used, together with previous analyses of sea surface temperature (SST), to investigate the temporal and spatial variability of surface waters around Ireland. The study area was restricted to specific geographically delineated divisions, as defined by the International Council of the Exploration of the Seas (ICES). The results showed that SST and Chl-a were positively and significantly correlated in ICES divisions corresponding to oceanic waters, while in coastal divisions, SST and Chl-a showed a significant negative correlation. Chl-a and K490 were positively correlated in all cases, suggesting an important role of phytoplankton in light attenuation. Chl-a and K490 had significant trends in most of the divisions, reaching maximum values of 1.45% and 0.08% per year, respectively. The strongest seasonal Chl-a trends were observed in divisions VIId and VIIe (the English Channel), primarily in the summer months, followed by northern divisions VIa (west of Scotland) and VIb (Rockall) in the winter months.

TI  - Entropy Estimators in SAR Image Classification
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data are essential for understanding environmental dynamics, for their forecasting, and for early detection of disasters. Microwave remote sensing sensors complement the information provided by observations in the optical spectrum, with the advantage of being less sensitive to adverse atmospherical conditions and of carrying their own source of illumination. On the one hand, new generations and constellations of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors provide images with high spatial and temporal resolution and excellent coverage. On the other hand, SAR images suffer from speckle noise and need specific models and information extraction techniques. In this sense, the G(0) family of distributions is a suitable model for SAR intensity data because it describes well areas with different degrees of texture. Information theory has gained a place in signal and image processing for parameter estimation and feature extraction. Entropy stands out as one of the most expressive features in this realm. We evaluate the performance of several parametric and non-parametric Shannon entropy estimators as input for supervised and unsupervised classification algorithms. We also propose a methodology for fine-tuning non-parametric entropy estimators. Finally, we apply these techniques to actual data.

TI  - Detecting Fire-Caused Forest Loss in a Moroccan Protected Area
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a concern for the sustainability of dry forests such as those of the Mediterranean region, especially under warming climate and high human use. We used data derived from Landsat and MODIS sensors to assess forest changes in the Talassemtane National Park (TNP) in North Africa from 2003-2018. The Talassemtane National Park is a protected area in northern Morocco, a biodiverse, mountainous region with endemic species of concern such as the Moroccan fir (Abies marocana) and Barbary macaque (Macaca sylvanus). To help the managers of the TNP better understand how the forest has been impacted by fire vs. other disturbances, we combined information from remotely derived datasets. The Hansen Global Forest Change (GFC) data are a global resource providing annual forest change, but without specifying the causes of change. We compared the GFC data to MODIS wildfire data from Andela's Global Fire Atlas (GFA), a new global tool to identify fire locations and progression. We also analyzed surface reflectance-corrected Landsat imagery to calculate fire severity and vegetation death using Relative Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio analysis (RdNBR). In the park, GFC data showed a net loss of 1695 ha over 16 years, corresponding to an approximately 0.3% annual loss of forest. The GFA identified nine large fires that covered 4440 ha in the study period, coinciding with 833 ha of forest loss in the same period. Within these fires, detailed image analysis showed that GFA fire boundaries were approximately correct, providing the first quantitative test of GFA accuracy outside North America. High-severity fire, as determined by RdNBR analysis, made up about 32% of burned area. Overall, the GFA was validated as a useful management tool with only one non-detected wildfire in the study period; wildfires were linked to approximately 49% of the forest loss. This information helps managers develop conservation strategies based on reliable data about forest threats.

TI  - The Use of Machine Learning Algorithms in Urban Tree Species Classification
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees are the key components of urban vegetation in cities. The timely and accurate identification of existing urban tree species with their location is the most important task for improving air, water, and land quality; reducing carbon accumulation; mitigating urban heat island effects; and protecting soil and water balance. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is frequently used for extracting high-resolution structural information regarding tree objects. LiDAR systems are a cost-effective alternative to the traditional ways of identifying tree species, such as field surveys and aerial photograph interpretation. The aim of this work was to assess the usage of machine learning algorithms for classifying the deciduous (broadleaf) and coniferous tree species from 3D raw LiDAR data on the Davutpasa Campus of Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey. First, ground, building, and low, medium, and high vegetation classes were acquired from raw LiDAR data using a hierarchical-rule-based classification method. Next, individual tree crowns were segmented using a mean shift clustering algorithm from high vegetation points. A total of 25 spatial- and intensity-based features were utilized for support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifiers to discriminate deciduous and coniferous tree species in the urban area. The machine learning-based classification's overall accuracies were 80%, 83.75%, and 73.75% for the SVM, RF, and MLP classifiers, respectively, in split 70/30 (training/testing). The SVM and RF algorithms generally gave better classification results than the MLP algorithm for identifying the urban tree species.

TI  - Mapping Tidal Flats of the Bohai and Yellow Seas Using Time Series Sentinel-2 Images and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal flats are one of the most productive ecosystems on Earth, providing essential ecological and economical services. Because of the increasing anthropogenic interruption and sea level rise, tidal flats are under great threat. However, updated and large-scale accurate tidal flat maps around the Bohai and Yellow Seas are still relatively rare, hindering the assessment and management of tidal flats. Based on time-series Sentinel-2 imagery and Google Earth Engine (GEE), we proposed a new method for tidal flat mapping with the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) extremum composite around the Bohai and Yellow Seas. Tidal flats were derived from the differences of maximum and minimum water extent composites. Overall, 3477 images acquired from 1 Oct 2020 to 31 Oct 2021 produced a tidal flat map around the Bohai and Yellow Seas with an overall accuracy of 94.55% and total area of 546,360.2 ha. The resultant tidal flat map at 10 m resolution, currently one of the most updated products around the Bohai and Yellow Seas, could facilitate the process of sustainable policy making related to tidal flats and will help reveal the processes and mechanisms of its responses to natural and human disturbance.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Neural Network for Rice Field Classification from SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is an important regional economic industry in Asian regions. Ensuring food security and stabilizing the food supply are a priority. In response to the frequent occurrence of natural disasters caused by global warming in recent years, the Agriculture and Food Agency (AFA) in Taiwan has conducted agricultural and food surveys to address those issues. To improve the accuracy of agricultural and food surveys, AFA uses remote sensing technology to conduct surveys on the planting area of agricultural crops. Unlike optical images that are easily disturbed by rainfall and cloud cover, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images will not be affected by climatic factors, which makes them more suitable for the forecast of crops production. This research proposes a novel spatial-temporal neural network called a convolutional long short-term memory rice field classifier (ConvLSTM-RFC) for rice field classification from Sentinel-1A SAR images of Yunlin and Chiayi counties in Taiwan. The proposed model ConvLSTM-RFC is implemented with multiple convolutional long short-term memory attentions blocks (ConvLSTM Att Block) and a bi-tempered logistic loss function (BiTLL). Moreover, a convolutional block attention module (CBAM) was added to the residual structure of the ConvLSTM Att Block to focus on rice detection in different periods on SAR images. The experimental results of the proposed model ConvLSTM-RFC have achieved the highest accuracy of 98.08% and the rice false positive is as low as 15.08%. The results indicate that the proposed ConvLSTM-RFC produces the highest area under curve (AUC) value of 88% compared with other related models.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Numerical Modeling of Flow Hydrodynamics and Cohesive Sediment Transport in Enid Lake, Mississippi
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Enid Lake is one of the largest reservoirs located in Yazoo River Basin, the largest basin in the state of Mississippi. The lake was impounded by Enid Dam on the Yocona River in Yalobusha County and covers an area of 30 square kilometers. It provides significant natural and recreational resources. The soils in this region are highly erodible, resulting in a large amount of fine-grained cohesive sediment discharged into the lake. In this study, a 3D numerical model was developed to simulate the free surface hydrodynamics and transportation of cohesive sediment with a median diameter of 0.0025 to 0.003 mm in Enid Lake. Flow fields in the lake are generally induced by wind and upstream river inflow, and the sediment is also introduced from the inflow during storm events. The general processes of sediment flocculation and settling were considered in the model, and the erosion rate and deposition rate of cohesive sediment were calculated. In this model, the sediment simulation was coupled with flow simulation. In this research, remote sensing technology was applied to estimate the sediment concentration at the lake surface and provide validation data for numerical model simulation. The model results and remote sensing data help us to understand the transport, deposition and resuspension processes of cohesive sediment in large reservoirs due to wind-induced currents and upstream river flows.

AB  - Indigenous peoples have expressed on several occasions the main challenges they face as guardians of their territories, insisting that they must be heard and addressed, strengthening dialogue between all actors, in order to safeguard life and permanence in their territories. Protecting the rights of indigenous peoples over their territories is essential to protect the world's biodiversity, protect threatened ecosystems and restore degraded lands. Strengthening dialogue processes has never been so urgent. At present, ancestral knowledge in agriculture, mining, astronomy, hunting, fishing, construction, hydraulics, and health care, among others, has been replaced by science, technology, and the great scientific discoveries that separate these peoples from modern society, often marginalizing and silencing them. For what it outlines as a problematic situation, for what is established as the Main Objective: to define specific activities that allow training and stimulating adequate behavior so that each citizen respects and values what surrounds him from the heritage inherited by indigenous peoples, and thus pass on their life stories to future generations.

TI  - Intelligent Mining of Urban Ventilated Corridor Based on Digital Surface Model under the Guidance of K-Means
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the acceleration of urbanization, climate problems affecting human health and safe operation of cities have intensified, such as heat island effect, haze, and acid rain. Using high-resolution remote sensing mapping image data to design scientific and efficient algorithms to excavate and plan urban ventilation corridors and improve urban ventilation environment is an effective way to solve these problems. In this paper, we use unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tilt photography technology to obtain high-precision remote sensing image digital elevation model (DEM) and digital surface model (DSM) data, count the city's dominant wind direction in each season using long-term meteorological data, and use building height to calculate the dominant wind direction. The projection algorithm calculates the windward area density of this dominant direction. Under the guidance of K-means, the binarized windward area density map is used to determine each area and boundary of potential ventilation corridors within the threshold range, and the length and angle of each area's fitted elliptical long axis are calculated to extract the ventilation corridors that meet the criteria. On the basis of high-precision stereo remote sensing data from UAV, the paper uses image classification, segmentation, fitting, and fusion algorithms to intelligently mine potential urban ventilation corridors, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a case study in Zhuji City, Zhejiang Province.

TI  - Nitrous Oxide Profile Retrievals from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder and Validation
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an algorithm for the retrieval of nitrous oxide profiles from the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) on the Earth Observing System (EOS)/Aqua using a nonlinear optimal estimation method. First, an improved Optimal Sensitivity Profile (OSP) algorithm for channel selection is proposed based on the weighting functions and the transmissions of the target gas and interfering gases, with 13 channels selected for inversion in this algorithm. Next, the data of the High-Performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research (HIAPER) Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) aircraft and the Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) are used to verify the retrieval results, including the atmospheric nitrous oxide profile and the column concentration. The results show that using AIRS satellite data, the atmospheric nitrous oxide profile between 300-900 hPa can be well retrieved with an accuracy of similar to 0.1%, which agrees with the corresponding Jacobian peak interval of selected channels. Analysis of the AIRS retrievals demonstrates that the AIRS measurements provide useful information to capture the spatial and temporal variations in nitrous oxide between 300-900 hPa.

TI  - Satellite Observed Spatial and Temporal Variabilities of Particulate Organic Carbon in the East China Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigate spatial and temporal variabilities of particulate organic carbon (POC) in the East China Sea (ECS) and explore the dominant influencing factors for its three subregions-coastal, continental shelf and open sea-by analyzing satellite derived POC from 2001 to 2011 after calibration against in situ samplings. The analysis reveals that the largest POC occurs in spring at the coastal region with a value of 297.5 mg m(-3), and the smallest in summer at the open sea region with a value of 108.9 mg m(-3). POC in the coastal region is dominated by biological activity related to river discharge of nutrients and organic matter, and is regulated by sediment discharge variation due to the Three Gorge Project and chemical fertilizer application along the Changjiang River watershed; the open sea region is dominated by water exchange with the Kuroshio current, which results in the highest sea surface temperature and the lowest chlorophyll and POC among the three subregions; POC in the continental shelf region is driven by the seasonal competition between the influence of the coastal ocean and the Kuroshio current through biological activity and water exchange. A method to estimate the organic matter reserve in the ECS was developed based on satellite data and in situ samplings. Organic carbon storage was estimated at 4.08 x 10(13) g, which could be used as a baseline for future estimates. An improved estimation could be found with additional in situ data and with the use of a more sophisticated algorithm for satellite POC analysis.

TI  - Surface Deformation Associated with the 22 August 1902 Mw 7.7 Atushi Earthquake in the Southwestern Tian Shan, Revealed from Multiple Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 22 August 1902 Mw 7.7 Atushi earthquake is the most disastrous seismic event in the southwestern Tian Shan. However, the spatial distribution of surface rupture zones as well as the geometric feature of surface deformation remain unclear, and the seismogenic fault is still controversial. Based on geologic and geomorphic interpretations of multiple remote sensing imaging data, high-resolution DEM data derived from UAV imaging complemented by field investigations, we mapped two sub-parallel NEE-trending surface rupture zones with a total length of 108 km. In addition, similar to 60 km and similar to 48 km surface rupture zones are distributed along the pre-existing Atushi fault (ATF) and the Keketamu fault (KTF), respectively. The surface deformations are mainly characterized as bedrock scarp, hanging wall collapse scarp, pressure ridge, and thrust-related fold scarps along the two south-dipping thrust faults, which are defined as the seismogenic structure of the 1902 Mw 7.7 Atushi earthquake. Thus, we proposed the cascading-rupture model to explain the multiple rupture zones generated by the 1902 Mw 7.7 Atushi earthquake. Moreover, the multiple advanced remote sensing mapping techniques can provide a promising approach to recover the geometric and geomorphic features of the surface deformation caused by large seismic events in the arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - Self-Supervised Stereo Matching Method Based on SRWP and PCAM for Urban Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a self-supervised stereo matching method based on superpixel random walk pre-matching (SRWP) and parallax-channel attention mechanism (PCAM). Our method is divided into two stages, training and testing. First, in the training stage, we obtain pre-matching results of stereo images based on superpixel random walk, and some matching points with high confidence are selected as labeled samples. Then, a stereo matching network is constructed to describe the matching correlation by calculating the attention scores of any two points between different images through the parallax-channel attention mechanism, superimposing the scores of each layer to calculate the disparity. The network is trained using the labeled samples and some unsupervised constraint criteria. Finally, in the testing stage, the trained network is used to obtain stereo matching relations of stereo images. The proposed method does not need manually labeled training samples and is more suitable for 3D reconstruction under mass satellite remote sensing data. Comparative experiments on multiple datasets show that our method has a stereo matching EPE of 2.44 and a 3D reconstruction RMSE of 2.36 m. Especially in the weak texture and parallax abrupt change regions, we can achieve more advanced performance than other methods.

TI  - Impacts of Land Use Changes on Net Primary Productivity in Urban Agglomerations under Multi-Scenarios Simulation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use is closely related to the sustainability of ecological development. This paper employed a patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model for the multi-scenario simulation of urban agglomerations. In addition, mathematical analysis methods such as Theil-Sen Median trend analysis, R/S analysis, Getis-Ord Gi* index and unary linear regression were used to study the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of net primary productivity (NPP) for the impact of land use changes on NPP in urban agglomerations from 2000 to 2020 and to forecast the future trend of NPP. The results indicate that urban expansion is obvious in the baseline scenario and in the ecological protection scenario. In the scenario of cropland protection, the urban expansion is consistent with the land use plan of the government for 2035. The NPP in Beijing decreased gradually from northwest to southeast. The hot spot areas are concentrated in the densely forested areas in the mountainous areas of northwest. The cold spot areas are mainly concentrated in the periphery of urban areas and water areas. The NPP will continue to increase in forest and other areas under protection and remain stable in impervious surfaces. The NPP of Beijing showed a strong improvement trend and this trend will continue with the right ecological management and urban planning of the government. The study of land use in urban agglomeration and the development trend of vegetation NPP in the future can help policymakers rationally manage future land use dynamics and maintain the sustainable development of urban regional ecosystems.

TI  - All-Sky 1 km MODIS Land Surface Temperature Reconstruction Considering Cloud Effects Based on Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A high spatio-temporal resolution land surface temperature (LST) is necessary for various research fields because LST plays a crucial role in the energy exchange between the atmosphere and the ground surface. The moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST has been widely used, but it is not available under cloudy conditions. This study proposed a novel approach for reconstructing all-sky 1 km MODIS LST in South Korea during the summer seasons using various data sources, considering the cloud effects on LST. In South Korea, a Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS) with a relatively high spatial resolution of 1.5 km has been operated since 2013. The LDAPS model's analysis data, binary MODIS cloud cover, and auxiliary data were used as input variables, while MODIS LST and cloudy-sky in situ LST were used together as target variables based on the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) approach. As a result of spatial five-fold cross-validation using MODIS LST, the proposed model had a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.89-0.91 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.11-1.39 degrees C during the daytime, and an R-2 of 0.96-0.97 with an RMSE of 0.59-0.60 degrees C at nighttime. In addition, the reconstructed LST under the cloud was evaluated using leave-one-station-out cross-validation (LOSOCV) using 22 weather stations. From the LOSOCV results under cloudy conditions, the proposed LightGBM model had an R-2 of 0.55-0.63 with an RMSE of 2.41-3.00 degrees C during the daytime, and an R-2 of 0.70-0.74 with an RMSE of 1.31-1.36 degrees C at nighttime. These results indicated that the reconstructed LST has higher accuracy than the LDAPS model. This study also demonstrated that cloud cover information improved the cloudy-sky LST estimation accuracy by adequately reflecting the heterogeneity of the relationship between LST and input variables under clear and cloudy skies. The reconstructed all-sky LST can be used in a variety of research applications including weather monitoring and forecasting.

TI  - Improving Ocean Forecasting Using Deep Learning and Numerical Model Integration
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel method to enhance the accuracy of a real-time ocean forecasting system. The proposed system consists of a real-time restoration system of satellite ocean temperature based on a deep generative inpainting network (GIN) and assimilation of satellite data with the initial fields of the numerical ocean model. The deep learning real-time ocean forecasting system is as fast as conventional forecasting systems, while also showing enhanced performance. Our results showed that the difference in temperature between in situ observation and actual forecasting results was improved by about 0.5 degrees C in daily average values in the open sea, which suggests that cutting back the temporal gaps between data assimilation and forecasting enhances the accuracy of the forecasting system in the open ocean. The proposed approach can provide more accurate forecasts with an efficient operation time.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node detection: A tremendous example of de-escalation in surgical oncology
T2  - BULLETIN DE L ACADEMIE NATIONALE DE MEDECINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Malignant solid tumors present a risk of lymph node diffusion. Lymphadenectomy brings information about lymph node involvement without any proved increase of overall survival. Systematic lymphadenectomies provide pain, lymphedema, seromas, abscesses and quality of life impairment. Sentinel lymph node dissection is a targeted lymph node surgery with less scare, less morbidity and short hospital stay. Thus, this targeted lymph node surgery allows getting lymph node involvement information with less morbidity than lymphadenectomy. Sentinel lymph node dissection is part of surgical de-escalation efforts in surgical oncology. It is mandatory to prove, through clinical trials, equivalence between sentinel lymph node and lymphadenectomy to recommend sentinel lymph node dissection as a standard surgical procedure instead of lymphadenectomy. The main goal of the current review is to highlight different cancer for which sentinel lymph node has replaced lymphadenectomy in standard guidelines and point example where sentinel lymph node could be outdated.

TI  - Increased Water Abstraction and Climate Change Have Substantial Effect on Morphometry, Salinity, and Biotic Communities in Lakes: Examples from the Semi-Arid Burdur Basin (Turkey)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming and altered precipitation patterns are predicted to intensify the water loss in semi-arid and arid regions, and such regions in Turkey will be particularly affected. Moreover, water abstraction, not least for irrigation purposes, is expected to increase markedly, posing major threats to the water balance of the lakes and thus their biodiversity. Among the closed basins in Turkey, the Burdur Closed Basin (BCB), located in the southwest of Turkey, is expected to be most affected. The BCB includes several types of aquatic ecosystems which support high biodiversity, including one Ramsar site, six Important Bird Areas, and a considerable richness of native and endemic fish species. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the potential environmental impacts of climate change and increased water abstraction on BCB lakes and their biotic communities. Here, we combined historical data on ecosystems as well as meteorological, remote sensing, and ground-truth data to analyze the changes in the temperature and precipitation of the BCB, water surface areas, and land use, as well as the potential effects on waterbird and fish communities. We calculated the water budget to elucidate water availability in the basin over the last few decades and predicted future conditions based on rainfall and temperature forecasts using climate models. The Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was used to relate the water surface area to precipitation and temperature change in the basin. Crop-farming irrigation in the BCB has increased notably since 2004, leading to intensive water abstraction from the lakes and their inflows, as well as from ground water, to meet the increased demand for irrigation. The water abstraction from the lakes, inflows to the lakes, and the groundwater in the basin has increased the water loss in the catchment substantially. Remotely sensed data on lake surface areas showed a major shrinkage of shallow lakes in the last 40 years. Moreover, the largest lake in the basin, Lake Burdur, lost nearly half of its surface area, which is worrisome since the shallower areas are the most suitable for supporting high biodiversity. Climate models (CNRM-ESM2-1GCM for temperature and GFDL-ESM4-GCM for precipitation) suggest that from 2070, the BCB will face long-term, moderate-to-severe dry periods. This, and the increased demand for water for irrigation, along with climate change, may accelerate the drying of these lakes in the near future with devastating effects on the lake ecosystems and their biodiversity.

TI  - Sentinel-1 based deformation mapping and monitoring experiences: state-of-the-art and future perspectives
T2  - ITALIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL-RIVISTA ITALIANA DI GEOTECNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground deformations, e.g. slope instability, regional and local subsidence and anthropogenic modifications of the landscape, are among the major threats for urban and social developments. Every year the damage related to such geohazards accounts for conspicuous amounts of money. Italy is uninterruptedly affected by ground deformations, and the efforts spent to prevent these events and the related consequences make it a forefront country for the monitoring of the territory. One of the most important advancements is represented by the spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. SAR-based monitoring enables accurate measurement of surface deformation over large areas, depending also on the revisiting time of the satellite constellation. The launch of the Sentinel-1 mission, characterized by a 6-days repeat pass, made possible the upgrade from a static view of the territory to a continuous streaming of ground motion measurements. The first continuous monitoring performed through Sentinel-1 data in the framework of an operational monitoring service were developed on three Italian Regions (firstly in Tuscany and then in Valle d'Aosta and Veneto), are presented. The operational chain is organized in four steps: i) generation of Sentinel-1 ground deformation maps including displacement Time Series (TS); ii) detection of "anomalous" points, i.e., targets showing a change in the deformation trend; iii) classification of the "anomalies", according to the type of deformation; iv) warning of local authorities in case of persistent and significant anomalous trends requiring field checks. These first experiences were useful to detect recurrent patterns of deformation, giving also the possibility to comprehend the spatial distribution pattern of the anomalies. So far, most of data were useful to spot unstable areas or to capture pre- and post-failure signs, however the potential of the Sentinel-1 for the detection of pre-failure accelerating creep has been recently proved through some retrospective InSAR analysis, as testified by the case of the Xinmo landslide (China). Such event occurred on 24 June 2017, and Sentinel-1 data demonstrated that an accurate estimation of the time of collapse was already possible at the beginning of June. This result shows that satellite radar data, systematically acquired over large areas with short revisiting time, could be used not only for mapping, monitoring and, for some typologies of slow sliding phenomena, for implementing a warning system of unstable areas.

TI  - Machine Learning for Defining the Probability of Sentinel-1 Based Deformation Trend Changes Occurrence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous monitoring of displacements occurring on the Earth surface by exploiting MTInSAR (Multi Temporal Interferometry SAR) Sentinel-1 data is a solid reality, as testified by the ongoing operational ground motion service in the Tuscany region (Central Italy). In this framework, anomalies of movement, i.e., accelerations or deceleration as seen by the time series of displacement of radar targets, are identified. In this work, a Machine Learning algorithm such as the Random Forest has been used to assess the probability of occurrence of the anomalies induced by slope instability and subsidence. About 20,000 anomalies (about 7000 and 13,000 for the slope instability and the subsidence, respectively) were collected between 2018 and 2020 and were used as input, while ten different variables were selected, five related to the morphological and geological setting of the study area and five to the radar characteristics of the data. The resulting maps may provide useful indications of where a sudden change of displacement trend may occur, analyzing the contribution of each factor. The cross-validation with the anomalies collected in a following timespan (2020-2021) and with official landslide and subsidence inventories provided by the regional authority has confirmed the reliability of the final maps. The adoption of a map for assessing the probability of the occurrence of MTInSAR anomalies may serve as an enhanced geohazard prevention measurement, to be periodically updated and refined in order to have the most precise knowledge possible of the territory.

TI  - Visual Story Bird Spirit by Fredy Chinkangana
T2  - TERCIO CRECIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - During the year 2020, in the context of the health emergency of COVID-19, the need to establish ties between poetic text and graphic illustration emerges, with the initial objective of experimenting with new forms of construction of artistic knowledge, through manual and digital tools of editing to generate knowledge from visual expression. Experience translated into a series of visual registers, such as sketches and drawings accompanied by poetic stories that configure an imaginary and symbolic world populated by characters and settings far from human sensibility and experience.Chinkangana's "Spirit of the Bird" (2010) is a poetic story loaded with "pure literature, pure creation, what human beings lack so much: so sane, so calculated, so little instinctive" (Sierra, 2017). Story that through oral language and visual language refers to an increasingly remote world, punished, mistreated and undermined by the irrational action of the human being. And that in full confinement emerges as a heartbreaking cry from a resignified orality with images that take on a life of their own apart from a present incapable of respecting the past memory of native peoples: "I dedicate these songs to the struggle and resistance of our native peoples in Colombia and America; to the grandfathers and grandmothers who have known how to keep their wisdom in a safe place to be taking it out in the most difficult moments of our journey "(Chinkangana, 2010, p.10).In this way, text and image make up a visual story made up of "seven acts" that represent the poem "Bird Spirit" by Chinkangana (2010) in different fragments. Story that shows the need to belong to a Mother Earth, from which we have expelled ourselves to create spaces that satisfy a walk away from oral traditions. Language that allows to preserve the ethnic nature, philosophical reasons and worldview the life of indigenous peoples, whose holistic vision of nature plays a fundamental role in the life cycle of indigenous peoples, to transcend the limit of individual or collective physical well-being that puts us in contact with the spiritual essence of life itself (Moreno Rangel and Olmos Zamudio, 2014, pp. 30-31).

TI  - Assessing the performance of MODIS and VIIRS active fire products in the monitoring of wildfires: a case study in Turkey
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS and VIIRS fire products have been widely used to detect and monitor fire activity at a global scale, as they provide highly relevant information on fire events, on their spatial and seasonal trends. Although these products have some limitations in detecting fires in forested areas due to closed canopy and smoke, they have been widely used to monitor and assess forest fires in many scientific studies. This study analyzes the performance of MODIS (MCDI4ML) and VIIRS S-NPP (VNPI4IMG) active fire/hotspot products in fire detection in five different land cover types (closed and open forests, shrublands, herbaceous vegetation and croplands) and compares the results to the ground-based fire database from 2015 to end of the 2019 in Turkey. Detected fires with a confidence value above 30% (nominal and high confidence) were used in the study. The land cover was assessed using the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) Dynamic Land Cover Layers at 100 m resolution in the study area. The performance assessment of two fire/hotspot products were conducted in three fire size classes, namely: fire size <1 ha, 1 to 10 ha, and >10 ha in five different land cover types. The results indicated that the overall accuracy of MODIS ranged from 0.6% to 16.6% and VIIRS S-NPP ranged from 1.3% to 25.6% of all ground-based fires in five different land cover types. The detection rates increased as the fire size increased. This study indicates that some limitations still exist to use MODIS and VIIRS S-NPP active fire/hotspot data in the assessment of wildfires.

TI  - Spatially Stratified and Multi-Stage Approach for National Land Cover Mapping Based on Sentinel-2 Data and Expert Knowledge
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Portugal is building a land cover monitoring system to deliver land cover products annually for its mainland territory. This paper presents the methodology developed to produce a prototype relative to 2018 as the first land cover map of the future annual map series (COSsim). A total of thirteen land cover classes are represented, including the most important tree species in Portugal. The mapping approach developed includes two levels of spatial stratification based on landscape dynamics. Strata are analysed independently at the higher level, while nested sublevels can share data and procedures. Multiple stages of analysis are implemented in which subsequent stages improve the outputs of precedent stages. The goal is to adjust mapping to the local landscape and tackle specific problems or divide complex mapping tasks in several parts. Supervised classification of Sentinel-2 time series and post-classification analysis with expert knowledge were performed throughout four stages. The overall accuracy of the map is estimated at 81.3% (+/- 2.1) at the 95% confidence level. Higher thematic accuracy was achieved in southern Portugal, and expert knowledge significantly improved the quality of the map.

TI  - Comparison of Different Sampling Methods to Catch Lymphatic Filariasis Vectors in a Sudan Savannah Area of Mali
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a need for better tools to monitor the transmission of lymphatic filariasis and malaria in areas undergoing interventions to interrupt transmission. Therefore, mosquito collection methods other than human landing catch (HLC) are needed. This study aimed to compare the Ifakara tent trap type C (ITTC) and the Biogents sentinel trap (BGST) to the HLC in areas with different vector densities. Mosquitoes were collected in two villages in Mali from July to December in 2011 and 2012. The three methods were implemented at each site with one ITTC, one BGST, and one HLC unit that consisted of one room with two collectors-one indoor and the other outdoor. The Anopheles collected in 2011 were individually dissected, whereas those from 2012 were screened in pools using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to determine the maximum infection prevalence likelihood (MIPL) for Wuchereria bancrofti and Plasmodium falciparum. The dissection of the females also allowed to assess the parity rates, as well its results. Over the 2 years, the HLC method collected 1,019 Anopheles, yields that were 34- and 1.5-fold higher than those with the BGST and ITTC, respectively. None of the dissected Anopheles were infected. The RT-PCR results showed comparable MIPL between HLC and ITTC for W. bancrofti with one infected pool from each trap's yield (respectively 0.03% [0.0009-0.2%] and 0.04% [0.001-0.2%]). For P. falciparum, no infected pool was recovered from BGST. The ITTC is a good alternative to HLC for xenomonitoring of program activities.

TI  - High Spatiotemporal Resolution PM2.5 Concentration Estimation with Machine Learning Algorithm: A Case Study for Wildfire in California
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an aggregate of suspended particulate matter in the air, atmospheric aerosols can affect the regional climate. With the help of satellite remote sensing technology to retrieve AOD (aerosol optical depth) on a global or regional scale, accurate estimation of PM2.5 concentration has become an important task to quantify the spatiotemporal distribution of AOD and PM2.5. However, due to the limitations of satellite platforms, sensors, and inversion algorithms, the spatiotemporal resolution of current major AOD products is still relatively low. Meanwhile, for the impact of cloud, the AOD products often have a serious data gap problem, which also objectively limits the spatiotemporal coverage of predicted PM2.5 concentration. Therefore, how to effectively improve the spatiotemporal resolution and coverage of PM2.5 concentration under the requisite accuracy is still a grand challenge. In this study, the fused high spatial-temporal resolution AOD data in our previous study were used to estimate the ground PM2.5 concentration through machine learning algorithms, the deep belief network (DBN). The PM2.5 data had spatiotemporal autocorrelation in geostatistics and followed the Gaussian kernel distribution. Hence, the autocorrelation model modified by Gaussian kernel function integrated with DBN algorithm, named Geoi-DBN, was used to estimate PM2.5 concentration. The cross-validation results showed that the Geoi-DBN (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 6.84 mu g m(-3)) performed better than the original DBN (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 10.46 mu g m(-3)). The final high quality PM2.5 concentration data can be applied for urban air quality monitoring and related PM2.5 exposure risk assessment such as wildfire.

TI  - QDA-System: A Cloud-Based System for Monitoring Water Quality in Brazilian Hydroelectric Reservoirs from Space
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the QDA-System (Sistema Qualidade da agua, from Portuguese), a system developed to monitor the quality of surface waters in Brazilian hydroelectric reservoirs using satellite images and cloud computing services. The development requirements of the QDA-System considered its use for operational monitoring purposes, with all processing steps automated, and a user-friendly interface to access and query the data generated automatically by the system. A pilot application of the QDA-System was customized and implemented for monitoring the Foz do Chapeco hydroelectric reservoir located in southern Brazil. For the pilot application, the QDA-System was customized to estimate nine water quality parameters,: five were estimated directly from Sentinel-2 multispectral images and four were estimated indirectly. We expect that in the near future the QDA-System can be replicated to monitor other Brazilian reservoirs, bringing benefits and cost reduction related to water quality monitoring, not only for the sector of hydroelectric generation but for other sectors that also need similar monitoring, such as sanitation and aquaculture production.

TI  - Monitoring crop phenology with street-level imagery using computer vision
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Street-level imagery holds a significant potential to scale-up in-situ data collection. This is enabled by combining the use of cheap high-quality cameras with recent advances in deep learning compute solutions to derive relevant thematic information. We present a framework to collect and extract crop type and phenological information from street level imagery using computer vision. Monitoring crop phenology is critical to assess gross primary productivity and crop yield. During the 2018 growing season, high-definition pictures were captured with side looking action cameras in the Flevoland province of the Netherlands. Each month from March to October, a fixed 200-km route was surveyed collecting one picture per second resulting in a total of 400,000 geo-tagged pictures. At 220 specific parcel locations, detailed on the spot crop phenology observations were recorded for 17 crop types (including bare soil, green manure, and tulips): bare soil, carrots, green manure, grassland, grass seeds, maize, onion, potato, summer barley, sugar beet, spring cereals, spring wheat, tulips, vegetables, winter barley, winter cereals and winter wheat. Furthermore, the time span included specific pre-emergence parcel stages, such as differently cultivated bare soil for spring and summer crops as well as post-harvest cultivation practices, e.g. green manuring and catch crops. Classification was done using TensorFlow with a well-known image recognition model, based on transfer learning with convolutional neural network (MobileNet). A hypertuning methodology was developed to obtain the best performing model among 160 models. This best model was applied on an independent inference set discriminating crop type with a Macro F1 score of 88.1% and main phenological stage at 86.9% at the parcel level. Potential and caveats of the approach along with practical considerations for implementation and improvement are discussed. The proposed framework speeds up high quality in-situ data collection and suggests avenues for massive data collection via automated classification using computer vision.

TI  - Aerosols over the Foothills of the Eastern Himalayan Region during Post-monsoon and Winter Seasons
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study a Microtops II sunphotometer is used for the first time over Birtamode, a rapidly growing city located in the eastern Himalayan foothills of Nepal, to measure aerosol optical depth (AOD). The average AOD for the observation period (October 2018-February 2019) was 0.68 +/- 0.39 with the post-monsoon season having a higher value (0.74 +/- 0.43) compared to the winter season (0.60 +/- 0.32). The Angstrom exponent (a) for post-monsoon and winter are found to be 1.08 +/- 0.10 and 1.11 +/- 0.16 respectively. During the monitoring period, the majority of AOD values (47%) are above 0.60, indicating moderately polluted conditions in the region. Anthropogenic, biomass burning, and mixed aerosols are identified as the prevalent aerosol types in the study region. The observed aerosol classification is also explained in terms of CAMS near-real-time model datasets. The AOD values retrieved by MODIS, VIIRS, Himawari-8, and CAMS show a good correlation with the observed Microtops AOD with R-2 values ranging from 0.60 to 0.94. Moreover, different MODIS aerosol products (DB, DT, and combined DB-DT) are evaluated based on a comparison of Collection 6.1 AOD with the ground truth obtained from Microtops. The spatial distribution of AOD as observed by various satellites are compared and the vertical distribution of aerosol is also explained with the extinction coefficient provided by the CALIOP lidar onboard CALIPSO and aerosol types provided by CAMS.

TI  - Estimating snow depth or snow water equivalent from space
T2  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing is widely used to estimate snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) which are two key parameters in global and regional climatic and hydrological systems. Remote sensing techniques for snow depth mainly include passive microwave remote sensing, Synthetic Aperture Radar ( SAR), Interferometric SAR (InSAR) and Lidar. Among them, passive microwave remote sensing is the most efficient way to estimate large scale snow depth due to its long time series data and high temporal frequency. Passive microwave remote sensing was utilized to monitor snow depth starting in 1978 when Nimbus-7 satellite with Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) freely provided multi-frequency passive microwave data. SAR was found to have ability to detecting snow depth in 1980s, but was not used for satellite active microwave remote sensing until 2000. Satellite Lidar was utilized to detect snow depth since the later period of 2000s. The estimation of snow depth from space has experienced significant progress during the last 40 years. However, challenges or uncertainties still exist for snow depth estimation from space. In this study, we review the main space remote sensing techniques of snow depth retrieval. Typical algorithms and their principles are described, and problems or disadvantages of these algorithms are discussed. It was found that snow depth retrieval in mountainous area is a big challenge for satellite remote sensing due to complicated topography. With increasing number of freely available SAR data, future new methods combing passive and active microwave remote sensing are needed for improving the retrieval accuracy of snow depth in mountainous areas.

TI  - Seasonal and Multiyear Flow Variability on the Prince of Wales Icefield, Ellesmere Island: 2009-2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last two decades, Trinity, Wykeham, Ekblaw, and Cadogan glaciers have retreated and been identified as the primary sources of iceberg flux from Prince of Wales (POW) Icefield, Ellesmere Island, accounting for similar to 83% of total solid ice discharge. In this study, we used a total of 167 Radarsat-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar scene pairs collected between 2009 and 2019 to derive winter surface velocities of these four major basins of the POW Icefield. Over this period both Cadogan and Ekblaw glaciers underwent multiyear acceleration and deceleration limited to their lower parts, consistent with characteristics of "pulse-type" glaciers. Trinity and Wykeham glaciers are currently the fastest flowing glaciers in the CAA and are grounded below sea level for similar to 40 km up-glacier from their termini. Both glaciers underwent multiyear repeating periods of velocity acceleration between 2009 and 2019 which coincided with significant thinning at their termini. As of 2017, Trinity and Wykeham were each within similar to 10 m of flotation over their lowermost 4 km. We also identified a shift in flow since 2014 on Trinity and Wykeham, after which winter flow rates began to propagate up-glacier and were nearly identical to flow rates observed throughout the rest of the year, indicating that seasonal variability in flow has become less apparent in recent years. Our findings suggest that Trinity and Wykeham glaciers have transitioned to a flow type dominated by dynamic thinning, which is strongly influenced by subglacial topography and may be susceptible to instability of the glacier front and large-scale collapse.

TI  - Remote sensing for monitoring tropical dryland forests: a review of current research, knowledge gaps and future directions for Southern Africa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Climate change, manifest via rising temperatures, extreme drought, and associated anthropogenic activities, has a negative impact on the health and development of tropical dryland forests. Southern Africa encompasses significant areas of dryland forests that are important to local communities but are facing rapid deforestation and are highly vulnerable to biome degradation from land uses and extreme climate events. Appropriate integration of remote sensing technologies helps to assess and monitor forest ecosystems and provide spatially explicit, operational, and long-term data to assist the sustainable use of tropical environment landscapes. The period from 2010 onwards has seen the rapid development of remote sensing research on tropical forests, which has led to a significant increase in the number of scientific publications. This review aims to analyse and synthesise the evidence published in peer review studies with a focus on optical and radar remote sensing of dryland forests in Southern Africa from 1997-2020. For this study, 137 citation indexed research publications have been analysed with respect to publication timing, study location, spatial and temporal scale of applied remote sensing data, satellite sensors or platforms employed, research topics considered, and overall outcomes of the studies. This enabled us to provide a comprehensive overview of past achievements, current efforts, major research topics studies, EO product gaps/challenges, and to propose ways in which challenges may be overcome. It is hoped that this review will motivate discussion and encourage uptake of new remote sensing tools (e.g., Google Earth Engine (GEE)), data (e.g., the Sentinel satellites), improved vegetation parameters (e.g., red-edge related indices, vegetation optical depth (VOD)) and methodologies (e.g., data fusion or deep learning, etc.), where these have potential applications in monitoring dryland forests.

TI  - Information Systems on violence against women: an integrative review
T2  - CIENCIA & SAUDE COLETIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - Violence against women, enhanced by issues of race/ethnicity, class and generation, con-stitutes one of the main obstacles to overcoming gender inequalities in all spheres of life, including the private domain. Over the past decades, actions to confront the phenomenon have advanced sig-nificantly in Brazil, particularly the growing out-put and the systematization of information on the topic. In this sense, Information Systems (IS) are important tools in the collection, processing/orga-nization and dissemination of official statistics on this type of violence, the objective of which is to as-sist in the planning and implementation of inter-sectoral public policies. It is noteworthy that these devices are characterized as a space for disputes of diverse interests. That is, they are not neutral instruments, but they bring with them a world-view that guides them. Thus, a critical analysis of information systems on violence against women is necessary, dealing with how they characterize the phenomenon, as well as feeding decisions and planning actions. Based on an integrative review, this paper aims to analyze how information sys-tems on violence against women are portrayed in national and international academic production.

TI  - Agents of Forest Disturbance in the Argentine Dry Chaco
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest degradation in the tropics is a widespread, yet poorly understood phenomenon. This is particularly true for tropical and subtropical dry forests, where a variety of disturbances, both natural and anthropogenic, affect forest canopies. Addressing forest degradation thus requires a spatially-explicit understanding of the causes of disturbances. Here, we apply an approach for attributing agents of forest disturbance across large areas of tropical dry forests, based on the Landsat image time series. Focusing on the 489,000 km(2) Argentine Dry Chaco, we derived metrics on the spectral characteristics and shape of disturbance patches. We then used these metrics in a random forests classification framework to estimate the area of logging, fire, partial clearing, riparian changes and drought. Our results highlight that partial clearing was the most widespread type of forest disturbance from 1990-to 2017, extending over 5520 km(2) (+/- 407 km(2)), followed by fire (4562 +/- 388 km(2)) and logging (3891 +/- 341 km(2)). Our analyses also reveal marked trends over time, with partial clearing generally becoming more prevalent, whereas fires declined. Comparing the spatial patterns of different disturbance types against accessibility indicators showed that fire and logging prevalence was higher closer to fields, while smallholder homesteads were associated with less burning. Roads were, surprisingly, not associated with clear trends in disturbance prevalence. To our knowledge, this is the first attribution of disturbance agents in tropical dry forests based on satellite-based indicators. While our study reveals remaining uncertainties in this attribution process, our framework has considerable potential for monitoring tropical dry forest disturbances at scale. Tropical dry forests in South America, Africa and Southeast Asia are some of the fastest disappearing ecosystems on the planet, and more robust monitoring of forest degradation in these regions is urgently needed.

TI  - Assessing Drought Response in the Southwestern Amazon Forest by Remote Sensing and In Situ Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term meteorological analyzes suggest an increase in air temperature and a decrease in rainfall over the Amazon biome. The effect of these climate changes on the forest remains unresolved, because field observations on functional traits are sparse in time and space, and the results from remote sensing analyses are divergent. Then, we analyzed the drought response in a 'terra firme' forest fragment in the southwestern Amazonia, during an extreme drought event influenced by ENSO episode (2015/2017), focusing on stem growth, litter production, functional traits and forest canopy dynamics. We use the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), corrected by Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) to generate the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and green chromatic coordinate (Gcc) vegetation indices. We monitor stem growth and measure the functional traits of trees in situ, such as the potential at which the plant loses 50% of hydraulic conductivity (P-50), turgor loss point (pi TLP), hydraulic safety margin (HSM) and isohydricity. Our results suggest that: (a) during the dry season, there is a smooth reduction in EVI values (browning) and an increase in the wet season (greening); (b) in the dry season, leaf flush occurs, when the water table still has a quota at the limit of the root zone; (c) the forest showed moderate resistance to drought, with water as the primary limiting factor, and the thickest trees were the most resistant; and (d) a decline in stem growth post-El-Nino 2015/2016 was observed, suggesting that the persistence of negative rainfall anomalies may be as critical to the forest as the drought episode itself.

TI  - Detecting and quantifying residue burning in smallholder systems: An integrated approach using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and rapid mapping of agriculture burned areas (ABA) is essential to track agricultural emissions for sustainable agronomic development, better air quality management, and mitigation of climate change. Despite its climate and environmental impacts, India is largely unexplored considering the magnitude and frequency of agricultural residue burning. This study focuses on Central India and explores the potential of Sentinel-2 (10 m) multispectral data to accurately estimate ABA, which can be used to calculate associated emissions. We used a locally adapted multi-temporal burned area detection methodology to quantify burned areas after the winter crop harvest in Central India from 2019 to 2021. A novel satellite data assisted virtual sampling method was used to collect burned and unburned training samples. Monthly ABAs were extracted at 10 m resolution and were compared with existing global burned area products. On average, the derived ABAs were larger (~9179 km(2) per month) than those reported by global burned area products that are based on MODIS at 500 m and 250 m resolutions. We show that our approach maps ABA from smallholder farms more accurately than other global products, particularly for fields that are smaller than 10 ha. The derived ABAs were further used to estimate emissions due to agricultural residue burning, which can be used as an initial estimate of potential emissions due to ABA in Central India. Overall, the study demonstrates the ability of Sentinel-2 data to detect and quantify ABA in smallholder systems, which can be used to more accurately estimate emissions compared to existing global products.

TI  - Wavelet coherence between ENSO indices and two precipitation databases for the Andes region of Colombia
T2  - ATMOSFERA
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on Colombia's hydrological variables has been shown in different studies. Most of the methodologies implemented have identified linear relationships and have associated the warm (cold) phase called El Nino (La Nina) with negative (positive) rainfall and streamflow anomalies. One of the most adverse impacts is the reduction in water supply during the warm phase. One aim of this study is to explore nonlinear correlations between ENSO and precipitation and the second is to identify which indices will enable improving the predictability of hydro-climatological variables. Wavelet coherence analysis is performed for monthly precipitation time series and ENSO indices from 1981-2016. Results show that ENSO events influence precipitation as periods of rainfall deficit or excess. Also, precipitation organized in the 2-8-year scales explain most of their variance. The most significant sectors are those that cover El Nino events when impacts on precipitation tend to be greater. In contrast, sectors are smaller when La Nina episodes occur. Results also allowed to identify that Nino 3, Nino 3.4, ONI, and BEST indices can be good predictors for specific regions. Intercomparison of two datasets allows to establish the feasibility

TI  - Drought Analysis for the Seyhan Basin with Vegetation Indices and Comparison with Meteorological Different Indices
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Various drought indices have been developed to monitor drought, which is a result of climate change, and mitigate its adverse effects on water resources, especially in agriculture. Vegetation indices determined by remote sensing were examined by many recent studies and shed light on drought risk management. In the current study, one of the 25 drainage basins in Turkey-the Seyhan Basin, located in the south of the country-was investigated. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) are the most widely used vegetation indices and are very useful because they give results only based on satellite images. This study examined the Seyhan Basin using satellite data in which the vegetation transformation occurring due to the decline of agricultural and forest areas was seen. An increase in drought frequency was detected in the Seyhan Basin using the NDVI and VCI indices and compared with different indices. The results obtained revealed that climate change and drought is increasing with a linear uptrend. It is recommended that decision-makers take the necessary measures by considering the drought risk maps. Long-term drought management plans should also be prepared and implemented.

TI  - Classification of remote sensing time series and similarity metrics for crop type verification
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the greatest challenges in many machine learning applications is to build robust classification models that reduce calibration efforts, ensure model transferability to unseen data distributions, and handle high semantic resolution datasets with a relatively large number of target classes. We present an operational domain adaptation framework for crop type verification from remote sensing data for integrated administration and control and farm management systems. It is part of the ag vertical bar knowledge crop monitoring platform and demonstrates a more robust spatiotemporal model transferability than conventional supervised crop type classification approaches, which use multitemporal and multispectral features to classify the specific characteristics of crop phenology patterns. The proposed method is based on a machine learning model that has been trained on particular similarity metrics between all target crop types. The metrics are derived by quantifying the similarity of vegetation index time series between the observed parcel and the aggregated time series of reference objects for each parcel and crop type. This method achieves higher classification results than a model trained on the pure remote sensing time series data, as the algorithm does not learn the temporal vegetation index patterns, but instead, the adversarial characteristics and the differences between each crop type. Moreover, it also reduces dimensionality as the time series are summarized through the respective similarity metrics. We compare both approaches through different classification algorithms. Overall, the achieved classification accuracy for more than 67 crop types scores more than 80%. (c) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Statistical analysis of precipitation, temperature and snow cover in Bhagirathi River basin
T2  - MAUSAM
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the world's largest river basins is the Ganga River basin. Bhagirathi basin which is part of this Ganga Basin is important because the glacier (Gangotri) from which river Ganga originates is situated in this basin. The present study presents the changing climate impact on dynamics of snow cover and hydrological regime of the Bhagirathi basin. The remote sensing satellite data from MODIS, TRMM and Cartosat DEM are used and watershed delineation, snow cover area extraction, trend and correlation analysis are performed in ArcGIS and R statistical software respectively. The results of trend analysis show a negative and weak association in precipitation data and positive but weak association in temperature data. However, when correlation analysis was done for different stations in the basin a strong positive correlation was found among the precipitation and temperature data for Kendall (0.93), Spearman (0.99) and Pearson (0.99) methods. A weak correlation was found between inflow and percentage snow cover area in the Bhagirathi basin for Kendall (0.04), Spearman (0.06) and Pearson (0.07) methods. The study findings present an insight into the precipitation, temperature and snow cover area data statistically. Further a better understanding of the data can be established if sub-basin level study is performed.

TI  - Consensus Conference Statement on the General Use of Near-infrared Fluorescence Imaging and Indocyanine Green Guided Surgery Results of a Modified Delphi Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In recent decades, the use of near-infrared light and fluorescence-guidance during open and laparoscopic surgery has exponentially expanded across various clinical settings. However, tremendous variability exists in how it is performed. Objective: In this first published survey of international experts on fluorescence-guided surgery, we sought to identify areas of consensus and nonconsensus across 4 areas of practice: fundamentals; patient selection/preparation; technical aspects; and effectiveness and safety. Methods: A Delphi survey was conducted among 19 international experts in fluorescence-guided surgery attending a 1-day consensus meeting in Frankfurt, Germany on September 8(th), 2019. Using mobile phones, experts were asked to anonymously vote over 2 rounds of voting, with 70% and 80% set as a priori thresholds for consensus and vote robustness, respectively. Results: Experts from 5 continents reached consensus on 41 of 44 statements, including strong consensus that near-infrared fluorescence-guided surgery is both effective and safe across a broad variety of clinical settings, including the localization of critical anatomical structures like vessels, detection of tumors and sentinel nodes, assessment of tissue perfusion and anastomotic leaks, delineation of segmented organs, and localization of parathyroid glands. Although the minimum and maximum safe effective dose of ICG were felt to be 1 to 2 mg and >10 mg, respectively, there was strong consensus that determining the optimum dose, concentration, route and timing of ICG administration should be an ongoing research focus. Conclusions: Although fluorescence imaging was almost unanimously perceived to be both effective and safe across a broad range of clinical settings, considerable further research remains necessary to optimize its use.

TI  - Study of Coastal Effects Relevant for Offshore Wind Energy Using Spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wind speed gradients relevant for offshore windfarming are analysed based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The study concentrates on situations with offshore wind directions in the German Bight using SAR scenes from the European satellites Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B. High resolution wind fields at 10 m height are derived from the satellite data set and respective horizontal wind speed gradients are investigated up to about 170 km offshore. The wind speed gradients are classified according to their general shape with about 60% of the cases showing an overall increase of wind speeds with growing distance from the coast. About half of the remaining cases show an overall wind speed decrease and the other half a decrease with a subsequent increase at larger distances from the coast. An empirical model is fitted to the horizontal wind speed gradients, which has three main parameters, namely, the wind speed over land, the equilibrium wind speed over sea far offshore, and a characteristic adjustment length scale. For the cases with overall wind speed increase, a mean absolute difference of about 2.6 m/s is found between wind speeds over land and wind speeds far offshore. The mean normalised wind speed increase with respect to the land conditions is estimated as 40%. In terms of wind power density at 10 m height this corresponds to an absolute average growth by 0.3 kW/m(2) and a normalised increase by 160%. The distance over which the wind speed grows to 95% of the maximum wind speed shows large variations with maximum above 170 km and a mean of 67 km. The impact of the atmospheric boundary layer stability on horizontal wind speed gradients is investigated using additional information on air and sea temperature differences. The absolute SAR-derived wind speed increase offshore is usually higher in unstable situations and the respective adjustment distance is shorter. Furthermore, we have found atypical cases with a wind speed decrease offshore to be often connected to stable atmospheric conditions. A particular low-level jet (LLJ) situation is analysed in more detail using vertical wind speed profiles from a wind LIDAR system.

TI  - Assessments of Cloud Liquid Water and Total Precipitable Water Derived from FY-3E MWTS-III and NOAA-20 ATMS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud liquid water (CLW) and total precipitable water (TPW) are two important parameters for weather and climate applications. Typically, microwave temperature sounding instruments onboard satellites are designed with two low-frequency channels at 23.8 and 31.4 GHz and can be used for retrieving CLW and TPW over global oceans. Since MWTS-III polarization at above two frequencies is uncertain, we must first determine their polarization involved in retrieval algorithms. Through radiative transfer simulation, we found that uses of the quasi-horizontal polarization for MWTS-III can produce smaller biases between observations and simulations and the scan-angle dependence of the biases is also in a general frown pattern, which is similar to ATMS pitch-maneuver observations. After the characterization of MWTS-III polarization, CLW and TPW are derived from Microwave Temperature Sounder (MWTS-III) and are compared with those from ATMS. It is found that CLW and TPW derived from two instruments exhibit a high consistency in terms of their spatial distributions and magnitudes.

TI  - Study on the Evolutionary Features and Driving Factors of Land-Use System in Xilingol, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we selected Xilingol League in Inner Mongolia, China, as the research area, based on the land-use data of five Landsat remote sensing images taken between 1980 and 2015. Then, we calculated the complex network eigenvalues, such as the average shortest path, betweenness centrality, and degree, to identify the key land-use types, stability, and ecological environment change regularity from the perspective of the land-use system. Finally, we used the Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) method to explore the main driving forces behind changes in the land-use system, to provide scientific support for the study of changing trends in land-use, and regional grassland ecological management. The findings are shown below. First, in the last 35 years, grasslands have always been the major type of change in land-use transfer matrices. Grasslands play a controlling role in the whole land-use system. Second, grassland and cultivated land are the major "transfer out" type of land in the Xilingol area, while construction land and water area belong to the major "transfer in" type of land. Third, the average shortest path values of four transition matrix networks were all less than 1.5, indicating that the land-use system becomes less stable, but the average shortest path values of these four networks present an increasing trend, leading to a more stable development of the land-use system. However, on the whole, it shows an upward trend, and the land-use system is moving in a stable direction. Fourth, the average annual rainfall, population, topographic factors, GDP, and distance from settlements play a prominent role in determining the spatial distribution of change in land-use in Xilingol.

TI  - Estimation of Global Cropland Gross Primary Production from Satellite Observations by Integrating Water Availability Variable in Light-Use-Efficiency Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based models have been widely used to estimate gross primary production (GPP) of terrestrial ecosystems. Although they have many advantages for mapping spatiotemporal variations of regional or global GPP, the performance in agroecosystems is relatively poor. In this study, a light-use-efficiency model for cropland GPP estimation, named EF-LUE, driven by remote sensing data, was developed by integrating evaporative fraction (EF) as limiting factor accounting for soil water availability. Model parameters were optimized first using CO2 flux measurements by eddy covariance system from flux tower sites, and the optimized parameters were further spatially extrapolated according to climate zones for global cropland GPP estimation in 2001-2019. The major forcing datasets include the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) data from the Copernicus Global Land Service System (CGLS) GEOV2 dataset, EF from the ETMonitor model, and meteorological forcing variables from ERA5 data. The EF-LUE model was first evaluated at flux tower site-level, and the results suggested that the proposed EF-LUE model and the LUE model without using water availability limiting factor, both driven by flux tower meteorology data, explained 82% and 74% of the temporal variations of GPP across crop sites, respectively. The overall KGE increased from 0.73 to 0.83, NSE increased from 0.73 to 0.81, and RMSE decreased from 2.87 to 2.39 g C m(-2) d(-1) in the estimated GPP after integrating EF in the LUE model. These improvements may be largely attributed to parameters optimized for different climatic zones and incorporating water availability limiting factor expressed by EF into the light-use-efficiency model. At global scale, the verification by GPP measurements from cropland flux tower sites showed that GPP estimated by the EF-LUE model driven by ERA5 reanalysis meteorological data and EF from ETMonitor had overall the highest R-2, KGE, and NSE and the smallest RMSE over the four existing GPP datasets (MOD17 GPP, revised EC-LUE GPP, GOSIF GPP and PML-V2 GPP). The global GPP from the EF-LUE model could capture the significant negative GPP anomalies during drought or heat-wave events, indicating its ability to express the impacts of the water stress on cropland GPP.

TI  - Monitoring Optical Variability in Complex Inland Waters Using Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical classification for water bodies was carried out based on satellite remote sensing data, which avoided the limitation of having a limited amount of in situ measured spectral data. Unsupervised cluster analysis was performed on 53,815 reflectance spectra extracted at 500-m intervals based on the same season or quasi-same season Landsat 8 SR data using the algorithm of fuzzy c-means. Lakes and reservoirs in the study area were comprehensively identified as three optical types representing different limnological features. The shape and amplitude characteristics of the reflectance spectra for the three optical water types indicated that one corresponds to the clearest water, one corresponds to turbid water, and the other is moderate clear water. The novelty detection technique was further used to label the match-ups of the in situ data set collected during 2006 to 2019 in 12 field surveys based on mathematical rules of the three optical water types. The results confirmed that each optical water type was associated with different bio-optical properties, and the total suspended matter of the clearest, moderate clear and turbid water types were 14.99 mg/L, 41.06 mg/L and 83.81 mg/L, respectively. Overall, the clearest, moderate clear and turbid waters in the study area accounted for 49.3%, 36.7% and 14.0%, respectively. The spatial distribution of optical water types in the study area was seamlessly mapped. Results showed that the bio-optical conditions of the water distributed across the southeast region were roughly homogeneous, but in most of other regions and within some water bodies, they showed a patchy distribution and heterogeneity. This study is useful for monitoring water quality and provides a useful foundation to develop or tuning algorithms to retrieve water quality parameters.

TI  - A global map of planting years of plantations
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Plantation is an important land use type that differs from natural forests and affects the economy and the environment. Tree age is one of the key factors used to quantify the impact of plantations. However, there is a lack of datasets explicitly documenting the planting years of global plantations. Here we used time-series Landsat archive from 1982 to 2020 and the LandTrendr algorithm to generate global maps of planting years based on the global plantation extent products in Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The datasets developed in this study are in a GeoTIFF format with 30-meter spatial resolution by recording gridded specie types and planting years of global plantations. The derived dataset could be used for yield prediction of tree crops and social and ecological cost-benefit analysis of plantations.

TI  - Thermal comfort conditions at microclimate scale and surface urban heat island in a tropical city: A study on Joao Pessoa city, Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) are one of the most studied phenomena in urban climates because they generate problems for the well-being of the urban population. This study analyzed the thermal comfort conditions at microclimate scale and SUHI for Joao Pessoa city, Brazil. Micrometeorological data (temperature and air humidity data) collected at 10 stations in 2011 and 2018 were used to calculate Thom's discomfort index (TDI) for Joao Pessoa city. Satellite images from Landsat 5/TM for 1991, 2006, and 2010 and Landsat 8/OLI for 2018 were used for land use and land cover classification and to identify SUHI. The obtained results highlighted that the SUHI area in Joao Pessoa city was 26 km(2) and that almost half of the heat island area was concentrated in the Geisel, Aeroclube, Valentina, Distrito Industrial, Cristo Redentor, and Mangabeira neighborhoods. Regarding the micrometeorological data, higher values were obtained for 2018 in the dry periods (summer) and during the day. Based on the results, a considerable increase in discomfort during the daytime was observed in urbanized areas of the city from 2010 - 2018 due to the increase in the average temperature in Joao Pessoa between 1991 and 2018.

TI  - Mapping Land Cover Types for Highland Andean Ecosystems in Peru Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Highland Andean ecosystems sustain high levels of floral and faunal biodiversity in areas with diverse topography and provide varied ecosystem services, including the supply of water to cities and downstream agricultural valleys. Google ((TM)) has developed a product specifically designed for mapping purposes (Earth Engine), which enables users to harness the computing power of a cloud-based solution in near-real time for land cover change mapping and monitoring. We explore the feasibility of using this platform for mapping land cover types in topographically complex terrain with highly mixed vegetation types (Nor Yauyos Cochas Landscape Reserve located in the central Andes of Peru) using classification machine learning (ML) algorithms in combination with different sets of remote sensing data. The algorithms were trained using 3601 sampling pixels of (a) normalized spectral bands between the visible and near infrared spectrum of the Landsat 8 OLI sensor for the 2018 period, (b) spectral indices of vegetation, soil, water, snow, burned areas and bare ground and (c) topographic-derived indices (elevation, slope and aspect). Six ML algorithms were tested, including CART, random forest, gradient tree boosting, minimum distance, naive Bayes and support vector machine. The results reveal that ML algorithms produce accurate classifications when spectral bands are used in conjunction with topographic indices, resulting in better discrimination among classes with similar spectral signatures such as pajonal (tussock grass-dominated cover) and short grasses or rocky groups, and moraines, agricultural and forested areas. The model with the highest explanatory power was obtained from the combination of spectral bands and topographic indices using the random forest algorithm (Kappa = 0.81). Our study presents a first approach of its kind in topographically complex Cordilleran terrain and we show that GEE is particularly useful in large-scale land cover mapping and monitoring in mountainous ecosystems subject to rapid changes and conversions, with replicability and scalability to other areas with similar characteristics.

TI  - Improving Breast Conserving Surgery Using the Faxitron® OR Specimen Radiography System - A Complication Analysis, Cost Evaluation and Literature Review
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Background/Aim: The combination of pre-surgical clip placement and hook-wire guided surgery is considered the gold standard for adequately locating non-palpable lesions during breast conserving surgery. After surgical removal of the segment, radiography is required to confirm clip removal, increasing surgical time, post-surgical complication rates, and cost. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis, using the Faxitron (R) in-theater specimen radiography system, of the following primary endpoints: surgical time and complication rates. The secondary endpoints were cost effectiveness and clip-location rates. The Control cohort included breast conserving surgery patients prior to May 2019 (n=150) and the Validation cohort included breast conserving surgery patients after May 2019 (n=53). Results: The analysis showed an improvement in surgical time when using the Faxitron (R) system, which is directly linked to a benefit in cost effectiveness. A numerical benefit in complication rates was also shown. A subgroup analysis showed a significant advantage in surgical time for breast conserving surgery plus sentinel node biopsy and open breast biopsies. Conclusion: Use of the Faxitron (R) system significantly reduces surgical time, which increases cost efficiency while maintaining a low complication rate.

TI  - A Pre-Operational System Based on the Assimilation of MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth in the MOCAGE Chemical Transport Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we present a pre-operational forecasting assimilation system of different types of aerosols. This system has been developed within the chemistry-transport model of Meteo-France, MOCAGE, and uses the assimilation of the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) onboard both Terra and Aqua. It is based on the AOD assimilation system within the MOCAGE model. It operates on a daily basis with a global configuration of 1 degrees x1 degrees (longitude x latitude). The motivation of such a development is the capability to predict and anticipate extreme events and their impacts on the air quality and the aviation safety in the case of a huge volcanic eruption. The validation of the pre-operational system outputs has been done in terms of AOD compared against the global AERONET observations within two complete years (January 2018-December 2019). The comparison between both datasets shows that the correlation between the MODIS assimilated outputs and AERONET over the whole period of study is 0.77, whereas the biases and the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) are 0.006 and 0.135, respectively. The ability of the pre-operational system to predict extreme events in near real time such as the desert dust transport and the propagation of the biomass burning was tested and evaluated. We particularly presented and documented the desert dust outbreak which occurred over Greece in late March 2018 as well as the wildfire event which happened on Australia between July 2019 and February 2020. We only presented these two events, but globally the assimilation chain has shown that it is capable of predicting desert dust events and biomass burning aerosols which happen all over the globe.

TI  - Beginnings of Social Communication: from critical reason to the rise of instrumental reason
T2  - CHASQUI-REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE COMUNICACION
M3  - Article
AB  - Social Communication studies in a broad sense, which have already covered a century in Latin America, were enriched in their beginnings with political, social and cultural dimensions-sometimes in tension-as well as with a set of theoretical and methodological perspectives that allowed them to develop prospective, to anticipate the future. Such possibilities have gone through a journey that has not left them immune to the impact of the ways of building power of neoliberal capitalism as well as its socio-cultural legitimations. The article attempts to show how the traces of this worldview have impacted and put at risk the density of the field itself. Hence the thought of the slippage of critical reason to the rise of instrumental reason.

TI  - Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and induced magnetic reconnection at the Earth's magnetopause: a 3D simulation based on satellite data
T2  - PLASMA PHYSICS AND CONTROLLED FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - A 3D two-fluid simulation, using plasma parameters as measured by MMS on 8 September 2015, shows the nonlinear development of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the Earth's magnetopause. It shows extremely rich dynamics, including the development of a complex magnetic topology, vortex merging and secondary instabilities. Vortex induced and mid-latitude magnetic reconnection coexist and produce an asymmetric distribution of magnetic reconnection events. Off-equator reconnection exhibits a predominance of events in the Southern Hemisphere during the early nonlinear phase, as observed by satellites at the dayside magnetopause. The late nonlinear phase shows the development of vortex pairing for all latitudes while secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz instability develops only in the Northern Hemisphere, leading to an enhancement of the occurrence of off-equator reconnection there. Since vortices move tailward while evolving, this suggests that reconnection events in the Northern Hemisphere should dominate at the nightside magnetopause.

TI  - Examining Vegetation Change and Associated Spatial Patterns in Wuyishan National Park at Different Protection Levels
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Examining the characteristics of vegetation change and associated spatial patterns under different protection levels can provide a scientific basis for national park protection and management. Based on the dense time-series Landsat enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data between 1986 and 2020, we utilized the Wild Binary Segmentation (WBS) approach to detect spatial and temporal characteristics of abrupt, gradual, and total changes in Wuyishan National Park. The differences in vegetation change in three protection-level areas (strictly protected [Prot(s)], generally protected [Prot], and non-protected [NP]) were examined, and the contributions to their spatial patterns were evaluated through Geodetector. The results showed the following: (1) The highest percentage of area without abrupt change was in Prot(s) (39.89%), and the lowest percentage was in NP (17.44%). The percentage of abrupt change frequency (larger than three times) increased from 4.40% to 9.10% and 12.49% with the decreases in protection. The significance test showed that the difference in changed frequencies was not significant among these regions, but the interannual variation of abrupt change in Prot(s) was significantly different from other areas. (2) The vegetation coverage of the Wuyishan National Park generally improved. The total EVI change (T-EVI) showed that the positive percentage of Prot(s) and Prot was 90.43% and 91.71%, respectively, slightly higher than that of NP (88.44%). However, the mean greenness change of NP was higher than that of Prot(s) and Prot. (3) The park's EVI spatial pattern in 1986 was the strongest factor determining the EVI spatial pattern in 2020; the explanatory power reduced as the protection level decreased. The explanation power (q value) of abrupt vegetation change was lower and increased as the protection level decreased. The interaction detection showed that EVI1986 and T-EVI had the strongest explanatory powers, but the explanatory ability gradually weakened from 0.713 to 0.672 to 0.581 in Prot(s), Prot, and NP, respectively. This study provided a systematic analysis of vegetation changes and their impacts on spatial patterns.

TI  - Analysis of Multispectral Drought Indices in Central Tunisia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water stress remote sensing indices can be very helpful to monitor the impact of drought on agro-ecosystems, and serve as early warning indicators to avoid further damages to the crop productivity. In this study, we compare indices from three different spectral domains: the plant water use derived from evapotranspiration retrieved using data from the thermal infrared domain, the root zone soil moisture at low resolution derived from the microwave domain using the Soil Water Index (SWI), and the active vegetation fraction cover deduced from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. The thermal stress index is computed from a dual-source model Soil Plant Atmosphere and Remote Evapotranspiration (SPARSE) that relies on meteorological variables and remote sensing data. In order to extend in time the available meteorological series, we compare the use of a statistical downscaling method applied to reanalysis data with the use of the unprocessed reanalysis data. Our study shows that thermal indices show comparable performance overall compared to the SWI at better resolution. However, thermal indices are more sensitive for a drought period and tend to react quickly to water stress.

TI  - The Prognostic Role and Significance of Dll4 and Toll-like Receptors in Cancer Development
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary The aim of this review is to summarize the latest details considering the role of Dll4 in cancer, since recent data report that Dll4 has a major key role in tumor angiogenesis. Moreover, the authors try to seek any correlation between Dll4 and cancer stem cells in tumor development. Considering that cancer stem cells have proven to be implicated in the progression of many cancer types, any impact from Dll4 could lead to the alteration of cancer development. Additionally, the authors make a report on current advantages on immunotherapy and tumor-draining lymph nodes in cancer. Finally, this study analyzes toll like receptors, pattern recognition receptors that are capable of recognizing different molecules and activating different genes. These immunogenetic molecules have remarkable roles including angiogenesis promotion, while their activation can lead to either cancer progression or inhibition, representing a very promising therapeutic alliance for cancer treatment. The Notch signaling pathway regulates the development of embryonic and tissue homeostasis of various types of cells. It also controls cell proliferation, variation, fate and cell death because it emits short-range messages to nearby cells. The pathway plays an important role in the pathophysiology of various malignancies, controlling cancer creation. It also limits cancer development by adjusting preserved angiogenesis and cellular programs. One of the Notch signaling ligands (in mammals) is Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4), which plays a significant role in the overall malignancies' advancement. Particularly, sequencing Notch gene mutations, including those of Dll4, have been detected in many types of cancers portraying information on the growth of particular gynecological types of tumors. The current research article examines the background theory that implies the ability of Dll4 in the development of endometrial and other cancer types, and the probable therapeutic results of Dll4 inhibition.

TI  - High-Resolution Mapping of Paddy Rice Extent and Growth Stages across Peninsular Malaysia Using a Fusion of Sentinel-1 and 2 Time Series Data in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is the staple crop for more than half the world's population, but there is a lack of high-resolution maps outlining rice areas and their growth stages. Most remote sensing studies map the rice extent; however, in tropical regions, rice is grown throughout the year with variable planting dates and cropping frequency. Thus, mapping rice growth stages is more useful than mapping only the extent. This study addressed this challenge by developing a phenology-based method. The hypothesis was that the unsupervised classification (k-means clustering) of Sentinel-1 and 2 time-series data could identify rice fields and growth stages, because (1) the presence of flooding during transplanting can be identified by Sentinel-1 VH backscatter; and (2) changes in the canopy of rice fields during growth stages (vegetative, generative, and ripening phases) up to the point of harvesting can be identified by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. Using the proposed method, this study mapped rice field extent and cropping calendars across Peninsular Malaysia (131,598 km(2)) on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The Sentinel-1 and 2 monthly time series data from January 2019 to December 2020 were classified using k-means clustering to identify areas with similar phenological patterns. This approach resulted in 10-meter resolution maps of rice field extent, intensity, and cropping calendars. Validation using very high-resolution street view images from Google Earth showed that the predicted map had an overall accuracy of 95.95%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.92. In addition, the predicted crop calendars agreed well with the local government's granary data. The results show that the proposed phenology-based method is cost-effective and can accurately map rice fields and growth stages over large areas. The information will be helpful in measuring the achievement of self-sufficiency in rice production and estimates of methane emissions from rice cultivation.

TI  - Vegetation-related dry deposition of global PM<sub>2.5</sub> from satellite observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation plays an important role in the dry deposition of particles with significant spatial variability, but the magnitude remains unclear at the global scale. With the aid of satellite products, this study estimated the vegetation-related dry deposition of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Methodologically, dry deposition was first calculated using an empirical algorithm. Then, deposition on the leaf surface was estimated to evaluate the influence of vegetation. Our results showed that the mean deposition velocity (V-d) of global PM2.5 was 0.91x10(-3) mu g center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1), with high velocities observed in sparsely vegetated regions because of the high friction velocity. Under the combined effect of the PM2.5 mass concentration and deposition velocity, the global mean dry deposition reached 0.47 g center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1). Global vegetation absorbed 0.26 g center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1) from PM2.5 pollution sources, contributing 54.98% of the total dry deposition. Spatially, vegetation-related dry deposition was high in the Amazon, Central Africa and East China due to dense vegetation coverage or serious pollution. Temporally, the increasing trends were mainly in Central Africa and India because of worsening air pollution. The results of this study helped to clarify the impact of vegetation on air pollution, which supported related land management and planning for air quality improvement.

TI  - Deep Learning for Archaeological Object Detection on LiDAR: New Evaluation Measures and Insights
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine Learning-based workflows are being progressively used for the automatic detection of archaeological objects (intended as below-surface sites) in remote sensing data. Despite promising results in the detection phase, there is still a lack of a standard set of measures to evaluate the performance of object detection methods, since buried archaeological sites often have distinctive shapes that set them aside from other types of objects included in mainstream remote sensing datasets (e.g., Dataset of Object deTection in Aerial images, DOTA). Additionally, archaeological research relies heavily on geospatial information when validating the output of an object detection procedure, a type of information that is not normally considered in regular machine learning validation pipelines. This paper tackles these shortcomings by introducing two novel automatic evaluation measures, namely 'centroid-based' and 'pixel-based', designed to encode the salient aspects of the archaeologists' thinking process. To test their usability, an experiment with different object detection deep neural networks was conducted on a LiDAR dataset. The experimental results show that these two automatic measures closely resemble the semi-automatic one currently used by archaeologists and therefore can be adopted as fully automatic evaluation measures in archaeological remote sensing detection. Adoption will facilitate cross-study comparisons and close collaboration between machine learning and archaeological researchers, which in turn will encourage the development of novel human-centred archaeological object detection tools.

TI  - Detecting Moving Trucks on Roads Using Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In most countries, freight is predominantly transported by road cargo trucks. We present a new satellite remote sensing method for detecting moving trucks on roads using Sentinel-2 data. The method exploits a temporal sensing offset of the Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument, causing spatially and spectrally distorted signatures of moving objects. A random forest classifier was trained (overall accuracy: 84%) on visual-near-infrared-spectra of 2500 globally labelled targets. Based on the classification, the target objects were extracted using a developed recursive neighbourhood search. The speed and the heading of the objects were approximated. Detections were validated by employing 350 globally labelled target boxes (mean F-1 score: 0.74). The lowest F-1 score was achieved in Kenya (0.36), the highest in Poland (0.88). Furthermore, validated at 26 traffic count stations in Germany on in sum 390 dates, the truck detections correlate spatio-temporally with station figures (Pearson r-value: 0.82, RMSE: 43.7). Absolute counts were underestimated on 81% of the dates. The detection performance may differ by season and road condition. Hence, the method is only suitable for approximating the relative truck traffic abundance rather than providing accurate absolute counts. However, existing road cargo monitoring methods that rely on traffic count stations or very high resolution remote sensing data have limited global availability. The proposed moving truck detection method could fill this gap, particularly where other information on road cargo traffic are sparse by employing globally and freely available Sentinel-2 data. It is inferior to the accuracy and the temporal detail of station counts, but superior in terms of spatial coverage.

TI  - Hybrid Semi-Analytical Algorithm for Estimating Chlorophyll-A Concentration in Lower Amazon Floodplain Waters
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon Basin is the largest on the planet, and its aquatic ecosystems affect and are affected by the Earth's processes. Specifically, Amazon aquatic ecosystems have been subjected to severe anthropogenic impacts due to deforestation, mining, dam construction, and widespread agribusiness expansion. Therefore, the monitoring of these impacts has become crucial for conservation plans and environmental legislation enforcement. However, its continental dimensions, the high variability of Amazonian water mass constituents, and cloud cover frequency impose a challenge for developing accurate satellite algorithms for water quality retrieval such as chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), which is a proxy for the trophic state. This study presents the first application of the hybrid semi-analytical algorithm (HSAA) for Chl-a retrieval using a Sentinel-3 OLCI sensor over five Amazonian floodplain lakes. Inherent and apparent optical properties (IOPs and AOPs), as well as limnological data, were collected at 94 sampling stations during four field campaigns along hydrological years spanning from 2015 to 2017 and used to parameterize the hybrid SAA to retrieve Chl-a in highly turbid Amazonian waters. We implemented a re-parametrizing approach, called the generalized stacked constraints model to the Amazonian waters (GSCMLAFW), and used it to decompose the total absorption & alpha;t(& lambda;) into the absorption coefficients of detritus, CDOM, and phytoplankton (& alpha;phy(& lambda;)). The estimated GSCMLAFW & alpha;phy(& lambda;) achieved errors lower than 24% at the visible bands and 70% at NIR. The performance of HSAA-based Chl-a retrieval was validated with in situ measurements of Chl-a concentration, and then it was compared to literature Chl-a algorithms. The results showed a smaller mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for HSAA Chl-a retrieval (36.93%) than empirical Rrs models (73.39%) using a 3-band algorithm, which confirms the better performance of the semi-analytical approach. Last, the calibrated HSAA model was used to estimate the Chl-a concentration in OLCI images acquired during 2017 and 2019 field campaigns, and the results demonstrated reasonable errors (MAPE = 57%) and indicated the potential of OLCI bands for Chl-a estimation. Therefore, the outcomes of this study support the advance of semi-analytical models in highly turbid waters and highlight the importance of re-parameterization with GSCM and the applicability of HSAA in Sentinel-3 OLCI data.

TI  - Ecological Infrastructures May Enhance Lepidopterans Predation in Irrigated Mediterranean Farmland, Depending on Their Typology and the Predator Guild
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological infrastructures (EIs) are considered relevant components in agricultural landscapes to support biodiversity and ecosystem services. We used the predatory attacks on lepidopteran dummies as a proxy to assess predation rates in the agricultural matrix and different EIs types according to their location and vegetation structure. We aimed at comparing the effect of different types of EI on the predation intensity in two intensively irrigated agricultural areas located in the Sorraia and Tagus river valleys in central Portugal. We hypothesized that: (1) the predation rate would be higher near EIs compared with the agricultural matrix, (2) the positive effect of EIs on predation rate would differ with their typologies, and (3) the EIs' proximity and proportion in the surrounding landscape would have a positive effect on the predation rate in agricultural fields. The EI typologies influenced differently the predator groups and the overall predation rate. Major differences were observed for bird predation, being higher in woody EIs. A positive correlation between predation rate and EIs area of the surrounding landscape, as well as a negative correlation with the distance to the nearest riparian and woody EIs, was observed for birds. The observed dissimilarities in the predators' response may be related to habitat differences and its functional connectivity. The overall monthly low predation rates are possibly related to the intensive agricultural system and the small area occupied by EIs.

TI  - Multicriteria Spatial Modeling: Methodological Contribution to the Analysis of Atmospheric and Surface Heat Islands in Presidente Prudente, Brazil
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies demonstrate the potential of models for the representation of phenomena such as urban heat islands. This article aimed to analyze atmospheric heat islands (UHI ud ) by integrating primary air temperature data with spatial information such as land use and relief from a multicriteria model based on multiple linear regression. Furthermore, we compared the measured and estimated air temperature at 11 p.m. with the surface temperature at 10:51 p.m. (local time). These temperatures were obtained through the thermal band of the Landsat 8 satellite considering extraction points of interest in Presidente Prudente city, Brazil. The multicriteria model showed reliability in UHIucl spatialization, reaching the confidence interval (p-value <= 0.05). The model proves that urban surface materials are the main energy sources modulating heat transfer to the atmosphere, while vegetation has a temperature-reducing effect. Precise mappings such as the one proposed here are relevant for the formulation of measures that support decision-making by public authorities. These mappings aim at urban planning that is resilient to the effects of urban climate and can be replicated in other realities.

TI  - Pathological examination of breast cancer samples before and after neoadjuvant therapy: recommendations from the Italian Group for the Study of Breast Pathology - Italian Society of Pathology (GIPaM-SIAPeC)
T2  - PATHOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in breast cancer is administered to downstage the tumor, deescalate surgery, and provide prognostic information that can be used to tailor subsequent adjuvant therapy. In this respect, the pathological evaluation of both pre-NAT biopsies and post-NAT surgical specimens is crucial to precisely assess the treatment response. With the increasing possibilities of NAT protocols and the rising number of eligible patients, it has become extremely important to standardize the pathological response assessment. Here, we provide an update on the recommendations of the Italian Group for the Study of Breast Pathology - the Italian Society of Pathology (GIPaM-SIAPeC) for the analysis of breast cancer samples before and after NAT.

TI  - Urban Change Detection from Aerial Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban change detection is an important part of sustainable urban planning, regional development, and socio-economic analysis, especially in regions with limited access to economic and demographic statistical data. The goal of this research is to create a strategy that enables the extraction of indicators from large-scale orthoimages of different resolution with practically acceptable accuracy after a short training process. Remote sensing data can be used to detect changes in number of buildings, forest areas, and other landscape objects. In this paper, aerial images of a digital raster orthophoto map at scale 1:10,000 of the Republic of Lithuania (ORT10LT) of three periods (2009-2010, 2012-2013, 2015-2017) were analyzed. Because of the developing technologies, the quality of the images differs significantly and should be taken into account while preparing the dataset for training the semantic segmentation model DeepLabv3 with a ResNet50 backbone. In the data preparation step, normalization techniques were used to ensure stability of image quality and contrast. Focal loss for the training metric was selected to deal with the misbalanced dataset. The suggested model training process is based on the transfer learning technique and combines using a model with weights pretrained in ImageNet with learning on coarse and fine-tuning datasets. The coarse dataset consists of images with classes generated automatically from Open Street Map (OSM) data and the fine-tuning dataset was created by manually reviewing the images to ensure that the objects in images match the labels. To highlight the benefits of transfer learning, six different models were trained by combining different steps of the suggested model training process. It is demonstrated that using pretrained weights results in improved performance of the model and the best performance was demonstrated by the model which includes all three steps of the training process (pretrained weights, training on coarse and fine-tuning datasets). Finally, the results obtained with the created machine learning model enable the implementation of different approaches to detect, analyze, and interpret urban changes for policymakers and investors on different levels on a local map, grid, or municipality level.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 133rd Annual Meeting of the Southern-Surgical-Association
CL  - Hot Springs, VA
AB  - BACKGROUND: This is a prospective, single-institution study to evaluate feasibility and accuracy of radar-localized reflector (RLR)-targeted axillary dissection (TAD) in node-positive breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST).METHODS: Patients with biopsy-proven T1-2, N1-3 disease were eligible. Before NST, a marker clip and/or RLR was placed into the positive node. After NST, RLR was inserted if not placed previously. All patients underwent RLR TAD followed by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Primary end points of the trial were feasibility of RLR TAD and false negative rate (FNR).RESULTS: Between 2017 and 2021, 101 patients with N1-3 disease underwent NST. Five patients withdrew from the study, 1 was ineligible, and there were 9 technical failures, thus our final study cohort comprised 86 patients. RLR TAD was performed with probe guidance and confirmed with intraoperative specimen radiograph. After RLR TAD, ALND was performed. Median number of RLR TAD nodes removed was 2 (range 1-10), and the RLR TAD nodes remained positive in 56 patients. Median number of ALND nodes removed was 18 (range 4-46). Accounting for 9 technical failures, feasibility was 90%. All technical failures occurred with attempted placement of RLR after NST. Feasibility rate was 100% when RLR placement occurred at diagnosis. Of the evaluable 86 patients, RLR TAD accurately predicted axillary status in 83 patients, with FNR of 5.1%.CONCLUSION: We demonstrate high accuracy of RLR TAD, especially when RLR is placed before NST. For patients who present with N1-3 disease, this is another step towards axillary surgery de-escalation strategies. (c) 2022 by the American College of Surgeons.

TI  - Assessment of Land Surface Temperature Estimates from Landsat 8-TIRS in A High-Contrast Semiarid Agroecosystem. Algorithms Intercomparison
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring Land Surface Temperature (LST) from Landsat satellites has been shown to be effective in the estimation of crop water needs and modeling water use efficiency. Accurate LST estimation becomes critical in semiarid areas under water scarcity scenarios. This work shows the assessment of some well-known Single-Channel (SC) and Split-Window (SW) algorithms, adapted to Landsat 8/TIRS, under the conditions of a high-contrast semiarid agroecosystem. The recently released Landsat 8 Level-2 LST product (L8_ST) has also been included in the performance analysis. Ground measurements of surface temperature were taken for the evaluation during the summers of 2018-2019 in the cropland area of the Barrax test site, Spain. A dataset of 44 ground samples and 11 different L8/TIRS dates/scenes was gathered, covering a variety of crop fields and surface conditions. In addition, a simplified Single Band Atmospheric Correction (L-SBAC) was introduced based on a linearization of the atmospheric correction parameters with the water vapor content (w) and a redefinition of the emissivity threshold for the emissivity correction in the study site. The best results show differences within +/- 4.0 K for temperatures ranging 300-325 K. Statistics for the L-SBAC result in a RMSE of +/- 1.8 K with negligible systematic deviation. Similar results were obtained for the other SC and SW algorithms tested, whereas an overestimation of 1.0 K was observed for the L8_ST product because of inappropriate assignment of emissivity values. These results show the potential of the proposed linearization approach and set the uncertainty for LST estimates in high-contrast semiarid agroecosystems.

TI  - A Dynamic Autocatalytic Network Model of Therapeutic Change
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Psychotherapy involves the modification of a client's worldview to reduce distress and enhance well-being. We take a human dynamical systems approach to modeling this process, using Reflexively Autocatalytic foodset-derived (RAF) networks. RAFs have been used to model the self-organization of adaptive networks associated with the origin and early evolution of both biological life, as well as the evolution and development of the kind of cognitive structure necessary for cultural evolution. The RAF approach is applicable in these seemingly disparate cases because it provides a theoretical framework for formally describing under what conditions systems composed of elements that interact and 'catalyze' the formation of new elements collectively become integrated wholes. In our application, the elements are mental representations, and the whole is a conceptual network. The initial components-referred to as foodset items-are mental representations that are innate, or were acquired through social learning or individual learning (of pre-existing information). The new elements-referred to as foodset-derived items-are mental representations that result from creative thought (resulting in new information). In clinical psychology, a client's distress may be due to, or exacerbated by, one or more beliefs that diminish self-esteem. Such beliefs may be formed and sustained through distorted thinking, and the tendency to interpret ambiguous events as confirmation of these beliefs. We view psychotherapy as a creative collaborative process between therapist and client, in which the output is not an artwork or invention but a more well-adapted worldview and approach to life on the part of the client. In this paper, we model a hypothetical albeit representative example of the formation and dissolution of such beliefs over the course of a therapist-client interaction using RAF networks. We show how the therapist is able to elicit this worldview from the client and create a conceptualization of the client's concerns. We then formally demonstrate four distinct ways in which the therapist is able to facilitate change in the client's worldview: (1) challenging the client's negative interpretations of events, (2) providing direct evidence that runs contrary to and counteracts the client's distressing beliefs, (3) using self-disclosure to provide examples of strategies one can use to diffuse a negative conclusion, and (4) reinforcing the client's attempts to assimilate such strategies into their own ways of thinking. We then discuss the implications of such an approach to expanding our knowledge of the development of mental health concerns and the trajectory of the therapeutic change.

TI  - Global Identification of Unelectrified Built-Up Areas by Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Access to electricity (the proportion of the population with access to electricity) is a key indica for of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7), which aims to provide affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy services for all. Accurate and timely global data on access to electricity in all countries is important for the achievement of SDG7. Current survey-based access to electricity datasets suffers from short time spans, slow updates, high acquisition costs, and a lack of location data. Accordingly, a new method for identifying the electrification status of built-up areas based on the remote sensing of nighttime light is proposed in this study. More specifically, the method overlays global built-up area data with night-time light remote sensing data to determine whether built-up areas are electrified based on a threshold night-time light value. By using our approach, electrified and unelectrified built-up areas were extracted at 500 m resolution on a global scale for the years 2014 and 2020. The acquired results show a significant reduction in an unelectrified built-up area between 2014 and 2020, from 51,301.14 km(2) to 22,192.52 km(2), or from 3.05% to 1.32% of the total built-up area. Compared to 2014, 117 countries or territories had improved access to electricity, and 18 increased their proportion of unelectrified built-up area by >0.1%. The identification accuracy was evaluated by using a random sample of 10,106 points. The accuracies in 2014 and 2020 were 97.29% and 98.9%, respectively, with an average of 98.1%. The outcomes of this method are in high agreement with the spatial distribution of access to electricity data reported by the World Bank. This study is the first to investigate the global electrification of built-up areas by using remote sensing. It makes an important supplement to global data on access to electricity, which can aid in the achievement of SDG7.

TI  - Mapping the Risk for West Nile Virus Transmission, Africa
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is an emergent arthropodborne virus that is transmitted from bird to bird by mosquitoes. Spillover events occur when infected mosquitoes bite mammals. We created a geopositioned database of WNV presence in Africa and considered reports of the virus in all animal components: reservoirs, vectors, and nonhuman dead-end hosts. We built various biogeographic models to determine which drivers explain the distribution of WNV throughout Africa. Wetlands of international importance for birds accounted for the detection of WNV in all animal components, whereas human-related drivers played a key role in the epizootic cases. We combined these models to obtain an integrative and large-scale perspective of the areas at risk for WNV spillover. Understanding which areas pose the highest risk would enable us to address the management of this spreading disease and to comprehend the translocation of WNV outside Africa through avian migration routes.

TI  - Application of Remote Sensing Data for Assessment of Bark Beetle Attacks in Pine Plantations in Kirkovo Region, the Eastern Rhodopes
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensive forest afforestation with native pine species was developed in the 1960s on degraded and deforested lands in the region of the Eastern Rhodopes (south-eastern Bulgaria). Severe damage by wet snow was registered in the coniferous forests of the Rhodopes in March 2015. In the following years, bark beetle attacks were registered on the broken and felled fresh wood. As a result, bark beetle infestation spots appeared in the pine plantations. In the period 2019-2021, damage caused by bark beetles was assessed in the region of State Forestry Kirkovo (the Eastern Rhodopes, south-eastern Bulgaria). An integrated approach using the data of the information system of the Executive Forest Agency (ISEFA), remote sensing data obtained by an "eBee SQ" unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a "Parrot Sequoia" multispectral camera, and subsequent terrestrial observations, was applied. ISEFA data showed that there was no serious damage caused by abiotic and biotic factors in the pine forests of SF Kirkovo until 2014. Snow damage in 2015 affected 513 ha of pine plantations, and bark beetle infestations reached up to 1316 ha in 2016. In 2019, a total of 226.87 ha of pine plantations were captured in three localities-Fotinovo, Kirkovo, and Kremen. The relative share of damage caused by bark beetles was greater in P. sylvestris plantations (15.3-23.0%), compared to damage in P. nigra (2.3%). Four different categories of normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) were separated in bark beetle infestation spots-living trees, dead trees, grass and shrub vegetation, stones and rocks. The NDVI values in locations with living trees varied between 0.500 (spaces between tree crowns) and 0.700 (central part of the crown projection) (an average of 0.617). In the locations with dead trees, the average values of NDVI of lying trees was 0.273, and in standing trees, NDVI varied between 0.275 (central part of crown projections) and 0.424 (spaces between tree crowns). In the locations with grass and shrub vegetation, stones and rocks, the average NDVI was 0.436 and 0.329, respectively. In the field study, average defoliation of 31.2-32.3% was registered in P. sylvestris plantations, and 47.4% in P. nigra plantations. Defoliations mainly were caused by pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) and fungal pathogens (Dothistroma septosporum and Lecanosticta acicola). The damage was caused by Ips acuminatus (in P. sylvestris only), and I. sexdentatus, Tomicus piniperda and T. minor (in P. sylvestris and P. nigra). Infestations by other xylophages, such as Phaenops cyanea, Rhagium inquisitor, and Pissodes spp., were also found on pine stems.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Langerhans cells (LCs) are crucial regulators of anti-cancer immune responses. Cancer, however, can alter DCs functions leading to tolerance. The enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) plays a crucial role in this process. In sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) of patients with melanoma, LCs show phenotypical and functional alterations favoring tolerance. Herein we aimed to investigate IDO1 expression in SLN LCs from patients with melanoma. We showed by immunofluorescence analysis that a portion of Langerin(+) LCs, located in the SLN T cell-rich area, displayed the typical dendritic morphology and expressed IDO1. There was no significant difference in the expression of IDO between SLN with or without metastases. Double IDO1/CD83 staining identified four LCs subsets: real mature IDO1(-)CD83(+) LCs; real immature IDO1(-)CD83(-) LCs; tolerogenic mature IDO1(+)CD83(+) LCs; tolerogenic immature IDO1(+)CD83(-) LCs. The latter subset was significantly increased in metastatic SLNs as compared to negative ones (p < 0.05), and in SLN LCs of patients with mitotic rate (MR) > 1 in primary melanoma, as compared to MR <= 1 (p < 0.05). Finally, immature SLN LCs, after in vitro stimulation by inflammatory cytokines, acquired a maturation profile by CD83 up-regulation. These results provide new input for immunotherapeutic approaches targeting in vivo LC of patients with melanoma.

TI  - Understanding traditional agro-ecosystem dynamics in response to systematic transition processes and rainfall variability patterns at watershed-scale in Southern Ethiopia
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal analysis of land cover dynamics using remote sensing can enable the determination of the spatial extent and average rate of land cover change. With the application of an appropriate change analysis method, it is also possible to distinguish whether a land cover change has occurred by the effect of a random or a systematic process. In connection with this, characterizing rainfall variability and historical meteorological drought events can allow understanding of their effects on agro-ecosystems and vegetation cover dynamics. Therefore, this study has evaluated multi-temporal land cover change in response to the possible impacts of population pressure and rainfall variability on agro-ecosystem dynamics. This was conducted on a traditional agroforestry-dominated landscape in Southern Ethiopia. Using Landsat images acquired in 1985, 2000, and 2018, a post-classification land cover change analysis approach was employed to distinguish between a systematic and random process of inter-category transitions. Assessment of drought events and rainfall variability dynamics were performed using standardized precipitation index (SPI) and rainfall coefficient of variation (CV), respectively. Mann-Kendall test was also applied for the detection of a monotonic rainfall trend. A bias-corrected Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) over 1981-2017 was used to calculate the SPI, CV and Mann-Kendall trend test. The analysis showed that above 41% of the landscape has experienced land cover transitions between 1985 and 2018. This has primarily resulted by a systematic and rapid expansion of agriculture, urban areas, and eucalyptus plantations, at the expense of natural vegetation ecosystems. Consequently, over the last 33 years (1985-2018), natural forest, grassland, and wetland have declined by 74.8%, 83.3%, and 78.4%, respectively. Another major land cover change identified in this study was the replacement of open-field crops by agroforestry, mainly in the western part of the catchment. Such expansion of agroforestry has appeared to be spatially correlated with a lower amount of long-term average and more variable rainfall. Perhaps, this could indicate farmers' response to rainfall variability by diversifying agricultural production options (i.e. agroforestry system), by replacing the more risk-prone mono-cropping culture. The observed persistence and further expansion of traditional agroforestry (a combination of perennial crops and scattered trees) have implications in terms of enhancing biodiversity conservation and environmental protection. Overall, the land cover transitions that occurred over the last three decades suggest future conservation priorities for improved landscape management, with more emphasis on the most exposed natural vegetation ecosystems.

TI  - Flares, Rotation, and Planets of the AU Mic System from TESS Observations
T2  - ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - AU Mic is a young (similar to 24 Myr), pre-main-sequence M dwarf star that was observed in the first month of science observations of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and reobserved 2 years later. This target has photometric variability from a variety of sources that is readily apparent in the TESS light curves; spots induce modulation in the light curve, flares are present throughout (manifesting as sharp rises with slow exponential decay phases), and transits of AU Mic b may be seen by eye as dips in the light curve. We present a combined analysis of both TESS Sector 1 and Sector 27 AU Mic light curves including the new 20 s cadence data from TESS Year 3. We compare flare rates between both observations and analyze the spot evolution, showing that the activity levels increase slightly from Sector 1 to Sector 27. Furthermore, the 20 s data collection allows us to detect more flares, smaller flares, and better resolve flare morphology in white light as compared to the 2 minute data collection mode. We also refine the parameters for AU Mic b by fitting three additional transits of AU Mic b from Sector 27 using a model that includes stellar activity. We show that the transits exhibit clear transit timing variations with an amplitude of similar to 80 s. We also detect three transits of a 2.8 R (circle plus) planet, AU Mic c, which has a period of 18.86 days.

TI  - Investigating the association between inpatient stroke therapy and disability, destination on discharge, length of stay and mortality: a prospective cohort study using the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective 'More is better' is a recognised mantra within stroke therapy, however, this has been developed in patients receiving long term rehabilitation. We investigated the relationship between amount of therapy received (from therapists and psychologists) and key patient outcomes during inpatient care. Design A secondary analysis of data from a prospective cohort study was performed. Multilevel mixed models adjusting for measured confounders (eg, severity), explored the relationship between therapy dose (average minutes per day of stay) and outcomes (disability, length of stay, home at discharge and mortality). Therapy was explored using simple linear terms and flexible natural cubic splines to allow for more complex relationships. Setting Data from the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme, covering England, Wales and Northern Ireland between July 2013 and July 2015 contained 94 905 adults with a stroke and still an inpatient after 72 hours. These patients received 92% (physiotherapy), 88% (occupational therapy), 57% (speech and language therapy) and 5% (clinical psychology), respectively. Results The average amount of therapy, for individual and 'any' therapy combined per day of stay was low. Overall, 41% were discharged with an 'independent' modified Rankin Scale (<= 2), 14% died, 44% were discharged home, and the median length of stay was 16 days. We observed complex relationships between amount of therapy received and outcomes. An additional minute of 'any' therapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and clinical psychology was associated with improved outcomes. Conversely, more physiotherapy was also associated with lower mortality and shorter length of stay, but also lower independence and discharge home. Conclusions Our findings suggest for stroke inpatients requiring therapy, 'More is better' may be overly simplistic. Strong limitations associated with analysis of routine data restrict further robust investigation of the therapy-response relationship. Robust prospective work is urgently needed to further investigate the relationships observed here.

TI  - Remotely sensed effectiveness assessments of protected areas lack a common framework: A review
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Review
AB  - Effective protected areas reflect socio-ecological values, such as biodiversity and habitat maintenance, as well as human well-being. These values, which safeguard ecosystem services in protected areas, are treated as models for the sustainable preservation and use of resources. While there is much research on the effectiveness of protected areas in a variety of disciplines, the question is whether there is a common framework that uses remote sensing methods. We conducted a qualitative and a quantitative analysis of 44 peer-reviewed scientific papers utilizing remote sensing data in order to examine the effectiveness of protected areas. Very few studies to date have a wide or even a global geographical focus; instead, most quantify the effectiveness of protected areas by focusing on local-scale case studies and single indicators such as forest cover change. Methods that help integrate spatial selection approaches, to compare a protected area's characteristics with its surroundings, are increasingly being used. Based on this review, we argue for a multi-indicator-based framework on protected area effectiveness, including the development of a consistent set of socio-ecological indicators for a global analysis. In turn, this will allow for globally applicable use, including a concrete evaluation that considers the diversity of regional parameters, biome-specific variables, and political frameworks. Ideally, such a framework will enhance the monitoring and evaluation of global strategies and conventions.

TI  - Retrieval of Total Column Carbon Dioxide over Russia from Meteor-M No. 2 Satellite Data
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A description is given of the method for the retrieval of atmospheric column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of carbon dioxide (XCO2) from the data of IKFS-2 infrared Fourier spectrometer on board the Meteor-M Russian meteorological satellites. The method is based on estimating XCO2 using a second-order regression, whose predictors are the effective spectral optical depths of the atmosphere in the infrared region of 8-14 mu m. The optical depth is determined using spectral intensities of outgoing radiation measured by the IKFS-2 as well as the calculated intensities of the Earth's surface or cloud top simulated as a gray body with temperature T-s. The temperature T-s is retrieved from IKFS-2 measurements within the atmospheric microwindow at the wave number equal to 900.1 cm(-1). The reference XCO2 values for constructing the regression were the results of contact CO2 measurements on the tall tower at the ZOTTO international observatory (Central Siberia) and at the NOAA observatory on the Mauna Loa volcano (Hawaii) in 2015-2016. The methodology was validated by comparing the XCO2 retrieved from Meteor-M No. 2 IKFS-2 measurements with parallel measurements over Siberia by the OCO and CrIS satellite spectrometers on board the OCO-2 and NOAA-20 satellites (USA). The maximum discrepancies in the daily estimates of the spatially averaged XCO2 during October 9-19, 2021 derived from the IKFS-2 data do not exceed 2.3 ppm versus the OCO data and 5 ppm versus the CrIS data.

TI  - MODWT-ANN hybrid models for daily precipitation estimates with time-delayed entries in Amazon region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological analyses based on precipitation records in the Amazon are essential due to their importance in climate regulation and regional and global atmospheric circulation. However, there are limitations related to data series with short periods and many gaps and failures at the daily scale. Thus, a hybrid model was developed based on an artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) coupled with the maximum overlap discrete wavelet (MODWT) method to obtain precipitation estimates. Six rainfall gauge stations located in different biomes within the studied region were adopted, and satellite data (CMORPH) were used. The interval of data that was have used is 1998-2016. The precipitation data were evaluated by seasonal (wet and dry) periods. The results obtained demonstrated the good capacity of the MODWT-ANFIS model to simulate the daily precipitation. In this case, data entries lagged by 4 days and 5 days performed better, with Nash values close to 1.0 and mean square errors (MSE) below 0.1.

TI  - Seeing Risks or Solutions: Psychological Distance and Ecological Worldview Moderated the Effect of Disgust Images on Attention to Environmental Messages
T2  - SAGE OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Disgust imageries often shun readers away from attending to important environmental messages. Based on the Limited Capacity Model and Construal Level Theory, an eye-tracking experiment was conducted to test the influence of psychological distance and disgust images on attention to environmental messages. Results indicated that psychological distance moderated disgust images' influence on attention to environmental communication messages. Disgust images increased attention to environmental messages only under the far distance condition. Additionally, disgust images increased attention to risk information but not efficacy information under the far distance condition, whereas non-disgust images increased attention to efficacy information under the close distance condition. All effects reported above were more salient among participants holding a more pro-environment worldview. Theoretical advances include the use of far psychological distance to reduce defensive reactions and the differential impact of disgust images on risk and efficacy information at the close or far psychological distance. Applied implications highlight the potentials of disgusting/non-disgusting images in emphasizing risk or efficacy information and reducing message avoidance.

TI  - "We will never get out of this power": The literary centrism of <i>Vospominaniya</i> by Grigory Potanin
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the specificity of the literary centrism of Vospominaniya [Memories] by Grigory Potanin, which became the final book of the leader of Siberian regionalism. The subject of the study determined the composition of the material taken. In addition to Vospominaniya, the analysis involves Krymskie Pis'ma Sibiryaka [The Crimean Letters of a Siberian], the brochure Vozrozhdenie Rossii i Ministerstvo Narodnogo Prosveshcheniya [The Revival of Russia and the Ministry of Public Education], Potanin's anniversary speech in 1915, as well as letters from the "senior" regionalist (first of all, letters to his second wife, the poetess M.G. Vasilyeva). The author refers to the methodology of research in the field of life-creation (Sh. Shahadat, A.L. Zorin), works on the literary centrism of Russian culture (Yu.M. Lotman, M. Berg, A.I. Zhuravleva), milestone research in Siberian studies (B.A. Chmykhalo, K.V. Anisimov, A.V. Remnev). The aim of the article is to consider the modes of literary centrism of Vospominaniya in the context of the literary centrism of Potanin's worldview and the views of "senior" regionalists on the relationship between literature and extra-literary reality. Though Vospominaniya belongs to non-fictional literature, its text is dominated by literary centrism. The key modes of literary centrism of the book are revealed. Their correlation with other manifestations of the literary centrism of Potanin's worldview is traced. The analysis led to the following conclusions. In his memoirs, Potanin intended to represent the events of his own life through the prism of literature as a reservoir of plot and behavioral models and psychological proto-narratives. Life in the cadet corps is portrayed as a place of spontaneous life-creation experience, the source of which was Nikolai Gogol's prose (first of all, Taras Bulba). The departure to St. Petersburg University is described with the help of an ironic auto-projection onto the mythologized biography of Mikhail Lomonosov. The episode of the meeting with Dostoevsky in Semipalatinsk is created according to the patterns of a scene from Mertvye Dushi [Dead Souls]. While developing "purely Siberian topics" in his Vospominaniya, Potanin actively turned to the resources of all-Russian literature, using its most significant achievements, which conflicted with the regional program of the 1860s-1870s and was more difficult to correlate with Potanin's views of the 1900s-1910s. Fictional literature did not occupy a dominant place in Potanin's legacy (and in that of "senior" regionalists in general), either structurally or in purely quantitative terms. At the same time, Potanin's most varied works had an almost invariable literature-centric focus, the apotheosis of which was Vospominaniya.

TI  - Intra-annual relationship between precipitation and forest disturbance in the African rainforest
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of forest disturbance patterns in relation to precipitation seasonality is important for understanding African tropical forest dynamics under changing climate conditions and different levels of human activities. Newly available radar-based forest disturbance information now enables an investigation of the intra-annual relationship between precipitation and forest disturbance in a spatially and temporally explicit manner, especially in the tropics, where frequent cloud cover hinders the use of optical-based remote sensing products. In this study, we applied cross-correlation on monthly precipitation and forest disturbance time series for 2019 and 2020 at a 0.5 degrees grid in the African rainforest. We used the magnitude of the correlation and time lag to assess the intra-annual relationship between precipitation and forest disturbance, and introduced accessibility proxies to analyse the spatial variation of the relationship. Results revealed that a significant negative correlation between forest disturbance and precipitation dominates the study region. We found that significant negative correlations appear on average closer to settlements with overall smaller variations in travel time to settlements compared to grid cells with non-significant and significant positive correlation. The magnitude of the negative correlation increases as the travel time to settlements increases, implying that forest disturbances in less accessible areas are more affected by precipitation seasonality and that in particular human-induced disturbance activities are predominantly carried out in the drier months. Few areas showed a significant positive correlation, mainly resulting from natural causes such as flooding. These new insights in the interaction between forest disturbance, precipitation and accessibility provide a step forward in understanding the complex interactions that underlie the complexity of forest loss patterns that we can increasingly capture with Earth Observation approaches. As such, they can support forest conservation and management in coping with climate change induced changes of precipitation patterns in African rainforest countries.

TI  - Estimating Reservoir Storage Variations by Combining Sentinel-2 and 3 Measurements in the Yliki Reservoir, Greece
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland water resources are facing increasing quantitative and qualitative pressures, deriving from anthropogenic causes and the ongoing climate change. The monitoring of reservoirs is essential for sustainable management and preparation against water scarcity and extreme events, such as droughts. This research, relying on the Sentinel-2 and 3 missions, attempts to demonstrate the efficiency of combining remotely sensed water level and water area estimations, in order to estimate the water storage variation of Yliki reservoir. The case study is conducted in one of the few sufficiently monitored reservoirs in Greece, enabling a direct comparison of the proposed methodology results with in situ observations. Moreover, this research work proposes a weekly time interval for pairing level and area estimations, instead of shorter time intervals. The results strongly demonstrate the efficiency of remote sensing in the production of empirical level-area-storage (L-A-S) curves. Correlation to in situ monitored storage- and satellite-derived water level, area stand for 98.81% and 99.27% respectively. Water storage variation is estimated and compared to the observed time series, resulting in an RMSE of 1.28% of the reservoir capacity and a correlation of 96.14%. The empirical L-S relationship underestimates storage, while the A-S relationship overestimates storage when compared to the existing L-A-S curve.

TI  - Ring Structures on Baikal Ice and Local Upwelling Cases in Summer
T2  - WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ring structures on Baikal ice were found in satellite images in the period when ice cover thickness decreased (April). Analysis of satellite data on lake surface temperature in summer showed that local zones with lower temperature of water surface can sometimes be seen during the navigation period. According to field studies of ring structures on lake ice, they form and develop under the effect of currents which contribute to a decrease in ice thickness. The available data show that the generation of anticyclonic currents can be caused by a local rise of deep water. Similar phenomena can be seen in summer. Data of satellite temperature measurements show local drops of lake surface temperature in summer caused by upwelling. This is directly related with the rise of cold water from a deep zone. Depending on the temperature stratification (direct or reverse), upwelling contributes to the generation of either cyclonic or anticyclonic currents, respectively. The different directions of currents are due to the difference between temperature stratification in winter and summer. The formation of ring structures on ice and local drops of surface water temperature in summer are due to local water rises (upwelling). The upwelling can be caused by convection. The decrease in the density of the underlying water can be due to (a) temperature increase; (b) a decrease in salinity; (c) an increase in the concentration of methane dissolved in water in bottom zone. In addition, the upward flows can be due to ascending gas hydrates.

TI  - An Estimation Method for PM<sub>2.5</sub> Based on Aerosol Optical Depth Obtained from Remote Sensing Image Processing and Meteorological Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal variations in the mass concentrations of particulate matter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) in size is important for controlling environmental pollution. Currently, ground measurement points of PM2.5 in China are relatively discrete, thereby limiting spatial coverage. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) data obtained from satellite remote sensing provide insights into spatiotemporal distributions for regional pollution sources. In this study, data from the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD (1 km resolution) product from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and hourly PM2.5 concentration ground measurements from 2015 to 2020 in Dalian, China were used. Although trends in PM2.5 and AOD were consistent over time, there were seasonal differences. Spatial distributions of AOD and PM2.5 were consistent (R-2 = 0.922), with higher PM2.5 values in industrial areas. The method of cross-dividing the test set by year was adopted, with AOD and meteorological factors as the input variable and PM2.5 as the output variable. A backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model of joint cross-validation was established; the stability of the model was evaluated. The trend in the predicted values of BPNN was consistent with the monitored values; the estimation result of the BPNN with the introduction of meteorological factors is better; coefficient of determination (R-2) and RMSE standard deviation (SD) between the predicted values and the monitored values in the test set were 0.663-0.752 and 0.01-0.05 mu g/m(3), respectively. The BPNN was simpler and the training time was shorter compared with those of a regression model and support vector regression (SVR). This study demonstrated that BPNN could be effectively applied to the MAIAC AOD data to estimate PM2.5 concentrations.

TI  - Climatology of aerosol types and their vertical distribution over East Asia based on CALIPSO lidar measurements
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol vertical distribution generally determines their health impacts and climate effects. By using long-term (2007-2019) CALIPSO lidar measurements, we present a large-scale insight into the climatology of aerosol types and their vertical structure over East Asia. Despite the low sampling frequency, comparison with MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) shows that the integrated CAIPSO vertical extinction can reasonably reproduce spatial patterns of the aerosol loading. With the unique advantage of active detection, CALIPSO reveals an obvious enhancement of the night-time AOD due to worse diffusion conditions. Moreover, long-range transport of different aerosols including dust, polluted dust, and smoke has substantial contribution to the aerosol loading over East Asia. Pure dust particles are mainly concentrated over the deserts with notable dust transport belts (dust AOD > 0.2 at 532 nm) along downwind regions during winter and spring. By contrast, polluted dust is prevalent over the downstream eastern China with much higher AODs throughout the year. In particular, AOD of polluted dust (similar to 0.5) is higher in winter rather than in spring, which is consistent with their seasonal occurrences. Smoke aerosols usually appear in the night-time over southern China. The top heights of aerosols are around 4-6 km, with dust and smoke having higher extinction at upstream regions. The climatology of these aerosol types and vertical distribution can provide a significant constraint for associated studies of air quality and climate effects.

TI  - Analysis of Land Use Change and Driving Mechanisms in Vietnam during the Period 2000-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-accuracy, long-time-series and large-scale land classification mapping are essential for assessing the evolutionary patterns of land systems and developing sustainability studies. In this paper, using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Landsat satellite remote sensing images, based on the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, we carried out remote sensing classification to obtain a year-by-year land use/cover data set in Vietnam over the past 21 years (2000-2020). Further applying principal component analysis and multiple linear regression methods, we examined the spatio-temporal characteristics, dynamic changes and driving mechanisms of land use change. The results show the following: (1) The RF classification algorithm supported by the GEE can quickly and accurately obtain a land use/cover data set. The overall classification accuracy is 0.91 +/- 0.01. (2) The land cover types in Vietnam are dominated by woodland and cropland, with an area share of 54.62% and 37.90%, respectively. In the past 20 years, the area of built-up land has increased the most (+93.49%), followed by the area of water bodies (+54.19%), while the area of woodland has remained almost unchanged. (3) The expansion of built-up land is driven by regional economic development; the area changes in cropland, water bodies and woodland are influenced by both national economic development and climate change. The results of the study provide a basis for assessing land use policies in Vietnam and a reference methodological framework for rapid land mapping and analysis in other countries in the China-Indochina Peninsula.

TI  - Reprocessing 12-yr Microwave Humidity Sounder Historical Data of Fengyun-3 Satellites
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric water vapor is an essential climate variable (ECV) with extensive spatial and temporal variations. Microwave humidity observations from meteorological satellites provide important information for climate system variables, including atmospheric water vapor and precipitable water, and assimilation in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and reanalysis. As one of the payloads onboard China's second-generation polar-orbiting operational meteorological Fengyun-3 (FY-3) satellites, the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MWHS) has been continuously observing the global humidity since 2008. The reprocessing of historical FY-3 MWHS data is documented in detail in this study. After calibrating and correcting the data, the quality of the reprocessed dataset is evaluated and the improvement is shown in this study. The results suggest that MWHS observations bias is reduced to approximately 0.8 K, compared with METOP-A Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS). The temporal variability of MWHS is highly correlated with the instrument temperature. After reprocessing, the scene temperature dependency is mitigated for all 183 GHz channels, and the consistency and stability between FY-3A/B/C are also improved.

TI  - Water-Body Segmentation for SAR Images: Past, Current, and Future
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), as a microwave sensor that can sense a target all day or night under all-weather conditions, is of great significance for detecting water resources, such as coastlines, lakes and rivers. This paper reviews literature published in the past 30 years in the field of water body extraction in SAR images, and makes some proposals that the community working with SAR image waterbody extraction should consider. Firstly, this review focuses on the main ideas and characteristics of traditional water body extraction on SAR images, mainly focusing on traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods. Secondly, how Deep Learning (DL) methods are applied and optimized in the task of water-body segmentation for SAR images is summarized from the two levels of pixel and image. We also pay more attention to the most popular networks, such as U-Net and its modified models, and novel networks, such as the Cascaded Fully-Convolutional Network (CFCN) and River-Net. In the end, an in-depth discussion is presented, along with conclusions and future trends, on the limitations and challenges of DL for water-body segmentation.

TI  - Filling Temporal Gaps within and between GRACE and GRACE-FO Terrestrial Water Storage Records: An Innovative Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal gaps within the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) (gap: 20 months), between GRACE and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) missions (gap: 11 months), and within GRACE-FO record (gap: 2 months) make it difficult to analyze and interpret spatiotemporal variability in GRACE- and GRACE-FO-derived terrestrial water storage (TWSGRACE) time series. In this study, an overview of data and approaches used to fill these gaps and reconstruct the TWSGRACE record at the global scale is provided. In addition, the study provides an innovative approach that integrates three machine learning techniques (deep-learning neural networks [DNN], generalized linear model [GLM], and gradient boosting machine [GBM]) and eight climatic and hydrological input variables to fill these gaps and reconstruct the TWSGRACE data record at both global grid and basin scales. For each basin and grid cell, the model performance was assessed using Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), correlation coefficient (CC), and normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), a leader model was selected based on the model performance, and variables that significantly control leader model outputs were defined. Results indicate that (1) the leader model reconstructed the TWSGRACE with high accuracy over both grid and local scales, particularly in wet and low anthropogenically active regions (grid scale: NSE = 0.65 +/- 0.20, CC = 0.81 +/- 0.13, and NSE = 0.56 +/- 0.16; basin scale: NSE = 0.78 +/- 0.14, CC = 0.89 +/- 0.07, and NRMSE = 0.43 +/- 0.14); (2) no single model was flawless in reconstructing the TWSGRACE over all grids or basins, so a combination of models is necessary; (3) basin-scale models outperform grid-scale models; (4) the DNN model outperforms both GLM and GBM at the basin scale, whereas the GBM outperforms at the grid scale; (5) among other inputs, the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)-derived TWS controls the model performance on both basin and grid scales; and (6) the reconstructed TWSGRACE data captured extreme climatic events over the investigated basins and grid cells. The developed approach is robust, effective, and could be used to accurately reconstruct TWSGRACE for any hydrologic system across the globe.

TI  - A Spectral Mixture Analysis and Landscape Metrics Based Framework for Monitoring Spatiotemporal Forest Cover Changes: A Case Study in Mato Grosso, Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An increasing amount of Brazilian rainforest is being lost or degraded for various reasons, both anthropogenic and natural, leading to a loss of biodiversity and further global consequences. Especially in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, soy production and large-scale cattle farms led to extensive losses of rainforest in recent years. We used a spectral mixture approach followed by a decision tree classification based on more than 30 years of Landsat data to quantify these losses. Research has shown that current methods for assessing forest degradation are lacking accuracy. Therefore, we generated classifications to determine land cover changes for each year, focusing on both cleared and degraded forest land. The analyses showed a decrease in forest area in Mato Grosso by 28.8% between 1986 and 2020. In order to measure changed forest structures for the selected period, fragmentation analyses based on diverse landscape metrics were carried out for the municipality of Colniza in Mato Grosso. It was found that forest areas experienced also a high degree of fragmentation over the study period, with an increase of 83.3% of the number of patches and a decrease of the mean patch area of 86.1% for the selected time period, resulting in altered habitats for flora and fauna.

TI  - THE IMPACT OF TERRAIN AND SPECTRAL VARIABLES IN ESTIMATING SOIL ORGANIC MATTER USING REMOTE SENSING IN SEMI-ARID MOUNTAINOUS AREAS
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling of soil properties, i.e. soil organic matter (SOM) through remote sensing (RS) technique is done only with environmental static or dynamic variables. The purpose of this study was to use both series of these variables to model SOM in mountainous areas in northern Iran. The SOM map zoning was performed through kriging method using 148 soil samples. The SOM was modeled using i) terrain attributes obtained from global digital elevation model (GDEM), ii) spectral indices/variables derived from satellite imagery (Landsat_8; TM), and iii) combining terrestrial {topographic factor, aspect, elevation, mid slope position, maximum difference from mean elevation, multi resolution ridge top flatness, general curvature, convergence index, total curvature, hill shade and catchment area} and RS {albedo, land surface temperature, emissivity, incidence, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and bare soil index (BSI)} variables. The VarImp function was used to determine the degree of importance of each variable in modeling by creating regression trees in SAGA software. The results showed that hybrid model (using a combination of both terrestrial and spectral variables) significantly increases the accuracy of SOM modeling with the highest correlation coefficient (R-2) and the lowest root mean square error RMSE. The R-2 values of the three models were 0.60, 0.64 and 0.78 and the RMSE values were 0.86, 0.68 and 0.53, respectively. Elevation and mid slope position, emissivity, BSI, NDVI were the most important terrain and spectral variables in SOM modeling with an importance of 53.2, 58.3, 87.6, 65 and 61 %, respectively. As such, the results of this study are of particular importance to provide a statistical and theoretical basis for predicting the SOM based on readily available remotely-sensed and terrain data, with potential for use in similar semi-arid mountainous areas internationally.

TI  - Plant Ontogeny Strongly Influences SO<sub>2</sub> Stress Resistance in Landscape Tree Species Leaf Functional Traits
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a major atmospheric pollutant and abiotic stressor. Although physiological studies on abiotic stressors have focused on fully expanded leaves, the resistance of leaf functional traits to SO2 during individual leaf development has not been studied. Thus, this study aimed to conduct SO2 static artificial fumigation experiments to evaluate changes in leaf functional traits and resistance to SO2 for three common landscape tree species (Syringa oblata Lindl. (S. oblata), Prunus cerasifera var. atropurpurea Jack. (P. cerasifera), and Ulmus pumila 'Jinye' (U. pumila)) in Changchun City and ontogeny under SO2 stress. Samples were collected on three days in autumn (1 September, 9 September, and 19 September 2019) for two different leaf stages (10 days and 40 days). In addition, remote sensing data were combined to explore the resistance mechanisms of broadleaf forests to different SO2 concentration classes during different seasons on a large scale. The results showed that the chlorophyll content, leaf temperature, green-peak reflectance, and Fv/Fm (maximal photochemical efficiency) at 10 days were significantly lower than that at 40 days, regardless of sampling date or SO2 concentration. Additionally, in general the SO2 resistance for 10 days leaves was consistently smaller than those for 40 days leaves in 3 tree species. On 9 September, 10 days leaves of the three tree species showed different leaf resistance performances under different SO2 concentrations in the order: P. cerasifera > S. oblata > U. pumila. Lastly, the extent of resistance decreased with increasing rho(SO2) classes in different seasons, and the SO2 resistance was affected by season. We conclude that mature leaves are more resistant to SO2 stress than young leaves are. These results will provide scientific guidance on artificial plant community construction and prevention of future vegetation degradation.

TI  - Impacts of Sub-Grid Topographic Representations on Surface Energy Balance and Boundary Conditions in the E3SM Land Model: A Case Study in Sierra Nevada
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sub-grid topographic heterogeneity has large impacts on surface energy balance and land-atmosphere interactions. However, the impacts of representing sub-grid topographic effects in land surface models (LSMs) on surface energy balance and boundary conditions remain unclear. This study analyzed and evaluated the impacts of sub-grid topographic representations on surface energy balance, turbulent heat flux, and scalar (co-)variances in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) land model (ELM). Three sub-grid topographic representations in ELM were compared: (a) the default sub-grid structure (D), (b) the recently developed sub-grid topographic structure (T), and (c) high spatial resolution (1KM). Additionally, two different solar radiation schemes in ELM were compared: (a) the default plane-parallel radiative transfer scheme (PP) and (b) the parameterization scheme (TOP) that accounts for sub-grid topographic effects on solar radiation. A series of offline simulations with the three grid discretization structures (D, T, and 1KM) and two schemes of solar radiation (TOP and PP) were carried out using the Sierra Nevada, California. 1KM simulations with TOP well capture the spatial heterogeneity of surface fluxes compared to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer remote sensing data. There are significant differences between TOP and PP in the 1-km simulated surface energy balance, but the differences in mean values and standard deviations become small when aggregated to the grid scale (i.e., 0.5 degrees). The T configuration better mimics the 1KM simulations with TOP than the D configuration and better captures the sub-grid topographic effects on surface energy balance and boundary conditions. These results underline the importance of representing sub-grid topographic heterogeneities in LSMs and motivate future research to understand the sub-grid topographic effects on land-atmosphere interactions over mountainous areas.

TI  - India's Greening Trend Seems to Slow Down. What Does Aerosol Have to Do with It?
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple drivers perturb the terrestrial carbon cycle, which ultimately reshapes the fertilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) and reorientates the climate. One such driver is atmospheric aerosols, which cascade the ecosystem's productivity in a large proportionality. Investigating this relation is non-conventional and limited across the globe. With the abundance of heterogenetic terrestrial ecosystems, India's primary productivity has a large proportion of the global carbon balance. Under climate change stress, India's unique spatial and climatological features perturb atmospheric aerosols from natural sources to anthropogenic sources. In light of that, this study utilizes the Carnegie-Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model to elucidate the consequence by examining the potential effect of aerosol load on the ecosystem productivity (Net Primary Production; NPP) for various agroclimatic zones of India from 2001-2020. CASA reveals a negative decadal amplitude with an overall increase in the NPP trend. In contrast, aerosol loadings from MODIS highlight the increasing trend, with definite seasonal intensities. Employing the CASA model and earth observations, the study highlights the increase in NPP in forest-based ecosystems due to relatively lower aerosols and higher diffuse radiation. Critically, strong dampening of NPP was observed in the agroecological and sparse vegetation zones inferring that the aerosol loadings affect the primary productivity by affecting the photosynthesis of canopy architecture. Spatial sensitivity zones across different ecological regions result in a non-homogenous response because of different phenological and canopy architecture that is mediated by the radiation intensities. Based on the analysis, the study infers that AOD positively influences the canopy-scale photosynthesis by diffuse radiation, which promotes NPP but is less likely for the crop canopy ecosystems. Barring the limitations, enhancement of NPP in the forest ecosystems offset the demand for carbon sink in the agroecosystems. Findings from this study reveal that a more precise provenance of aerosol effects on carbon fluxes is required to understand the uncertainties in the terrestrial carbon cycle.

TI  - Evaluating Several Vegetation Indices Derived from Sentinel-2 Imagery for Quantifying Localized Overgrazing in a Semi-Arid Region of South Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangeland monitoring aims to determine whether grazing management strategies meet the goals of sustainable resource utilization. The development of sustainable grazing management strategies requires an understanding of the manner in which grazing animals utilize available vegetation. In this study, we made use of livestock tracking, in situ observations and Sentinel-2 imagery to make rangeland scale observations of vegetation conditions in a semi-arid environment, to better understand the spatial relationships between vegetation conditions and sheep movement patterns. We hypothesized that sheep graze more selectively under low stocking rates-resulting in localized overgrazing. We also assessed the importance of image spatial resolution, as it was assumed localized effects of grazing will be best explained by higher resolution imagery. The results showed that livestock tend to congregate along drainage lines where soils are deeper. The findings demonstrate how the spatial analysis of remotely sensed data can provide a landscape-scale overview of livestock movement patterns. This study illustrates that high-resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data can be used as a grazing management tool to determine the spatial variability of productive areas across the semi-arid Upper Karoo rangelands and identify preferred grazing areas.

TI  - Integration Remote Sensing and Meteorological Data to Monitoring Plant Phenology and Estimation Crop Coefficient and Evapotranspiration
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The water requirements of the wheat crop are represented by the actual evapotranspiration, which depends on the meteorological data of the study area and the amount of water consumed during the season. Estimation of crop coefficients (Kc) and evapotranspiration (ETc) using remote sensing data is essential for decision-making regarding water management in irrigated areas in arid and semi-arid large-scale areas. This research aims to estimate the crop coefficient calculated from remote sensing data and the actual evapotranspiration values for the crop. The FAO Penman-Monteith equation has been used to estimate the reference evapotranspiration from meteorological data. Linear regression analysis was applied by developing prediction equations for the crop coefficient for different growth stages of comparing with the vegetation cover index (NDVI). The results showed that (R-2 = 0.98) between field crop coefficient and crop coefficient predicted from (Kc = 2.0114 NDVI-0.147) in addition to (RMSE = 0.92 and (d = 0.97).

TI  - Linking Land Use and Plant Functional Diversity Patterns in Sabah, Borneo, through Large-Scale Spatially Continuous Sentinel-2 Inference
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Global biodiversity losses erode the functioning of our vital ecosystems. Functional diversity is increasingly recognized as a critical link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Satellite earth observation was proposed to address the current absence of information on large-scale continuous patterns of plant functional diversity. This study demonstrates the inference and spatial mapping of functional diversity metrics through satellite remote sensing over a large key biodiversity region (Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, similar to 53,000 km(2)) and compares the derived estimates across a land-use gradient as an initial qualitative assessment to test the potential merits of the approach. Functional traits (leaf water content, chlorophyll-a and -b, and leaf area index) were estimated from Sentinel-2 spectral reflectance using a pre-trained neural network on radiative transfer modeling simulations. Multivariate functional diversity metrics were calculated, including functional richness, divergence, and evenness. Spatial patterns of functional diversity were related to land-use data distinguishing intact forest, logged forest, and oil palm plantations. Spatial patterns of satellite remotely sensed functional diversity are significantly related to differences in land use. Intact forests, as well as logged forests, featured consistently higher functional diversity compared to oil palm plantations. Differences were profound for functional divergence, whereas functional richness exhibited relatively large variances within land-use classes. By linking large-scale patterns of functional diversity as derived from satellite remote sensing to land-use information, this study indicated initial responsiveness to broad human disturbance gradients over large geographical and spatially contiguous extents. Despite uncertainties about the accuracy of the spatial patterns, this study provides a coherent early application of satellite-derived functional diversity toward further validation of its responsiveness across ecological gradients.

TI  - Living with Rheumatic Heart Disease at the Intersection of Biomedical and Aboriginal Worldviews
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) significantly impacts the lives of First Nations Australians. Failure to eliminate RHD is in part attributed to healthcare strategies that fail to understand the lived experience of RHD. To rectify this, a PhD study was undertaken in the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia, combining Aboriginal ways of knowing, being and doing with interviews (24 participants from clinical and community settings) and participant observation to privilege Aboriginal voices, including the interpretations and experiences of Aboriginal co-researchers (described in the adjunct article). During analysis, Aboriginal co-researchers identified three interwoven themes: maintaining good feelings; creating clear understanding (from good information); and choosing a good djalkiri (path). These affirm a worldview that prioritises relationships, positive emotions and the wellbeing of family/community. The findings demonstrate the inter-connectedness of knowledge, choice and behaviour that become increasingly complex in stressful and traumatic health, socioeconomic, political, historical and cultural contexts. Not previously heard in the RHD domain, the findings reveal fundamental differences between Aboriginal and biomedical worldviews contributing to the failure of current approaches to communicating health messages. Mitigating this, Aboriginal co-researchers provided targeted recommendations for culturally responsive health encounters, including: communicating to create positive emotions; building trust; and providing family and community data and health messages (rather than individualistic).

TI  - From Forest Dynamics to Wetland Siltation in Mountainous Landscapes: A RS-Based Framework for Enhancing Erosion Control
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities have caused a significant change in the function and services that ecosystems have provided to society since historical times. In mountainous landscapes, the regulation of services such as water quality or erosion control has been impacted by land use and land cover (LULC) changes, especially the loss and fragmentation of forest patches. In this work, we develop a Remote Sensing (RS)-based modelling approach to identify areas for the implementation of nature-based solutions (NBS) (i.e., natural forest conservation and restoration) that allow reducing the vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to siltation in mountainous regions. We used time series Landsat 5TM, 7ETM+, 8OLI and Sentinel 2A/2B MSI (S2) imagery to map forest dynamics and wetland distribution in Picos de Europa National Park (Cantabrian Mountains, northern Spain). We fed RS-based models with detailed in situ information based on photo-interpretation and fieldwork completed from 2017 to 2021. We estimated a forest cover increase rate of 2 ha/year comparing current and past LULC maps against external validation data. We applied this forest gain to a scenario generator model to derive a 30-year future LULC map that defines the potential forest extent for the study area in 2049. We then modelled the distribution of wetlands to identify the areas with the greatest potential for moisture accumulation. We used an S2 mosaic and topography-derived data such as the slope and topographic wetness index (TWI), which indicate terrain water accumulation. Overall accuracy scores reached values of 86% for LULC classification and 61% for wetland mapping. At the same time, we obtained the potential erosion using the NetMap software to identify potential sediment production, transport and deposition areas. Finally, forest dynamics, wetland distribution and potential erosion were combined in a multi-criteria analysis aiming to reduce the amount of sediment reaching selected wetlands. We achieved this by identifying the most suitable locations for the conservation and restoration of natural forests on slopes and in riparian areas, which may reduce the risk of soil erosion and maximise sediment filtering, respectively. The results show a network pattern for forest management that would allow for controlling erosion effects across space and time at three levels: one, by reducing the load that originates upslope in the absence of forest cover; two, by intersecting runoff at watercourses related to sediment transport; and three, by a lack of former barriers, by trapping erosion near to the receiving wetland systems, main river axes and contributing streams. In conclusion, the proposed methodology, which could be transferred to other mountain regions, allows to optimise investment for erosion prevention and wetland conservation by using only very specific areas of the landscape for habitat management (e.g., for NBS implementation).

TI  - Modeling of oil palm phenology based on remote sensing data: opportunities and challenges
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Oil palm phenology has many advantages in managing the sustainability of oil palm plantations. The phenology of oil palms is a key issue in harvest estimation, fruit bunch production, estimating oil palm taxes, replanting, fertilization, and detecting oil palm disease. One of the recently developed methods of oil palm phenology involves the use of remote sensing technology. We evaluated and reviewed the current state of oil palm phenology based on remote sensing and conducted an optimized systematic review of recent scientific publications, specifically focusing on scientific peer-reviewed papers published between 1990 and 2021, comprising over 100 existing journal papers on remote sensing for oil palm phenology. The review includes a description of the state of the art and the mapping of oil palm phenology based on sensors, biophysical tree parameters, and classification techniques and also describes the state of the art in the development of regression models of oil palm phenology based on wavelength, biophysical tree parameters, and the type of regression model. Finally, the review provided an opportunity to develop suitable techniques for the identification, classification, and the construction of regression models of oil palm phenology. There is a lot of potential in combining multisensor approaches, suitable classification methods, and regression models for oil palm phenology. For future studies on oil palm phenology, we recommend integrating machine learning with oil palm biophysical parameters based on multisensor remote sensing technologies.

TI  - Water Accounting and Productivity Analysis to Improve Water Savings of Nile River Basin, East Africa: From Accountability to Sustainability
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Complete water accounting (WA) and crop water productivity (CWP) analysis is crucial for evaluating water use efficiency (WUE). This study aims to evaluate the contributions of hydro-meteorological factors to the changes of WA and CWP and subsequent WUE based on the data from 2009-2020 in the Nile River Basin (NRB), East Africa (EA). The Mann-Kendall (MK) statistical test and Sen's slope estimator were applied to detect the trends of climatic factors, and the AquaCrop model was used to simulate the crop yields in response to water balance and consumption based on crop physiological, soil water, and salt budget concepts. For the years 2012 and 2019, the mean of climatic water deficit P - ETa was 71.03 km(3) and 37.03 km(3), respectively, which was expected to rise to similar to 494.57 km(3) by 2050. The results indicated that the basin water budget was unbalanced due to the coupled impact of year-to-year hot and dry conditions and increase in water abstraction, an indication of water deficit or stress. CWP and WUE increased during the study period with different changing patterns. CWP was also found to correlate to the yield of major crops (p-value > 0.05). It was concluded that climatic factors influenced the crop yield, CWP, and WUE in the study area. Thus, the improvement of CWP and WUE should rely on advanced water-saving innovations. The findings of this study could help water managers to improve water productivity by focusing on water account potentials and creating regional advantages by deploying water in combination with surplus flow from upstream to downstream consumption.

TI  - Predicting Species and Structural Diversity of Temperate Forests with Satellite Remote Sensing and Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenically-driven climate change, land-use changes, and related biodiversity losses are threatening the capability of forests to provide a variety of valuable ecosystem services. The magnitude and diversity of these services are governed by tree species richness and structural complexity as essential regulators of forest biodiversity. Sound conservation and sustainable management strategies rely on information from biodiversity indicators that is conventionally derived by field-based, periodical inventory campaigns. However, these data are usually site-specific and not spatially explicit, hampering their use for large-scale monitoring applications. Therefore, the main objective of our study was to build a robust method for spatially explicit modeling of biodiversity variables across temperate forest types using open-access satellite data and deep learning models. Field data were obtained from the Biodiversity Exploratories, a research infrastructure platform that supports ecological research in Germany. A total of 150 forest plots were sampled between 2014 and 2018, covering a broad range of environmental and forest management gradients across Germany. From field data, we derived key indicators of tree species diversity (Shannon Wiener Index) and structural heterogeneity (standard deviation of tree diameter) as proxies of forest biodiversity. Deep neural networks were used to predict the selected biodiversity variables based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images from 2017. Predictions of tree diameter variation achieved good accuracy (r(2) = 0.51) using Sentinel-1 winter-based backscatter data. The best models of species diversity used a set of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 features but achieved lower accuracies (r(2) = 0.25). Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning and satellite remote sensing to predict forest parameters across a broad range of environmental and management gradients at the landscape scale, in contrast to most studies that focus on very homogeneous settings. These highly generalizable and spatially continuous models can be used for monitoring ecosystem status and functions, contributing to sustainable management practices, and answering complex ecological questions.

TI  - Identifying the Factors behind Climate Diversification and Refugial Capacity in Mountain Landscapes: The Key Role of Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have shown the importance of small-scale climate diversification and climate microrefugia for organisms to escape or suffer less from the impact of current climate change. These situations are common in topographically complex terrains like mountains, where many climate-forcing factors vary at a fine spatial resolution. We investigated this effect in a high roughness area of a southern European range (the Pyrenees), with the aid of a network of miniaturized temperature and relative humidity sensors distributed across 2100 m of elevation difference. We modeled the minimum (Tn) and maximum (Tx) temperatures above- and below-ground, and maximum vapor pressure deficit (VPDmax), as a function of several topographic and vegetation variables derived from ALS-LiDAR data and Landsat series. Microclimatic models had a good fit, working better in soil than in air, and for Tn than for Tx. Topographic variables (including elevation) had a larger effect on above-ground Tn, and vegetation variables on Tx. Forest canopy had a significant effect not only on the spatial diversity of microclimatic metrics but also on their refugial capacity, either stabilizing thermal ranges or offsetting free-air extreme temperatures and VPDmax. Our integrative approach provided an overview of microclimatic differences between air and soil, forests and open areas, and highlighted the importance of preserving and managing forests to mitigate the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. Remote-sensing can provide essential tools to detect areas that accumulate different factors extensively promoting refugial capacity, which should be prioritized based on their high resilience.

TI  - Evaluation of land cover changes and secondary ecological succession of typical agroforestry landscapes in Phu Yen Province
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of land cover changes as well as landscape succession has theoretical and practical significance. Determining the characteristics, causes, and trends of the changes and succession of a landscape allows for assessing the natural and human characteristics of the territory. On this basis, appropriate solutions and policies in resource management, socioeconomic development, and environmental protection are available for each locality. Applying and integrating remote sensing data with field investigations and surveys improves the accuracy and reliability of research results. From the establishment of a land cover change map based on land cover map data collected in 2010, 2015, and 2020, variations in the land cover types of Phu Yen Province were observed. In the period 2010-2015, the area of natural forests and grasslands, shrubs, and bare lands decreased rapidly, whereas the covered areas of intentionally planted forests, industrial trees, and crops increased significantly. The secondary ecological succession of the agroforestry landscape of Phu Yen Province in the last 50-60 years occurred under the strong influence of human activities. Under the impact of chemical warfare and policies and farming practices of the local people, several evergreen broad-leaved tropical forest landscape units have undergone four to six stages of succession, with the interweaving of the economic development policy of Phu Yen Province and farming practices of the local people, making the structure and length of each period and succession very different.

TI  - An Overview of Aerosol Properties in Clear and Cloudy Sky Based on CALIPSO Observations
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A full understanding of the climatological properties of aerosols is an important step towards characterizing their effects on climate. Utilizing the observations from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations, we study cloud-free and cloudy aerosol properties with attention on aerosol and cloud layer relative vertical positions. On a global scale, the cloud-free aerosols account for about 56% of all detected aerosols with a mean optical depth ((tau) over bar (a)) and mean uncertainty of 0.135 +/- 0.047. The cloudy aerosols, accounting for 44%, have a larger (tau) over bar (a) and larger mean uncertainty of 0.143 +/- 0.074 compared to the cloud-free aerosols. The above-cloud aerosols (similar to 4%), primarily composed of elevated smoke, dust/volcanic ash and polluted dust, have a much smaller (tau) over bar (a) of (0.056 +/- 0.038). The below-cloud aerosols (-21%) have (tau) over bar (a) similar to 0.165 +/- 0.087. The below-cloud and cloud-free aerosols show close tau(a) probability density distributions and similar aerosol types, indicating that cloud-free aerosol climatologies from passive sensors are likely representative of all-sky conditions. In addition, about 27% of the detected aerosol profiles are found to have cloud layers vertically connected to the detected aerosol layers. The lidar backscatter profiles of these aerosols have larger median values than the cloud-free, above-cloud and below-cloud aerosols. The seasonal variations of the cloud-free and the cloudy aerosols significantly vary with regions. Our results imply that quantifying the impact of clouds, particularly cirrus due to the wide coverage of cirrus-aerosol overlap, on aerosol direct radiative effect is crucial to assess aerosols' roles in the Earth-climate system.

TI  - Assessing Water Quality Parameters in Burullus Lake Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Images
T2  - WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Burullus lake is one of the coastal lakes in northern Egypt. Burullus lake is connected to seven drains through its western, eastern, and southern shores. The discharge of untreated wastewater (domestic, industrial, and agricultural) from these drains caused degradation for the water quality of the lake. Therefore, it is needed to develop a methodology to monitor water quality parameters at a low cost. This study is a trial to estimate water quality parameters from remote sensing data (reflectance data) by developing statistical regression models. Sentinel-2 reflectance data are compared to field measurements. The field measurements include transparency (SDT), chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and salinity. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) are calculated to evaluate the goodness of fit between field measurements and reflectance values. The results show that the optimum bands and bands ratios to estimate SDT, Chl-a, TN, TP, and Salinity are B6/B7, B7/B8, B8A, B8/B3, and B3/B8, respectively. The developed regression model is acceptable to be used for detecting water parameters and the produced R-2 and NRMSE are within the range from 0.52 to 0.83 and from 0.12 to 0.34, respectively. The distribution maps of water quality parameters were built using the regression equations by writing these equations in the raster calculator as raster calculation expression. The results of this study show that both optical and non-optical water quality parameters are reasonably correlated with Sentinel-2 reflectance data as a low-cost data source.

TI  - Ecological Impacts of Land Use Change in the Arid Tarim River Basin of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/cover change has become an indispensable part of global eco-environmental change research. The Tarim River Basin is the largest inland river basin in China. It is also one of the most ecologically fragile areas in the country, with greening and desertification processes coexisting. This paper analyzes the evolution of land-use/cover change in the Tarim River Basin over the past 30 years based on remote sensing data. The research also explores the contribution of conversion between different land types to the ecological environment by selecting methods, such as transfer matrix and ecological contribution rate. Results indicate that grassland and barren land are the main land types in the region, accounting for 72.46% and 18.87% of the basin area, respectively. From 1990 to 2019, cropland area increased from 33,585.89 km(2) to 52,436.40 km(2), an increase of 56.13%, while barren land areas decreased from 781,380.57 km(2) to 760,783.29 km(2). Most of the land-use conversion was grassland to other land types and other land types to barren land. Since 1990, the conversion of barren land to grassland and cropland in the basin has led to ecological improvement, whereas the conversion of grassland to cropland has caused deterioration, but with a generally improving trend. It is anticipated that, over the next decade, changes in land types will involve increases in grassland and woodland area, decreases in barren land and cropland, and an overall improvement in the ecological environment in the watershed. Since agriculture and animal husbandry are the main industries in the Tarim River Basin and the land-use structure is dominated by cropland and grassland, several key measures should be implemented. These include improving land use, rationalizing the use of water and soil resources, slowing down the expansion of cropland, and alleviating the contradiction between humans and land, with the ultimate aim of achieving sustainable development of the social economy and ecological environment.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ocean dynamics application radar (CODAR) SeaSonde high-frequency (HF) radars deployed along the coast of Taiwan were used to reveal ocean surface current variations both hourly and through climatological seasons in the Penghu Channel (PHC), southeastern Taiwan Strait (TS), from December 2014 to December 2020. The ocean current in the PHC has a semidiurnal tidal cycle, and the seasonal main flow, wind direction, and wind strength significantly affect the direction and speed of the flow passing through the PHC. The speed of the tidal current in the PHC area can reach more than 1 m/s, and the monthly average flow speed in the PHC is between 0.12 (winter) and 0.24 m/s (summer). Several buoys indicated that the southward flow along the western coast of Taiwan drifted through the PHC in fall and winter. The HF radar observations confirmed the same, implying that this occurred during the strong northeastern monsoon. For a weak northerly wind or even southerly wind, the flow in the PHC can be northward. Different wind directions can affect the speed of the flow passing through the PHC and the branch flow in the northern PHC. The HF radar results are highly consistent with the spatial characteristics of satellite data regarding the sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, and chlorophyll concentrations; however, there are significant differences from the satellite-derived ocean current.

T2  - MICROBIAL DRUG RESISTANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The spread of NDM-5-producing Escherichia coli has become a severe challenge in clinical therapy, which necessitates reliable detection and surveillance methods. However, limited information is available regarding the prevalence and dissemination of the bla(NDM-5) gene in E. coli in China. Therefore, we investigated the dissemination of the bla(NDM-5) gene in carbapenem-resistant E. coli isolates from different regions. A total of 1,180 carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae strains were obtained from patients admitted to the 20 sentinel hospitals in 8 cities. Strains positive for bla(NDM-5) were detected using the Vitek 2 compact system, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing, polymerase chain reaction, the S1 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis assay, and Southern blot hybridization. The horizontal-transfer capability of the bla(NDM) gene was assessed by filter mating with a standard E. coli J53 azide-resistant strain as the recipient. Genotyping, susceptibility testing, and whole genome sequencing were performed. Seven strains of bla(NDM-5)-positive E. coli were detected in 1,180 clinical strains from different regions in China. The bla(NDM-5)-carrying strains showed resistance to multiple tested antibiotics and belonged to two widespread sequence types, sequence type (ST)167 and ST405. Antimicrobial resistance genes, including bla(CTX-M), bla(OXA), bla(CMY), and two novel bla(TEM) variants (bla(TEM-230) and bla(TEM-231)) were also identified. Southern blotting located the bla(NDM-5) gene on 46 kb IncX3 plasmids in all isolates, which showed only two single nucleotide differences between EJN003 and the other strains. This study further confirms the increasing occurrence of bla(NDM-5)-carrying IncX3 plasmids and the dissemination of carbapenem resistance in E. coli isolates using the plasmid from different parts in China, which warrants stringent surveillance and control measures.

TI  - Urban Spatial Development Based on Multisource Data Analysis: A Case Study of Xianyang City's Integration into Xi'an International Metropolis
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of urban spatial development focuses on the process of urbanization, which involves the urban economy, population, the scale of urban construction land and the construction land's structure. All this influences the economic structure, social structure and functional structure of the city. Taking Xianyang City, a core part of Xi'an international metropolis, as an example, this study, based on night light remote sensing data from 1992 to 2013, land use data from 1980 to 2015 (6 periods), AutoNavi Map (AMAP) Points of Interest (POI) data, and the patch-generated land use simulation model (PLUS), simulates the spatial-temporal pattern change characteristics of land use in Xianyang City from 2025 to 2035. The results show that: (1) During 1985-2015, urban land use showed a significant upward trend (p < 0.05); (2) From 1992 to 2013, the change in night light in the Xianyang City Administrative Region showed an upward trend. The gravitational center of Xianyang City's built-up area moves southeast first and then northeast. After the beginning of 2010, the gravitational center of Xianyang City's built-up area moved faster; (3) The distribution of different types of urban centers in Xianyang City is basically the same; (4) From 2005 to 2035, the overall land use in Xianyang City showed a trend of "multi polar explosive growth in construction land, slow growth in forest land, and first a decrease then an increase in wetland water body". The urban spatial structure has changed from a single-center development model to a point-axis development model. The study of urban space development can provide some reference for the layout of urban construction in the future.

TI  - How Does COVID-19 Lockdown Impact Air Quality in India?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is a severe environmental problem in the Indian subcontinent. Largely caused by the rapid growth of the population, industrialization, and urbanization, air pollution can adversely affect human health and environment. To mitigate such adverse impacts, the Indian government launched the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) in January 2019. Meanwhile, the unexpected city-lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 in India greatly reduced human activities and thus anthropogenic emissions of gaseous and aerosol pollutants. The NCAP and the lockdown could provide an ideal field experiment for quantifying the extent to which various levels of human activity reduction impact air quality in the Indian subcontinent. Here, we study the improvement in air quality due to COVID-19 and the NCAP in the India subcontinent by employing multiple satellite products and surface observations. Satellite data shows significant reductions in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) by 17% and aerosol optical depth (AOD) by 20% during the 2020 lockdown with reference to the mean levels between 2005-2019. No persistent reduction in NO2 nor AOD is detectable during the NCAP period (2019). Surface observations show consistent reductions in PM2.5 and NO2 during the 2020 lockdown in seven cities across the Indian subcontinent, except Mumbai in Central India. The increase in relative humidity and the decrease in the planetary boundary layer also play an important role in influencing air quality during the 2020 lockdown. With the decrease in aerosols during the lockdown, net radiation fluxes show positive anomalies at the surface and negative anomalies at the top of the atmosphere over most parts of the Indian subcontinent. The results of this study could provide valuable information for policymakers in South Asia to adjust the scientific measures proposed in the NCAP for efficient air pollution mitigation.

TI  - Coded Caching for Combination Networks with Multiaccess
T2  - INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In a traditional (H,r) combination network, each user connects to a unique set of r relays. However, few research efforts have considered the (H,r,u) multiaccess combination network problem wherein each unique set of r relays is connected by u users. In this paper, we focus on designing coded caching schemes for a (H,r,u) multiaccess combination network. By directly applying the well-known coding method (proposed by Zewail and Yener) for a (H,r) combination network, a coded caching scheme (called ZY scheme) for (H,r,u) multiaccess combination network is obtained. However, its subpacketization has an exponential order with the number of users which leads to high implementation complexity. In order to reduce subpacketization, a direct construction of a coded caching scheme (called the direct scheme) for (H,r,u) multiaccess combination network is proposed by means of combinational design theory, where the parameter u must be a combinatorial number. For the arbitrary parameter u, the hybrid construction of a coded caching scheme (called the hybrid scheme) for the (H,r,u) multiaccess combination network is proposed based on the direct scheme. Theoretical and numerical analysis shows that the direct scheme and the hybrid scheme have a smaller transmission load for each relay compared with the naive scheme (which is obtained by repeatedly applying the coded caching scheme for a traditional (H,r) combination network by u times) and have much lower subpacketization compared with the ZY scheme.

TI  - Estimation of Rooftop Solar Power Potential by Comparing Solar Radiation Data and Remote Sensing Data-A Case Study in Aichi, Japan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There have been significant advances in the shift from fossil-based energy systems to renewable energies in recent years. Decentralized solar photovoltaic (PV) is one of the most promising energy sources because of the availability of rooftop areas, ease of installation, and reduced cost of PV panels. The current modeling method using remote sensing data based on a geographic information system (GIS) is objective and accurate, but the analysis processes are complicated and time-consuming. In this study, we developed a method to estimate the rooftop solar power potential over a wide area using globally available solar radiation data from Solargis combined with a building polygon. Our study also utilized light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and AW3D to estimate rooftop solar power potential in western Aichi, Japan, and the solar radiation was calculated using GIS. The estimation using LiDAR data took into account the slope and azimuth of rooftops. A regression analysis of the estimated solar power potential for each roof between the three methods was conducted, and the conversion factor 0.837 was obtained to improve the accuracy of the results from the Solargis data. The annual rooftop solar power potential of 3,351,960 buildings in Aichi Prefecture under Scenario A, B, and C was 6.92 x 10(7), 3.58 x 10(7), and 1.27 x 10(7) MWh/year, estimated using Solargis data after the adjustment. The estimated solar power potential under Scenario A could satisfy the total residential power demand in Aichi, revealing the crucial role of rooftop solar power in alleviating the energy crisis. This approach of combining Solargis data with building polygons can be easily applied in other parts of the world. These findings can provide useful information for policymakers and contribute to local planning for cleaner energy.

TI  - Simulating Future LUCC by Coupling Climate Change and Human Effects Based on Multi-Phase Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Future land use and cover change (LUCC) simulations play an important role in providing fundamental data to reveal the carbon cycle response of forest ecosystems to LUCC. Subtropical forests have great potential for carbon sequestration, yet their future dynamics under natural and human influences are unclear. Zhejiang Province in China is an important distribution area for subtropical forests. For forest management, it is of great significance to explore the future dynamic changes of subtropical forests in Zhejiang. As a popular LUCC spatial simulation model, the cellular automata (CA) model coupled with machine learning and LUCC quantitative demand models such as system dynamics (SD) can achieve effective LUCC simulation. Therefore, we first integrated a back propagation neural network (BPNN), a CA, and a SD model as a BPNN_CA_SD (BCS) coupled model for future LUCC simulation and then designed a slow development scenario (SD_Scenario), a harmonious development scenario (HD_Scenario), a baseline development scenario (BD_Scenario), and a fast development scenario (FD_Scenario), combining climate change and human disturbance. Thirdly, we obtained future land-use patterns in Zhejiang Province from 2014 to 2084 under multiple scenarios, and finally, we analyzed the temporal and spatial changes of land use and discussed the subtropical forest dynamics of the future. The results showed the following: (1) The overall accuracy was approximately 0.8, the kappa coefficient was 0.75, and the figure of merit (FOM) value was over 28% when using the BCS model to predict LUCC, indicating that the model could predict the consistent change of LUCC accurately. (2) The future evolution of the LUCC under different scenarios varied, with the growth of bamboo forests and the decline of coniferous forests in the FD_Scenario being prominent among the forest dynamics changes. Compared with 2014, the bamboo forest in 2084 will increase by 37%, while the coniferous forest will decrease by 25%. (3) Comparing the area and spatial change of the subtropical forests, the SD_Scenario was found to be beneficial for the forest ecology. These results can provide an important decision-making reference for land-use planning and sustainable forest development in Zhejiang Province.

TI  - MODELING OF BEACH CHANGE AND TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLID DISTRIBUTION BASED ON REMOTE SENSING DATA BEFORE AND POST RECLAMATION IN LAMONG BAY PORT
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Teluk Lamong Harbor is one of the reclamation areas which is affecting the marine environmental resources. Therefore, an analysis of shoreline changes, current pattern modeling, Total Suspended Solid (TSS) modeling based on remote sensing data is used to see the results of the development of the Teluk Lamong Multipurpose Port Terminal. The objectives of this study are analysing the shoreline changes in the Multipurpose Port Terminal in Lamong Bay in 2012 (before reclamation) and 2020 (after reclamation), analyzing the modeling of current patterns in the Multipurpose Port Terminal in Lamong before and after reclamation, analyzing the use of TSS analysis in the Multipurpose Port Terminal in the Lamong Bay before and after reclamation. Stages of the method are analyzing shoreline changes using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) software before and after reclamation, modeling the flow pattern using Mike 21 software before and after reclamation, and modeling the use TSS uses Mike 21 software based on remote data sensing using Google Earth Engine (GEE). The EPR values are 107.5 meters/year, 59.63 meters/year and 10.38 meters/year. The remote sensing TSS values which need to be considered are on the condition of very low values (0-20 mg/L), low (20.1-40 mg/L), moderate (40.1-80 mg/L), high (80.1-120 mg/L) and very high (>120.1 mg/L). For the total suspended solids, informs that the highest value is at a point near the Teluk Lamong Port based on the in-situ data where the high TSS values at stations 2, 3, 4, 22 and 23 with values of 142 mg/L, 119 mg/L, 115 mg/L, 112 mg/L, and 116 mg/L. However, comparing with the remote sensing data in 2020 using GEE TSS software shows the values on 167 mg/L, 122 mg/L, 120 mg/L, 128 mg/L and 120 mg/L. In 2012, TSS in low tide reaches 320-360 mg/L and in high tide reaches 325-350 mg/L. In 2020, TSS in low tide reaches 360-400 mg/L and 440 mg/L in high tide. Both previous papers and the recent analysis on this research give a similar result. Therefore, it may consider that the recent result as the updated condition from the development of Teluk Lamong Harbour.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring of the Spatial Pattern of Greening and Browning in Xilin Gol Grassland and Its Response to Climate and Human Activities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a unique ecosystem with multiple ecological functions but high fragility, grassland in arid areas is very vulnerable to changes in the natural environment or human activities, resulting in various ecological and environmental problems. In order to study the degree and spatial extent of the influence of climatic conditions and human activities, especially mining activities, on grasslands in arid regions, we used remote sensing data to monitor the vegetation of the Xilin Gol grassland over a long period. The significant greening and browning areas of Xilin Gol grassland vegetation from 2000 to 2020 were extracted by a time series analysis. At the same time, the correlation analysis method was used to obtain the response of the Xilin Gol grassland vegetation to climatic factors and social and economic factors. In addition, we propose a new method based on buffer analysis and correlation analysis to calculate the influence range of vegetation degradation due to mining. We used this method to determine the influence range of vegetation degradation in the main mining area of the Xilin Gol grassland. The results showed that the vegetation condition of the Xilin Gol grassland were slightly improved from 2000 to 2020. Its vegetation was significantly affected by precipitation, and more than 50% of the area's vegetation changes were highly correlated with precipitation changes. However, the area with the most serious vegetation degradation was mainly affected by human factors, and this part accounted for about 0.13% of the total area. In the form of direct damage and indirect effects (pulling population and economic growth to expand built-up areas), coal mining has become the main driving factor in the most significant areas of vegetation damage in the study area. Vegetation coverage in areas with significant greening and significant browning was highly correlated with economic factors, indicating that the vegetation changes were significantly affected by economic development. This study can reflect the vegetation changes and main driving factors in the overall and key areas of the Xilin Gol League and is a meaningful reference for the local balance of economic development and environmental protection.

AB  - In water budget assessment, evapotranspiration (ET) proved as one of the most significant features whose reputation boosts in arid climates. Indirect approaches to estimate ET are complex in their calculation requiring different algorithms but an indirect approach was taken in this study which enables us to develop relationships, which are less complex and less time-consuming. In this study, an association between ET, observed by the Global Land Data Assimilation System of National Aeronautics and Space Administration and vegetation indices (VI) taken by Landsat 8 images were generated. Quarterly images were taken for the period of two years (2018-2019) to make an empirical relationship by linear regression analysis between ET and VI's specifically named as, soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI). The resultant equation represents the relationship in terms of R-2 enabling to evaluate each index with ET. NDVI was found averagely associated with ET estimation because of its low regression value, in general, it goes minimum up to 0.56 for August 2019. However, it remains approximately consistent between 0.60 and 0.65 for all month except October 18 in which its values go to 0.72. Similarly, SAVI was also analyzed and got much better correlation for both years sustaining near or above 0.65 with a maximum value of 0.78, so this index performed well then NDVI. Likewise, to other indices, NDWI was also studied and got very splendid results of correlation than other two indices. This index sustains its values of R-2 among 0.85-0.91 for maximum months of the years indicating its highest relationship with ET. It can be concluded that NDWI derived relations were more promising than the other two for ET calculation.

TI  - Sea Ice Rheology Experiment (SIREx): 2. Evaluating Linear Kinematic Features in High-Resolution Sea Ice Simulations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulating sea ice drift and deformation in the Arctic Ocean is still a challenge because of the multiscale interaction of sea ice floes that compose the Arctic Sea ice cover. The Sea Ice Rheology Experiment (SIREx) is a model intercomparison project of the Forum of Arctic Modeling and Observational Synthesis (FAMOS). In SIREx, skill metrics are designed to evaluate different recently suggested approaches for modeling linear kinematic features (LKFs) to provide guidance for modeling small-scale deformation. These LKFs are narrow bands of localized deformation that can be observed in satellite images and also form in high resolution sea ice simulations. In this contribution, spatial and temporal properties of LKFs are assessed in 36 simulations of state-of-the-art sea ice models and compared to deformation features derived from the RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System. All simulations produce LKFs, but only very few models realistically simulate at least some statistics of LKF properties such as densities, lengths, or growth rates. All SIREx models overestimate the angle of fracture between conjugate pairs of LKFs and LKF lifetimes pointing to inaccurate model physics. The temporal and spatial resolution of a simulation and the spatial resolution of atmospheric boundary condition affect simulated LKFs as much as the model's sea ice rheology and numerics. Only in very high resolution simulations (<= 2 km) the concentration and thickness anomalies along LKFs are large enough to affect air-ice-ocean interaction processes.

TI  - COVID-19 persuaded lockdown impact on local environmental restoration in Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic adversely affected human beings. The novel coronavirus has claimed millions of lives all over the globe. Most countries around the world, including Pakistan, restricted people's social activities and ordered strict lockdowns throughout the country, to control the fatality of the novel coronavirus. The persuaded lockdown impact on the local environment was estimated. In the present study, we assessed air quality changes in four cities of Pakistan, namely Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar, based on particulate matter (PM2.5), using "Temtop Airing 1000," which is capable of detecting and quantifying PM2.5. The Air Quality Index (AQI) was evaluated in three specific time spans: the COVID-19 pandemic pre- and post-lockdown period (January 1, 2020 to March 20, 2020, and May 16, 2020 to June 30, 2020 respectively), and the COVID-19 pandemic period (March 21 2020 to May 15, 2020). We compared land-monitored AQI levels for the above three periods of time. For validation, air quality was navigated by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) satellite during the first semester (January 1 to June 30) of 2019 and 2020. It is seen that the concentration of PM2.5 was considerably reduced in 2020 (more than 50%), ranging from similar to 0.05 to 0.3 kg.m(3), compared to the same period in 2019. The results revealed that the AQI was considerably reduced during the lockdown period. This finding is a very promising as the inhabitants of the planet Earth can be guaranteed the possibility of a green environment in the future.

TI  - Rapid ground subsidence in the Kucuk Menderes Graben (W. Turkey) captured by Sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past few decades, surface deformations have been observed and measured geodetically at many places all over the world, including Central and western Turkey. Surface deformations in some of these regions have been attributed to aseismic slip-on faults and/or to excessive pumping of groundwater. In this study, we present our investigation on the ground subsidence in odemis town (W. Turkey) located in the Kucuk (K.) Menderes Graben where one of the most severe and widespread surface fracturings has been reported. The entire graben is analyzed using the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with multi-temporal interferometric SAR techniques. A total of 342 single look complex products acquired in 2015-2018 are processed using the Small Baseline Subset method. Vertical mean velocity fields reveal that K. Menderes Graben is experiencing extensive subsidence at rates reaching as much as 29 cm/year, making it one of the fastest subsiding regions in the world. The spatial correlation between the subsiding regions and the unconsolidated sediments suggests that the subsidence is most probably due to over drafting of the groundwater, which is confirmed by the strong temporal correlation between displacement time series and groundwater level changes. Inelastic/elastic deformation ratios calculated for the entire graben suggest that inelastic deformation is the dominant component in the region, implying an irreversible deformation. Skeletal storage coefficients calculated at well locations also support the idea of inelastic deformation. However, severe inelasticity is not extensive, and the region may still recover from subsidence with correct groundwater management.

T2  - TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The Sentinel-2 provides available multispectral bands at relatively high spatial resolution. In this study, using Sentinel-2 images, the reflectance of metal roofs has been investigated and the differences between these reflections with other high reflections such as saline and dry soils have been evaluated. Bands 2(Blue), 3(Green), 4(Red) and band 8(VNIR), which have a resolution of ten meters, are the most used in extracting different types of reflection. The result of the research shows that using the reflection of materials, it is easy to identify and harvest samples for the purpose of classifying the controlled sample by object-oriented processing. The results show that there is a significant difference between the reflection of the salty soil and the metal roof in the near infrared range, although in the image with the natural color combination, both types of material show same reflection. This paper presents a new approach for extracting training samples from metal roofs compared to saline soils. The classification of SVM (Support Vector Machine) as the best method of classification with an accuracy of 96.9% and Kappa coefficient of 0.9 for categorization in this study was selected among other classification methods. This study compared two types of reflections from metal and saline soils.

TI  - Forecasting of Future Medical Care Expenditure in Japan Using a System Dynamics Model
T2  - INQUIRY-THE JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION PROVISION AND FINANCING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The aim of this study was to construct a system dynamics (SD) model to estimate the future medical care expenditure and to address the dynamic issues of health care that should be resolved. In particular, the measures for promoting the spread of generic drug (GE drug) usage in Japan and reducing cancer-related medical expenses were investigated regarding their future impact on medical finances. Methods The SD model was constructed from FY 2018 to FY 2050. The change in the future GE drug quantity share was analyzed by using a regression equation. The impact of the increase in medical expense for cancer and the change in the future national medical care expenditure were also estimated. Results The annual total medical care expenditure in FY 2050 would arrive at 58.9-64.2 trillion JPY (US$ 535.1-584.0 billion) (1.3-1.5 times higher than that in FY 2018) with different trends in age groups. The cumulative total medical care expenditure was expected to decrease by about 787.0-989.4 billion JPY (US$ 7.2-9.0 billion) if the impact of the spread of GE drug usage was considered. On the other hand, due to the continuous increase in the cancer-related medical expense, the cumulative total medical care expenditure was estimated to increase about 7554.3-11715.0 billion JPY (US$ 68.7-106.5 billion). Conclusions If the cancer-related medical expense continues to increase in the future, an increase of 686.4-1104.2 billion JPY (US$ 6.2-10.0 billion) in FY 2050 is expected which suggests that this disease field should be prioritized regarding the measures to maintain medical finances.

TI  - Assessment of Restoration Effects in Riparian Wetlands using Satellite Imagery. Case Study on the Lower Danube River
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - To better understand the outcomes of river restoration, our paper analyzes the variability of the water content in a restored riparian wetland. We focused our demonstration on the case study of the Babina Islet located in the northern Danube Delta. This site was restored in 1994 by opening levees to regain the pristine hydrological regime with both flooding and dry phases depending on the water level of the Danube River. We monitored the wetland by using the Normal Difference Water Index (NDWI) estimated on Landsat scenes for the period 1984-2020. When compared to pre-restoration conditions, we found an increase of the surface-water area. The maximum surface-water area corresponded to the restoration works. Post-implementation of the restoration solution in 1994, the surface-water area is decreasing. The surface-water area pre-restoration is smaller than the surface-water area in present-day conditions, similar to the control site (Small Islet of Braila), thus confirming the role of hydrology in maintaining the effects of restoration works. Moreover, we detected the increase of drought area since 1984 on both the restored and the control site. This finding appears to be a new challenge for restoring the riparian wetlands of the Lower Danube River. Our paper recommends the use of standardized indicators via satellite remote sensing to understand riparian wetlands functioning at large scale, which could help to design a coherent strategy of river restoration.

TI  - Floristic types of high-Andean wetlands from northwest Argentina and their remote-sensed characterization at a regional scale
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims High-Andean vegas are key functional wetlands in the Puna ecoregion. Plant communities in combination with ecogeographic characteristics determine their functional processes. In this study, we identified groups of vegas based on their plant composition and characterized these groups with spatial and spectral variables representing their ecogeographic context. Location Argentine Puna and High-Andean ecoregions. Methods We recorded the species composition and cover of plants in 50 vegas distributed along a ecogeographic gradient. We calculated six spatial and 14 spectral variables for each vega. We performed a correspondence analysis (CA) to explore species data and used the site's scores in a k-means analysis to identify groups of vegas. Then, we characterized each group of vegas with spatial and spectral variables with the v.test using the 'catdes' function in the FactoMineR package. Results The CA showed five groups of vegas segregated by the plant species composition. Each group was related to different spatial and spectral variables showing an ecogeographic gradient. Vegas with Poaceas were located at higher altitude and lower latitude and longitude (Group 1, Festuca nardifolia and Deschampsia hackelii). Vegas dominated by cushion species had higher humidity (Group 2, Oxychloe andina), and higher and more stable productivity (Group 3, Eleocharis pseudoalbibracteata), while vegas with halophytic species were associated with a larger area, higher salinity, and lower humidity (Group 4, Amphiscirpus nevadensis), and lower productivity (Group 5, Lycium humile and Salicornia pulvinata). Conclusions Our results are the first floristic classification and remote-sensing characterization of high-Andean vegas at a regional scale. This information shows the variation of these ecosystems and suggests that remote sensing, complemented with field information, could help to identify types of vegas at regional scales. This information is relevant for land planning and sustainable management of these key ecosystems in the context of threats of global change.

TI  - Rivers running green: water hyacinth invasion monitored from space
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water hyacinth is an aquatic free-floating plant that is highly invasive, to the extent that it is now present in most freshwater bodies in sub-tropical and tropical regions worldwide. Due to the ecological and socio-economic damages these plants can cause, monitoring their spatial coverage and seasonality is key for development of timely and efficient mitigation measures. Hyacinth patches are sufficiently large to be detectable in high-resolution satellite imagery, allowing for monitoring using freely available remote sensing data collected by platforms such as Sentinel-2. In this study, we estimated water hyacinth coverage and seasonal dynamics over three years (2018-2020) for the Saigon river, Vietnam. Using a Naive Bayes classifier, hyacinth coverage was mapped in Sentinel-2 imagery with an accuracy of 91%. We show that the dry season (December-May) corresponds to highest water hyacinth abundance, with maximum coverage in February. Lower rainfall and relative humidity were found to be highly correlated (r = -0.56 and r = -0.64, respectively) with higher hyacinth cover. We also detected substantial interannual variability: annual means in hyacinth coverage varied by a factor of five between the 2018/2019 and 2020 yearly averages, with peak cover occurring in February 2020. The percentage of Saigon river covered by hyacinths over the entire study area peaked at 14% and reached as much as 24% for the upstream section. This confirms the prevalence of these invasive plants in the region, and the growing threat to river navigability and biodiversity. Our study provides an openly available automated workflow for long-term monitoring of hyacinth coverage, which can be scaled-up and extended to other freshwater systems. As such, it provides a step for building a large-scale monitoring tool of this highly invasive species, which may also be used for designing mitigation and reduction strategies of hyacinth and the pollutants it carries along.

TI  - Using Remote Sensing to Quantify the Joint Effects of Climate and Land Use/Land Cover Changes on the Caatinga Biome of Northeast Brazilian
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Caatinga biome, located in the Brazilian semi-arid region, is the most populous semi-arid region in the world, causing intensification in land degradation and loss of biodiversity over time. The main objective of this paper is to determine and analyze the changes in land cover and use, over time, on the biophysical parameters in the Caatinga biome in the semi-arid region of Brazil using remote sensing. Landsat-8 images were used, along with the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) in the Google Earth Engine platform, from 2013 to 2019, through spatiotemporal modeling of vegetation indices, i.e., leaf area index (LAI) and vegetation cover (V-C). Moreover, land surface temperature (LST) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) in Petrolina, the semi-arid region of Brazil, was used. The principal component analysis was used to select descriptive variables and multiple regression analysis to predict ETa. The results indicated significant effects of land use and land cover changes on energy balances over time. In 2013, 70.2% of the study area was composed of Caatinga, while the lowest percentages were identified in 2015 (67.8%) and 2017 (68.7%). Rainfall records in 2013 ranged from 270 to 480 mm, with values higher than 410 mm in 46.5% of the study area, concentrated in the northern part of the municipality. On the other hand, in 2017 the lowest annual rainfall values (from 200 to 340 mm) occurred. Low vegetation cover rate was observed by LAI and V-C values, with a range of 0 to 25% vegetation cover in 52.3% of the area, which exposes the effects of the dry season on vegetation. The highest LST was mainly found in urban areas and/or exposed soil. In 2013, 40.5% of the region's area had LST between 48.0 and 52.0 degrees C, raising ETa rates (similar to 4.7 mm day(-1)). Our model has shown good outcomes in terms of accuracy and concordance (coefficient of determination = 0.98, root mean square error = 0.498, and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient = 0.907). The significant increase in agricultural areas has resulted in the progressive reduction of the Caatinga biome. Therefore, mitigation and sustainable planning is vital to decrease the impacts of anthropic actions.

TI  - Agricultural Drought Monitoring System in Poland-Farmers' Assessments vs. Monitoring Results (2021)
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to compare the farmers' viewpoint on agricultural drought with the results generated by the national Agricultural Drought Monitoring System (ADMS) in 2021. The authors attempted also to indicate effective methods of validating these results, which could serve as an objective tool of appeal made available to farmers as a part of an administrative procedure or directly included in the drought monitoring system, which, apart from soil and meteorological conditions, would take into account the actual condition of crops in the field. An analysis comparing farmers' assessments with the ADMS results was presented for all (27,580 parcels) claims for compensation for losses in winter wheat crops submitted in the country. A detailed assessment of the impact of drought on yields was carried out for two pilot regions in the area most affected by agricultural drought in Poland (West Pomeranian Voivodeship, NUTS-2 PL42 region). The paper demonstrates a subjective assessment of incurred losses, performed by the farmers themselves. The difference between the "potential drought"-resulting from the meteorological and soil conditions-and the actual losses, which are also influenced by agro-technical factors, was indicated. The grounds for further development of the Agricultural Drought Monitoring System were the need to establish a method of estimating the impact of drought on crops, which will be based on unambiguous criteria and using high-resolution (temporal and spatial) remote sensing data.

TI  - InSAR Study of Landslides: Early Detection, Three-Dimensional, and Long-Term Surface Displacement Estimation-A Case of Xiaojiang River Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides, a major natural geohazard, obstruct municipal constructions and may destroy villages and towns, at worst causing significant casualties and economic losses. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique offers distinct advantages on landslide detection and monitoring. In this paper, a more systematic workflow is designed for InSAR study of landslides, in terms of three levels: (i) early detection on regional scale, (ii) three-dimensional (3D) surface displacement rates estimation on detailed scale, and (iii) time series analysis on long-term temporal scale. The proposed workflow is applied for landslide research on the Xiaojiang River Basin, China, using ascending and descending Sentinel-1 images acquired from March 2017 to May 2019. First, the landslide inventory has been mapped and updated using InSAR stacking method, supporting geohazard prevention on a regional scale. A total of 22 active landslides are identified, ranging from medium to super large scale. Compared with the existing inventory, three unrecorded landslides are newly detected by our approach, and five recorded landslides are detected significant expansion of their boundaries. Then, specific to a detected landslide, Baobao landslide, a Total Least Squares-Kalman Filter-based approach is presented. Two outcomes are provided for further spatial-temporal pattern analysis: 3D displacement rates, providing an intuitive insight on the spatial characteristics and sliding direction of landslide, which are analyzed to deep the understanding of its kinematic mechanism, and long-term time series, which contribute to deduce the dynamic evolution of landslide, presenting benefits in landslide forecasting.

TI  - Historically inconsistent productivity and respiration fluxes in the global terrestrial carbon cycle
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The terrestrial carbon cycle is a major source of uncertainty in climate projections. Its dominant fluxes, gross primary productivity (GPP), and respiration (in particular soil respiration, RS), are typically estimated from independent satellite-driven models and upscaled in situ measurements, respectively. We combine carbon-cycle flux estimates and partitioning coefficients to show that historical estimates of global GPP and RS are irreconcilable. When we estimate GPP based on RS measurements and some assumptions about RS:GPP ratios, we found the resulted global GPP values (bootstrap mean 149(-23)(+29) Pg C yr(-1)) are significantly higher than most GPP estimates reported in the literature (113(-18)(+18) Pg C yr(-1)). Similarly, historical GPP estimates imply a soil respiration flux (RsGPP, bootstrap mean of 68(-8)(+10) Pg C yr(-1)) statistically inconsistent with most published RS values (87(-8)(+9) Pg C yr(-1)), although recent, higher, GPP estimates are narrowing this gap. Furthermore, global RS:GPP ratios are inconsistent with spatial averages of this ratio calculated from individual sites as well as CMIP6 model results. This discrepancy has implications for our understanding of carbon turnover times and the terrestrial sensitivity to climate change. Future efforts should reconcile the discrepancies associated with calculations for GPP and Rs to improve estimates of the global carbon budget.

TI  - Oyster Aquaculture Site Selection Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing: A Case Study in the Gulf of Maine, United States
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, is an expanding industry in the US, particularly in the Gulf of Maine. High resolution ocean color satellites launched in the last decade potentially provide aquaculture-relevant water-quality parameters at farm scales. However, these parameters, such as temperature, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and Chlorophyll a (Chl a), need to be derived by interested users. Water quality parameters are derived first by applying an atmospheric correction and then estimating the target parameter with a specific algorithm. Here, we use five atmospheric correction schemes and two algorithms to derive SPM and Chl a from the Sentinel 2A&B satellites' multispectral instrument data. The best estimates of SPM and Chl a are determined by comparison with in situ observations from buoys. Together with SST from Landsat-8, we estimated an Oyster Suitability Index (OSI) along the transects in five estuaries in the Gulf of Maine as well as applied a novel particulate organic matter algorithm, a function of Chl a and SPM in low turbidity estuaries. We then apply the optimal approaches to derive water quality parameters to study five different estuaries in Maine and find that existing high-yield oyster aquaculture farms are found in areas with elevated OSI values. Additionally, we suggest new areas, currently under-exploited, where oyster aquaculture is likely to succeed, showcasing the utility of the approach.

TI  - A Survey on Deep Learning-Based Change Detection from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Change detection based on remote sensing images plays an important role in the field of remote sensing analysis, and it has been widely used in many areas, such as resources monitoring, urban planning, disaster assessment, etc. In recent years, it has aroused widespread interest due to the explosive development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, and change detection algorithms based on deep learning frameworks have made it possible to detect more delicate changes (such as the alteration of small buildings) with the help of huge amounts of remote sensing data, especially high-resolution (HR) data. Although there are many methods, we still lack a deep review of the recent progress concerning the latest deep learning methods in change detection. To this end, the main purpose of this paper is to provide a review of the available deep learning-based change detection algorithms using HR remote sensing images. The paper first describes the change detection framework and classifies the methods from the perspective of the deep network architectures adopted. Then, we review the latest progress in the application of deep learning in various granularity structures for change detection. Further, the paper provides a summary of HR datasets derived from different sensors, along with information related to change detection, for the potential use of researchers. Simultaneously, representative evaluation metrics for this task are investigated. Finally, a conclusion of the challenges for change detection using HR remote sensing images, which must be dealt with in order to improve the model's performance, is presented. In addition, we put forward promising directions for future research in this area.

TI  - Research on Remote Sensing Retrieval of Bohai Sea Transparency Based on Sentinel-3 OLCI Image
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Transparency is one of the critical indicators for marine ecological environment monitoring, and it plays a vital role in the military, navigation, fishery, and other fields. Compared with other traditional ocean monitoring technologies, remote sensing technology has the advantages of long time sequence, extensive range, and near real-time acquisition of ocean information. Therefore, it is of great significance to the rational development and utilization of marine resources by using satellites to observe ocean transparency. This study used the in situ transparency data and the equivalent remote sensing reflectance data of the Sentinel-3 OLCI sensor to build the Bohai Sea transparency inversion model, which mainly included the single band method, the band ratio method, and the mixed band method. The model's accuracy was verified with the in situ-satellite match-ups. It found that the best inversion model was the mixed band model with B6 (560 nm) and B7 (620 nm) as the sensitive factors. The coefficient of determination R-2 was 0. 68, the average relative error (MRE) was 15. 93% , and the root means square error (RMSE) was 0. 48 m. On this basis, combined with Sentinel-3 OLCI time-series images, we got the monthlyremote sensing products of Bohai transparency in 2020 and found that thetransparency showed obvious regional and seasonal characteristics. The transparency ranged from 0 m to 10 m. It was higher in July and August. The value of some areas could be deeper than 9 m. While it was relatively low in winter, the value was less than 2 m in January and February. At the same time, we also found that the higher transparency appeared in the central Bohai Sea and the coastal waters of Qinhuangdao, while the transparency was lower in Bohai Bay, Liaodong Bay, and Laizhou Bay throughout the year. The characteristic trend of transparency is inseparable from Bohai Sea coastal geological properties, the distribution of surrounding rivers, and coastal urban agglomerations and industrial ports. This research provided a reliable theoretical basis for remote sensing transparency estimation, and it was of great significance for monitoring the marine environment of the Bohai Sea.

TI  - Water Information Extraction Based on Multi-Model RF Algorithm and Sentinel-2 Image Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - For the Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite image remote sensing data, due to the rich spatial information, the traditional water body extraction methods cannot meet the needs of practical applications. In this study, a random forest-based RF_16 optimal combination model algorithm is proposed to extract water bodies. The research process uses Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite images and DEM data as the basic data, collected 24 characteristic variable indicators (B2, B3, B4, B8, B11, B12, NDVI, MSAVI, B5, B6, B7, B8A, NDI45, MCARI, REIP, S2REP, IRECI, PSSRa, NDWI, MNDWI, LSWI, DEM, SLOPE, SLOPE ASPECT), and constructed four combined models with different input variables. After analysis, it was determined that RF_16 was the optimal combination for extracting water body information in the study area. Model. The results show that: (1) The characteristic variables that have an important impact on the accuracy of the model are the improved normalized difference water index (MNDWI), band B2 (Blue), normalized water index (NDWI), B4 (Red), B3 (Green), and band B5 (Vegetation Red-Edge 1); (2) The water extraction accuracy of the optimal combined model RF_16 can reach 93.16%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.8214. The overall accuracy is 0.12% better than the traditional Relief F algorithm. The RF_16 method based on the optimal combination model of random forest is an effective means to obtain high-precision water body information in the study area. It can effectively reduce the "salt and pepper effect" and the influence of mixed pixels such as water and shadows on the water extraction accuracy.

TI  - Lithospheric Deformation Due To the 2015 M7.2 Sarez (Pamir) Earthquake Constrained by 5 years of Space Geodetic Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2015 M7.2 Sarez (Pamir) earthquake occurred at the north-west margin of the Tibetan Plateau. We use Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar and Global Navigation Satellite System data to investigate coseismic and postseismic deformation due to the Sarez earthquake. Kinematic inversions show that the earthquake ruptured a similar to 80 km long, sub-vertical fault producing the maximum surface offset of 3-4 m on the south-west and central fault segments. In contrast, the largest postseismic displacements are observed at the north-east end of the earthquake rupture, predominantly on the west (hanging wall) side of the fault with an average rate of 20-30 mm/yr in the satellite line of sight. We use the derived coseismic and postseismic slip models to investigate mechanisms of time-dependent relaxation, stress transfer and possible triggering relationships between the Sarez earthquake and a sequence of strong M6+ events that occurred within similar to 100 km of the 2015 earthquake. We find that the near-field postseismic displacements are best explained by shallow afterslip driven by the coseismic stress changes. The data also allow some contribution from poroelastic rebound, but do not show a clear signature of viscoelastic relaxation in the lower crust and upper mantle during the observation period, suggesting a lower bound on the effective viscosity of similar to 10(19) Pa s. A pair of M6+ events that occurred within 100 km and several months of the 2015 mainshock have experienced near-zero and in some cases negative static Coulomb stress changes, suggesting either delayed dynamic triggering, or no relation to the mainshock.

TI  - An NDVI Retrieval Method Based on a Double-Attention Recurrent Neural Network for Cloudy Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - NDVI is an important parameter for environmental assessment and precision agriculture that well-describes the status of vegetation. Nevertheless, the clouds in optical images often result in the absence of NDVI information at key growth stages. The integration of SAR and optical image features will likely address this issue. Although the mapping of different data sources is complex, the prosperity of deep learning technology provides an alternative approach. In this study, the double-attention RNN architecture based on the recurrent neural network (RNN) and attention mechanism is proposed to retrieve NDVI data of cloudy regions. Overall, the NDVI is retrieved by the proposed model from two aspects: the temporal domain and the pixel neighbor domain. The performance of the double-attention RNN is validated through different cloud coverage conditions, input ablation, and comparative experiments with various methods. The results conclude that a high retrieval accuracy is guaranteed by the proposed model, even under high cloud coverage conditions (R-2 = 0.856, RMSE = 0.124). Using SAR images independently results in poor NDVI retrieval results (R-2 = 0.728, RMSE = 0.141) with considerable artifacts, which need to be addressed with auxiliary data, such as IDM features. Temporal and pixel neighbor features play an important role in improving the accuracy of NDVI retrieval (R-2 = 0.894, RMSE = 0.096). For the missing values of NDVI data caused by cloud coverage, the double-attention RNN proposed in this study provides a potential solution for information recovery.

TI  - Detection of Southern Beech Heavy Flowering Using Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The southern beech (genus Fuscospora and Lophozonia) forest in New Zealand periodically has "mast" years, during which very large volumes of seeds are produced. This excessive seed production results in a population explosion of rodents and mustelids, which then puts pressure on native birds. To protect the birds, extra pest controls, costing in the order of NZD 20 million, are required in masting areas. To plan pest control and keep it cost-effective, it would be helpful to have a map of the masting areas. In this study, we developed a remote sensing method for the creation of a national beech flowering map. It used a temporal sequence of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to determine areas in which a yellow index, which was based on red and green reflectance (red-green)/(red + green), was higher than normal in spring. The method was used to produce national maps of heavy beech flowering for the years 2017 to 2021. In 2018, which was a major beech masting year, of the 4.1 million ha of beech forest in New Zealand, 27.6% was observed to flower heavily. The overall classification accuracy of the map was 90.8%. The method is fully automated and could be used to help to identify areas of potentially excessive seed fall across the whole of New Zealand, several months in advance of when pest control would be required.

TI  - Combination of remote-sensing spectral indices to classify the areas of land degradation in West Burdwan district, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Demarcating the extent of land degradation remains a major challenge worldwide. A combination of remote-sensing spectral indices and Land Degradation Index (LDI) were used for the delineation and classification of land degraded areas in West Burdwan district, West Bengal, India. Mining, brick and other industries were delineated using the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) algorithm of the supervised image classification method. Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Moisture Index (SMI), night-time LST and Evapotranspiration (ET) were used as indicators of land degradation and were derived from Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite images for the years from 1990 to 2020. The result indicates an increase in industrial area from 2.06% to 7.62% of the district area from 1990 to 2020. Our pixel-based time-series analysis displays some considerable land degradation over the past 30 years, including (i) increasing daytime LST, (ii) declining vegetation, (iii) decreasing ET. However, no considerable change was found in night-time-LST and SMI. A strong positive correlation (adjusted R-2 > 0.5 and p < 0.05) was observed between mining area expansion and daytime LST and a negative correlation between mining area expansion and NDVI and ET respectively. LDI shows a total land degradation of 91.01 km(2) over the entire study region. Mining area expansion was found to be one of the major stressors to local environmental degradation. The results from this study may help the decision-makers and policymakers to provide a better management plan for sustainable land management in future.

TI  - What Is the Effect of Quantitative Inversion of Photosynthetic Pigment Content in <i>Populus euphratica</i> Oliv. Individual Tree Canopy Based on Multispectral UAV Images?
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is highly necessary to apply unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology to forest health assessment. To prove the feasibility of quantitative inversion of photosynthetic pigment content (PPC) in Populus euphratica Oliv. individual tree canopy (PeITC) by using multispectral UAV images, in this study, Parrot Sequoia+ multispectral UAV system was manipulated to collect the images of Populus euphratica (Populus euphratica Oliv.) sample plots in Daliyabuyi Oasis from 2019 to 2020, and the canopy PPCs of five Populus euphratica sample trees per plot were determined in six plots. The Populus euphratica crown regions were extracted by grey wolf optimizer-OTSU (GWO-OTSU) multithreshold segmentation algorithm from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images of Populus euphratica sample plots obtained after preprocessing, and the PeITCs were segmented by multiresolution segmentation algorithm. The mean values of 27 spectral indices in the PeITCs were calculated in each plot, and the optimal model was constructed for quantitative estimation of the PPCs in the PeITCs, then the inversion results were compared and verified based on GF-6 and ZY1-02D satellite imageries respectively. The results were as follows. (1) The average value of canopy chlorophyll content (Chl) was 2.007 mg/g, the mean value of canopy carotenoid content (Car) was 0.703 mg/g. The coefficient of variation (C.V) of both were basically the same and they were both of strong variability. The measured PPCs of the PeITCs in Daliyabuyi Oasis was generally low. The average contents of chlorophyll and carotenoid in PeITC in June were more than twice those in August, while the mean ratio between them was significantly lower in June than in August. The measured PPCs had no obvious spatial distribution law. However, that could prove the rationality of sample selection in this study. (2) NDVI had the best effect of highlighting vegetation among all quadrats in the study area. Based on the GWO-OTSU multithreshold segmentation method, the canopy area of Populus euphratica could be quickly and effectively extracted from the quadrat NDVI map. The best segmentation effect of PeITCs was obtained based on a multiresolution segmentation method when the segmentation scale was 120, the shape index was 0.7, and the compactness index was 0.5. Compared with manual vectorization method of visual interpretation, the root mean square error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (R) values of the mean NDVI values in PeITCs obtained by these two methods were 0.038 and 0.951. (3) Only 12 of the 27 spectral indices were significantly correlated with Chl and Car at the significance level of 0.02. Characteristics of the calibration set and validation set were basically consistent with those of the entire set. The classification and regression tree-decision tree (CART-DT) model performed best in the estimation of the PPCs in the PeITCs, in which, when estimating the Car, the calibration coefficient of determination (R-C(2)) was 0.843, the calibration root mean square error (RMSEC) was 0.084, the calibration residual prediction deviation (RPDC) was 2.525, the validation coefficient of determination (R-V(2)) was 0.670, the validation root mean square error (RMSEV) was 0.251, the validation residual prediction deviation (RPDV) was 1.741.(4) Qualitative comparison of spectral reflectance and NDVI values between GF-6 multispectral imagery and Parrot Sequoia+ multispectral image on the 172 PeITCs can show the reliability of Parrot Sequoia+ multispectral image. The comparison results of five PeITCs relative health degree judged by field vision judgment, measured SPAD value, predicted value of Chl (Chl(pre)), the red edge value calculated by ZY1-02D (ZY1-02D(red) (edge)) and the Carotenoid Reflection Index 2 (CRI2) value calculated by ZY1-02D (ZY1-02D(CRI2)) can further prove the scientificity of inversion results to a certain extent. These results indicate that multispectral UAV images can be applied for quantitative inversion of PPC in PeITC, which could provide an indicator for the construction of a Populus euphratica individual tree health evaluation indicator system based on UAV remote sensing technology in the next step.

TI  - Why Is It Important to Consider Dust Aerosol in the Sevastopol and Black Sea Region during Remote Sensing Tasks? A Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction of satellite optical data is based on an assessment of the optical characteristics of the atmosphere, such as the aerosol optical thickness of the atmosphere and the spectral slope, the so-called Angstrom parameter. Inaccurate determination of these parameters is one of the causes of error in the retrieval of remote-sensed reflectance spectra. In this work, a large array of field and satellite data measured in Sevastopol and the northeastern part of the Black Sea were used, including ship-based measurements of atmospheric characteristics and sea reflectance, MODIS Aqua/Terra, and VIIRS NOAA/NPP Level 2 remote-sensed reflectance and atmospheric data. In total, three episodes of Saharan dust transfer over the Black Sea region were considered, mainly in the autumn-winter period. The purpose of this study was to show the numerical differences between the atmospheric parameters measured at the surface level and by satellites, and show their relationship with the differences between in situ and satellite remote-sensed reflectance. Based on the information identified, we propose an algorithm for additional correction of satellite level 2 data that uses a two-parametric model of the Black Sea remote-sensed reflectance as a first approximation. Moreover, additional correction significantly reduces the discrepancy between in situ and retrieved remote-sensed reflectance, especially in short-wave spectral bands.

TI  - Machine Learning Techniques for Estimating Hydraulic Properties of the Topsoil across the Zambezi River Basin
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - It is critical to produce more crop per drop in an environment where water availability is decreasing and competition for water is increasing. In order to build such agricultural production systems, well parameterized crop growth models are essential. While in most crop growth modeling research, focus is on gathering model inputs such as climate data, less emphasis is paid to collecting the critical soil hydraulic properties (SHPs) data needed to operate crop growth models. Collection of SHPs data for the Zambezi River Basin (ZRB) is extremely labor-intensive and expensive, thus alternate technologies such as digital soil mapping (DSM) must be explored. We evaluated five types of DSM models to establish the best spatially explicit estimates of the soil water content at pF0.0 (saturation), pF2.0 (field capacity), and pF4.2 (wilting point), and of the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) across the ZRB by using estimates of locally calibrated pedotransfer functions of 1481 locations for training and testing the DSM models, as well as a reference dataset of measurements from 174 locations for validating the DSM models. We produced coverages of environmental covariates from various source datasets, including climate variables, soil and land use maps, parent materials and lithologic units, derivatives of a digital elevation model (DEM), and Landsat imagery with a spatial resolution of 90 m. The five types of models included multiple linear regression and four machine learning techniques: artificial neural network, gradient boosted regression trees, random forest, and support vector machine. Where the residuals of the initial DSM models were spatially autocorrelated, the models were extended/complemented with residual kriging (RK). Spatial autocorrelation in the model residuals was observed for all five models of each of the three water contents, but not for Ksat. On average for the water content, the R 2 ranged from 0.40 to 0.80 in training and test datasets before adding kriged model residuals and ranged from 0.80 to 0.95 after adding model residuals. Overall, the best prediction method consisted of random forest as the deterministic model, complemented with RK, whereby soil texture followed by climate and topographic elevation variables were the most important covariates. The resulting maps are a ready-to-use resource for hydrologists and crop modelers to aliment and calibrate their hydrological and crop growth models.

TI  - Collaborative Extraction of Paddy Planting Areas with Multi-Source Information Based on Google Earth Engine: A Case Study of Cambodia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-precision spatial mapping of paddy planting areas is very important for food security risk assessment and agricultural monitoring. Previous studies have mainly been based on multi-source satellite imagery, the fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with optical data, and the combined use of multi-scale and multi-source sensors. However, there have been few studies on paddy spatial mapping using collaborative multi-source remote sensing product information, especially in tropical regions such as Southeast Asia. Therefore, based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, in this study, Cambodia, which is dominated by agriculture, was taken as the study area, and an extraction scheme for paddy planting areas was developed from collaborative multi-source information, including multi-source remote sensing images (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2), multi-source remote sensing land cover products (GFSAD30SEACE, GLC_FCS30-2015, FROM_GLC2015, SERVIR MEKONG, and GUF), paddy phenology information, and topographic features. Evaluation and analysis of the extraction results and the SERVIR MEKONG and ESACCI-LC paddy products revealed that the accuracy of the paddy planting areas extracted using the proposed method is the highest, with an overall accuracy of 89.90%. The results of the proposed method are better than those of the other products in terms of the outline of the paddy planting areas and the description of the road information. The results of this study provide a reference for future high-precision paddy mapping.

T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Parasites have developed many strategies to ensure their development, multiplication, and dissemination, including the use of reservoir hosts that are often nondomesticated species. Despite drastic reductions in their populations, wild birds remain widespread worldwide and could constitute some of these reservoirs. We focused on the identification of wild bird species harboring parasite stages in their muscles. Breast muscles of 327 birds of 27 different species were collected at three different sites in France. After artificial digestion, isolated nematode larvae were identified by PCR sequencing or restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Toxocara cati was identified mainly in birds of prey. The presence of anti-Toxoplasma antibodies was investigated by modified agglutination test on muscle fluids. Anti-Toxoplasma antibodies were detected in 65 out of 166 samples from various bird species. Avifauna, particularly birds of prey, could help on the surveillance of parasite circulation and play a role as sentinel species.

TI  - Mapping Soil Properties with Fixed Rank Kriging of Proximally Sensed Soil Data Fused with Sentinel-2 Biophysical Parameter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil surveys with line-scanning platforms appear to have great advantages over the traditional methods used to collect soil information for the development of field-scale soil mapping and applications. These carry VNIR (visible and near infrared) spectrometers and have been used in recent years extensively for the assessment of soil fertility at the field scale, and the delineation of site-specific management zones (MZ). A challenging feature of VNIR applications in precision agriculture (PA) is the massiveness of the derived datasets that contain point predictions of soil properties, and the interpolation techniques involved in incorporating these data into site-specific management plans. In this study, fixed-rank kriging (FRK) geostatistical interpolation, which is a flexible, non-stationary spatial interpolation method especially suited to handling huge datasets, was applied to massive VNIR soil scanner data for the production of useful, smooth interpolated maps, appropriate for the delineation of site-specific MZ maps. Moreover, auxiliary Sentinel-2 data-based biophysical parameters NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and fAPAR (fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy) were included as covariates to improve the filtering performance of the interpolator and the ability to generate uniform patterns of spatial variation from which it is easier to receive a meaningful interpretation in PA applications. Results from the VNIR prediction dataset obtained from a pivot-irrigated field in Albacete, southeastern Spain, during 2019, have shown that FRK variants outperform ordinary kriging in terms of filtering capacity, by doubling the noise removal metrics while keeping the computation cost reasonably low. Such features, along with the capacity to handle a large volume of spatial information, nominate the method as ideal for PA applications with massive proximal and remote sensing datasets.

TI  - Mapping Groundwater Potential Zones Using Analytical Hierarchical Process and Multicriteria Evaluation in the Central Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring alternative freshwater resources other than those surrounding the Nile is critical to disperse Egypt's population to other uninhabited desert areas. This study aims to locate groundwater potential zones (GWPZs) in the water-scarce desert between the Qina and Safga-Bir Queh regions to build groundwater wells, thereby attracting and supporting people's demand for water, food, and urban development. Multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) and analytical hierarchical process (AHP) techniques based on remote sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) were used to map GWPZs. The outcome of the GWPZs map was divided into six different classes. High and very-high aquifer recharge potentials were localized in the middle and western parts, spanning 19.3% and 17% (16.4% and 15.7%) by MCE (AHP). Low and very low aquifer recharge potentials were distributed randomly in the eastern part over an area of 29% and 14.3% (26.9% and 6.1%) by MCE (AHP). Validation has been undertaken between the collected Total Dissolved Solid (TDS) and with the calculated GWPZs, indicating that the highest and lowest TDS concentrations of most aquifers are correlated with low to very low and high to very high aquifer potential, respectively. The study is promising and can be applied anywhere with similar setups for groundwater prospect and management.

TI  - Assessing Land Use/Land Cover Changes in Parts of Chandrapur District, Wardha Valley Coalfield, Maharashtra Using Geospatial Techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Wardha valley coalfield of Central India is one of the major coalfields which fulfils the requirement of coal in Maharashtra and other adjoining states. Chandrapur district falls within the Wardha valley coalfield covering an area of 11,364 km(2). The district has its economic and industrial importance due to availability of coal reserves, which contributes to core sector of India with both open and underground mining. An attempt has been made to assess the land use/cover changes in parts Wardha valley coalfield, Chandrapur district using multi-temporal satellite data. Survey of India toposheets (55P/8 and 56M/5) have been used for preparation of base map, whereas multi-temporal satellite data of LANDSAT 5 (TM), IRS 1D LISS III and IRS P6 LISS III corresponding to 1991, 2001 and 2011, respectively have been utilized for LU/LC mapping and change detection. Visual interpretation technique has been followed to delineate LU/LC categories supplemented with ground truth verification /field work. Satellite data interpretation led to the identification and delineation of 14 land use/cover categories, namely dense forest, degraded forest, open scrub, plantation, cultivated land, uncultivated land, waste land, mining area, overburden dumps, thermal power plant, industrial area, settlement/built-up, water body and dry river. Arc GIS has been used for digitization, editing, computation and generating vital statistics. The analysis of LU/LC statistics suggests that area has undergone significant land use/cover changes during two decades (1991-2011) due to increasing mining activity, industrialization and urbanization. There has been significant reduction in areas under dense forest (9.49 km(2)) and open scrub (10.83 km(2)). The other notable changes have been observed in uncultivated land which reduced by 1.54 km(2) and waste land by 2.75 km(2). On other hand, significant increase in area has been observed under plantation (5.08 km(2)), cultivated land (6.25 km(2)), mining area (2.16 km(2)), overburden dumps (3.37 km(2)) and settlement/built-up (5.22 km(2)). Area under degraded forest has increased by 2.32 km(2), industrial area by 0.18 km(2) and water body by 1.14 km(2).

TI  - The Benefit of Routine Axillary Sonographic Assessment in cN0 Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BREAST HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Axillary ultrasound (US) is often part of the routine assessment of the clinically negative axilla in primary breast cancer, which determines the extent of axillary surgery to be performed. This study aims to ascertain the burden of disease in the axilla of patients with a normal clinical examination (cN0) but with US detected metastatic axillary lymph nodes.Materials and Methods: We retrospectively identified 345 female patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection, following a positive lymph node biopsy, between January 2015 and August 2019.Eighty-nine of those had a positive biopsy prior to surgery. They were divided into two groups: Those with clinically palpable axillary disease preoperatively, cN1 (n = 41), and those with a normal clinical axillary examination, cN0 (n = 48). We assessed the number of positive axillary lymph nodes dissected in the two groups.Results: In the cN0 group the mean value of excised disease-positive axillary lymph nodes was 3.6, while in the cN1 group it was 8.0 (p<0.01). However, further analysis showed that 25 patients of the cN0 who had T1/T2 tumors had >= 3 positive lymph nodes.Conclusion: Our study suggests that the presence of clinically palpable axillary lymph nodes appears to be correlated to a higher number of positive lymph nodes. However, in cases of non-palpable sonographically positive lymph nodes there might still be significant axillary disease, even in T1 and T2 tumors. Therefore we still support the routine use of preoperative sonographic assessment of the axilla for early breast cancer.

TI  - Determining the Capability of the Tree-Based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) in Mapping Parthenium Weed Using Multi-Date Sentinel-2 Image Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) is a state-of-the-art automated machine learning (AutoML) approach that automatically generates and optimizes tree-based pipelines using a genetic algorithm. Although it has been proven to outperform commonly used machine techniques, its capability to handle high-dimensional datasets has not been investigated. In vegetation mapping and analysis, multi-date images are generally high-dimensional datasets that contain embedded information, such as phenological and canopy structural properties, known to enhance mapping accuracy. However, without the implementation of a robust classification algorithm or a feature selection tool, the large sets and the presence of redundant variables in multi-date images can impede accurate and efficient landscape classification. Hence, this study sought to test the efficacy of the TPOT on a multi-date Sentinel-2 image to optimize the classification accuracies of a landscape infested by a noxious invasive plant species, the parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus). Specifically, the models created from the multi-date image, using the TPOT and an algorithm system that combines feature selection and the TPOT, dubbed "ReliefF-Svmb-EXT-TPOT", were compared. The results showed that the TPOT could perform well on data with large feature sets, but at a computational cost. The overall accuracies were 91.9% and 92.6% using the TPOT and ReliefF-Svmb-EXT-TPOT models, respectively. The study findings are crucial for automated and accurate mapping of parthenium weed using high-dimensional geospatial datasets with limited human intervention.

TI  - Buddhist Modernism and the Piety of Female Sex Workers in Northern Thailand
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper highlights Thailand's distinctive form of Buddhist Modernism through an exploration of religious piety among female sex workers in the city of Chiangmai. The generally accepted key basis of Buddhist Modernism, as depicted by certain Western Buddhist scholars, is interaction and engagement with modernity. More specifically, it is seen as incorporating modern science into the Buddhist worldview, and as regarding meditation as a core practice of 'true Buddhism'. Crucial components of popular Buddhism, such as magical monks and mystical rituals, are excluded from this depiction of Buddhist Modernism, and even decried as 'false Buddhism', despite their canonical basis and long-term acceptance. Using ethnographic methods, this paper argues instead that the result of interactions with modernity by popular Buddhists always includes engagement with and mythologizing of traditional cosmology. That is, rather than solely involving global networks and scientific rationalism, Thai Buddhist Modernism is the product of complex patterns of interaction among local beliefs, mystical practices, and modernity. The purpose of this integration of modern and popular Buddhism in the religious practices of sex workers is to create loving-kindness (metta). Metta, in turn, is held to bring luck and attractiveness to practitioners, allowing them to earn an income to support their impoverished families and live well in modern society, as well as to accumulate good merit (bun) to improve their religious lives.

TI  - Analysis of Surface Displacement of Oil Sands Region in Alberta, Canada Using Sentinel-1 SAR Time Series Images
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - SAGD (Steam-Assisted Gravity Drainage) method is widely used for oil recovery in oil sands regions. The SAGD operation causes surface displacement, which can affect the stability of oil recovery plants and trigger various geological disasters. Therefore, it is important to monitor the surface displacement due to SAGD in the oil sands region. In this study, the surface displacement due to SAGD operations of the Athabasca oil sands region in Alberta, Canada, was observed by applying Permanent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) technique to the Sentinel-1 time series SAR data acquired from 2016 to 2021. We also investigated the construction and expansion of SAGD facilities from Landsat-7/8 time series images, from which the characteristics of the surface displacement according to the oil production activity of SAGD were analyzed. Uplift rates of 0.3-2.5 cm/yr in the direction of line of sight were observed over the SAGDs and their vicinity, whereas subsidence rates of -0.3--0.6 cm/yr were observed in areas more than several kilometers away from the SAGDs and not affected by oil recovery activities. Through the analysis of Landsat-7/8 images, we could confirm that the SAGDs operating after 2012 and showing high oil production activity caused uplift rates greater than 1.6 cm/yr due to the subsurface steam injection. Meanwhile, very small uplift rates of several mm per year occurred over SAGDs which have been operated for a longer period of time and show relatively low oil production activity. This was probably due to the compression of reservoir sandstone due to continuous oil recovery. The subsidence observed in areas except for the SAGDs and their vicinity estimated to be a gradual land subsidence caused by melting of the permafrost. Considering the subsidence, it was expected that the uplift due to SAGD operation would be greater than that observed by the PSInSAR. The results of this study confirm that the PSInSAR can be used as an effective means for evaluating productivity and stability of SAGD in the extreme cold regions.

TI  - Evaluation of Reservoir Monitoring-based Hydrological Drought Index Using Sentinel-1 SAR Waterbody Detection Technique
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water storage is one of the factors that most directly represent the amount of available water resources. Since the effects of drought can be more intuitively expressed, it is also used in various studies for drought evaluation. In a recent study, hydrological drought was evaluated through information on observing reservoirs with optical images. The short observation cycle and diversity of optical satellites provide a lot of data. However, there are some limitations because it is vulnerable to the influence of weather or the atmospheric environment. Therefore, this study attempted to conduct a study on estimating the drought index using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image with relatively little influence from the observation environment. We produced the waterbody of Baekgok and Chopyeong reservoirs using SAR images of Sentinel-1 satellites and calculated the Reservoir Area Drought Index (RADI), a hydrological drought index. In order to validate the applicability of RADI to drought monitoring, it was compared with Reservoir Storage Drought Index (RSDI) based on measured storage. The two indices showed a very high correlation with the correlation coefficient, r=0.87, Area Under curve, AUC=0.97. These results show the possibility of regional-scale hydrological drought monitoring of SAR-based RADI. As the number of available SAR images increases in the future, it is expected that the utilization of drought monitoring will also increase.

TI  - Combining randomized field experiments with observational satellite data to assess the benefits of crop rotations on yields
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - With climate change threatening agricultural productivity and global food demand increasing, it is important to better understand which farm management practices will maximize crop yields in various climatic conditions. To assess the effectiveness of agricultural practices, researchers often turn to randomized field experiments, which are reliable for identifying causal effects but are often limited in scope and therefore lack external validity. Recently, researchers have also leveraged large observational datasets from satellites and other sources, which can lead to conclusions biased by confounding variables or systematic measurement errors. Because experimental and observational datasets have complementary strengths, in this paper we propose a method that uses a combination of experimental and observational data in the same analysis. As a case study, we focus on the causal effect of crop rotation on corn (maize) and soybean yields in the Midwestern United States. We find that, in terms of root mean squared error, our hybrid method performs 13% better than using experimental data alone and 26% better than using the observational data alone in the task of predicting the effect of rotation on corn yield at held-out experimental sites. Further, the causal estimates based on our method suggest that benefits of crop rotations on corn yield are lower in years and locations with high temperatures whereas the benefits of crop rotations on soybean yield are higher in years and locations with high temperatures. In particular, we estimated that the benefit of rotation on corn yields (and soybean yields) was 0.85 t ha(-1) (0.24 t ha(-1)) on average for the top quintile of temperatures, 1.03 t ha(-1) (0.21 t ha(-1)) on average for the whole dataset, and 1.19 t ha(-1) (0.16 t ha(-1)) on average for the bottom quintile of temperatures. This association between temperatures and rotation benefits is consistent with the hypothesis that the benefit of the corn-soybean rotation on soybean yield is largely driven by pest pressure reductions while the benefit of the corn-soybean rotation on corn yields is largely driven by nitrogen availability.

TI  - Spatial effect of anti-COVID measures on land surface temperature (LST) in urban areas: A case study of a medium-sized city
T2  - IDOJARAS
M3  - Article
AB  - This case study investigates the magnitude and nature of the spatial effect generated by the anti-COVID measures on land surface temperature (LST) in the city of Targu Mures (Marosvasarhely), Romania. The measures were taken by the Romanian government during the state of emergency (March 16 - May 14, 2020) due to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic. The study shows that - contrary to previous studies carried out on cities in China and India in most of the urban areas of Marosvasarhely LST has increased in the period of health emergency in 2020 concerning the large average of the years 2000-2019. Remote sensing data from the MODIS and the Landsat satellites show. that MODIS data, having a moderate spatial (approximately 1 km) but good temporal resolution (daily measurements), show a temperature increase of +0.78 degrees C, while Landsat data, having better spatial (30 m) but lower temporal resolution, show an even greater increase, +2.36 degrees C in the built-up areas. The difference in temperature increase is mainly due to the spatial resolution difference between the two TIR band sensors. The LST anomaly analysis performed with MODIS data also shows a positive anomaly increase of 1 degrees C. However, despite this increase, with the help of the hotspot-coldspot analysis of the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic we were able to identify 46 significant coldspots that showed a 1- 2 degrees C decrease of LST in April 2020 compared to the average of the previous years in April. Most of these coldspots correspond to factory areas, public transport epicenters, shopping centers, industrial polygons. and non-residential areas. This shows that anti-COVID measures in the medium-sized city of Marosvasarhely had many effects on LST in particular areas that have links to the local economy, trade. and transport. Paired sample t-test for areas identified with LST decrease shows that there is a statistically significant difference in the average LST observed before and after anti-COVID measures were applied. MODIS-based LST is satisfactory for recognizing patterns and trends at large or moderate geographical scales. However, for a hotspot-coldspot analysis of the urban heat islands, it is more suitable to use Landsat data.

AB  - This paper aims to present possible areas to plant different vegetation types near traffic jams to reduce air pollution in the capital of Croatia, the city of Zagreb. Based on main traffic road and random forest machine learning using WorldView-2 European cities data, potential areas are established. It is seen that, based on a 10 m buffer, there is a possible planting area of more than 220,000 square meters, and based on 15 m buffer, there is a possible planting area of more than 410,000 square meters. The proposed plants are Viburnum lucidum, Photinia x fraseri, Euonymus japonicus, Tilia cordata, Aesculus hippocastanum, Pinus sp., Taxus baccata, Populus alba, Quercus robur, Betula pendula, which are characteristic for urban areas in Croatia. The planting of proposed trees may result in an increase of 3-5% in the total trees in the city of Zagreb. Although similar research has been published, this paper presents novelty findings from combined machine learning methods for defining green urban areas. Additionally, this paper presents original results for this region.

T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The conflict of civilizations has not been resolved at the beginning of the 21st century. Attempts to give a worthy place to the dominants of the Indian, African, Arab mentality fill in the gaps in modern literary criticism and reveal the ideas of literary works. Simone de Beauvoir was one of the first to draw attention to the oppression of the colonized peoples in the memoirs 'Force of Circumstance'. The purpose of the article is to investigate the time trends in the memoirs by Simone de Beauvoir 'Force of Circumstance'. The methodology is basically based on hermeneutics approach and biographical method. The most important results are the following. S. de Beauvoir interprets African and Algerian culture in order to refute the myth of the "minority" of the thinking of its bearers, to overcome the "secondary" in accordance with the European worldview. Time trends are nonstandard choices of subjects and circumstances that contrast with the views of the "majority". S. de Beauvoir's nonconformist position on "white civilization" demonstrates progressive potential. S. de Beauvoir reproduced the general trends of the time, acted as an analyst of social processes. Many of her observations and conclusions have not lost their relevance today.

TI  - Dual-Labelling Strategies for Nuclear and Fluorescence Molecular Imaging: Current Status and Future Perspectives
T2  - PHARMACEUTICALS
M3  - Review
AB  - Molecular imaging offers the possibility to investigate biological and biochemical processes non-invasively and to obtain information on both anatomy and dysfunctions. Based on the data obtained, a fundamental understanding of various disease processes can be derived and treatment strategies can be planned. In this context, methods that combine several modalities in one probe are increasingly being used. Due to the comparably high sensitivity and provided complementary information, the combination of nuclear and optical probes has taken on a special significance. In this review article, dual-labelled systems for bimodal nuclear and optical imaging based on both modular ligands and nanomaterials are discussed. Particular attention is paid to radiometal-labelled molecules for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) and metal complexes combined with fluorescent dyes for optical imaging. The clinical potential of such probes, especially for fluorescence-guided surgery, is assessed.

TI  - Monitoring Complex Integrated Crop-Livestock Systems at Regional Scale in Brazil: A Big Earth Observation Data Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to different combinations of agriculture, livestock and forestry managed by rotation, succession and intercropping practices, integrated agriculture production systems such as integrated crop-livestock systems (iCL) constitute a very complex target and a challenge for automatic mapping of cropping practices based on remote sensing data. The overall objective of this study was to develop a classification strategy for the annual mapping of integrated Crop-Livestock systems (iCL) at a regional scale. This strategy was designed and tested in the six agro-climatic regions of Mato Grosso, the largest Brazilian soybean producer state, using MODIS satellite time-series images acquired between 2012 and 2019, ground data with heterogeneous distribution in space and time and a Random Forest classifier. The results showed that: 1. the use of unbalanced training samples with a class composition close to the real one was the right classifier training strategy; 2. the use of a single training database (pooling samples from different years and regions) to classify each region and year individually proved to be robust enough to provide similar classification accuracies in comparison to those based on the use of a database acquired for each region and for each year. The final hierarchical classification overall accuracy was 0.89 for Level 1, the cropping pattern level (single and double crops DC); 0.84 for Level 2, the DC category level (integrated system iCL soy-pasture/brachiaria, soy-cotton and soy-cereal); 0.77 for Level 3, the iCL level (iCL1 soy-pasture and iCL2 soy-pasture mixed with corn). The F-scores for DC, iCL and iCL1 cropping systems presented high accuracy (0.89, 0.85 and 0.84), while iCL2 was more difficult to classify (0.63). This approach will next be applied across the entire Brazilian soybean corridor, leading to an operational tool for monitoring the adoption of sustainable intensification practices recognized by Brazil's Agriculture Low Carbon Plan (ABC PLAN).

TI  - Management of the axilla in 2022: when and how is surgery still carried out?
T2  - GYNAKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The lymph node status is still the most important prognostic factor in breast cancer. Therefore, axillary staging (axillary lymph node dissection, ANLD and sentinel lymph node biopsy, SLNB) is therefore an integral component of the surgical treatment for every invasive breast cancer; however, adjuvant systemic treatment decisions are increasingly based on tumor biology and the probability of response to a specific treatment. This is particularly true for triple negative or HER2 positive tumors for which chemotherapy is indicated independent of the lymph node status. For luminal B tumors gene signatures are increasingly being used, so that in some collectives chemotherapy can be omitted even if the lymph node status is positive. Although documentation of the pN stage is necessary for systemic treatment decisions for only a few patients, many systemic treatment recommendations, such as for luminal tumors in premenopausal patients, are still based on the lymph node status. The ypN stage is currently still of great importance for the indications for adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) of the thoracic wall after mastectomy or the extra-axillary lymph drainage area. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) the axillary staging only plays a subordinate role in the planning of postneoadjuvant systemic treatment but is of substantial importance for locoregional treatment. Therefore, omission of the determination of the ppN stage currently only appears to be feasible in a small subset of patients. In view of the declining role of the lymph node status in patients who undergo upfront surgery, a selective staging that anticipates potential subsequent treatment decisions appears to be meaningful.

TI  - Emerging Land Use Challenges and Overlapping Interests in a Remote Community <i>Case-Study of the Okinskiy District of Buryatia</i>
T2  - INNER ASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Okinskiy district of Buryatia is characterised by the entanglement of heterogeneous economies formed by the global demand for gold and jade, the remnants of Soviet planning systems at the local and municipal levels, traditional Soyot and Buryat land use practices and nascent adventure and recreational tourist flows. In a situation where most of the economic and social relations remain informal and rarely captured in the official documents, landscapes become the visible marker of the changing, intersecting and sometimes conflicting interests of these actors. In this paper, we analyse and juxtapose social and landscape data to examine how these relations are manifested in the land cover, which is a valuable proxy for studies of landscapes in a situation of remoteness. Using interviews and observations, we collected and analysed data on pertinent social, cultural and professional ties and examined local land-use practices and diverse economic interests during fieldwork in August 2020. The analysis of forest change was carried out using statistical and forest plan data, and a land-cover map was created using Iandsat satellite images from 2020. The resulting map illustrates preservation of a traditional way of life in the form of seasonal migration infrastructure which includes summer pastures with summer houses and informal roads connecting them with settlements. However, multi-temporal maps with field data validation are needed to support more detailed accounts of change captured in the interviews.

TI  - GIS-based multi-criteria approach to delineate groundwater prospect zone and its sensitivity analysis
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was aimed at delineating groundwater potential zones (GWPZ) using geo-spatial techniques for Ranchi district, Jharkhand (India). Data including Cartosat-1 digital elevation model (DEM), Landsat 8 satellite images, lithology, geology, soil, and water yield data were utilised in this study. The relative importance of multiple parameters including lithology, soil, slope, geology, rainfall, drainage density, and land use/land cover (LULC) that influence the availability of groundwater was determined subjectively. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) along with pair-wise comparison decision theory was utilized to calculate the weights for each aforementioned parameter. The delineated GWPZ were categorized into four classes viz., very good zone (31.57%), good zone (45.43%), moderate zone (13.09%), and poor zone (8.53%). The sensitivity analysis indicated lithology and soil type as the most and least sensitive parameters, respectively influencing the presence of groundwater in the study area. Comparison between well discharge data and delineated GWPZ yielded a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.59. This study contributes to identifying priority areas where appropriate water conservation programs as well as strategies for sustainable groundwater development can be implemented.

TI  - Biophysical Impact of Sunflower Crop Rotation on Agricultural Fields
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop rotation is an important determining factor of crop productivity. Sustainable agriculture requires correct rules of crop rotation. Failure to comply with these rules can lead to deterioration of soil biochemical characteristics and land degradation. In Ukraine as well as in many other countries, sunflower monocropping is common practice and the impact of this fact should be studied to find the most precise rules to save the economic potential of land and minimize land degradation factors. This research provides an evaluation of the sunflower monocropping effect on the vegetation indices obtained from MODIS vegetation indices datasets for Ukraine as one of the countries with the biggest sunflower export in Europe. The crop rotation schemes are represented by their area proportions at the village level calculated based on the crop classification maps for 2016 to 2020. This representation gives the possibility to use regression models and f-test feature importance analysis to measure the impact of 3-year and 5-year crop rotation sequences. For these purposes, we use several models: a four-year binary representation model (model A1) and a model with all possible three-year crop rotation scheme representations (model B). These models gave the possibility to evaluate crop rotation schemes based on their biophysical impact on the next sunflower plantings and found that sunflower planting with an interval of three or more years is optimal in terms of the sustainability of soil fertility.

TI  - A Diversity Index Model based on Spatial Analysis to Estimate High Conservation Value in a Mining Area
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large scale land-based investments have a significant impact on natural resources and environmental conditions. It is necessary to protect areas of high conservation value (HCV) within land management investments, such as the mining sector, to minimise this impact. The existence of high conservation value sites in locations with activities related to the mining sector is intended to maintain the ecological and conservation value of a mining investment area. We demonstrate a model that can identify potential high conservation value sites in mining areas using remote sensing data and spatial analysis compiled with field observation data. The research was conducted in one of the largest nickel mining areas (71,047 ha) in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. We mapped vegetation density using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), calculated from Sentinel-2 imagery. We also collected biodiversity data in predetermined inventory sampling plots, which we then used to estimate species richness using the Shannon-Wiener diversity index. Using a linear regression model to compare the normalized difference vegetation index value in each sampling plot with the biodiversity value of flora and fauna, we then estimated biodiversity distribution patterns for the entire study area. We found that potential high conservation value areas (areas likely to have high biodiversity based on our regression model) covered 40,000 ha, more than half of the total concession area.

TI  - Assimilation of SMAP Products for Improving Streamflow Simulations over Tropical Climate Region-Is Spatial Information More Important Than Temporal Information?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Streamflow is one of the key variables in the hydrological cycle. Simulation and forecasting of streamflow are challenging tasks for hydrologists, especially in sparsely gauged areas. Coarse spatial resolution remote sensing soil moisture products (equal to or larger than 9 km) are often assimilated into hydrological models to improve streamflow simulation in large catchments. This study uses the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) technique to assimilate SMAP soil moisture products at the coarse spatial resolution of 9 km (SMAP 9 km), and downscaled SMAP soil moisture product at the higher spatial resolution of 1 km (SMAP 1 km), into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to investigate the usefulness of different spatial and temporal resolutions of remotely sensed soil moisture products in streamflow simulation and forecasting. The experiment was set up for eight catchments across the tropical climate of Vietnam, with varying catchment areas from 267 to 6430 km(2) during the period 2017-2019. We comprehensively evaluated the EnKF-based SWAT model in simulating streamflow at low, average, and high flow. Our results indicated that high-spatial resolution of downscaled SMAP 1 km is more beneficial in the data assimilation framework in aiding the accuracy of streamflow simulation, as compared to that of SMAP 9 km, especially for the small catchments. Our analysis on the impact of observation resolution also indicates that the improvement in the streamflow simulation with data assimilation is more significant at catchments where downscaled SMAP 1 km has fewer missing observations. This study is helpful for adding more understanding of performances of soil moisture data assimilation based hydrological modelling over the tropical climate region, and exhibits the potential use of remote sensing data assimilation in hydrology.

TI  - How wildfires increase sensitivity of Amazon forests to droughts
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The phenology of tropical forests is tightly related to climate conditions. In the Amazon, the seasonal greening of forests is conditioned by solar radiation and rainfall. Yet, increasing anthropogenic pressures (e.g. logging and wildfires), raise concerns about the impacts of forest degradation on the functioning of forest ecosystems, especially in a climate change context. In this study, we relied on remote sensing data to assess the contribution of solar radiation and precipitation to forest greening in mature and fire degraded forests, with a focus on the 2015 drought event. Our results showed that forest greening is more dependent on water resources in degraded forests than in mature forests. As a consequence, the expected increase in drought episodes and associated fire occurrences under climate change could lead to a long-term drying of tropical forests.

TI  - Retrieval of Vegetation Health Index for the Korean Peninsula Using GK2A AMI
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming causes climate change and increases extreme weather eveGnts worldwide, and the occurrence of heatwaves and droughts is also increasing in Korea. For the monitoring of extreme weather, various satellite data such as LST (Land Surface Temperature), TCI (Temperature Condition Index), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), VCI (Vegetation Condition Index), and VHI (Vegetation Health Index) have been used. VHI, the combination of TCI and VCI, represents the vegetation stress affected by meteorological factors like precipitation and temperature and is frequently used to assess droughts under climate change. TCI and VCI require historical reference values for the LST and NDVI for each date and location. So, it is complicated to produce the VHI from the recent satellite GK2A (Geostationary Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-2A). This study examined the retrieval of VHI using GK2A AMI (Advanced Meteorological Imager) by referencing the historical data from VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) NDVI and LST as a proxy data. We found a close relationship between GK2A and VIIRS data needed for the retrieval of VHI. We produced the TCI, VCI, and VHI for GK2A during 2020-2021 at intervals of 8 days and carried out the interpretations of recent extreme weather events in Korea. GK2A VHI could express the changes in vegetation stress in 2020 due to various extreme weather events such as heatwaves (in March and June) and low temperatures (in April and July), and heavy rainfall (in August), while NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) VHI could not well represent such characteristics. The GK2A VHI presented in this study can be utilized to monitor the vegetation stress due to heatwaves and droughts if the historical reference values of LST and NDVI can be adjusted in a more statistically significant way in the future work.

TI  - Does the Tundra Bean Goose (Anser serrirostris) Follow the Green Wave Throughout its Entire Spring Migration?
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Following the flush of spring growth of primary production (the ???green wave??? hypothesis) has been applied as a universal explanation for spring migration timing of avian herbivores. However, studies of the green wave hypothesis have focused on species feeding intensively on above-ground primary production. To test whether a facultative grazer strictly follows the green wave, we used 16 complete tracks in time and space of spring migrating tundra bean geese (Anser serrirostris) fitted with telemetry devices from two flyways between Yangtze River Floodplain winter areas and Anadyr (Russia)/Central Arctic breeding grounds. We combined these with high spatial resolution MODIS satellite-derived plant production data to relate the timing of spring migration to that of the green wave index (GWI) at different staging regions and on breeding areas. Results showed that, at stopovers south of 52??N, eastern tundra bean geese fed mainly on cropland and arrived at stopover sites ahead of 50% GWI. At all subsequent stopover sites in Russia, eastern tundra bean geese fed exclusively on natural forage land, and followed GWI northwards, finally overtaking GWI to arrive at the breeding sites in advance of these dates. These data show that satellite-derived GWI are generally poor predictors of the arrival dates of spring migrating eastern tundra bean geese, but that deviations related to differential habitat use along the flyway and the need to arrive on the breeding areas ahead of snowmelt to coincide subsequent hatching of goslings with optimal food availability.

TI  - Satellite Detection of Surface Water Extent: A Review of Methodology
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Water is an imperative part of the Earth and an essential resource in human life and production. Under the effects of climate change and human activities, the spatial and temporal distribution of water bodies has been changing, and the shortage of water resources is becoming increasingly serious worldwide. Therefore, the monitoring of water bodies is indispensable. Remote sensing has the advantages of real time, wide coverage, and rich information and has become a brand-new technical means to quickly obtain water information. This study summarizes the current common methods of water extraction based on optical and radar images, including the threshold method, support vector machine, decision tree, object-oriented extraction, and deep learning, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of each method. These methods were applied to the Huai River Basin in China and Nam Co on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The extraction results show that all the aforementioned approaches can obtain reliable results. Among them, the threshold segmentation method based on normalized difference water index is more robust than others. In the water extraction process, there are still many problems that restrict the accuracy of the results. In the future, researchers will continue to search for more automatic, extensive, and high-precision water extraction methods.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Land Surface Albedo and Its Influencing Factors in the Qilian Mountains, Northeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo directly determines the distribution of radiant energy between the surface and the atmosphere, and it is a key parameter affecting the energy balance on the land surface. However, the spatiotemporal dynamics of land surface albedo and associated influencing factors in the Qilian Mountains (QM) have been rarely reported. By using the long-time series data products of MODIS shortwave albedo, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and snow cover with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees from 2001 to 2020, this paper analyzes the temporal and spatial variations of land surface albedo in the QM over the past 20 years and its influencing factors. The analysis results show that the multi-year average surface albedo in the QM has obvious differences in spatial distribution: it increases with the altitude, and it is high in the west (at the west of 98 degrees E) and low in the east. Meanwhile, the surface albedo has different distribution characteristics in different seasons: the spatial distribution of surface albedo is similar in spring and autumn; the areas with a high surface albedo in summer are significantly fewer than those in other seasons. Besides, in the past 20 years, the annual average surface albedo has shown a weak growth trend in the QM, with a change rate of 5 x 10(-3)/10a, and the minimum and maximum values were reached in 2001 and 2019, respectively. In addition, the annual variation of the surface albedo in the QM showed a "U" shape, with the largest variation in January and the smallest variation in August. The annual variation of surface albedo is significantly positively correlated with snow cover (r = 0.96) and significantly negatively correlated with NDVI (r = -0.91). Moreover, the interannual variation of the surface albedo in the QM is closely related to land surface cover and is greatly affected by snow cover. Spatially, the annual variation of surface albedo in most areas of the QM is dominated by the change of snow cover, and the increase of surface albedo in the middle area is consistent with the increase of snow cover, while the decrease of albedo in the edge area is related to the improvement of vegetation cover. The results of this study provide a scientific basis for studying the climate and environmental changes caused by changes in the surface of the QM and making ecological environment restoration strategies.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Processes and Characteristics of Vegetation Recovery in the Earthquake Area: A Case Study of Wenchuan, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantitative and qualitative assessment of post-disaster vegetation damage and recovery in the core area of the Wenchuan earthquake is of great significance for the restoration and reconstruction of natural ecosystems and the construction of human settlements in China. This study used time series analysis to determine the time of MODIS data and used the data to study the vegetation damage and restoration in the core area of the Wenchuan earthquake. The determined MODIS images were used to quantitatively analyze a series of vegetation damage changes and the vegetation recovery rate in the core area of the Wenchuan earthquake before and after the earthquake. By applying the topographic factors, we analyzed the spatial and temporal characteristics of the dynamic changes of vegetation damage and the recovery rate in the disaster area. The results show that the study area's vegetation damage was correlated to topographic factors and distance from towns. Besides, the overall vegetation restoration after the disaster was relatively optimistic. In some areas, the vegetation restoration level even exceeded the vegetation coverage level before the disaster. The recovery study of MODIS-NDVI showed a specific lag delay effect on the image of vegetation cover. The vegetation damage and the recovery rate of vegetation cover were significantly correlated with the distance from towns and the topographic factor. Overall, the results contribute to the theoretical support for the damage and recovery of vegetation in the core area affected by the earthquake.

TI  - Retrieval of the Leaf Area Index from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Surface Reflectance Based on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several global leaf area index (LAI) products were generated using neural networks, but the training dataset for the neural networks was sensor specific, and the construction of the training dataset was time consuming. In this paper, an unsupervised domain adaptation-based method was proposed to estimate LAI from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) surface reflectance dataset based on a training dataset constructed from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance dataset. A transfer component analysis (TCA) algorithm was first utilized to map the MODIS and VIIRS surface reflectance into the same subspace to reduce the distribution discrepancies between the MODIS and VIIRS surface reflectance. Then, the embedded data obtained from MODIS surface reflectance dataset, along with the LAI values produced by fusing the MODIS and the Carbon cYcle and Change in Land Observational Products from an Ensemble of Satellites (CYCLOPES) products, were employed to train general regression neural networks (GRNNs). Finally, for retrieving the LAI values, the embedded data acquired from the VIIRS surface reflectance dataset was input into the trained GRNNs. For multiple field sites with different biome types, we used this developed method to retrieve LAI values based on the VIIRS surface reflectance dataset. The results indicate that, based on the training dataset built from MODIS surface reflectance dataset, the domain adaptation-based retrieval method can effectively estimate LAI values from VIIRS surface reflectance dataset. By comparison with the VIIRS and MODIS LAI products, the retrieved LAI values with TCA are more consistent with the reference LAI values acquired from high-resolution remote sensing images. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the retrieved LAI values with TCA at all selected sites are 0.88 and 0.68, respectively. Furthermore, the accuracy of the retrieved LAI values with TCA is higher than the retrieved LAI values without TCA with the R-2 0.81 and the RMSE 0.79.

TI  - Reconstructed annual glacier surface mass balance in the anyemaqen Mountains, Yellow River source, based on snow line altitude
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual mass balance is an important factor that reflects glacier change and glacier meltwater resources. In this study, we analyzed the changes in glacier area, snow line altitude (SLA) and surface elevation in the anyemaqen Mountain region using multisource remote sensing data. Then, the annual mass balance of two glaciers was reconstructed by using SLA-mass-balance gradient method. The results showed that the glacier area in the anyemaqen Mountains decreased by 29.4 km(2) from 1985 to 2017. The average SLAs of the Halong Glacier and Yehelong Glacier were approximately 5290 m and 5188 m, respectively. The glacier mass balance for the two glaciers from 1990 to 2020 was - 0.71 m w.e. a(-1) and -0.63 m w.e. a(-1), respectively. Our results indicate that SLA is an important indicator of glacier changes, and a long sequence of SLAs can more accurately reconstruct the glacier mass balance of the glacier. The mean annual glacial meltwater-fed streamflow is 1.45 x 10(7) m(3) and 1.12 x 10(7) m(3), respectively. Sensitivity analysis indicates that summer air temperature plays a leading role in regard to the influential climatic factors of glacial retreat in the Anyemaqen Mountains. This highlights the potential of the methodology for application on reconstructing annual glacier surface mass balance at larger scales without direct measurements.

TI  - Land Subsidence in Qingdao, China, from 2017 to 2020 Based on PS-InSAR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence is a global geological disaster that seriously affects the safety of surface and underground buildings/structures and even leads to loss of life and property. The large-scale and continuous long-time coverage of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series analysis techniques provide data and a basis for the development of methods for the investigation and evolution mechanism study of regional land subsidence. Based on the 108 SAR data of Sentinel-1 from April 2017 to December 2020, this study used Persistent Scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR) technology to monitor the land subsidence in Qingdao. In addition, detailed analysis and discussion of land subsidence combined with the local land types and subway construction were carried out. From the entire area to the local scale, the deformation analysis was carried out in the two dimensions of time and space. The results reveal that the rate of surface deformation in Qingdao from 2017 to 2020 was mainly -34.48 to 5.77 mm/a and that the cumulative deformation was mainly -126.10 to 30.18 mm. The subsidence areas were mainly distributed in coastal areas (along the coasts of Jiaozhou Bay and the Yellow Sea) and inland areas (northeast Laixi City and central Pingdu City). In addition, it was found that obvious land subsidence occurred near the Health Center Station of Metro Line 8, a logistics company in Qingdao, and near several high-rise residential areas and business office buildings. It is necessary for the relevant departments to take timely action to prevent and mitigate subsidence-related disasters in these areas.

TI  - Advances in experimental petrology study on the evolution of the lunar magma ocean
T2  - ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the lack of rock samples directly from the deep part of the Moon, experiments and numerical simulation are effective methods to understand the early evolution of the Moon. Since the 1970s, the Lunar Magma Ocean (LMO) evolution model has been verified and modified by a large number of experimental petrology and geochemical work. However, the original composition of the Moon and the depth of its magma ocean, which are the two most critical parameters of LMO models remain controversial. The different lunar crust thickness estimated from lunar seismic data compared to that estimated from gravity data, the volatile content of lunar samples, and the widespread of Mg and Al-rich spinet (Cr (#) <5) discovered from interpreting the new remote sensing data affect our assessment on the starting composition and the depth of LMO, and the fractional crystallization process thereafter. In this paper, we review a series of high temperature and high pressure experimental petrology and experimental geochemistry results on the Moon's early evolution by focusing on: (1) The influence of refractory elements and volatile content of LMO's composition and its depth on the thickness of lunar crust and the Moon's mineral constitution formed through early differentiation. (2) The rationality of stability of high pressure mineral garnet deep inside lunar mantle and it effect on the distribution of trace elements during the evolution of lunar. (3) The petrogenesis of the Moon's special components, including volcanic glasses and Mg-suite, and their indication on the composition of the Moon's deep interior. (4) The constraint of lunar core composition on the Moon's material source, especially the abundance of trace elements. Based on the latest observation and the new analysis results of lunar samples, we evaluate the existing LMO evolution models and propose a LMO model with garnet as an important constituent mineral inside the Moon. We also discuss the necessary work need to be done to improve the "new" LMO model.

TI  - An assessment of the factors that drive changes in the distribution and area of cultivated land in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yellow River Delta is an important land expansion and cultivated land reserve area, where the relationship between land use and the landscape is constantly evolving with changes in the area and morphology of the large river delta. Furthermore, it is also an ecologically fragile area where the relationship between environmental and socioeconomic factors needs to be carefully managed, particularly in the cultivated land area, which is important to local livelihoods. Consequently, it is important to understand how the distribution and area of cultivated land on the delta have changed over time and to identify the key factors that have influenced the changes in this land use in the region. In this paper, a comprehensive method of trajectory analysis and geodetector models was used, with the cultivated land evolution trajectory from 1990 to 2018 as the dependent variable. Based on the multitemporal Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing images of the Yellow River Delta and socioeconomic data, a geodetector assessment was applied to analyze the pattern of change in the cultivated land and its influencing factors during a 30-year period. The results of this analysis have shown that the amount of cultivated land in the Yellow River Delta first increased and then decreased slightly. Most cultivated land was derived from unused land, forest and grassland, and most cultivated land was then converted to construction land. The cultivated land loss has mostly taken place on the margins of tidal flats and in the areas surrounding towns. The amount of cultivated land has been expanding, largely following the distribution of urban expansion. A geodetector analysis showed that socioeconomic factors were the main factors that drove the changes in the distribution of cultivated land in the region. These factors, including the gross national product, proportion of primary industry, and rate of population change, were the main driving factors for cultivated land expansion. The proportion of primary industry, proportion of secondary industry, and distance from the coastline were the main influencing factors for the loss of cultivated land.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Evolution and Relationship between Night Time Light and Land Surface Temperature: A Case Study of Beijing, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has triggered significant changes in urban land surface temperature (LST), which in turn affects urban ecosystems and the health of residents. Therefore, exploring the interrelationship between urban development and LST can help optimize the urban thermal environment and promote sustainable development. Based on remote sensing data from 2004-2019 within the sixth ring road of Beijing, this study investigates the spatiotemporal coupling law of night time light (NTL) and LST using an overall coupling model and analyzes the degree of coordination between them using a coordination model. The spatial response law between them was also analyzed using standard deviation ellipses and bivariate spatial autocorrelation. The results show that, from the perspective of spatiotemporal evolution, the spatial distributions of NTL and LST within the sixth ring road of Beijing were closely related from 2004 to 2019, although the overall coupling of NTL and LST was initially decreased and then continuously increased. From the perspective of coordination types, the main types of coordination between NTL and LST deteriorated over time. The increase in LST lagged behind NTL from 2004 to 2009 (heating hysteresis type), while LST increased ahead of NTL from 2014 to 2019 (heating advance type). This suggests that urban development became less efficient, while LST increases became more significant. In terms of correlation, NTL and LST showed significant positive correlation and spatial positive correlation; the correlation coefficient first decreased significantly and then continued to increase. From 2004 to 2009, the temperature increase caused by urbanization was suppressed due to the 2008 Beijing Olympics and related ecological protection policies, resulting in a significant decrease in the correlation coefficient between NTL and LST. From 2009 to 2019, short-term measures taken by Beijing during the Olympic Games were no longer effective, and the opposition between urban development and related policies made the policies increasingly less effective, thereby increasing the correlation coefficient between NTL and LST, and the increase in LST was more significant. This will greatly affect the urban ecological environment and residents' health and make the previous government investment to suppress the temperature increase all in vain. This study can provide theoretical and practical support for the development of thermal environment optimization schemes and LST mitigation strategies in Beijing and other cities.

TI  - Threshold Calibration of Key Parameters of Withered Grass Based on PROSAIL Model in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland, as an important part of the ecosystem in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, plays an ecological indicator role. However, during the non-growing season, it generally didn't monitor or observe alpine grass in winter. It could be a great gap to develop the methods of grassland monitoring and its application in winter. PROSAIL, a physical radiation model, can quantitatively describe the relationship between various vegetation parameters and canopy reflectance spectra. In this study, the latest version of the PROSAIL-D model and ground observed data were applied to explore the thresholds of critical range for 10 parameters of withered grass affected by reflectance spectrum. Based on the reflectance spectrums and the corresponding character' s parameters of withered grass that were obtained in the field, 15 000 possible withered grass spectrums were simulated by the PROSAIL model. Compared to the difference of reflectance spectra between withered grass and green grass observed in winter and summer respectively, it is found that a clear difference displayed on visible and near-infrared bands and with a significant linear in 400 similar to 1 300 nm spectral range for withered grass in winter in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. On that basis, we proposed a method to distinguish the withered and green grass using the difference between red and green spectral reflections. It can be considered as a withered grass spectrum while the difference is greater than 0. Furthermore, a dataset of potential withered grass spectrum was established by two-steps identification from 15 000 possible spectrums based on the methods described above. The potential withered grass spectrums are correlated closely to the observed spectrums with a whole range of 400 similar to 2 500 nm, and the R-2 of all the simulated spectrum lines was between 0. 904 and 0. 994. By EFAST method and global sensitivity analysis, the brown pigment, carotenoid, anthocyanin, leaf structure and hot spot were identified as non-sensitive factors that respond to the withered grass spectrum. Finally, PROSAIL model was run again in OFAT (One Factor at a Time) with 99% confidence interval as the criterion and cosine distance as the evaluation function. The parameter threshold intervals of the sensitive factors of withered grass are estimated as : leaf area index of 0. 2-0. 89, chlorophyll content in 0 similar to 1. 29 mu g . cm(2), the average leaf angle between 11 degrees similar to 90 degrees, equivalent water thickness from 0. 000 1 to 0. 005 cm, dry matter content within 0. 008 similar to 0. 05 g . cm(2). The results provide some important parameters and further understanding of grass characteristics in winter, and it will strongly promote the application in remote sensing monitoring.

TI  - Discussion on InSAR Identification Effectivity of Potential Landslides and Factors That Influence the Effectivity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The southwest mountainous area of China is one of the areas with the most landslides in the world. In this paper, we used Ya'an City and Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province as the research areas to explore the identification application effects of large-area potential landslides using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with different wavelength types (Sentinel-1, ALOS-2), different processing methods (SBAS-InSAR, Stacking-InSAR), and different geological environmental conditions. The results show the following: (1) The effect of identifying landslides with different slope directions is largely affected by the satellite orbit direction; when we identify landslide hazards across a large area, the joint monitoring mode of ascending and descending orbit data is required. (2) The period of monitoring affects the identification effect of potential landslides when landslide identification is carried out in southwestern China; the InSAR monitoring period is recommended to be more than 2 years. (3) In different geological environmental regions, SBAS technology and Stacking technology have their own advantages; Stacking technology identifies more potential landslides, and SBAS technology identifies potential landslides with higher accuracy; (4) the degree of vegetation coverage has a great impact on the landslide identification effect of different SAR data sources. In low-density vegetation coverage areas, the landslide identification result using Sentinel-1 data seems to be better than the result using ALOS-2 data. In high-density vegetation coverage areas, the landslide identification result using ALOS-2 data is better than that using Sentinel-1 data.

TI  - Remote Sensing Estimation and Spatiotemporal Pattern Analysis of Terrestrial Net Ecosystem Productivity in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) plays an important role in understanding ecosystem function and the global carbon cycle. In this paper, the key parameters of the Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model, maximum light use efficiency (epsilon(max)), was optimized by using vegetation classification data. Then, the NEP was estimated by coupling the optimized CASA model, geostatistical model of soil respiration (GSMSR) and the soil respiration-soil heterotrophic respiration (R-s-R-h) relationship model. The ground observations from ChinaFLUX were used to verify the NEP estimation accuracy. The results showed that the R-2 of the optimized CASA model increased from 0.411 to 0.774, and RMSE decreased from 21.425 gC center dot m(-2)center dot month(-1) to 12.045 gC center dot m(-2)center dot month(-1), indicating that optimizing CASA model by vegetation classification data was an effective method to improve the estimation accuracy of NEP. On this basis, the spatial and temporal distribution of NEP in China was analyzed. The research indicated that the monthly variation of NEP in China was a single peak curve with summer as the peak, which generally presented the pattern of southern region > northern region > Qinghai-Tibet region > northwest region. Furthermore, from 2001 to 2016, most regions of China showed a non-significant level upward trend, but main cropland (e.g., North China Plain and Northeast Plain) and some grassland (e.g., Ngari in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Xilin Gol League in Inner Mongolia) showed a non-significant-level downward trend. The study can deepen the understanding of the distribution of carbon sources/sinks in China, and provide a reference for regional carbon cycle research.

M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) has a profound impact on urban climate and ecology, and is widely used to quantify surface urban heat islands. The spatial heterogeneity of LST is affected by natural and human factors, with seasonal differences. This study selected Dongguan, a rapidly urbanizing city in China, as an example to analyze the relationship between the spatial heterogeneity of LST in different seasons and influencing factors in six dimensions. Multi-source spatial data were combined, including Landsat images, meteorological data, digital elevation models, National Polar-Orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite nighttime light, and points of interest. The results show that spatial patterns of LST across different seasons were consistent, although there were local differences. Based on the GeoDetector model, the result indicated differences between separate effects and interactive effects, and identified the high temperature risk areas.

T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The melt onset dates (MOD) over Arctic sea ice plays an important role in the seasonal cycle of sea ice surface properties, which impacts Arctic surface solar radiation absorbed by the ice-ocean system. Monitoring interannual variations in MOD is valuable for understanding climate change. In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal variability of MOD over Arctic sea ice and 14 Arctic sub-regions in the period of 1979 to 2017 from passive microwave satellite data. A set of mathematical and statistical methods, including the Sen's slope and Mann-Kendall mutation tests, were used to comprehensively assess the variation trend and abrupt points of MOD during the past 39 years for different Arctic sub-regions. Additionally, the correlation between Arctic Oscillation (AO) and MOD was analyzed. The results indicate that: (1) all Arctic sub-regions show a trend toward earlier MOD except the Bering Sea and St. Lawrence Gulf. The East Siberian Sea exhibits a significantly earlier trend, with the highest rate of -9.45 d/decade; (2) the temporal variability and statistical significance of MOD trend exhibit large interannual differences with different time windows for most regions in the Arctic; (3) during the past 39 years, the MOD changed abruptly in different years for different sub-regions; (4) the seasonal AO has more influence on MOD than monthly AO. The findings in this study can improve our knowledge of MOD changes and are beneficial for further Arctic climate change study.

TI  - An Outpatient Management Strategy Using a Coronataxi Digital Early Warning System Reduces Coronavirus Disease 2019 Mortality
T2  - OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - This COVID-19 outpatient care system using early remote digital monitoring (symptoms, vital parameter, peripheral oxygen saturation) and home care reduced mortality 3- to 4-fold and increased hospitalization rate with shorter hospital stay, low use of intensive care, and mechanical ventilation.Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused sudden, severe strain to healthcare systems. Better outpatient management is required to save lives, manage resources effectively, and prepare for future pandemics. Methods The Coronataxi digital early warning (CDEW) system deployed in Rhein-Neckar County and Heidelberg, Germany is an outpatient care system consisting of remote digital monitoring via a mobile application, a medical doctor dashboard, and medical care delivery to COVID-19 patients in home quarantine when indicated. Patients reported their symptoms, temperature, breathing rate, oxygen saturation, and pulse via the app. This single-center cohort study compared outcomes of the population with and without using the CDEW system. The primary outcome was mortality; the secondary outcomes were hospitalization, duration of hospitalization, intensive care therapy, and mechanical ventilation. Results Mortality rate was 3- to 4-fold lower and hospitalization rate was higher in the CDEW cohort (459 patients) compared with the cohort without CDEW in the same test area and other regions (Mannheim, Karlsruhe town, Karlsruhe district, and Germany), (mortality rate: 0.65% [95% confidence interval {CI}, .13%-1.90%] versus 2.16%, 2.32%, 2.48%, 2.82% and 2.76%, respectively, P < .05 for all; hospitalization rate: 14.81% [95% CI, 11.69%-18.40%] versus 6.89%, 6.93%, 6.59%, 6.15%, and 7.22%, respectively, P < .001 for all). The median duration of hospitalization in the CDEW cohort was significantly lower compared with a national sentinel cohort (6 days [interquartile range {IQR}, 4-9.75 days] versus 10 days [IQR, 5-19 days]; Z = -3.156; P = .002). A total of 1.96% patients needed intensive care and 1.09% were mechanically ventilated. Conclusions The CDEW system significantly reduced COVID-19 mortality and duration of hospitalization and can be applied to the management of future pandemics.

TI  - Motivated reasoning when assessing the effects of refugee intake
T2  - BEHAVIOURAL PUBLIC POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Do differences in worldview ideology hinder people from objectively interpreting the effect of immigration? In an experiment with Swedish adults (n = 1015), we investigate whether people display motivated reasoning when interpreting numerical information about the effects of refugee intake on crime rate. Our results show clear evidence of motivated reasoning along the lines of worldview ideology (i.e., whether people identify themselves primarily as nationally oriented or globally oriented). In scenarios where refugee intake was associated with higher crime rate, nationally oriented people were 18 percentage points more likely to make the correct assessment compared to globally oriented people. Likewise, in scenarios where refugee intake was associated with lower crime rate, nationally oriented people were 20 percentage points less likely to make the correct assessment compared to globally oriented people. Individuals with higher numeric ability were less likely to engage in motivated reasoning, suggesting that motivated reasoning more commonly is driven by feelings and emotional cues rather than deliberate analytical processes.

TI  - Offshore Oil Platform Detection in Polarimetric SAR Images Using Level Set Segmentation of Limited Initial Region and Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Offshore oil platforms are difficult to detect due to the complex sea state, the sparseness of target distribution, and the similarity of targets with ships. In this paper, we propose an oil platform detection method in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images using level set segmentation of a limited initial region and a convolutional neural network (CNN). Firstly, to reduce the interference of sea clutter, the offshore strong scattering targets were initially detected by the generalized optimization of polarimetric contrast enhancement (GOPCE) detector. Secondly, to accurately locate the contour of targets and eliminate false alarms, the coarse results were refined using an improved level set segmentation method. An algorithm for splitting and merging the smallest enclosing circle (SMSEC) was proposed to cover the coarse results and obtain the initial level set function. Finally, the LeNet-5 CNN model was used to classify the oil platforms and ships. Experimental results using multiple sets of polarimetric SAR data acquired by RADARSAT-2 show that the performance of the proposed method, including the detection rate, the false alarm rate, and the Intersection over Union (IOU) index between the extracted ROI and the ground truth, is better than the performance of a method that combines a GOPCE detector and a support vector machine classifier.

TI  - Complete three-dimensional coseismic displacements due to the 2021 Maduo earthquake in Qinghai Province, China from Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 SAR images
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - On 22nd May 2021 (local time), an earthquake of M(s)7.4 struck Maduo county in Qinghai Province, China. This was the largest earthquake in China since the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. In this study, ascending/descending Sentinel-1 and advanced land observation satellite-2 (ALOS-2) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images were used to derive the three-dimensional (3-D) coseismic displacements of this earthquake. We used the differential interferometric SAR (InSAR, DInSAR), pixel offset-tracking (POT), multiple aperture InSAR (MAI), and burst overlap interferometry (BOI) methods to derive the displacement observations along the line-of-sight (LOS) and azimuth directions. To accurately mitigate the effect of ionospheric delay on the ALOS-2 DInSAR observations, a polynomial fitting method was proposed to optimize range-spectrum-split-derived ionospheric phases. In addition, the 3-D displacement field was obtained by a strain model and variance component estimation (SM-VCE) method based on the high-quality SAR displacement observations. Results indicated that a left-lateral fault slip with the largest horizontal displacement of up to 2.4 m dominated this earthquake, and the small-magnitude vertical displacement with an alternating uplift/subsidence pattern along the fault trace was more concentrated in the near-fault regions. Comparison with the global navigation satellite system data indicated that the SM-VCE method can significantly improve the accuracy of the displacements compared to the classical weighted least squares method, and the incorporation of the BOI displacements can substantially benefit the accuracy of north-south displacement. In addition to the displacements, three coseismic strain invariants calculated based on the strain model parameters were also investigated. It was found that the eastern and western parts of the faults suffered more significant strains compared with the epicenter region.

TI  - Large-Scale Detection of the Tableland Areas and Erosion-Vulnerable Hotspots on the Chinese Loess Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tableland areas, featured by flat and broad landforms, provide precious land resources for agricultural production and human settlements over the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). However, severe gully erosion triggered by extreme rainfall and intense human activities makes tableland areas shrink continuously. Preventing the loss of tableland areas is of real urgency, in which generating its accurate distribution map is the critical prerequisite. However, a plateau-scale inventory of tableland areas is still lacking across the Loess Plateau. This study proposed a large-scale approach for tableland area mapping. The Sentinel-2 imagery was used for the initial delineation based on object-based image analysis and random forest model. Subsequently, the drainage networks extracted from AW3D30 DEM were applied for correcting commission and omission errors based on the law that rivers and streams rarely appear on the tableland areas. The automatic mapping approach performs well, with the overall accuracies over 90% in all four investigated subregions. After the strict quality control by manual inspection, a high-quality inventory of tableland areas at 10 m resolution was generated, demonstrating that the tableland areas occupied 9507.31 km(2) across the CLP. Cultivated land is the dominant land-use type on the tableland areas, yet multi-temporal observations indicated that it has decreased by approximately 500 km(2) during the year of 2000 to 2020. In contrast, forest and artificial surfaces increased by 57.53% and 73.10%, respectively. Additionally, we detected 455 vulnerable hotspots of the tableland with a width of less than 300 m. Particular attention should be paid to these areas to prevent the potential split of a large tableland, accompanied by damage on roads and buildings. This plateau-scale tableland inventory and erosion-vulnerable hotspots are expected to support the environmental protection policymaking for sustainable development in the CLP region severely threatened by soil erosion and land degradation.

TI  - Impact of Power on Uneven Development: Evaluating Built-Up Area Changes in Chengdu Based on NPP-VIIRS Images (2015-2019)
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of uneven development studies of China, urban built-up area changes are the index of the impact of power, as the local government is the only party that is able to acquire agricultural land and convert it to construction urban land. Existing studies generally use statistical data to describe the built-up area changes and struggle to meet the requirement of an updated and inexpensive monitoring of uneven development, especially for western cities with tight budgets. Open access NPP-VIIRS (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and nighttime LST (Land Surface Temperature) data ranging from 2015 to 2019 were analyzed with a stratified SVM (Support Vector Machine) method in this study to track urban built-up area changes in Chengdu, one of the biggest cities in Western China. The SDE (Standard Deviation Ellipse) and Moran's I were then applied to evaluate the spatial variations of the built-up area changes. It was revealed that the spatial evolution of built-up area change in Chengdu over the period 2015-2019 demonstrated a "northwest-southeast" spatial expansion pattern, and the change distance in the center of gravity in 2018 and 2019 was greater than that from 2015 to 2017, which reflected the faster uneven development in 2018 and 2019 in Chengdu. The results were verified with finer resolution Landsat-8 OLI images; the high OA (all larger than 92%) and KAPPA (all larger than 0.6) values showed the accuracy of the method. The methodology proposed in this study offers a practical way for cities with tight budgets to monitor uneven development, and this study suggests a further adaption using higher-resolution remote sensing images and field experiments.

TI  - Estimating the impact of shelterbelt structure on corn yield at a large scale using Google Earth and Sentinel 2 data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A shelterbelt is an important measure to protect farmland and increase crop yield. However, how a shelterbelt structure affects crop yield is still unclear due to the difficulties accessing sufficient data from traditional field observations. To address this problem, we developed an innovative framework to estimate the shelterbelt structure and crop yield profile at a regional scale based on Google Earth and Sentinel-2 data. Using this method, we quantified the impact of the shelterbelt structure on the corn yield at 302 shelterbelts in the Northeast Plain of China. Generally, the corn yield increased (by 2.41% on average) within a distance of 1.2-15 times the tree height from the shelterbelt. Such an effect was particularly prominent within a distance of two to five times the tree height, where the corn yield was significantly increased by up to 4.63%. The structure of the shelterbelt has a significant effect on the magnitude of increase in yield of the surrounding corn. The increment of corn yields with high-, medium-high-, medium- and low-width-gap grade shelterbelt were 2.01%, 2.21%, 1.99%, and 0.91%, respectively. The medium-high grade shelterbelt achieved the largest yield increase effect. The location of the farmland relative to the shelterbelt also affected the yield, with a yield increase of 2.39% on the leeward side and 1.89% on the windward side, but it did not change the relationship between the yield increase effect and the shelterbelt structure. Our findings highlight the optimal shelterbelt structure for increasing corn yield, providing practical guidance on the design and management of farmland shelterbelts for maximizing yield.

TI  - Ocean wave parameters retrieved directly from compact Polarimetric SAR data
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - We aim to directly invert wave parameters by using the data of a compact polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (CP SAR) and validate the effectiveness of ocean wave parameter retrieval from the circular transmit/linear receive mode and pi/4 compact polarimetric mode. Relevant data from the RADARSAT-2 fully polarimetric SAR on the C-band were used to obtain the compact polarimetric SAR images, and a polarimetric SAR wave retrieval algorithm was used to verify the sea surface wave measurements. Using the data and algorithm, there is no need to estimate complex hydrodynamic modulation transfer functions, even at large radar incidence angles. First, the radar backscattering cross-sections and backscattering cross-section of the radar linearly polarized with any polarization orientation angle were calculated in the two compact polarimetric SAR modes. Then, the wave slopes along the azimuth direction and the range direction were calculated directly using CP SAR data. Finally, we obtained the slope spectrum of the wave from the estimated wave slopes along azimuth and range directions. The wave parameters extracted from the synthetic wave slope spectrum were compared with those obtained from buoy observations of the National Data Buoy Center, verifying a suitable agreement.

TI  - Breast cancer larger than 2.5 cm with tumor-free radioisotope-hot sentinel nodes has higher risk of non-hot axillary lymph node metastasis
T2  - BIOMEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is the standard axillary staging approach for early breast cancer with clinically negative axillary involvement. Adequate SLNB should include the removal of not only radioactive tracer-labeled lymph nodes (hot nodes or SLNs) but also suspicious unlabeled nodes (non-hot nodes or non-SLNs). However, the biopsy of non-hot nodes is highly dependent on the surgeons' experiences. This article aims to facilitate the surgeon's decision making by elucidating parameters that correlate with non-hot node metastasis.Methods: From 2013 to 2016, clinically node-negative (cNO) breast cancer patients receiving axillary SLNB using single Tc-99m tracer method at our institute were recruited. Patients were excluded if they had received prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Among them, cases that have at least one non-isotope-hot node biopsied were retrospectively reviewed with a particular focus on patients with pathologically negative isotope-hot SLNs. The correlation of clinicopathological data with metastasis to axillary lymph nodes and sentinel lymph nodes was analyzed with the Chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, and multivariate logistic regression. Receiver operating curve (ROC) was applied for continuous variables that predicted non-hot node metastasis; relapse-free survival (RFS) and locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS) were compared by Kaplan-Meier analysis.Results: In 632 isotope-hot SLN negative patients, T stage showed a correlation with nonisotope-hot SLN metastasis (p = 0.035, odds ratio (OR) 9.65). Tumors larger than 2.5 cm best predict non-isotope-hot SLN metastasis (area under curve (AUC) = 0.71). With a median follow up of 41.80 months, locoregional relapse-free survival was significantly worse in cases with non-hot node metastasis (66.2% vs. 69.0%, p = 0.001).Conclusion: In the setting of SLNB using single radioisotope tracer, non-hot node metastasis in cases with negative hot SLN still carries a higher locoregional recurrence rate (13.3%). For early breast cancer larger than 2.5 cm, removal of suspicious non-hot nodes should be included for a precision therapy.

TI  - Patterns and causes of winter wheat and summer maize rotation area change over the North China Plain
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland area and cropping frequency play very crucial roles in determining regional food production. However, rapid urbanization accompanied by declining surplus-agricultural labor force has greatly altered patterns of agriculture land use and cropping frequency. Due to lack of continuous cropland and cropland-use intensity maps, our knowledge is still limited to understand whether the urbanization process must have a negative effect for changes in cropland-use intensity. Herein, we took the North China Plain (NCP), both the largest winter wheat and summer maize rotation area and rapidly urbanized area in China, as the study area, and used 250 m moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer NDVI anomaly data, the correlation of NDVI time series in two neighboring years and machine learning algorithms to investigate spatiotemporal patterns and trends of cropland area and cropping frequency change over the NCP from 2000 to 2019. Results showed a significantly decreased cropland area observed since 2004 (slope = 783.8 km(2) a(-1), p < 0.01), while area of double-season cropping presented a relatively steady trend (slope = 446.9 km(2) a(-1), p = 0.335). As expected, decreased croplands were mainly occupied by urban and built-up land expansion, however, existing cropland-use intensity was yet improved. Patterns and trends of double-season cropping types were varied spatially. Particularly, the area of winter wheat and summer maize rotation presented a significantly increasing trend (slope = 3423.3 km(2) a(-1), p < 0.01). Furthermore, the respective area of winter wheat and summer maize both displayed significantly increasing trends with slope of 2953.8 and 2874.9 km(2) a (-1)(p < 0.01) in entire period. Land-use and grain subsidy policies are considered as largely responsible for this phenomenon. These satellite-observed findings highlight that positive land-use policies and managements will be helpful for profitably keeping/improving the harvest area.

TI  - A New Method for Long-Term River Discharge Estimation of Small- and Medium-Scale Rivers by Using Multisource Remote Sensing and RSHS: Application and Validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - River discharge is an important hydrological parameter of river water resources. Especially in small- and medium-scale rivers, data deficiency is the biggest problem for studies of river discharge. In recent years, remote sensing has become a rapid and convenient method to estimate river discharge. However, remote sensing images still have some difficulty generating continuous long-term river discharge. To address this problem, we developed a new method coupling the remote sensing hydrology station method (RSHS) with statistical regression downscaling, using data from optical satellites (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2), radar satellites (Sentinel-1), and un-manned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We applied this method to monitor monthly river discharge for small- and medium-scale rivers from 2016 to 2020 on Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and evaluated the accuracy of the results. The results show that (1) by applying the newly constructed method, the water body continuity index obtained by Landsat-8 increased by 7% and the average river length percentage in the channel reached 90.7%, a 40% increase; (2) there were only 10 river flow data points, on average, in the 5-year period obtained before this method was applied; after this method was applied, more than 50 river flow data points could be obtained, on average, extending the quantity of data fivefold; in addition, improper extreme values could also be avoided; (3) with better continuity of water body distribution, the images provided steadier river widths. The relative error of daily flow estimation from Landsat-8 images was reduced by 60% and the mean percentage error was reduced by one-fourth. The relative error of the multisource remote sensing composited flow was reduced by 37% with a reduction in the mean percentage error of over a half; (4) in addition, we found that when the threshold difference between water bodies and land in remote sensing images is more than 0.2, the impact of water body recognition error on flow accuracy can be ignored. This method helps to overcome the absence of remote sensing methods for the long-term estimation of flow series in small- and medium-scale rivers, improves the accuracy of remote sensing methods for calculating flow, and provides ideas for regional water resource management and utilization.

TI  - Annual forest disturbance intensity mapped using Landsat time series and field inventory data for the conterminous United States (1986-2015)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbances can have broad impact on the climate, local environment, and the regeneration of the forest ecosystem. The nature and magnitude of such impact is largely driven by disturbance intensity. In this study, by integrating field plot measurements collected by the Forest Inventory and Analysis program with time series Landsat observations, we produced the first set of annual forest disturbance intensity map products quantifying the percentage of basal area removal (PBAR) at the 30-m resolution for the conterminous United States (CONUS) from 1986 to 2015. The derived map products revealed that during the 30-year study period, the annual average PBAR values of all disturbed pixels across CONUS ranged from 66% to 70%, and the proportion of those pixels having stand-clearing disturbances ranged from 40% to 58%. High disturbance intensities were concentrated in the Southeastern states from Texas to Virginia and along the Pacific coast and the Cascades in the West. At the national scale, the annual mean PBAR and proportion of stand clearing area (PSCA) values both appeared to follow second order trajectories, with increasing trends at the beginning, decreasing trends towards the end, and turning points around 2003. Overall, there is a net increase of 2% in PBAR and 3% in PSCA from 1986 to 2015. The temporal trends of PBAR and PSCA were also investigated at state and ecoregion levels, with substantial differences found among many states and ecoregions. While states and ecoregions generally follow second order trajectories, the majority had increasing trends throughout much of the study period, reflecting higher disturbance intensities during the later years compared to earlier years. Large increase (>10%) in PBAR was seen in several states (e.g., Virginia, Arkansas, and Minnesota) and ecoregions (e.g., Northern Minnesota Wetlands); however, large decreases (>10%) in PBAR were not observed in any states, and were seen in only one ecoregion, the Blue Mountains in the southeast. The disturbance intensity maps are available from a web portal of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL-DAAC) at https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNL DAAC/2059.

TI  - Using Machine Learning to Predict Inland Aquatic CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> Concentrations and the Effects of Wildfires in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is causing an intensification in tundra fires across the Arctic, including the unprecedented 2015 fires in the Yukon-Kuskokwim (YK) Delta. The YK Delta contains extensive surface waters (similar to 33% cover) and significant quantities of organic carbon, much of which is stored in vulnerable permafrost. Inland aquatic ecosystems act as hot-spots for landscape CO2 and CH4 emissions and likely represent a significant component of the Arctic carbon balance, yet aquatic fluxes of CO2 and CH4 are also some of the most uncertain. We measured dissolved CH4 and CO2 concentrations (n = 364), in surface waters from different types of waterbodies during summers from 2016 to 2019. We used Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery to classify landcover types and area burned in contributing watersheds. We develop a model using machine learning to assess how waterbody properties (size, shape, and landscape properties), environmental conditions (O-2, temperature), and surface water chemistry (dissolved organic carbon composition, nutrient concentrations) help predict in situ observations of CH4 and CO2 concentrations across deltaic waterbodies. CO2 concentrations were negatively related to waterbody size and positively related to waterbody edge effects. CH4 concentrations were primarily related to organic matter quantity and composition. Waterbodies in burned watersheds appeared to be less carbon limited and had longer soil water residence times than in unburned watersheds. Our results illustrate the importance of small lakes for regional carbon emissions and demonstrate the need for a mechanistic understanding of the drivers of greenhouse gasses in small waterbodies.

TI  - Estimating peanut and soybean photosynthetic traits using leaf spectral reflectance and advance regression models
T2  - PLANTA
M3  - Article
AB  - One proposed key strategy for increasing potential crop stability and yield centers on exploitation of genotypic variability in photosynthetic capacity through precise high-throughput phenotyping techniques. Photosynthetic parameters, such as the maximum rate of Rubisco catalyzed carboxylation (V-c,V-max) and maximum electron transport rate supporting RuBP regeneration (J(max)), have been identified as key targets for improvement. The primary techniques for measuring these physiological parameters are very time-consuming. However, these parameters could be estimated using rapid and non-destructive leaf spectroscopy techniques. This study compared four different advanced regression models (PLS, BR, ARDR, and LASSO) to estimate V-c,V-max and J(max) based on leaf reflectance spectra measured with an ASD FieldSpec4. Two leguminous species were tested under different controlled environmental conditions: (1) peanut under different water regimes at normal atmospheric conditions and (2) soybean under high [CO2] and high night temperature. Model sensitivities were assessed for each crop and treatment separately and in combination to identify strengths and weaknesses of each modeling approach. Regardless of regression model, robust predictions were achieved for V-c,V-max (R-2 = 0.70) and J(max) (R-2 = 0.50). Field spectroscopy shows promising results for estimating spatial and temporal variations in photosynthetic capacity based on leaf and canopy spectral properties.

TI  - Combinations of Feature Selection and Machine Learning Algorithms for Object-Oriented Betel Palms and Mango Plantations Classification Based on Gaofen-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Betel palms and mango plantations are two crucial commercial crops in tropical agricultural areas. Accurate spatial distributions of these two crops are essential in tropical agricultural regional planning and management. However, the characteristics of small patches, scattering, and perennation make it challenging to map betel palms and mango plantations in complex tropical agricultural regions. Furthermore, the excessive features of very-high-resolution (VHR) imaging might lead to a reduction in classification accuracy and an increase in computation times. To address these challenges, we selected five feature selection (FS) methods (random forest means a decrease in accuracy (RFMDA), ReliefF, random forest-recursive feature elimination (RFE), aggregated boosted tree (ABT), and logistic regression (LR)) and four machine learning algorithms (random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression tree (CART), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost)). Then, the optimal combinations of FS and machine learning algorithms suited for object-oriented classification of betel palms and mango plantations were explored using VHR Gaofen-2 imagery. In terms of overall accuracy, all optimal classification schemes exceeded 80%, and the classifiers using selected features increased the overall accuracy between 1% and 4% compared with classification without FS methods. Specifically, LR was appropriate to RF and SVM classifiers, which produced the highest classification accuracy (89.1% and 89.88% for RF and SVM, respectively). In contrast, ABT and ReliefF were found to be suitable FS methods for CART and AdaBoost classifiers, respectively. Overall, all four optimal combinations of FS methods and classifiers could precisely recognize mango plantations, whereas betel palms were best depicted by using the RF-LR method with 26 features. The results indicated that combination of feature selection and machine learning algorithms contributed to the object-oriented classification of complex tropical crops using Gaofen-2 imagery, which provide a useful methodological reference for precisely recognizing small tropical agricultural patterns.

TI  - Developing High-Resolution Crop Maps for Major Crops in the European Union Based on Transductive Transfer Learning and Limited Ground Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise and timely information on crop spatial distribution over large areas is paramount to agricultural monitoring, food security, and policy development. Currently, automatically classifying crop types at a large scale is challenging due to the scarcity of ground data. Although previous studies have indicated that transductive transfer learning (TTL) is a promising method to address this problem, it performs poorly within regions where crop compositions and phenology differ largely. Here we transferred random forest classifiers trained in limited regions with diversified growing conditions and land covers to the rest of the study area where ground data are scarce, with more than 130,000 Sentinel-2 images processed using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We established the 10 m crop maps for four major crops (i.e., maize, rapeseed, winter, and spring Triticeae crops) across 10 European Union (EU) countries from 2018 to 2019. The final crop maps had a high accuracy with overall accuracy generally greater than 0.89, with user's accuracy and producer's accuracy ranging from 0.72 to 0.98. Moreover, the resulting maps were consistent with the NUTS-2 level official statistics, with R2 consistently greater than 0.9. We further analyzed the crop rotation patterns and found that the rotation intervals across these EU countries were generally at least one year. Maize was dominantly rotated with winter Triticeae crops or converted to other land covers in the following year. Rapeseed was generally grown in rotation with winter Triticeae crops, whereas the rotation patterns of winter and spring Triticeae crops were more diversified. Red Edge Position (REP) and Normalized Difference Yellow Index (NDYI) played significant roles in crop classification across the EU. This study highlights the potential of the developed TTL method for crop classification over large spatial extents where labeled data are limited and the differences in crop compositions and phenology are relatively large.

TI  - Development of a New Tropical Cyclone Strip Segment Retrieval Model for C-Band Cross-Polarized SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared with co-polarized (HH/VV) normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) backscattered from the sea surface, there is no saturation phenomenon in cross-polarized (HV/VH) NRCS when wind speed is greater than about 20 m/s, so cross-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images can be used for high wind speed monitoring. In this work, a new geophysical model function (GMF) is proposed to describe the relation of the C-band cross-polarized NRCS with wind speed and radar incidence angle. Here, sixteen ScanSAR wide mode SAR images acquired by RADARSAT-2 (RS-2) under tropical cyclone (TC) conditions and the matching wind speed data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the Stepped-Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) are collected and divided into datasets A and B. Dataset A is used for analyzing the effects of the wind field and radar incidence angle on the reference noise-removed cross-polarized NRCS, and for proposing the new GMF for each sub-swath of the SAR images, while dataset B is used to retrieve wind speed and evaluate the validity of the new GMF. The comparisons between the wind speeds retrieved by the new GMF and the collocated ECMWF and SFMR data demonstrate the excellent performance of the new GMF for wind speed retrieval. To analyze the universality of the new GMF, wind speed retrievals based on 32 Sentinel-1A/B (S-1A/B) extra-wide-swath (EW) mode images acquired under TC conditions are also compared with the collocated wind speeds measured by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer, and the retrieved wind speeds have RMSE of 3.667 m/s and a bias of 2.767 m/s. The successful applications in high wind speed retrieval of different tropical cyclones again supports the availability of the new GMF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adjuvant therapy for most sentinel-node-positive (stage IIIA) melanoma may have limited clinical benefit for older patients given the competing risk of non-cancer death. The objective of this study is to model the clinical effect and cost of adjuvant therapy in stage IIIA melanoma across age groups.STUDY DESIGN: A Markov decision analysis model simulated the overall survival of patients with resected stage IIIA melanoma treated with adjuvant therapy vs observation. In the adjuvant approach, patients are modeled to receive adjuvant pembrolizumab (BRAF wild type) or dabrafenib/trametinib (BRAF mutant). In the observation approach, treatment is deferred until recurrence. Transition variables were derived from landmark randomized trials in adjuvant and salvage therapy. The model was analyzed for age groups spanning 40 to 89 years. The primary outcome was the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one melanoma-related death at 10 years. Cost per mortality avoided was estimated using Medicare reimbursement rates.RESULTS: Projections for NNT among BRAF wild type patients increased by age from 14.71 (age 40 to 44) to 142.86 (age 85 to 89), with patients in cohorts over the age of 75 having an NNT over 25. The cost per mortality avoided ranged from $2.75 million (M) (age 40 to 44) to $27.57M (age 85 to 89). Corresponding values for BRAF mutant patients were as follows: NNT 18.18 to 333.33; cost per mortality avoided ranged from $2.75M to $54.70M.CONCLUSION: Universal adjuvant therapy for stage IIIA melanoma is costly and provides limited clinical benefit in patients older than 75 years.

TI  - Ecopolitana: A Plan of Cities, Territory, Landscape, and Ecology
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - A national green planning strategy has recently been introduced in the Italian urban planning sector, aimed at making all local initiatives undertaken nationwide consistent with each other. At a regional level, Friuli Venezia-Giulia has recently implemented a Landscaping Plan, which is of an urban planning and ecological nature at an intermediate level between national and local. This article describes the local green plan of Latisana, which has been titled Ecopolitana, given that it represents the experimental phase, at a regional level, of the possibilities offered by landscape planning and design. Specifically, it outlines the multi-disciplinary approach used, demonstrating how landscape planning can be compared to the sustainable development of cities, with specific regard to the agricultural sector. In this regard, a low-intensity cropping model is also suggested, based on the principles of agroecology and landscape ecology, which has already been implemented in the historical rural landscape of Plasencis (UD) and investigated through GIS analysis and remote sensing processes. Its aim is to be the starting point for the achievement of the goals set in the 2030 Agenda, especially Goals 13 (climate action) and 15 (life on land), given the current scarcity of agroecological infrastructures in the area of Latisana (UD) and the high percentage of soil used for intensive cropping.

TI  - Spatiotemporal monitoring of low water turbidity in Moroccan coastal lagoon using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water turbidity is a key index used to evaluate coastal water quality conditions. To determine the turbidity in large areas, remote sensing technologies have the potential to provide a cost-effective alternative to experimental methods that require extensive time for field data collection and laboratory analysis. This research focuses on the development of an accurate model to estimate and monitor low water turbidity using Sentinel-2 images and field measurements in the Sidi Moussa lagoon of the Moroccan Atlantic coast. Also, the effect of various factors was mentioned and compared qualitatively to the water turbidity variations, including spatiotemporal variation, wind, depth, geomorphology, and vegetation. Among all the regressions analyzed, the Red band was the most successful remote sensing information for water turbidity with a good validation accuracy of R2 = 0.87. ANOVA analysis showed that measured turbidity values vary differently from upstream to downstream of the lagoon. The analysis of the seasonal effect on the water turbidity using one-year multitemporal Sentinel-2 images showed that in the dry season, the mean turbidity is lower than in the rainy season. The water turbidity map derived using the developed algorithm can be used to support wetland management, the conservation of natural resources, and the selection of aquaculture areas. These results highlight the potential contribution of Sentinel-2 to map and monitor the low water turbidity.

TI  - Comparative analysis of groundwater potentiality zone using fuzzy AHP, frequency ratio and Bayesian weights of evidence methods
T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater resource management in the urban area is one of the important aspects because of growing population demand and having inadequate water supply. So, proper information is needed to manage the future urban planning for such kinds of areas. This study emphasizes groundwater potentiality zone (GPZ) assessment in the Asansol urban agglomeration (AUA) region, West Bengal, India. For this purpose, we have incorporated eight conditioning factors namely LULC, lithology, slope, elevation, rainfall, drainage density, lineaments density, and soil map using conventional and remote sensing data in GIS software. All these conditioning factors have been reclassified in ArcGIS and processed by the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), frequency ratio (FR), and Bayesian weights of evidence (BWOE) statistical methods. Then, the groundwater potential index has been formulated, and finally, GPZ maps are generated based on of selected three models. The result shows that very high area of GPZ, e.g. 9.13%, 11.62% and 7.43% are under BWOE, FR and FAHP models, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic validation curves show that FR method (AUC = 96.4%) is well obtained for GPZ in comparison with both BWOE (AUC = 83.8%) and FAHP methods (AUC = 82.9%). Therefore, this statistical method is highly recommended for the study of groundwater potential assessment and this outcome is very suitable for the groundwater resources management in future land use planning. Precautionary works in low potential areas should be given priority for long-term planning. Thus, this study can be considered as a good document for decision support in water exploitation planning and sustainable groundwater management in AUA region.

TI  - Earth observation and geospatial data can predict the relative distribution of village level poverty in the Sundarban Biosphere Reserve, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing interest in leveraging Earth Observation (EO) and geospatial data to predict and map aspects of socioeconomic conditions to support survey and census activities. This is particularly relevant for the frequent monitoring required to assess progress towards the UNs' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Sundarban Biosphere Reserve (SBR) is a region of international ecological importance, containing the Indian portion of the world's largest mangrove forest. The region is densely populated and home to over 4.4 million people, many living in chronic poverty with a strong dependence on nature-based rural livelihoods. Such livelihoods are vulnerable to frequent natural hazards including cyclone landfall and storm surges. In this study we examine associations between environmental variables derived from EO and geospatial data with a village level multidimensional poverty metric using random forest machine learning, to provide evidence in support of policy formulation in the field of poverty reduction. We find that environmental variables can predict up to 78% of the relative distribution of the poorest villages within the SBR. Exposure to cyclone hazard was the most important variable for prediction of poverty. The poorest villages were associated with relatively small areas of rural settlement (<-30%), large areas of agricultural land (>-50%) and moderate to high cyclone hazard. The poorest villages were also associated with less productive agricultural land than the wealthiest. Analysis suggests villages with access to more diverse livelihood options, and a smaller dependence on agriculture may be more resilient to cyclone hazard. This study contributes to the understanding of poverty-environment dynamics within Low-and middle-income countries and the associations found can inform policy linked to socio-environmental scenarios within the SBR and potentially support monitoring of work towards SDG1 (No Poverty) across the region.

TI  - Comparison of Ground Release and Drone-Mediated Aerial Release of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> Sterile Males in Southern Mexico: Efficacy and Challenges
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Diseases transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti, such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika, affect millions of people in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is a safe and environmentally benign method of population suppression that could be applied to reduce mosquito-transmitted disease. SIT involves the release of large numbers of sterile male insects that then compete with wild males in mating with females. The females that mate with sterile males do not produce viable offspring. To test this technique within a pilot-scale trial in a village in southern Mexico, we compared two methods for the weekly release of large numbers (approximately 85,000 males/week) of sterile males that were marked with colored powders for later identification. The number of sterile males captured in traps placed in and around houses was higher (average 5.1 males/trap/week) for sterile males released at ground level by technicians walking through the streets of the village. In contrast, traps captured an average of 2.6 males/trap/week when males were released from a small drone aircraft that flew over the village. The males released from the drone may have suffered from chilling, compaction and physical injury during the release procedure. However, the use of the drone resulted in a less aggregated distribution, was markedly quicker, released males over a larger area and required fewer technicians than ground-based releases. Some village residents also reported discomfort from the presence of large numbers of male mosquitoes when released at ground level. Future studies should focus on modifications to the handling and transport of sterile males and the design of drone release containers to avoid injury to sterile mosquitoes and to improve the efficiency of aerial releases for SIT-based suppression of Ae. aegypti in Mexico.Sterile males of Aedes aegypti were released once a week for 8 weeks to evaluate the dispersal efficiency of ground and aerial drone release methods in a rural village of 26 Ha in southern Mexico. Indoor and outdoor BG-Sentinel traps were placed in 13-16 houses distributed throughout the village. The BG traps were activated 48 h after the release of the sterile males and functioned for a 24 h period following each release. Over the 8-week period of simultaneous ground and aerial releases, an average of 85,117 +/- 6457 sterile males/week were released at ground level and 86,724 +/- 6474 sterile males/week were released using an aerial drone. The ground release method resulted in higher numbers of captured males (mean = 5.1 +/- 1.4, range 1.1-15.7 sterile males/trap) compared with the aerial release method (mean = 2.6 +/- 0.8, range 0.5-7.3 sterile males/trap) (p < 0.05). Similarly, the prevalence of traps that captured at least one sterile male was significantly higher for ground release compared to the aerial release method (p < 0.01). The lower numbers of sterile males captured in the aerial release method could be due to mortality or physical injury caused by the chilling process for immobilization, or the compaction of these insects during transport and release. However, aerial releases by a two-person team distributed insects over the entire village in just 20 min, compared to similar to 90 min of work for a five-person team during the ground release method. Ground release also resulted in higher aggregations of males and some villagers reported feeling discomfort from the presence of large numbers of mosquitoes in and around their houses. We conclude that modifications to the handling and transport of sterile males and the design of containers used to store males are required to avoid injury and to improve the efficiency of aerial releases for area-wide SIT-based population suppression programs targeted at mosquito vectors of human disease.

AB  - Sentinel-3 A&B radar altimeters yield sea surface height measurements in both a high-precision Synthetic Aperture Radar Mode (SARM), and a Pseudo-Low Resolution Mode (PLRM). We stacked repeat cycles from both missions and in both modes to compare their resolution of small seamounts. Stacking entailed removing non-geoidal heights and height errors, testing for consecutive measurements over ocean, aligning to common locations at 1 km intervals along a synthetic track, and forming a median height profile. These profiles are available from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) data repository. Global maps show that, over the oceans, the median height is usually derived from more than 49 cycles, and the typical error in an individual PLRM measurement is approximately 1.9 times greater than an individual SARM measurement. We applied a seamount detection bandpass filter to the median profiles and compared their spectral resolution to that of the Satellite for ARgos and AltiKa (SARAL) AltiKa mission. Small seamounts are similarly resolved by Sentinel-3 A&B SARM data and by the SARAL/AltiKa data.

AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) are indicators of water productivity. This research aims to analyze the characteristics of NPP and Chl-a and their relationship to pelagic fish seasons in the Banda Sea. The methods used to analyze the data are Hovmoller diagram and Pearson's correlation. The NPP data used comes from Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM) and Chl-a from Aqua MODIS satellite. The results of data analysis from January 2003-December 2020, NPP and Chl-a reached highest concentration in dry season and lowest in wet season. The highest monthly concentration occurred in August and the lowest in April and December The Banda Sea include mesotrophic waters with monthly average of NPP 429 mg C/m2/day and Chl-a 0.24 mg/m(3). Spatially (longitude and latitude) and temporally (seasonal and monthly), the high concentrations of NPP and Chl-a are found in northern and eastern parts of study area. During La Nina and El Nino, there was a change (decrease/increase) the concentration of NPP and Chl-a in dry season and transition period II. NPP and Chl-a have a high correlation and a strong linear relationship. The change of NPP concentrations temporally corresponded to change of Chl-a concentrations. Seasonal factors, La Nina and El Nino have a strong influence in influencing the variability of NPP and Chl-a concentrations. Skipjack and tuna seasons occur in transition period II, wet season and La Nina. High productivity have an effect on the flying fish season which occurs in the dry season and El Nino.

TI  - Saharan Dust and Childhood Respiratory Symptoms in Benin
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineral dust is one of the largest natural constituents of coarse particulate matter (PM10). Most of these dust emissions originate from northern Africa, and several hundred tera-grams of dust are emitted annually from this region. Previous evidence has linked dust PM10 to adverse respiratory outcomes in children. However, most of these studies have been from high-income countries (HICs) or examined dust from other regions of the world, mainly Asia. Evidence from low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs) in Africa is scarce. Respiratory infections are one of the leading causes of under-five mortality across the globe. However, there is a poignant disparity in studies examining these outcomes in children in the region where most dust is emitted. This study linked remotely sensed satellite data to a nationally representative survey to examine acute exposure to dust in children living in Benin using a time-stratified case-crossover analysis. We identified acute effects of exposure to dust and increased risk of cough in children under five. The effect of increased risk is strongest within two weeks of exposure and dissipates by four weeks. Children living in rural areas and households with lower income had a greater risk of adverse respiratory outcomes when exposed to dust. We could elucidate the specific period and conditions of increased risk for respiratory problems in children living in Benin.

AB  - One of the greatest challenges for land managers is to maintain a multitude of ecosystem services while reducing hazards posed by wildfires, insect outbreaks, and other disturbances accelerating due to climate change. In response to limited available resources and improved technical abilities, natural resource managers are increasingly using geospatial data to plan and evaluate their management actions. Large amounts of public resources are invested in research and development to improve geospatial datasets, yet there is limited knowledge about the specific data types and data characteristics that clients (e.g. land managers) prefer. Our overall objective was to investigate what geospatial data characteristics are preferred by natural resource professionals to monitor and manage forests and fuels across large landscapes. We performed an online survey and collected supplemental data at a subsequent workshop during the 2020 Operational Lidar Inventory meeting to investigate preferred data use and data characteristics of data users of the Pacific Northwest. Our online survey was completed by 69 respondents represented by managers and natural resource professionals from tribal/state, federal, academic, and industry/consulting entities. We found that metrics related to species composition, total biomass/timber volume, and vegetation height were the most preferred attributes, yet preference differed slightly by employment type. From the workshop we found that metric preferences depend upon which management priorities are central to the management application. There was preference for data with Landsat pixel-level (30 m) spatial resolution, annual temporal resolution, and at regional spatial extents. To maintain viable ecosystem services in the long term, it is important to understand the metrics and their data characteristics that are most useful. We conclude that our study is a useful way to understand (a) how to improve the data utility for the users (clients) and (b) the development and investment needs for the data developers and funders.

TI  - On the Joint Exploitation of Satellite DInSAR Measurements and DBSCAN-Based Techniques for Preliminary Identification and Ranking of Critical Constructions in a Built Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The need for widespread structural safety checks represents a stimulus for the research of advanced techniques for structural monitoring at the scale of single constructions or wide areas. In this work, a strategy to preliminarily identify and rank possible critical constructions in a built environment is presented, based on the joint exploitation of satellite radar remote sensing measurements and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The satellite measurements are represented by the displacement time series obtained through the Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) technique known as full resolution Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) approach, while the exploited AI technique is represented by the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) methodology. The DBSCAN technique is applied to the SBAS-DInSAR products relevant to the achieved Persistent Scatterers (PSs), to identify clusters of pixels corresponding to buildings within the investigated area. The analysis of the deformation evolution of each building cluster is performed in terms of velocity rates and statistics on the DInSAR measurements. Synthetic deformation maps of the areas are then retrieved to identify critical buildings. The proposed methodology is applied to three areas within the city of Rome (Italy), imaged by the COSMO-SkyMed SAR satellite constellation from ascending and descending orbits (in the time interval 2011-2019). Starting from the DInSAR measurements, the DBSCAN algorithm provides the automatic clustering of buildings within the three selected areas. Exploiting the derived deformation maps of each study area, a preliminary identification and ranking of critical buildings is achieved, thus confirming the validity of the proposed approach.

TI  - Adaptability of MODIS Daily Cloud-Free Snow Cover 500 m Dataset over China in Hutubi River Basin Based on Snowmelt Runoff Model
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming affects the hydrological characteristics of the cryosphere. In arid and semi-arid regions where precipitation is scarce, glaciers and snowmelt water assume important recharge sources for downstream rivers. Therefore, the simulation of snowmelt water runoff in mountainous areas is of great significance in hydrological research. In this paper, taking the Hutubi River Basin in the Tianshan Mountains as the study area, we used the "MODIS Daily Cloud-free Snow Cover 500 m Dataset over China" (MODIS CGF SCE) to carry out the Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) simulation and evaluated the simulation accuracy. The results showed that: (1) The SRM preferably simulated the characteristics of the average daily flow variation of the Hutubi River from May to October, from 2003-2009. The monthly total runoff was maximum in July and minimum in October. Extreme precipitation events influenced the formation of flood peaks, and the interannual variation trend of total runoff from May to October was increased. (2) The mean value of the volume difference (Dv) during the model validation period was 8.85%, and the coefficient of determination (R-2) was 0.73. In general, the SRM underestimates the runoff of the Hutubi River, and the simulation accuracy is more accurate in the normal water period than in the high-water period. (3) By analyzing MODIS CGF SCE from 2003 to 2009, areas above 3200 m elevation in the Hutubi River Basin were classified as permanent snow areas, and areas below 3200 m were classified as seasonal snow areas. In October, the snow area in the Hutubi River Basin gradually increased, and the increase in snow cover in the permanent snow area was greater than that in the seasonal snow area. The snowmelt period was from March to May in the seasonal snow area and from May to early July in the permanent snow area, and the minimum snow cover was 0.7%.

TI  - Unsupervised Building Extraction from Multimodal Aerial Data Based on Accurate Vegetation Removal and Image Feature Consistency Constraint
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate building extraction from remotely sensed data is difficult to perform automatically because of the complex environments and the complex shapes, colours and textures of buildings. Supervised deep-learning-based methods offer a possible solution to solve this problem. However, these methods generally require many high-quality, manually labelled samples to obtain satisfactory test results, and their production is time and labour intensive. For multimodal data with sufficient information, extracting buildings accurately in as unsupervised a manner as possible. Combining remote sensing images and LiDAR point clouds for unsupervised building extraction is not a new idea, but existing methods often experience two problems: (1) the accuracy of vegetation detection is often not high, which leads to limited building extraction accuracy, and (2) they lack a proper mechanism to further refine the building masks. We propose two methods to address these problems, combining aerial images and aerial LiDAR point clouds. First, we improve two recently developed vegetation detection methods to generate accurate initial building masks. We then refine the building masks based on the image feature consistency constraint, which can replace inaccurate LiDAR-derived boundaries with accurate image-based boundaries, remove the remaining vegetation points and recover some missing building points. Our methods do not require manual parameter tuning or manual data labelling, but still exhibit a competitive performance compared to 29 methods: our methods exhibit accuracies higher than or comparable to 19 state-of-the-art methods (including 8 deep-learning-based methods and 11 unsupervised methods, and 9 of them combine remote sensing images and 3D data), and outperform the top 10 methods (4 of them combine remote sensing images and LiDAR data) evaluated using all three test areas of the Vaihingen dataset on the official website of the ISPRS Test Project on Urban Classification and 3D Building Reconstruction in average area quality. These comparative results verify that our unsupervised methods combining multisource data are very effective.

TI  - Linking Micropollutants to Trait Syndromes across Freshwater Diatom, Macroinvertebrate, and Fish Assemblages
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological quality of freshwater ecosystems is endangered by various micropollutants released into the environment by human activities. The cumulative effects of these micropollutants can affect the fitness of organisms and populations and the functional diversity of stream ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the relationships between the joint toxicity of micropollutants and trait syndromes. A trait syndrome corresponds to a combination of traits that could occur together in communities due to the trait selection driven by exposure to these micropollutants. Our objectives were to (i) identify trait syndromes specific to diatom, macroinvertebrate, and fish assemblages and their responses to exposure, taking into account four micropollutant types (mineral micropollutants, pesticides, PAHs, and other organic micropollutants) and nine modes of action (only for pesticides), (ii) explore how these syndromes vary within and among the three biological compartments, (iii) investigate the trait categories driving the responses of syndromes to micropollutant exposure, and (iv) identify specific taxa, so-called paragons, which are highly representative of these syndromes. To achieve these objectives, we analyzed a dataset including the biological and physico-chemical results of 2007 sampling events from a large-scale monitoring survey routinely performed in French wadeable streams. We have identified five (diatoms), eight (macroinvertebrates), and eight (fishes) trait syndromes, either positively or negatively related to an increasing toxicity gradient of different clusters of micropollutant types or modes of action. Our analyses identified several key trait categories and sets of paragons, exhibiting good potential for highlighting exposure by specific micropollutant types and modes of action. Overall, trait syndromes might represent a novel and integrative bioassessment tool, driven by the diversity of trait-based responses to increasing gradients of micropollutant toxic cocktails.

TI  - New Model of the Rupture Surface of the <i>M<sub>w</sub></i>=7.8 Near Islands Aleutian Earthquake of July 17, 2017 Based on SAR Interferometry
T2  - IZVESTIYA-PHYSICS OF THE SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - A new model of the rupture surface of the M-w = 7.8 Near Islands Aleutian earthquake that occurred on July 17, 2017 in the region of the Commander Islands of the Aleutian Island Arc is presented. The model is based on the displacement fields obtained from Sentinel-1B radar images for the Bering and Mednyi Islands. Among the interferogram pairs calculated from the images covering the period from June 17 to August 28, 2017, the most reliable displacement fields were obtained from the image pair July 11-July 23, 2017. These displacements include coseismic and part of postseismic displacements. The inversion also involved the displacement data recorded by the GNSS GPS stations on the Kamchatka Peninsula, Commander Islands, and the closest to the epicenter Aleutian Islands. Due to the fact that displacements substantially exceeding the noise level were only recorded at two GPS stations on the Bering and Shemya islands, the use of the InSAR data substantially refines the existing earthquake source models. In our models, a seismic rupture zone is approximated by a plane with a length of 370 km along the strike and 19 km along the dip, respectively. Three models have been calculated: a model of uniform displacement across the entire rupture surface; a model in which the rupture surface is divided strikewise into five elements; and a model divided into four elements along the strike and into two levels along the dip, with a total of eight elements. All models demonstrate the same displacement type-right-lateral strike-slip faulting with a relatively small thrust component. According to the constructed models, the displacements in some areas of the rupture surface are slightly smaller than average but, generally, they occur all over the source zone. The models based on satellite geodetic data and on waveform inversion largely agree. The discrepancy between the models utilizing different data types can probably be due to the fact that seismological data characterize the part of the source process that is accompanied by the generation of seismic waves. Surface displacements estimated from InSAR data do not characterize the main event alone but also contain contributions that may reflect various creep processes. The period covered by the radar images also includes the foreshocks with magnitudes up to 6.3 as well as more than 100 aftershocks with magnitudes between 4 to 5.5. Perhaps that is why the displacements obtained in our models are more uniformly distributed over the 370-km rupture surface than in the models based on the waveform analysis.

T2  - COSMIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we consider disturbances in the airglow of the Earth's upper atmosphere caused by a launch of the Yamal-601 satellite on May 30, 2019. For this purpose, we used the data acquired with an optical system of the Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences (ISTP SB RAS). The measurements were carried out at the Geophysical Observatory (GPO) of the ISTP SB RAS (similar to 52 degrees N, similar to 103 degrees E) with a complex of optical instruments-a whole-sky camera, a spectrograph, and a Fabry-Perot interferometer. According to the data of the KEO Sentinel camera, an extensive area of airglow was observed along the flightpath; it appeared approximately 2-4 min after the spacecraft's passage over the GPO and existed for similar to 20 min. A transversal scale of the spacecraft's flightpath is estimated approximately as 95-110 km if the spontaneous-emission altitude is assumed to be at similar to 150 km (and it is about 190-220 km if the spontaneous-emission altitude is similar to 300 km). We discuss the mechanisms that may result in forming the observed area of airglow, including the mechanisms connected with the physical and chemical interaction of fuel products with atmospheric components and the influence of propagation of a shock wave or short-period internal gravitational waves. Probable causes of the delay observed in appearing the airglow after the spacecraft's flyby are analyzed.

AB  - Scholarship on Christian-Muslim relations often notes that the Islamic Mary (Maryam) is not seen as a figure in her own right but rather is viewed as ancillary to Jesus/Isa. This paper will argue that the Islamic Mary is a protagonist, as the Qur'an defines her role, extols her spiritual state, and places her within its worldview. Maryam fits within the Qur'an's larger framework of a daughter who is both similar to and distinct from the Christian Mary.

T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Smart farming is a farming system that integrates information technology (IT) to ensure that plants, animals, and soil receive what they have for optimum health and production. The goal of smart farming is to provide the profitability, viability, and security of the ecosystem. Agriculture is indeed a challenge in drought-prone areas with limited water supplies. Using remote sensing data such as UAV images is exceptionally sufficient to detect the in-field variability of soil and plant properties in dry soil. UAV images produce faster and more accurate NDVI with higher resolution. New technologies such as IoT, artificial intelligence, global positioning systems (GPS), and big data analysis are promising tools to optimise farmed operations and inputs to enhance productivity and reduce losses and returns of information. Finally, the fundamental dry land agricultural issues under study, their applications, specific models, and sources were examined. Besides, the study compares standard deep learning algorithms with the results of classification or regression accuracy.

TI  - "Amazonizing" world cities through paintings: Indigenous cosmovisions encountering urban centers for the lost balance
T2  - ALTERNATIVE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, Peruvian Amazonian Indigenous artists are receiving unprecedented attention as they exhibit their paintings in galleries worldwide. In this context, I focus on three paintings of world cities as Havana, Miami, and Paris by Bora artist Brus Rubio (born 1984). Unfortunately, these paintings have not been analyzed from Indigenous studies and Amazonian Indigenous cosmologies. I argue that the paintings manifest Rubio's Amazonian resilience by offering a new imaginary of the urban space associated with Indigenous cosmologies, which facilitates the preservation of Indigenous lands, rights, and traditions for the globalized world. In this vision, the Western and the Indigenous worldview find harmony when the human and the non-human encounter and celebrate a balanced cohabitation as in Bora's narratives. This is his way of amazonizing the world or claiming his right to world citizenship and proposing a new understanding of globalization.

TI  - Quantitative remote sensing of forest ecosystem services in sub-Saharan Africa's urban landscapes: a review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - A dearth of information on urban ecosystem services in the past decades has led to little consolidation of such information for informed planning, decision-making and policy development in sub-Saharan African cities. However, the increasing recognition of the value of urban ecological processes and services as well as their contribution to climate change adaptation and mitigation has recently become an area of great research interest. Specifically, the emerging geospatial analytical approaches like remote sensing have led to an increase in the number of studies that seek to quantify and map urban ecosystem services at varying scales. Hence, this study sought to review the current remote sensing trends, challenges and prospects in quantifying urban ecosystem services in sub-Saharan Africa cities. Literature shows that consistent modelling and understanding of urban ecosystem services using remotely sensed approaches began in the 1990s, with an average of five publications per year after around 2010. This is mainly attributed to the approach's ability to provide fast, accurate and repeated spatial information necessary for optimal and timely quantification and mapping of urban ecosystem services. Although commercially available high spatial resolution sensors (e.g. the Worldview series, Quickbird and RapidEye) with higher spatial and spectral properties have been valuable in providing highly accurate and reliable data for quantification of urban ecosystem services, their adoption has been limited by high image acquisition cost and small spatial coverage that limits regional assessment. Thus, the newly launched sensors that provide freely and readily available data (i.e. Landsat 8 and 9 OLI, Sentinel-2) are increasingly becoming popular. These sensors provide data with improved spatial and spectral properties, hence valuable for past, current and future urban ecosystem service assessment, especially in developing countries. Therefore, the study provides guidance for future studies to continuously assess urban ecosystem services in order to achieve the objectives of Kyoto Protocol and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD +) of promoting climate-resilient and sustainable cities, especially in developing world.

TI  - Evaluation of targeted axillary dissection following neoadjuvant therapy for a patient with node-positive breast cancer as initial experience in Ain Shams University Hospitals
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Surgical treatment of the axilla in breast cancer shows a lot of advances over the past decade. Patients with clinically positive lymph node (LN) have a great chance to turn by neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) to be negative clinically and radiologically, and so surgical management in those patients is still a field of research. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in such patients showed a high false-negative rate (FNR), which was decreased by the use of immunohistochemistry and if a clip was placed in the node with biopsy-confirmed metastases, with removal of that node with the SLNB which is called targeted axillary dissection (TAD). Objectives To determine the accuracy of TAD, ensuring that surgical removal of clipped nodes would improve accuracy of nodal staging in patients with initial positive LN. Patients and methods A prospective study including 30 patients with cT1_3(a-c) cN1-2, M0 breast cancer post-NACT, who had shown downstaging of their nodal status (N0) as proven by clinical examination and ultrasound assessment, who were recommended for TAD removing the clipped LN added to the SLNB at Ain Shams University Hospital, between March 2020 and March 2021. Results Out of the 29 patients, two patients showed residual disease in the clipped LN in a frozen section; one of them revealed positive SLN as well. Completion of axillary lymph node (ALN) dissection was done regardless of the frozen section results to detect any residual nodal disease, which revealed negative results in all cases and that indicate the success of TAD in removing the diseased LN and decreasing the FNR of SLN alone. Twenty-four patients with clipped ALNs were stained with patent blue dye while five patients with clipped ALNs were not stained by patent blue dye. Therefore, SLN was unable to detect clipped ALNs, which were previously positive in five patients, so there is a FNR of 17.2% if SLNB was done alone. So, with targeted procedure we can decrease the FNR of sentinel study and accurately assess the neoadjuvant effect on diseased LNs. Conclusion TAD is a feasible technique for axillary management in patients with clinically N1 breast cancer, who receive NACT and turned to N0. Preoperative clipped node guide wire localization significantly improves the identification rate of the clipped node and decreases the FNR of SLNB alone.

TI  - Urban Infill Development: A Strategy for Saving Peri-Urban Areas in Developing Countries (the Case Study of Ardabil, Iran)
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The overall objective of this study was to investigate urban infill development policies as a good solution to counteract urban sprawl and protect the peri-urban area of Ardabil in Northwestern Iran. In this context, we used a mixed methodology (two quantitative methods). Landsat imagery, including a patchy Landsat ETM+ for the year 2000 and a Landsat 8 for the year 2020, was used to map and assess land use to investigate sprawl and land-use change, and ArcGIS was used to investigate the potential for infill development in this city. The results show that between 2000 and 2020, 967 hectares of peri-urban land was lost to urban expansion. CA-Markov projections also showed that 452 hectares will be lost by 2030. The assessment of the city's internal capacity for infill development showed that more than 999 hectares of land within the city are suitable to support this strategy and provide the land needed for urban expansion over the next decade. Finally, the study of the city's master plan, which applies to all Iranian cities, discovered that there is a lack of adequate outlook regarding the amount of land available for future urban development, leading to misuse of urban land and urban sprawl in Iranian cities, suggesting that an infill development strategy could be a good way to address this issue.

TI  - Evaluating Field Theory as a Valid Theoretical Construct to Inform Christian Leadership Praxis
T2  - CHRISTIAN EDUCATION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Leadership is a popular area of study but appears to be locked within a never-ending loop of retroactive behavioral analysis. Field theory offers modern leadership study an opportunity to break this cycle, potentially unlocking previously undiscovered relationships within the leadership phenomenon. The authors evaluate field theory for Christian application via Trentham's principle of inverse consistency. After reorientation toward a Christian worldview, field theory is demonstrated as a valid theoretical construct to inform Christian leadership praxis.

TI  - Forest Fire Assessment Using Remote Sensing to Support the Development of an Action Plan Proposal in Ecuador
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide, forest fires exert effects on natural ecosystems, contributing to economic/human losses, health effects, and climate change. Spectral indices are an essential tool for monitoring and analyzing forest fires. These indices make it possible to evaluate the affected areas and help mitigate possible future events and reduce damage. The case study addressed in this work corresponds to the Cerro of the Guadual community of La Carolina parish (Ibarra, Ecuador). This work aims to evaluate the degree of severity and the recovery of post-fire vegetation, employing the multitemporal analysis of spectral indices and correlating these with the climatological aspects of the region. The methodological process was based on (i) background information collection, (ii) remote sensing data, (iii) spectral index analysis, (iv) multivariate analysis, and (v) a forest fire action plan proposal. Landsat-8 OLI satellite images were used for multitemporal analysis (2014-2020). Using the dNDVI index, the fire's severity was classified as unburned and very low severity in regard to the areas that did not regenerate post-fire, which represented 10,484.64 ha. In contrast, the areas classified as high and very high severity represented 5859.06 ha and 2966.98 ha, respectively. In addition, the dNBR was used to map the burned areas. The high enhanced regrowth zones represented an area of 8017.67 ha, whereas the moderate/high-severity to high-severity zones represented 3083.72 ha and 1233.49 ha, respectively. The areas with a high severity level corresponded to native forests, which are challenging to recover after fires. These fire severity models were validated with 31 in situ data from fire-starting points and they presented an accuracy of 99.1% in the high severity category. In addition, through the application of principal component analysis (PCA) with data from four meteorological stations in the region, a bimodal behavior was identified corresponding to the climatology of the area (dry season and rainy season), which is related to the presence of fires (in the dry season). It is essential to note that after the 2014 fire, locally, rainfall decreased and temperatures increased. Finally, the proposed action plan for forest fires made it possible to define a safe and effective evacuation route to reduce the number of victims during future events.

TI  - Assessing Spatial Variation of PBL Height and Aerosol Layer Aloft in Sao Paulo Megacity Using Simultaneously Two Lidar during Winter 2019
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents the use of two elastic lidar systems to assess the horizontal variation of the PBL height (PBLH) and aerosol layer aloft in the Sao Paulo Megacity. These two lidars performed simultaneous measurements 10.7 km apart in a highly urbanized and relatively flat area of Sao Paulo for two winter months of 2019. The results showed that the PBLH differences display diurnal variation that depends on the PBL during daytime growth phases. Cloud and sea breeze effects control most of PBLH variation. In the absence of cloud and sea breeze, the maximum difference (similar to 300 m) occurs in the rapid development stage and is due to topographic effects. When the PBL approaches its maximum daily value, it tends to level off with respect to the topography. In addition, it was presented a method that combines elastic lidar (to detect an aerosol layer) and satellite data (to classify such a layer from Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Aerosol Index (AI) information) for the detection of biomass burning events. This methodology demonstrated that the variations caused by Biomass Burning in AOD and AI enable both the detection of aerosol plumes originating from biomass burning and the identification of their origin.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Sawa Lake's Physical Parameters between (1985-2020) and Drought Investigations Using Landsat Imageries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Sawa located in Southwest Iraq is a unique natural landscape and without visible inflow and outflow from its surrounding regions. Investigating the environmental and physical dynamics and the hydrological changes in the lake is crucial to understanding the impact of hydrological changes, as well as to inform planning and management in extreme weather events or drought conditions. Lake Sawa is a saltwater lake, covering about 4.9 square kilometers at its largest in the 1980s. In the last decade, the lake has dried out, shrinking to less than 75% of its average size. This contribution focuses on calculating the bank erosion and accretion of Lake Sawa utilizing remote sensing data captured by Landsat platforms (1985-2020). The methodology was validated using higher-resolution Sentinel imagery and field surveys. The outcomes indicated that the area of accretion is significantly higher than erosion, especially of the lake's banks in the far north and the south, in which 1.31 km(2) are lost from its surface area. Further analysis of especially agricultural areas around the lake have been performed to better understand possible reasons causing droughts. Investigations revealed that one possible reason behind droughts is related to the rapid increase in agriculture areas surrounding the lake. It has been found that the agriculture lands have expanded by 475% in 2020 compared to 2010. Linear regression analysis revealed that there is a high correlation (69%) between the expanding of agriculture lands and the drought of Lake Sawa.

TI  - Characterization of the on-orbit response versus scan angle for Terra MODIS SWIR bands in Collection 7
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Terra and Aqua platforms has 20 reflective solar bands (0.4 to 2.1 mu m), for which the on-orbit detector gain changes are tracked using the on-board solar diffuser (SD) and SD stability monitor. SD and lunar observation data, supplemented by Earth-view (EV) observations for some bands, are used to characterize the scan-mirror response versus scan angle (RVS). The short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands (1.2 to 2.1 mu m) have issues, such as electronic crosstalk and an out-of-band optical leak from the thermal bands, which complicate the use of the Moon for reliably characterizing the on-orbit RVS. Before Collection 7 (C7), the pre-launch RVS was deemed sufficient for both Aqua and Terra MODIS SWIR bands throughout the missions. However, recent studies have found that the RVS behavior does change with time in some SWIR bands, up to 2% and 1% for Terra MODIS bands 5 and 26, respectively. We assess the residual RVS effects present in the current MODIS calibration at desert sites and deep convective clouds (DCC). Due to the large uncertainties caused by the water vapor absorption effects from desert sites, especially for band 26 (1.375 mu m), EV observations from DCCs are chosen to characterize the on-orbit RVS behavior for the SWIR bands. A time-dependent RVS characterization method for the SWIR bands is described and assessed by comparing the results with Collection 6.1 (C6.1) Level 1B (L1B) reflectance products. This new algorithm will be used in the upcoming C7 L1B reprocessing for Terra MODIS, providing more stable and accurate SWIR band reflectance data over time and across the scan range compared with the C6.1 results. For Aqua MODIS SWIR bands, performance evaluations with desert and DCC data indicate stable performance, so the pre-launch RVS will continue to be used in C7.

TI  - Compact Multimode Quadrifilar Helical Antenna for GNSS-R Applications
T2  - IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, a compact circularly polarized (CP) multimode antenna for global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) is presented. The design comprises two quadrifilar helical antennas (QHAs), each fed with a ground coplanar wave-guide (GCPW) and quarter wavelength power divider (QWPD) integrated feed. A hybrid staircase-shaped (SSR) QHA radial is proposed, and it is formed by serially arranging several vertical and diagonal elements. The electric field lines from the vertical elements converge constructively to radiate with the axis normal. Besides, the circular spatial offsets between the adjacent diagonal and vertical elements induce a 90 degrees delay in the field radiated. This hybrid shape launches an unprecedented theory facilitating normal mode of operation (MOOp) in QHA and generates CP over broad elevations and azimuths (0 degrees <theta < 80 degrees and 0 degrees <phi< 360 degrees). Besides, the portto-port 90 degrees spatial offset and the GCPW architecture yield high isolation (>20 dB). Unlike conventional GNSS-R antennas, this compact (170.5 mm x 132 mm) configuration operates in axial and normal mode, offers a broad beam coverage (237 degrees), minimizes pattern interference between the two QHAs upon gap-free stacking, and ensures high delay accuracy in the remote sensing data computed. Additionally, it supports proficient (efficiency >0.9) multiconstellation remote sensing. The design prototype was fabricated and measured, and the measurements agreed well with the simulations.

TI  - Open Innovation Using Satellite Imagery for Initial Site Assessment of Solar Photovoltaic Projects
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the responses to the fight against climate change by the developing world has been the large-scale adoption of solar energy. The adoption of solar energy in countries like India is propagating mainly through the development of energy producing photovoltaic farms. The realization of solar energy producing sites involves complex decisions and processes in the selection of sites whose knowhow may not rest with all the stakeholders supporting (e.g., banks financing the project) the industry value chain. In this article, we use the region of Bangalore in India as the case study to present how open innovation using satellite imagery can provide the necessary granularity to specifically aid in an independent initial assessment of the solar photovoltaic sites. We utilize the established analytical hierarchy process over the information extracted from open satellite data to calculate an overall site suitability index. The index takes into account the topographical, climatic, and environmental factors. Our results explain how the intervention of satellite imagery-based big data analytics can help in buying the confidence of investors in the solar industry value chain. Our study also demonstrates that open innovation using satellites can act as a platform for social product development.

TI  - A Self-Trained Model for Cloud, Shadow and Snow Detection in Sentinel-2 Images of Snow- and Ice-Covered Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Screening clouds, shadows, and snow is a critical pre-processing step in many remote-sensing data processing pipelines that operate on satellite image data from polar and high mountain regions. We observe that the results of the state-of-the-art Fmask algorithm are not very accurate in polar and high mountain regions. Given the unavailability of large, labeled Sentinel-2 training datasets, we present a multi-stage self-training approach that trains a model to perform semantic segmentation on Sentinel-2 L1C images using the noisy Fmask labels for training and a small human-labeled dataset for validation. At each stage of the proposed iterative framework, we use a larger network architecture in comparison to the previous stage and train a new model. The trained model at each stage is then used to generate new training labels for a bigger dataset, which are used for training the model in the next stage. We select the best model during training in each stage by evaluating the multi-class segmentation metric, mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), on the small human-labeled validation dataset. This effectively helps to correct the noisy labels. Our model achieved an overall accuracy of 93% compared to the Fmask 4 and Sen2Cor 2.8, which achieved 75% and 76%, respectively. We believe our approach can also be adapted for other remote-sensing applications for training deep-learning models with imprecise labels.

TI  - Approach towards a Holistic Management of Research Data in Planetary Science-Use Case Study Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the planetary sciences, the volume of remote sensing data and derived research products has been continuously increasing over the last five decades. The amount and complexity of data require growing sophistication in data analysis, data management, and data provision targeted at a growing research community. In order to efficiently manage and facilitate the reuse of research data and to provide stable and long-term access, sustainable research data solutions are needed. We here present a prototype for structured storage, management, and visualisation of planetary research data and discuss the particular benefits, as well as challenges of such an information system for data management, for establishing data references by cross-linking information, and for improving the visibility of data products. The prototype is a co-development of two research institutes of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and is based on two components: the Earth Observation Center (EOC) Geoservice, which constitutes an infrastructure providing data storage and management capabilities, as well as an interface compliant with collaborative and web-based data access services, and the Environmental and Crisis Information Systems (UKIS), a framework for the implementation of geoscientific web applications.

TI  - Spatiotemporal characterization of land cover and degradation in the agreste region of Pernambuco, Brazil, using cloud geoprocessing on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The characterization of land use and land cover (LULC), as well as the identification of its degradation factors, are necessary for the preservation of the agroecosystem and help in decision making. Therefore, the objective of this research was to evaluate the spatial-temporal dynamics of vegetation cover and soil degradation in the Agreste mesoregion of the state of Pernambuco, through the leaf area index (LAI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and pasture vegetation cover index (PVC) from Sentinel-2/MSI images from the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) sensor and, develop software for automatic cloud processing on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Were used 8 Sentinel-2/MSI satellite images (2017-2020), processed in GEE, to obtain the SAVI, LAI, and PVC. A pluviometric survey was carried out for the month before the registration of each image, from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS). The images were subjected to descriptive statistics and principal component analysis (PCA). The months that comprise the highest rainfall exceeded the accumulated 100 mm. The SAVI values ranged from 0.2 to 0.80, of the LAI between 0 and 3 m(2) m(-2) (with small regions greater than 3). Regions of the low spectral response of LAI and SAVI, correlated with areas of low rainfall in the study region. The total variance showed 100% representativeness and significance of the data for the accumulated in PC2, this denotes how significant the correlations between SAVI, LAI, and PVC are. Because of the new climatic and environmental scenarios, this study presented a relevant contribution to characterizing the potential areas in soil degradation processes, mainly in the Caatinga biome. Between the years 2017-2020, there was the occurrence of soil degradation processes in the Agreste region of Pernambuco, where the state's dairybasin islocated, caused by poor management, use of arable land, and long periods of drought.

TI  - Utility of geospatial techniques in estimating dam water levels: insights from the Katrivier Dam
T2  - WATER SA
M3  - Article
AB  - To achieve informed integrated water resource management and sustainability, an understanding of the quantity of water available for use within a spatial and temporal context is needed. This study was consequently focused on the estimation of water levels with the use of geospatial techniques. The availability of water data is a significant challenge, especially for smaller dams used by farmers. The lack of consistent water data in turn poses a problem by limiting the estimation of the overall water availability in water strategy models. This challenge is attributed to the cost of modeling all available water resources and the lack of complete records of all available water resources, as some small dams are not officially registered. This paper provides a simple protocol that can be implemented to reliably derive water levels for dams that are yet to be registered or accounted for, using the Katrivier Dam as a case study. Three main datasets were used which enabled the calculation of water levels - a 12.5 m digital elevation model, Sentinel-2 optical images, and water data from the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS), as in-situ data. The resulting water level values were derived using a proposed model that includes two correction factors, k and s. The results obtained showed that the estimated water levels from the model proposed in this paper are analogous with those observed by the DWS. Therefore, the proposed method can serve as an additional cost-effective method in water accounting procedures as it requires less expensive equipment than alternatives such as bathymetric methods.

TI  - Influence of Primary Care Provider Type on Chronic Pain Management Among Veterans
T2  - JOURNAL OF NURSING REGULATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Chronic pain disproportionately impacts veterans and is often treated in primary care, where physician shortages in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) healthcare system are well documented. Nurse practitioners (NPs) may represent a solution to the care shortage; however, concerns of NP opioid overprescribing have led to NP practice and prescribing restrictions in individual VHA facilities and at the state level. Little is known regarding the prescribing patterns of NPs and physician assistants (PAs) for veterans with chronic pain in the VHA. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare opioid and non-opioid prescribing patterns of physicians, NPs, and PAs for chronic pain patients at VHA centers. Methods: We used data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Survey of Healthcare Experience of Patients and Corporate Data Warehouse from October 2015 to September 2016. Patient medical records for the year were analyzed by provider type (physician, NP, or PA) for differences in providers' rates of prescribing opioid and non-opioid medications, as well as characteristics of the opioid prescriptions (e.g., high daily morphine milligram equivalent [90 MME/day] dose, long-term opioid therapy [90 days]). Results: Medical records of a total of 39,936 patients were included. In FY 2016, 55% of patients received one opioid prescription, whereas 83.8% received one non-opioid prescription. Compared to patients of NPs and PAs, patients of physicians had higher odds of receiving opioid (vs. NPs: OR = 1.13, p < 0.01; vs. PAs: OR = 1.16, p < 0.01) and non-opioid prescriptions (vs. NPs: OR=1.08, p = 0.02; vs. PAs: OR=1.20, p < 0.01) after adjusting for patient characteristics. There were no differences in high MME/day dose (p = 0.59) or long-term opioid therapy (p = 0.99). Conclusion: In a national sample of veterans with chronic pain, NPs and PAs did not have higher odds of opioid prescribing. Concerns of NP or PA opioid overprescribing may be addressed by considering evidence that patients of these providers are not at higher odds of receiving an opioid prescription.

AB  - Objective: Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) mapping is increasingly used as an alternative to lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer. There is, however, limited data regarding the clinical outcome and survival after SLN mapping. The aim of the study was to determine long-term outcome data in endometrial cancer patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery and SLN mapping. Study design: Retrospective cohort study of 108 patients with primary endometrial cancer who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery and sentinel lymph node mapping using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) algorithm with near-infrared fluorescence detection of indocyanine green for endometrial cancer, from November 20th 2012 to January 1st 2016 at St. Olav's Hospital in Norway. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival. Secondary endpoints were overall survival and treatment complications. Results: Among 108 patients operated in accordance with the SLN algorithm, 17 (16%) had lymph node metastases. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered on indication endometrial cancer to 36 (33%) of the patients. After a median follow up of 75 months (range 61-98), five (4.6%) patients had recurrence, and three patients had died from the disease. Four of the patients who had recurrence had lymph node metastasis at diagnosis. The 5year recurrence-free survival was 95.4% (95% CI, 91.5 - 99.3). The 5-year disease-specific survival was 97.2% (95% CI, 94.1 - 100.3). The 5-year overall survival was 92.6% (95% CI, 87.7 - 97.5). Peripheral neuropathy after chemotherapy was the most common complication (9.3%), followed by lower limb lymphedema (2%) and postoperative hernia (2%). Conclusion: The present study demonstrated excellent oncologic outcome and low long-term treatment complication rate in patients treated according to the SLN algorithm more than five years after diagnosis.
