TI  - Gradient Boosting and Linear Regression for Estimating Coastal Bathymetry Based on Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thousands of vessels travel around the world every day, making the safety, efficiency, and optimization of marine transportation essential. Therefore, the knowledge of bathymetry is crucial for a variety of maritime applications, such as shipping and navigation. Maritime applications have benefited from recent advancements in satellite navigation technology, which can utilize multi-spectral bands for retrieving information on water depth. As part of these efforts, this study combined deep learning techniques with satellite observations in order to improve the estimation of satellite-based bathymetry. The objective of this study is to develop a new method for estimating coastal bathymetry using Sentinel-2 images. Sentinel-2 was used here due to its high spatial resolution, which is desirable for bathymetry maps, as well as its visible bands, which are useful for estimating bathymetry. The conventional linear model approach using the satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) ratio (green to blue) was applied, and a new four-band ratio using the four visible bands of Sentienl-2 was proposed. In addition, three atmospheric correction models, Sen2Cor, ALOCITE, and C2RCC, were evaluated, and Sen2Cor was found to be the most effective model. Gradient boosting was also applied in this study to both the conventional band ratio and the proposed FVBR ratio. Compared to the green to blue ratio, the proposed ratio FVBR performed better, with R-2 exceeding 0.8 when applied to 12 snapshots between January and December. The gradient boosting method was also found to provide better estimates of bathymetry than linear regression. According to findings of this study, the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, sediments, and atmospheric dust do not affect the estimated bathymetry. However, tidal oscillations were found to be a significant factor affecting satellite estimates of bathymetry.

TI  - Evaluation of the Bias in the Use of Clear-Sky Compared with All-Sky Observations of Monthly and Annual Daytime Land Surface Temperature
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived observations of land surface temperature (LST) are being utilized in a growing number of land surface studies; however, these observations are generally obtained from optical sensors that exclude cloudy observations of the land surface. The impact of using only clear-sky observations of land surfaces on monthly and annual estimates of daytime LST over two U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) sites was evaluated over five years with daily in situ LST observations available for all-sky (clear and cloudy) conditions. The in situ LST observations were obtained for the nominal daytime observations associated with the MODIS sensors on board the Terra and Aqua satellites and were identified as all-sky or clear-sky conditions by utilizing cloud information provided with the MODIS LST product. Both monthly/annual mean and monthly/annual maximum values of daytime LST were significantly different when only clear-sky values were utilized, in comparison with all-sky values. Monthly averaged differences between the mean clear- and all-sky daytime LST (dLST) values ranged from -0.1 degrees +/- 1.5 degrees C for January to 5.6 degrees +/- 1.8 degrees C for May. Annually averaged dLST values, over the five years of the study, were 2.58 degrees C, and differences between the maximum values of clear- and all-sky daytime LST values were -1.03 degrees C. Although significant differences between mean annual clear-sky and all-sky daytime LST values were more frequent than differences observed for the annual maximum daytime LST values, the results suggest that the exclusive use of either mean or maximum clear-sky daytime LST values is not advisable for applications in which the use of daytime all-sky LST values would be more applicable.

TI  - Small-Scale Analysis of Characteristics of the Wildland-Urban Interface Area of Thessaloniki, Northern Greece
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past few years, the continuous expansion of urban development has created mixed forested, agricultural, and urban areas. These areas are called the wildland-urban interface (WUI), and they are characterized by increased human activities and land-use conversion, and they usually contribute to a high risk of wildfire occurrence. In the case of the peri-urban areas of Thessaloniki city, an effort was made to map, classify, and describe this wildland-urban interface, using Sentinel-2 satellite images of the area and very large scale orthophotos (VLSO) for the human settlements. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) was applied to classify landcover, combined with analysis of field data. The results showed that the WUI area in the city of Thessaloniki appears to the north and east of the city and covers an area of 2203.98 ha. The main characteristics affected by the ecological conditions of this area are the building (or human infrastructure) density, type, and the structure of forest vegetation. Human population pressure was found to be greatly differentiated between WUI areas belonging to different municipalities, the most affected was the municipality of Thessaloniki. A set of fire prevention silvicultural treatments are suggested for mitigating the fire danger in the area, accompanied by appropriate human awareness actions and the involvement of the local society. These measures include the reduction in crown bulk density and increase in crown base height through pruning (at least to 1/3 of total tree height), and low thinning, aiming to ensure that tree crowns of mature Pinus brutia trees are not in contact with one another. Both in the young P. brutia forest and the evergreen vegetation areas, thinning, pruning, and vegetation clearing is recommended adjusted according to each ecosystem.

TI  - Assessment of COVID-19 Impacts on Air Quality in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, Based on Terrestrial and Sentinel-5P TROPOMI Data
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims to reveal the impact of three sequential strict-lockdowns of COVID-19 measures on the air pollutants including NO2, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5 in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia during November 2020-February 2021 based on air quality network and satellite data. Based on measurements of automatic air quality sites in Ulaanbaatar, we found a substantial decrease in NO2 (up to 45%), PM10 (72%), and PM2.5 (59%) compared to the same periods in the previous five years. On the other hand, up to a threefold increase in SO2 concentration was seen. Compared to 2015-2020, the number of days exceeding the national air quality standard level of NO2 decreased by 55% during November 2020-February 2021. A similar trend was observed for PM10 and PM2.5 (30% and 14%, respectively). Conversely, days exceeding the national air quality standard level of SO2 increased by 58%. The third strict-lockdown exhibited significant reductions in pollutant concentrations. The percentage exceeding the national standard level for NO2, PM10, and PM2.5 constituted 23%, 50%, and 67% during the lockdown periods while it was 89%, 84%, and 91%, respectively, for the same periods in the previous five years. Even though Sentinel 5P-TROPOMI data do not fully reflect the above findings, they add valuable insights into the spatial pollution pattern during strict-lockdown and non-lockdown periods. The study demonstrates that measures taken during the strict-lockdown periods clearly influenced the values of daily patterns of NO2, PM10, and PM2.5 concentrations. On the contrary, it is important to note that SO2 concentration increased during the last two winter months after 2019.

TI  - Drought Severity and Frequency Analysis Aided by Spectral and Meteorological Indices in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past two decades, severe drought has been a recurrent problem in Iraq due in part to climate change. Additionally, the catastrophic drop in the discharge of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and their tributaries has aggravated the drought situation in Iraq, which was formerly one of the most water-rich nations in the Middle East. The Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) also has catastrophic drought conditions. This study analyzed a Landsat time-series dataset from 1998 to 2021 to determine the drought severity status in the KRI. The Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI2) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) were used as spectral-based drought indices to evaluate the severity of the drought and study the changes in vegetative cover, water bodies, and precipitation. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Spatial Coefficient of Variation (CV) were used as meteorologically based drought indices. According to this study, the study area had precipitation deficits and severe droughts in 2000, 2008, 2012, and 2021. The MSAVI2 results indicated that the vegetative cover decreased by 36.4%, 39.8%, and 46.3% in 2000, 2008, and 2012, respectively. The SPI's results indicated that the KRI experienced droughts in 1999, 2000, 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2021, while the southeastern part of the KRI was most affected by drought in 2008. In 2012, the KRI's western and southern parts were also considerably affected by drought. Furthermore, Lake Dukan (LD), which lost 63.9% of its surface area in 1999, experienced the most remarkable shrinkage among water bodies. Analysis of the geographic distribution of the CV of annual precipitation indicated that the northeastern parts, which get much more precipitation, had less spatial rainfall variability and more uniform distribution throughout the year than other areas. Moreover, the southwest parts exhibited a higher fluctuation in annual spatial variation. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between MSAVI2, SPI, NDWI, and agricultural yield-based vegetation cover. The results also revealed that low precipitation rates are always associated with declining crop yields and LD shrinkage. These findings may be concluded to provide policymakers in the KRI with a scientific foundation for agricultural preservation and drought mitigation.

TI  - Crop Water Productivity Mapping and Benchmarking Using Remote Sensing and Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Scarce water resources present a major hindrance to ensuring food security. Crop water productivity (WP), embraced as one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is playing an integral role in the performance-based evaluation of agricultural systems and securing sustainable food production. This study aims at developing a cloud-based model within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) based on Landsat -7 and -8 satellite imagery to facilitate WP mapping at regional scales (30-m resolution) and analyzing the state of the water use efficiency and productivity of the agricultural sector as a means of benchmarking its WP and defining local gaps and targets at spatiotemporal scales. The model was tested in three major agricultural districts in the Lake Urmia Basin (LUB) with respect to five crop types, including irrigated wheat, rainfed wheat, apples, grapes, alfalfa, and sugar beets as the major grown crops. The actual evapotranspiration (ET) was estimated using geeSEBAL based on the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) methodology, while for crop yield estimations Monteith's Light Use Efficiency model (LUE) was employed. The results indicate that the WP in the LUB is below its optimum targets, revealing that there is a significant degree of work necessary to ameliorate the WP in the LUB. The WP varies between 0.49-0.55 (kg/m(3)) for irrigated wheat, 0.27-0.34 for rainfed wheat, 1.7-2.2 for apples, 1.2-1.7 for grapes, 5.5-6.2 for sugar beets, and 0.67-1.08 for alfalfa, which could be potentially increased up to 80%, 150%, 76%, 83%, 55%, and 48%, respectively. The spatial variation of the WP and crop yield makes it feasible to detect the areas with the best and poorest on-farm practices, thereby facilitating the better targeting of resources to bridge the WP gap through water management practices. This study provides important insights into the status and potential of WP with possible worldwide applications at both farm and government levels for policymakers, practitioners, and growers to adopt effective policy guidelines and improve on-farm practices.

TI  - ReFuse: Generating Imperviousness Maps from Multi-Spectral Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - FUTURE INTERNET
M3  - Article
AB  - Continual mapping and monitoring of impervious surfaces are crucial activities to support sustainable urban management strategies and to plan effective actions for environmental changes. In this context, impervious surface coverage is increasingly becoming an essential indicator for assessing urbanization and environmental quality, with several works relying on satellite imagery to determine it. However, although satellite imagery is typically available with a frequency of 3-10 days worldwide, imperviousness maps are released at most annually as they require a huge human effort to be produced and validated. Attempts have been made to extract imperviousness maps from satellite images using machine learning, but (i) the scarcity of reliable and detailed ground truth (ii) together with the need to manage different spectral bands (iii) while making the resulting system easily accessible to the end users is limiting their diffusion. To tackle these problems, in this work we introduce a deep-learning-based approach to extract imperviousness maps from multi-spectral Sentinel-2 images leveraging a very detailed imperviousness map realised by the Italian department for environment protection as ground truth. We also propose a scalable and portable inference pipeline designed to easily scale the approach, integrating it into a web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) application. As a result, even non-expert GIS users can quickly and easily calculate impervious surfaces for any place on Earth (accuracy > 95%), with a frequency limited only by the availability of new satellite images.

TI  - Discrimination of Rock Units in Karst Terrains Using Sentinel-2A Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We explored the potential incorporation of Sentinel-2A imagery for rock unit determination in the Croatian karst region dominated by carbonate rocks. The various lithological units are potential sources of both stone aggregates and dimension stone, and their spatial distribution is of high importance for mineral resource management. The presented approach included the preprocessing and processing of existing analog data (geological maps), Sentinel-2A satellite images and the United States Geological Survey spectral indices, all in combination with ground truth data. Geological mapping and digital processing of legacy maps using the K-means and random forest algorithm reduced the spatial error of the geometry of geological boundaries from 100 m and 300 m to below 100 m. The possibility of discriminating individual lithological units based on spectral analysis and discriminant function analysis was also examined, providing a tool for evaluating the geological potential for mineral resources. Despite the challenges posed by the lithological homogeneity of karst terrain, the results of this study show that the use of spectral signature data derived from Sentinel-2A satellite images can be successfully implemented in such terrains for the enhancement of existing geological maps and mineral resources exploration.

TI  - Influence of the Accuracy of Chlorophyll-Retrieval Algorithms on the Estimation of Solar Radiation Absorbed in the Barents Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work is to study the influence of errors on the accuracy of estimation of absorbed solar energy in the visible spectral range in the water column of the Barents Sea occurring due to the use of various satellite ocean color chlorophyll-retrieval algorithms. The estimates of absorbed energy are based on data obtained during field experiments conducted in various parts of the Barents Sea in June-August 2021, as well as on modeling results. A new regional algorithm for evaluation of chlorophyll concentration in the Barents Sea (B22) is presented as a data source. This algorithm provides more accurate estimates compared to the standard MODIS algorithm under conditions of coccolithophore bloom. Comparing of the results of hydro-optical modeling to the data of shipboard hydro-optical measurements made it possible to validate the obtained data and confirmed the correctness of the selected models. Furthermore, we calculate the parameters of underwater light fields and the absorbed thermal energy in the visible spectral range in the seawater column, showing that differences in the chlorophyll concentration due to the accuracy of satellite bio-optical algorithms (30-50%) have little effect on the vertical distribution of solar energy absorbed in the seawater column.

TI  - Topsoil clay content mapping in croplands from Sentinel-2 data: Influence of atmospheric correction methods across a season time series
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies demonstrated the capability of Sentinel-2 (S2) data to estimate topsoil properties and highlighted the sensitivity of these estimations to soil surface conditions depending on the S2 acquisition date. These estimations are based on Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance images, obtained from Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance values using Atmospheric Correction (AC) methods. AC of optical satellite imagery is an important pre-processing stage before estimating biophysical variables, and several AC methods are currently operational to perform such conversion. This study aims at evaluating the sensitivity of topsoil clay content estimation to atmospheric corrections along an S2 time series. Three AC methods were tested (MAJA, Sen2Cor, and LaSRC) on a time series of eleven Sentinel-2 images acquired over a cultivated region in India (Karnataka State) from February 2017 to June 2017. Multiple Linear Regression models were built using clay content analyzed from topsoil samples collected over bare soil pixels and corresponding BOA reflectance data. The influence of AC methods was also analysed depending on bare soil pixels selections based on two spectral indices and several thresholds: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI below 0.25, 0.3 and 0.35) and the combination of NDVI (below 0.3) and Normalized Burned Ratio 2 index (NBR2 below 0.09, 0.12 and 0.15) for masking green vegetation, crop residues and soil moisture.First, this work highlighted that regression models were more sensitive to acquisition date than to AC method, suggesting that soil surface conditions were more influent on clay content estimation models than variability among atmospheric corrections. Secondly, no AC method outperformed other methods for clay content estimation, and the performances of regression models varied mostly depending on the bare soil pixels selection used to calibrate the regression models. Finally, differences in BOA reflectance among AC methods for the same acquisition date led to differences in NDVI and NBR2, and hence in bare soil coverage identification and subsequent topsoil clay content mapping coverage. Thus, selecting S2 images with respect to the acquisition date appears to be a more critical step than selecting an AC method, to ensure optimal retrieval accuracy when mapping topsoil properties assumed to be relatively stable over time.

TI  - Variability of Sea Ice from 2008 to 2019 in the Bohai and Northern Huanghai Sea, China and the Relationship with Climatic Factors
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice has important effect on the marine ecosystem and people living in the surrounding regions in winter. However, the understanding on changes of sea ice in the Bohai and northern Huanghai Sea (BNHS), China is still limited. Based on the images from Visible and InfraRed Radiometer (VIRR) onboard Chinese second generation polar-orbit meteorological series satellites FY-3A/B/C, the sea ice areas in the BNHS were extracted from December 2008 to March 2019, the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of sea ice and the relationship between sea ice area and climatic factors were analyzed, then a preliminary sea ice forecast model based on the climatic factors was developed. The results showed that sea ice area in the BNHS in each December was relatively small and rather high sea ice occurrence probability appeared in the offshore areas in Liaodong Bay and northern Huanghai Sea. The sea ice area in January or February each year was the largest, and sea ice occurred in most of areas in Liaodong Bay and northern Huanghai Sea with rather high probability and in some areas in Bohai Bay and Laizhou Bay with relatively high probability. However, the sea ice area in each March was the smallest, and sea ice was even melted completely occasionally, hence with relatively low occurrence probability in Liaodong Bay. As for the inter-annual variability of sea ice in the BNHS during the research period, the sea ice area was largest in winter 2010/11 and smallest in winter 2014/15, and annual sea ice area presented a decreasing trend. The atmospheric temperature, western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH), Asia polar vortex (APV), Asian monsoon circulation (AMC) and Eurasian monsoon circulation (EMC) were very important climatic factors for sea ice formation and they had significant correlations with sea ice area. Therefore, a preliminary sea ice forecast model was constructed by using eight climatic factors including western Pacific subtropical high area index (WPSHAI), western Pacific subtropical high intensity index (WPSHII), western Pacific subtropical high northern boundary position index (WPSHNBPI), Asia polar vortex area index (APVAI), Asian zonal circulation index (AZCI), Asian meridional circulation index (AMCI), Eurasian zonal circulation index (EZCI) and mean minimum atmospheric temperature (MMAT). The model was confirmed to have a robust forecast effect by using F-test and validated sample data. The results are useful for monitoring sea ice with remote sensed data and forecasting sea ice conditions by climatic indices.

TI  - Integrated Remote Sensing and 3D GIS Methodology to Strengthen Public Participation and Identify Cultural Resources
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of territorial development, the construction of specific and competitive local resources is based on the identification of their intangible and material elements but also their links to the region. The connection between these links and local heritage, along with their spatial dimension, makes the active participation of residents in the entire process necessary. This paper presents the application of an integrated methodology that fosters the involvement of residents in a process of collecting relevant implicit information, with the assistance of experts, in order to identify cultural resources from different historical periods. This methodology is based on the synergy of three components: interdisciplinarity, local community participation, and the use of non-destructive cutting-edge technologies (remote sensing, UAV mapping, ground-penetrating radar, and 3D GIS interactive representations). The use of various methods and tools is organized in successive phases, the objective being the substantial participation of residents through 3D interactive visualisations of their area. 3D representations enable the activation of local memory in conjunction with the collection of information regarding location, type, and traces of cultural resources. The entire process validates the implicit information that guides the competent authorities and experts in the further search for more precise information, both from satellite data (high-resolution images) and images from subsurface mapping (ground-penetrating radar).

TI  - Trends in River Total Suspended Sediments Driven by Dams and Soil Erosion: A Comparison Between the Yangtze and Mekong Rivers
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global river systems are experiencing rapid changes in sediment transport under growing anthropogenic and climatic stresses. However, the response of sediment discharge to the coupled influence of anthropogenic and natural factors and the associated impacts on the fluvial geomorphology in the Yangtze and Mekong rivers are not comprehensively assessed. Here, we recalibrated a seamless retrieval algorithm of the total suspended sediment (TSS) concentrations using in situ data and concurrent satellite data sets to analyze spatiotemporal patterns of the TSS concentrations in the lower Yangtze and Mekong rivers. Combined with soil erosion rates estimated by the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation for the past 20 years, we examined the contributions of different factors to TSS trends. The results show that TSS concentrations in the Yangtze River decreased from 0.47 g L-1 in 2000 to 0.23 g L-1 in 2018 due to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), especially in the Jingjiang reach, with a declining magnitude of 0.3 g L-1 (similar to 56%) since the TGD began operating. The Mekong River experienced increasing TSS concentration trends upstream and decreasing trends downstream from 2000 to 2018, possibly attributed to increased upstream soil erosion and decreased downstream water discharge. Declining TSS concentrations in both rivers have driven varying degrees of river channel erosion over the past two decades. This study investigated long-term changes in the TSS concentrations and soil erosion in the Yangtze and Mekong rivers, and the results provide baseline information for the sustainable development of river sediment delivery.

TI  - Detection of Peanut Leaf Spot Disease Based on Leaf-, Plant-, and Field-Scale Hyperspectral Reflectance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf spot (LS) caused by Cercosporidium personatum is one of the most harmful peanut diseases in the late growth stage and severely affects the yield of peanuts. Hyperspectral disease detection technology is efficient, objective, and accurate and is suitable for large-scale crop management practices. To establish a multi-scale spectral index (SI) with high accuracy and stability for the detection of peanut LS disease, the spectral reflectance of different disease severity levels at leaf, plant, and field scales was collected, and the difference in wavelength caused by disease severity was analyzed using the mean, variance, and dispersion matrix of hyperspectral reflectance. Meanwhile, the feature weights at different scales were obtained using Relief-F, and the average feature weights identified 540, 660, and 770 nm as multi-scale sensitive wavelengths. Three new SIs were constructed by combining single, ratiometric, and normalized wavelengths. The new SIs were compared and analyzed with 35 commonly used SIs by correlation analysis and M-statistic values, and 6 SIs were significantly correlated with disease severity levels and had good separability. Finally, k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and multinomial logistic regression (MLR) were used to evaluate the ability of the above SIs to detect LS severity. The results showed that the leaf spot multi-scale spectral index (LS-MSSI) constructed in this study was superior to the other SIs and obtained high accuracy at different scales simultaneously. At the leaf and plant scales, the MLR obtained high accuracy, with the overall accuracy (OA) reaching 93.77% and 92.50% and Kappa reaching 91.59% and 89.97%, respectively. At the field scale, the KNN obtained high accuracy, with the OA and Kappa reaching 90.29% and 87.04%, respectively. The LS-MSSI proposed in this study has high accuracy, stability, and robustness in the detection of LS severity at multiple scales, providing a technical basis and scientific guidance for the detection and precise management of peanuts.

TI  - Anisotropic spin Hall and spin Nernst effects in bismuth semimetal
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bismuth is an archetypal semimetal with gigantic spin-orbit coupling and it has been a major source material for the discovery of seminal phenomena in solid state physics for more than a century. In recent years, spin current transports in bismuth have also attracted considerable attention. In this paper, we theoretically study both spin Hall effect (SHE) and spin Nernst effect (SNE) in bismuth, based on relativistic band structure calculations. First, we find that there are three independent tensor elements of spin Hall conductivity (SHC) () and spin Nernst conductivity (SNC) (), namely, , and , where . We calculate all the elements as a function of the Fermi energy. Second, we find that all SHC elements are large, being & SIM;1000 (PLANCK CONSTANT OVER TWO PI/e)(S/cm). Furthermore, because of its low electrical conductivity, the spin Hall angles are gigantic, being & SIM;20 %. Third, all the calculated SNC elements are also pronounced, being comparable to that [& SIM;0.13 (PLANCK CONSTANT OVER TWO PI/e)(A/m-K)] of gold. Finally, in contrast to Pt and Au where = , the SHE and SNE in bismuth are anisotropic, i.e., . In particular, SNC is highly anisotropic, and differ even in sign. Also, such anisotropy in SHE can be significantly enhanced by either electron or hole doping. Consequently, the Hall voltages due to the inverse SHE and inverse SNE from the different conductivity elements could cancel each other and thus result in a small spin Hall angle if polycrystalline samples are used, which may explain why the measured spin Hall angles ranging from nearly 0 to 25 % have been reported. We hope that these interesting findings would stimulate further experiments on bismuth using highly oriented single crystal specimens.

TI  - Lake Changes in Inner Mongolia over the Past 30 Years and the Associated Factors
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are important water resources in Inner Mongolia and play essential roles in flood storage, water source maintenance, aquaculture, water volume regulation, and the regional ecological balance. However, most lakes in Inner Mongolia have undergone significant shrinkage over the past few decades. In order to quantify the lake changes in Inner Mongolia and analyze the factors associated with these changes, information about 546 lakes in seven years (1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018) was retrieved using 30 m resolution Landsat images taken of the entire region over 29 years (1989-2018). In addition, water census data from 2010 and 1:250,000 geological maps were used as references. The analysis revealed that the lakes in Inner Mongolia exhibited rapidly decreasing trends during the past three decades, with both the area and the number of lakes decreasing to a minimum by 2010. The number of lakes with areas of >1 km(2) decreased from 384 in 1990 to 301 in 2018; the total area of lakes with individual areas of >1 km(2) decreased from 4905.74 km(2) in 1990 to 4187.45 km(2) in 2018. With respect to the lake distribution among different geomorphological units, the analysis revealed that the lake shrinkage was most pronounced on the West Liaohe Plain, followed by the northern Inner Mongolian Plateau. Furthermore, in relation to different climatic zones, lake shrinkage primarily occurred in the mid-temperate semi-arid zone, wherein the lake area decreased by 776.6 km(2). We hypothesize that the changes in the lake number and area in Inner Mongolia resulted from the combined effects of natural conditions and anthropogenic disturbances; possibly, lake shrinkage was mainly driven by the rising temperature and decreasing precipitation, along with water regulation projects, agricultural irrigation, mining development, and population growth that also had non-negligible effects on the lakes.

TI  - A Refined Model for Quad-Polarimetric Reconstruction from Compact Polarimetric Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a special dual-polarization technique, compact polarimetric (CP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has already been widely studied and installed on some spaceborne systems due to its superiority to quad-polarization; moreover, quad-pol information can be explored and reconstructed from the CP SAR data. In this paper, a refined model is proposed to estimate the quad-pol information for the CP mode. This model involves CP decomposition, wherein the polarization degree is introduced as the volume scattering model parameter. Moreover, a power-weighted model for the co-polarized coherence coefficient is proposed to avoid the iterative approach in pseudo-quad-pol information reconstruction. Experiments were implemented on the simulated Gaofen-3 and ALOS-2 data collected over San Francisco. Compared with typical reconstruction models, the proposed refined model shows its superiority in estimating the quad-pol information. Furthermore, terrain classification experiments using a complex-value convolutional neural network (CV-CNN) were performed on AIRSAR Flevoland data to validate the reconstruction effectiveness for classification applications.

TI  - Greater Greening Trend in the Loess Plateau of China Inferred from Long-Term Remote Sensing Data: Patterns, Causes and Implications
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Loess Plateau (LP) of China, which is the pilot region of the "Grain to Green Project" (GGP), has received worldwide attention due to its significant changes in the natural and social environment. Investigation of vegetation variations in response to climate change and human activities is vital for providing support for further ecological restoration planning. This paper aimed to monitor vegetation dynamics of the LP with trend comparisons of various vegetation types, disentangle the effects of climate variations and ecological programs on vegetation variations, and detect the consistency of vegetation variations. More specifically, vegetation dynamics during 1982-2015 were analyzed using the Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping System third-generation Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GIMMS NDVI3g) data with the application of Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) and Hurst Exponent. The results showed that: (1) Vegetation manifested a significant greening trend (0.013 decade(-1) p < 0.01) in the LP during 1982-2015, and a breakpoint (BP) was detected in 1999, which was the beginning of the GGP. Interannual NDVI after the BP (ABP) showed more than 3.5 times greening rates compared to the NDVI before the BP (BBP). (2) Human activities dominated the vegetation variation (accounted for 59.46% of vegetation variation), among which reforestation and land-use change with steep slopes (i.e., >= 15 degrees) lead to the greening after the GGP implementation. (3) Future trends should be noticed in the Forest Zone and Forest-Grass Zone, where the greening trends tend to slow down or even reverse in the southern LP. The long-term GIMMS NDVI3g time series and multiple geospatial analyses of this study might facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms of vegetation variations for the assessment of the large restoration programs in fragile ecosystems.

TI  - Combining Cloud Properties from <i>CALIPSO</i>, <i>CloudSat</i>, and MODIS for Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) Shortwave Broadband Irradiance Computations: Impact of Cloud Vertical Profiles
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud vertical profile measurements from the CALIPSO and CloudSat active sensors are used to improve top-of-atmosphere (TOA) shortwave (SW) broadband (BB) irradiance computations. The active sensor measurements, which occasionally miss parts of the cloud columns because of the full attenuation of sensor signals, surface clutter, or insensitivity to a certain range of cloud particle sizes, are adjusted using column-integrated cloud optical depth derived from the passive MODIS sensor. Specifically, we consider two steps in generating cloud profiles from multiple sensors for irradiance computations. First, cloud extinction coefficient and cloud effective radius (CER) profiles are merged using available active and passive measurements. Second, the merged cloud extinction profiles are constrained by the MODIS visible scaled cloud optical depth, defined as a visible cloud optical depth multiplied by (1 - asymmetry parameter), to compensate for missing cloud parts by active sensors. It is shown that the multisensor-combined cloud profiles significantly reduce positive TOA SW BB biases, relative to those with MODIS-derived cloud properties only. The improvement is more pronounced for optically thick clouds, where MODIS ice CER is largely underestimated. Within the SW BB (0.18-4 mu m), the 1.04-1.90-mu m spectral region is mainly affected by the CER, where both the cloud absorption and solar incoming irradiance are considerable. Significance StatementThe purpose of this study is to improve shortwave irradiance computations at the top of the atmosphere by using combined cloud properties from active and passive sensor measurements. Relative to the simulation results with passive sensor cloud measurements only, the combined cloud profiles provide more accurate shortwave simulation results. This is achieved by more realistic profiles of cloud extinction coefficient and cloud particle effective radius. The benefit is pronounced for optically thick clouds composed of large ice particles.

TI  - Investigating Terrestrial Water Storage Response to Meteorological Drought in the Canadian Prairies
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Canadian Prairies region is considered a climate change hot spot due to the extreme drought events and their impacts on water resources. The overall goal of this research is to understand the linkage between meteorological droughts and Total Water Storage (TWS) variations in the Canadian Prairies. To achieve this goal, a diversified database is collected and analyzed by geostatistical tools and cross-wavelet transform approach. It concerns a multitude of climatic data (four CMIP6 multi-model datasets) and satellite observations (GRACE data). The results indicate that: (1) the models overestimate the precipitation rate over the Canadian Prairies, and the Norwegian Earth System Model version 2 (NorESM2-LM) is the most suitable model for the context of the Canadian Prairies; (2) Sen's slope estimator of annual rainfall can reach -2.5 mm/year/year, with a decreasing magnitude of trends in the NE to SW direction; (3) the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Modified China-Z Index (MCZI) demonstrate that, in the past, most of the climatological years were near normal with some extremely dry years (1952, 2000, 2003, and 2015) and one extremely wet year (1960); (4) the projections in the far future indicate an increase in the number of extremely dry years (2037, 2047, 2080, 2089, and 2095); (5) the combined analysis of GRACE-derived TWS and drought indices show the direct impact of the meteorological drought periods on the water resources. The TWS values decreased from 23 cm in 2002 to -54 cm in 2020, indicating a significant water reserve decline in the region. The results of this study are expected to provide a valuable perspective to understand the dynamic of hydrosystems in a climate change context in the Canadian Prairies.

TI  - Monitoring Mesoscale to Submesoscale Processes in Large Lakes with Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery: The Case of Lake Geneva
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As in oceans, large-scale coherent circulations such as gyres and eddies are ubiquitous features in large lakes that are subject to the Coriolis force. They play a crucial role in the horizontal and vertical distribution of biological, chemical and physical parameters that can affect water quality. In order to make coherent circulation patterns evident, representative field measurements of near-surface currents have to be taken. This, unfortunately, is difficult due to the high spatial and temporal variability of gyres/eddies. As a result, few complete field observations of coherent circulation in oceans/lakes have been reported. With the advent of high-resolution satellite imagery, the potential to unravel and improve the understanding of mesoscale and submesoscale processes has substantially increased. Features in the satellite images, however, must be verified by field measurements and numerical simulations. In the present study, Sentinel-1 SAR satellite imagery was used to detect gyres/eddies in a large lake (Lake Geneva). Comparing SAR images with realistic high-resolution numerical model results and in situ observations allowed for identification of distinct signatures of mesoscale gyres, which can be revealed through submesoscale current patterns. Under low wind conditions, cyclonic gyres manifest themselves in SAR images either through biogenic slicks that are entrained in submesoscale and mesoscale currents, or by pelagic upwelling that appears as smooth, dark elliptical areas in their centers. This unique combination of simultaneous SAR imagery, three-dimensional numerical simulations and field observations confirmed that SAR imagery can provide valuable insights into the spatial scales of thus far unresolved mesoscale and submesoscale processes in a lake. Understanding these processes is required for developing effective lake management concepts.

TI  - Remote sensing sea ice classification based on DenseNet and heterogeneous data fusion
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most remote sensing sea ice classification methods use single-source remote sensing data, such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and optical remote sensing data. SAR data contain rich sea ice texture information, but the data are relatively single, making it difficult to distinguish detailed sea ice categories. Optical data include abundant spatial-spectral information, but they are often affected by clouds, fog, and severe weather. Hence, given the limitations of single-source data, the remote sensing sea ice classification accuracy cannot be further improved. A sea ice classification method based on deep learning and multisource remote sensing data fusion is proposed utilizing an improved densely connected convolutional neural network (DenseNet) to mine and fuse the multilevel features of sea ice. According to the characteristics of SAR data and optical data, a dual-branch network structure based on an improved DenseNet is employed for feature extraction, and a squeeze-and-excitation attention mechanism is introduced to weight the fusion features to further enhance the feature weights that can effectively distinguish different types of sea ice. The fully connected network is used to perform the deep fusion of features and classify sea ice. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, two sets of sea ice data are utilized for sea ice classification. The experimental results show that the proposed method fully excavates and fuses the multilevel characteristics of heterogeneous data using the improved dual-branch network structure, leverages the complementary characteristics of SAR data and optical data, significantly increases the sea ice classification accuracy, and effectively improves the influence of cloud cover on the sea ice classification accuracy. Compared with the typical single-source data classification method and other heterogeneous data fusion classification methods, the proposed method achieves superior overall classification accuracy (98.49% and 98.58%).

TI  - Habitat Prediction of Northwest Pacific Saury Based on Multi-Source Heterogeneous Remote Sensing Data Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate habitat prediction is important to improve fishing efficiency. Most of the current habitat-prediction studies use the single-source datasets and the sequence model based on single-source datasets, which, to a certain extent, limits the further improvement of prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a habitat-prediction method based on the multi-source heterogeneous remote-sensing data fusion, using product-level remote-sensing data and L1B-level original remote-sensing data. We designed a heterogeneous data feature extraction model based on a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Long and Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), and we designed a decision-fusion model based on multi-source heterogeneous data feature extraction. In the habitat prediction for the Northwest Pacific Saury, the mean R-2 of the model reaches 0.9901 and the RMSE decreases to 0.01588 in the model validation experiment. It is significantly better than the results of other models, with the single datasets as input. Moreover, the model performs well in the generalization experiment because we limited the prediction error to less than 8%. Compared with the single-source sequence network model in the existing literature, the proposed method in this paper solves the problem of ineffective fusion caused by the differences in the structure and size of heterogeneous data through multilevel feature fusion and decision fusion, and it deeply explores the features of remote-sensing fishery data with different data structures and sizes. It can effectively improve the accuracy of fishery prediction, proving the feasibility and advancement of using multi-source remote-sensing data for habitat prediction. It also provides new methods and ideas for future research in the field of habitat prediction.

TI  - Crop Water Requirements with Changing Climate in an Arid Region of Saudi Arabia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is critical for a country's population growth and economic expansion. In Saudi Arabia (SA), agriculture relies on groundwater, seasonal water, desalinated water, and recycled water due to a lack of surface water resources, a dry environment, and scanty rainfall. Estimating water consumption to plan crop water requirements (CWR) in changing environments is difficult due to a lack of micro-level data on water consumption, particularly in agricultural systems. High-resolution satellite data combined with environmental data provides a valuable tool for computing the CWR. This study aimed to estimate the CWR with a greater spatial and temporal resolution and localized field data and environmental variables. Obtaining this at the field level is appropriate, but geospatial technology can produce repeatable, time-series phenomena and align with environmental data for wider coverage regions. The CWR in the study area has been investigated through two methods: firstly, based on the high-resolution PlanetScope (PS) data, and secondly, using the FAO CROPWAT model v8.0. The analysis revealed that evapotranspiration (ETo) showed a minimum response of 2.22 mm/day in January to a maximum of 6.13 mm/day in July, with high temperatures (42.8). The humidity reaches a peak of 51%, falling to a minimum in June of 15%. Annual CWR values (in mm) for seven crops studied in the present investigation, including date palm, wheat, citrus, maize, barley, clover, and vegetables, were 1377, 296, 964, 275, 259, 1077, 214, respectively. The monthly averaged CWR derived using PS showed a higher correlation (r = 0.83) with CROPWAT model results. The study was promising and highlighted that such analysis is decisive and can be implemented in any region by using Machine Learning and Deep Learning for in-depth insights.

Algorithms were developed after performing a series of polynomial regressions of field and Sentinel -2A satellite data and then select the highest correlation coefficient. The dominant mangrove is Rhizophora apiculata. The field mangrove leaf chlorophyll-a content ranged from 14.03-15.77 mg.ml- 3, while the estimated chlorophyll-a from algorithm is in the range of 13.714-16 mg.ml-3. Calculated field mangrove biomass is in the range of 66.31-85.05 tons.ha-1, while the value from algorithms is in the range of 51-90 tons.ha-1. The highest biomass and carbon storage is in the trunks. This study produces the algorithm of mangrove leaf chlorophylll-a = 0.0002((B4 + B2)/2)2 - 0.057((B4 + B2)/2) + 16.79, with RMSE of 0.072 mg.m-3. Algorithm for mangrove biomass = 24.69(B4/Band2)2 -47.41(B4/B2) + 36.06, with RMSE of 0.337 tons/0.2ha and algorithm for mangrove carbon = 10.071(B4/B2)2 - 23.159(B4/B2) + 44.233; with RMSE of 0.235 tonsC/0.2ha. The new insight in this study is that the algorithm developments can be applied for mangrove chlorophyll-a content, biomass and carbon content estimation using any optical satellite data based on its relevant spectral range. This algorithm development is an open approach method based on highest correlation coefficient on regression equation of the field and the satellite spectral value. The algorithms resulted from this study can be applied over wide and in any area in the tropics.

TI  - Predicting Habitat Properties Using Remote Sensing Data: Soil pH and Moisture, and Ground Vegetation Cover
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data comprise a valuable information source for many ecological landscape studies that may be under-utilized because of an overwhelming amount of processing methods and derived variables. These complexities, combined with a scarcity of quality control studies, make the selection of appropriate remote sensed variables challenging. Quality control studies are necessary to evaluate the predictive power of remote sensing data and also to develop parsimonious models underpinned by functional variables, i.e., cause rather than solely correlation. Cause-based models yield superior model transferability across different landscapes and ecological settings. We propose two basic guidelines for conducting such quality control studies that increase transferability and predictive power. The first is to favor predictors that are causally related to the response. The second is to include additional variables controlling variation in the property of interest and testing for optimum processing method and/or scale. Here, we evaluated these principles in predicting ground vegetation cover, soil moisture and pH under challenging conditions with forest canopies hindering direct remote sensing of the ground. Our model using lidar data combined with natural resource maps explained most of the observed variation in soil pH and moisture, and somewhat less variation of ground vegetation cover. Soil pH was best predicted by topographic position, sediment type and site index (R-2 = 0.90). Soil moisture was best predicted by topographic position, radiation load, sediment type and site index (R-2 = 0.83). The best model for predicting ground vegetation cover was a combination of lidar-based estimates for light availability below canopy and forest type, including an interaction between these two variables (R-2 = 0.65).

TI  - Orbit determination of sentinel-6A using the galileo high accuracy service test signal
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The High Accuracy Service (HAS) is an upcoming addition to the Galileo service portfolio that offers free correction data for precise point positioning in real-time. Beyond terrestrial and aeronautical applications, precise orbit determination (POD) of satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) has been proposed as a potential use case for HAS corrections in view of their global availability. Based on HAS data collected during a test campaign in September 2021, the benefit of HAS corrections is assessed for real-time, onboard navigation as well as near real-time POD on the ground using GNSS observations of the Sentinel-6A LEO satellite. Compared to real-time POD using only broadcast ephemerides, performance improvements of about 40%, 10%, and 5% in terms of 3D position error can already be achieved for GPS-only, GPS + Galileo, and Galileo-only navigation. While Galileo processing benefits only moderately from the HAS correction data during the early tests in view of an already excellent Open Service performance, their use is highly advantageous for GPS processing and enables dual-constellation navigation with balanced contributions of both GNSSs for improved robustness. For near real-time offline POD, HAS corrections offer reduced latency or accuracy compared to established ultra-rapid GNSS orbit and clock products as well as independence from external sources.

TI  - Multi-Input Attention Network for Dehazing of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The non-uniform haze distribution in remote sensing images, together with the complexity of the ground information, brings many difficulties to the dehazing of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a multi-input convolutional neural network based on an encoder-decoder structure to effectively restore remote sensing hazy images. The proposed network can directly learn the mapping between hazy images and the corresponding haze-free images. It also effectively utilizes the strong haze penetration characteristic of the Infrared band. Our proposed network also includes the attention module and the global skip connection structure, which enables the network to effectively learn the haze-relevant features and better preserve the ground information. We build a dataset for training and testing our proposed method. The dataset consists of remote sensing images with two different resolutions and nine bands, which are captured by Sentinel-2. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional dehazing methods and other deep learning methods in terms of the final dehazing effect, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM) and feature similarity (FSIM).

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of Urban Thermal Effects Caused by Heat Waves through Remote Sensing
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years there has been an increase in the number of extreme weather events that lead to higher mortality, such as heat waves. This study carries out a new investigation that integrates the environmental quality parameters-the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) and the Terrestrial Surface Temperature (LST)-during these periods of high temperatures and compares them with normal periods. The study of the relationship between these variables will allow improving the quality of life through new mitigation measures that will minimize the effects of climate change in urban areas. This study analyzes eight cities in the south of Spain (Andalusia) to assess environmental quality through gases SO2, NO2, CO, O-3 and aerosols, obtained through Sentinel-5P satellite images, and the LST and SUHI obtained through Sentinel-3 images. Next, the results of periods of heat waves are compared with periods of normal environmental conditions during the summers of the years 2020 and 2021. The objective is to determine the possible impact of heat waves on environmental quality, as well as on the LST and SUHI of the investigated cities, which are located in an area identified as highly vulnerable to the effects of global warming. During the period of the heat wave and compared to the periods without a heat wave, a variety of environmental pollutants was found: SO2 (+165%), NO2 (+24%), CO (+8%), O-3 (-4%) and aerosols (+193%). Both the LST and the SUHI suffered an average increase of 2.8 K. The results of this document can help to establish pollutant reduction mechanisms in periods prior to heat waves. This could minimize major effects on the population and provide sustainable development.

TI  - DEM Study on Hydrological Response in Makkah City, Saudi Arabia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The changes in catchments can be analyzed through the generation of DEM, which is important as input data in hydrologic modeling. This study aims to analyze the effect of anthropogenic activities on hydrological studies based on DEM comparison and GIUH hydrographs. The four DEM datasets (SRTM, ALOS, Copernicus, Sentinel-1) were compared to the topographic map of Makkah City and GPS data in order to assess the quality of the DEM elevation. The GIS Arc Hydro toolbox was used to extract morphometric and Horton-Strahler ratio characteristics to generate a GIUH hydrograph of the catchments of Wadi Nouman and Wadi Ibrahim inside Makkah City. Based on the DEM comparison, Copernicus and SRTM have the highest accuracy, with R-2 = 0.9788 and 0.9765, and the lowest RMSE, 3.89 m and 4.23 m, respectively. ALOS and Sentinel-1 have the lowest R-2, 0.9687 and 0.9028, and the highest RMSE, 4.27 m and 6.31 m, respectively. GIUH Copernicus DEM on Wadi Nouman has a higher q(p) and lower t(p) (0.21 1/h and 2.66 h) than SRTM (0.20 1/h and 2.75 h), respectively. On Wadi Ibrahim, the SRTM has a greater q(p) and lower t(p) than Copernicus due to the wadi having two shapes. Based on the anthropogenic effect, the stream network in the mountain area is quite similar for SRTM and Copernicus due to the dominant influence of the mountainous relief and relatively inconsequential influence of anthropogenic activities and DEM noise. In the urban area, the variation of the stream network is high due to differing DEM noise and significant anthropogenic activities such as urban redevelopment. The Copernicus DEM has the best performance of the others, with high accuracy, less RMSE, and stream flow direction following the recent condition.

M3  - Article
AB  - Ningxia is an important agriculture -pastoral area in China. Research on the temporal and spatial variations of net primary productivity (NPP) in this area and its driving factors would help understand the trends and leading factors of NPP variations, and reveal vegetation restoration status and causes. Based on the NPP data of MODIS, we used Theil-Sen Median trend analysis, correlation analysis, overlay analysis and other methods to analyze the spatiotemporal variations and driving factors of NPP in Ningxia. The results showed that NPP of Ningxia - Ivegetation showed a fluctuating upward trend during 2000-2019, with a linear growth rate of 5.46 g C . m(-2) . a(-1). The NPP presented a spatial characteristics of "two high and two low", with the highest in the southern mountain area, followed by the Yellow River irrigation area, and the lowest in the hilly area of the central arid zone and Helan Mountain. 84.2% of the NPP in the study area was under significant restoration, mainly distributed in the central and southern mountainous and hilly areas. The NPP varied significantly with altitude and was significantly affected by the terrain. NPP center of gravity had generally moved to the south, with the increase and growth rate of NPP of vegetation in the south being greater than that in the north. The annual precipitation in Ningxia had shown an increasing trend, while the average annual temperature had slightly decreased. The NPP was significantly affected by precipitation (R-2=0.291), whereas the correlation between mean annual temperature and NPP was weak. 96.9% of the study area was at a state of vegetation restoration, which was promoted by both climate change and human activities.

TI  - Forecasting Hospital Visits Due to Influenza Based on Emergency Department Visits for Fever: A Feasibility Study on Emergency Department-Based Syndromic Surveillance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the use of chief complaint data from emergency departments (EDs) to detect the increment of influenza cases identified from the nationwide medical service usage and developed a forecast model to predict the number of patients with influenza using the daily number of ED visits due to fever. The National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) and the National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS) databases from 2015 to 2019 were used. The definition of fever included having an initial body temperature >= 38.0 degrees C at an ED department or having a report of fever as a patient's chief complaint. The moving average number of visits to the ED due to fever for the previous seven days was used. Patients in the NHIS with the International Classification of Diseases-10 codes of J09, J10, or J11 were classified as influenza cases, with a window duration of 100 days, assuming the claims were from the same season. We developed a forecast model according to an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method using the data from 2015 to 2017 and validated it using the data from 2018 to 2019. Of the 29,142,229 ED visits from 2015 to 2019, 39.9% reported either a fever as a chief complaint or a >= 38.0 degrees C initial body temperature at the ED. ARIMA (1,1,1) (0,0,1)(7) was the most appropriate model for predicting ED visits due to fever. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) value showed the prediction accuracy of the model. The correlation coefficient between the number of ED visits and the number of patients with influenza in the NHIS up to 14 days before the forecast, with the exceptions of the eighth, ninth, and twelfth days, was higher than 0.70 (p-value = 0.001). ED-based syndromic surveillances of fever were feasible for the early detection of hospital visits due to influenza.

T2  - NURSING PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - On 4 February 2021 a group of nurse scholar-educators, nurses and other interested folks came together for the second of two virtual events to think together about the role of philosophy in the nursing world. The live streamed open access event provided an opportunity in the COVID-19 pandemic for over 400 people to listen to five nursing scholars' presentations and to interact virtually through comments in chat and on the @IPONSociety Twitter social media platform. By reading the comments and questions that were generated, and by looking at the social media comments related to the event, it is apparent that philosophy is an important thinking practice for nurses but many audience members critically expressed they felt excluded. Critical issues were raised by participants in chat and on Twitter-pointedly around the need for more representative voices-including the imperative to open nursing philosophy to diverse and disparate worldviews. This dialogue provides a summary of critical points raised during the live question and answer session for the panel entitled Addressing Current Debates in Nursing Theory, Education, Practice as well as examing comments selected from the @IPONSociety Twitter space in response to the panel. One commenter said it was great to see the discussion being lifted up from the influential roots of white supremacy, while other nurses expressed that they wished the panellists themselves were more diverse. In discussion of key takeaway, links are made to historical and ongoing structural oppressions in nursing where thinking practices like nursing philosophy and theory are still dominated by world views emanating from positionalities of able-bodied cis-gendered heterosexual western eurocentric whiteness.

TI  - Urban land use and land cover classification with interpretable machine learning - A case study using Sentinel-2 and auxiliary data*
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Commission launch of the twin Sentinel-2 satellites provides new opportunities for land use and land cover (LULC) classification because of the ready availability of their data and their enhanced spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions. The rapid development of machine learning over the past decade led to data-driven models being at the forefront of high accuracy predictions of the physical world. However, the contribution of the driving variables behind these predictions cannot be explained beyond generalized metrics of overall performance. Here, we compared the performance of three shallow learners (support vector machines, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting) as well as two deep learners (a convolutional neural network and a residual network with 50 layers) in and around the city of Malmo in southern Sweden. Our com-plete analysis suite involved 141 input features, 85 scenarios, and 8 LULC classes. We explored the interpretability of the five learners using Shapley additive explanations to better understand feature importance at the level of individual LULC classes. The purpose of class-level feature im-portance was to identify the most parsimonious combination of features that could reasonably map a particular class and enhance overall map accuracy. We showed that not only do overall ac-curacies increase from shallow (mean = 84.64%) to deep learners (mean = 92.63%) but that the number of explanatory variables required to obtain maximum accuracy decreases along the same gradient. Furthermore, we demonstrated that class-level importance metrics can be success-fully identified using Shapley additive explanations in both shallow and deep learners, which al-lows for a more detailed understanding of variable importance. We show that for certain LULC classes there is a convergence of variable importance across all the algorithms, which helps ex-plain model predictions and aid the selection of more parsimonious models. The use of class-level feature importance metrics is still new in LULC classification, and this study provides important insight into the potential of more nuanced importance metrics.

TI  - Exploring the Potential of Soil Salinity Assessment through Remote Sensing and GIS: Case Study in the Coastal Rural Areas of Bangladesh
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is a negative impact of climate change, and it is a significant problem for the coastal region of Bangladesh, which has been increasing in the last four decades. The issue of soil salinity substantially limits the agricultural crop production in coastal areas. Therefore, a soil salinity assessment is essential for proper land-use planning in agricultural crop production. This research was carried out to determine the soil salinity area with different salinity levels in Barguna Sadar Upazila (sub-district). The remote sensing technique, which is a potentially quick yet effective method for the soil salinity estimation in data-scarce conditions, was applied. The methodology employed the Landsat 8 OLI dataset along with nine soil salinity indices to develop a soil salinity map. The maps were from Soil Resource Development Institute (SRDI), and low NDVI value (-0.01 to 0.48) was produced using satellite images illustrate the extent of the soil salinity for the study area. However, nine linear regressions, which were made between the pixel value of the satellite-based generated map and ground truth soil salinity data, that is, the EC value, indicate a maximum R-2 value for the salinity index SI 7 = G x R/B, representing a value of 0.022. This minimal R-2 value indicates a negligible relationship between the ground EC value and the pixel value of the salinity index generated map, inferring that the indices are not sufficient to assess the soil salinity. Nonetheless, this research's findings offer a guide for researchers to investigate alternative geospatial approaches for this geophysical condition.

TI  - Phenological Changes and Driving Forces of Lake Ice in Central Asia from 2002 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake ice phenology is an indicator of past and present climate, it is sensitive to regional and global climate change. In the past few decades, the climate of Central Asia has changed significantly due to global warming and anthropogenic activities. However, there are few studies on the lake ice phenology in Central Asia. In this study, the lake ice phenology of 53 lakes in Central Asia were extracted using MODIS daily LST products from 2002 to 2020. The results show that MODIS-extracted lake ice phenology is generally consistent with Landsat-extracted and AVHRR-extracted lake ice phenology. Generally, lakes in Central Asia start to freeze from October to December. The trends in the lake ice phenology show strong regional differences. Lakes distributed along the Kunlun Mountains show overall delayed trends in all lake ice phenology variables, while lakes located in southwestern Central Asia show clear advancing trends in the freeze-up start dates (7.06 days) and breakup end dates (6.81 days). Correlations between the phenology of lake ice and local and climatic factors suggest that the ice breakup process and the duration of its complete coverage depend more on heat, while precipitation mainly affects the freezing time of the ice. Wind speed mainly affects the time of completely frozen of ice. In general, the breakup process is more susceptible to climatic factors, while local factors have strong influences on the freeze-up process.

TI  - Point-to-Surface Upscaling Algorithms for Snow Depth Ground Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To validate the accuracy of snow depth products retrieved from passive microwave remote sensing data with a high confidence level, the verification method based on points of ground observation is subject to great uncertainty, due to the scale effect. Thus, it is necessary to use a point-to-surface scale transformation method to obtain the relative ground truth at the remote sensing pixel scale. In this study, by using the snow depth ground observations at different observation scales, the upscaling methods are conducted based on simple average (SA), geostatistical, Bayes maximum entropy (BME), and random forest (RF) algorithms. In addition, the cross-validation of the leave-one-out method is employed to validate the upscaling results. The results show that the SA algorithm is seriously inadequate for estimating snow depth variation in space, and is only suitable for regions with relatively flat terrain and small variation of snow depth. The BME algorithm can introduce prior knowledge and perform kernel smoothing on observed data, and the upscaling result is superior to geostatistical and RF algorithms, especially when the observed data is insufficient, and outliers appear. The results of the study are expected to provide a reference for developing a point-to-surface upscaling method based on snow depth ground observations, and to further solve the uncertainties caused by scale effects in snow depth and other land surface parameter inversion and validation, by using remote sensing data.

TI  - Comparing Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 for Burn Severity Mapping in Western North America
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate assessment of burn severity is a critical need for an improved understanding of fire behavior and ecology and effective post-fire management. Although NASA Landsat satellites have a long history of use for remotely sensed mapping of burn severity, the recently launched (2015 and 2017) European Space Agency Sentinel-2 satellite constellation offers increased temporal and spatial resolution with global coverage, combined with free data access. Evaluations of burn severity derived from Landsat and Sentinel generally show comparable results, but these studies only assessed a small number of fires with limited field data. We used 912 ground calibration plots from 26 fires that burned between 2016 and 2019 in western North America to compare Sentinel- and Landsat-derived burn severity estimates with the field-based composite burn index. We mapped burn severity using two methods; the well-established paired scene approach, in which a single pre- and post-fire scene are selected for each fire, and also a mean image compositing approach that automatically integrates multiple scenes using the cloud-based remote sensing platform Google Earth Engine. We found that Sentinel generally performed as well or better than Landsat for four spectral indices of burn severity, particularly when using atmospherically corrected Sentinel imagery. Additionally, we tested the effects of mapping burn severity at Sentinel's finer spatial resolution (10 m) on estimates of the spatial complexity of stand-replacing fire, resulting in a 5% average reduction per-fire in area mapped as high-severity patch interiors (24,273 ha total) compared to mapping at the resolution of Landsat (30 m). These findings suggest Sentinel may improve ecological discrimination of fine-scale fire effects, but also warrant caution when comparing estimates of burn severity spatial patterns derived at different resolutions. Overall, these results indicate that burn severity mapping will benefit substantially from the integration of Sentinel imagery through increased imagery availability, and that Sentinel's higher spatial resolution improves opportunities for examining finer-scale fire effects across ecosystems.

TI  - Mosquito Surveillance and Insecticide Resistance Monitoring Conducted by the Florida Keys Mosquito Control District, Monroe County, Florida, USA
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Mosquitoes are the most important group of flies affecting human health and wellness. Worldwide, mosquito-borne diseases kill over 700,000 people every year and afflict millions more. Mosquitoes also adversely affect domestic and agricultural animal health and negatively impact tourism-based economies. The Florida Keys Mosquito Control District is responsible for reducing mosquito populations in an area stretching from Cross Key and Broad Creek in the northeast to Key West in the southwest. Before mosquitoes can be controlled, it is important to know how many mosquitoes there are, what species are present, and where they are located. Adult mosquito surveillance traps such as the BG Sentinel, set around homes and businesses, and light traps, set in field sites, are used to identify the number and species of mosquitoes in an area. Larval and pupal mosquito surveillance is conducted by visiting water sources in domestic and field habitats to look for immature mosquitoes. Surveillance informs operational staff of the types of treatments required to control mosquitoes present. Products currently used to kill larval and adult forms of mosquitoes are continuously evaluated for efficacy to reduce pesticide-resistant populations. Mosquito control programs in the State of Florida are charged with protecting human and animal health, fostering economic development of the State, permitting enjoyment of the natural attractions in Florida, and improving the quality of life of citizens. Mosquito control programs must accomplish these tasks in such a manner as will protect the environment and terrestrial, marine, and freshwater ecosystems. The Florida Keys Mosquito Control District provides a science-based Integrated Pest Management mosquito control program to the residents of the Florida Keys, Monroe County, Florida. Operational decisions are based on surveillance of adult and immature mosquitoes. Mosquito populations are monitored by means of carbon dioxide-baited light traps BG Sentinel traps, truck traps, gravid traps, oviposition traps, and human landing rate counts. Larvae and pupae are monitored by inspections of natural and human-made immature habitats. Due to past and current reliance on chemical pesticides for control of mosquitoes, the District maintains a pesticide resistance detection program consisting of CDC bottle bioassays and larval bioassays, challenging local mosquito species with currently used adulticides and larvicides.

TI  - Helicopter Takeoff and Landing Point Location in Cities for Emergency Services
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In low-altitude rescue, civilian helicopters, relying on their speed, efficiency and flexibility, play at center stage. Due to the terrain restrictions of the disaster area, it is difficult for helicopters to carry out safe and efficient rescue in cities. In order to facilitate emergency rescue, fixed helicopter takeoff and landing points for rescue missions must be selected strategically and wisely. However, the traditional method is to analyze the satellite data and conduct field surveys manually, which is rather subjective. A scientific, simple and efficient method of location selection is in urgent need. This paper analyzes the normativeness of the location of the helicopter's take-off and landing point and establishes a model of the slope and undulation of the landing site. It utilizes ArcGIS software to build layers and selects for the terrain element models that meet the specifications. It also studies the rescue radius commonly used in the world and then maximizes the location range of the take-off and landing point based on the greedy algorithm. Considering the construction cost, the final optimized site selection result is obtained. The results show that the use of GIS space technology can effectively select suitable take-off and landing points and gain valuable time for low-altitude rescue.

TI  - New Insight into the Sliding Mechanism and Post-Stability of the 2017 Xinmo Landslide in Sichuan, China
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - On the 24th of June 2017, a catastrophic landslide, named the Xinmo landslide, occurred in Xinmo village, Sichuan Province, China, resulting in 103 casualties. In this study, multifield investigation data, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, and Google Earth images were adopted to explore the sliding mechanism; 47 Sentinel-1A images (2017/10-2021/11) were adopted for post-stability analysis based on permanent scatterer synthetic aperture radar interferometry (PS-InSAR). The results show that the source zone was divided into two subzones by three groups of cracks of neotectonic origin. The main source zone failed first and pulled the sub-source zone (left) down, striking the lower colluvium and causing massive sliding. The sliding provoked an unstable block (on the right side), which seriously threatened the village below. During the landslide movement, an apparent particle differentiation formed, and the large, fractured rocks ran over the hump and accumulated on the left side, while the small rocks were reflected and accumulated on the right side with the old colluvium. The differentiation finally resulted in different movement forms in which the fine particles were deposited more evenly than the coarse particles. The particle differentiation further led to two different river dam types. The five-year displacement monitoring based on PS-InSAR analysis indicated that the source zone of the Xinmo landslide and the unstable block were stable after September 2018, but the rock mass along the flank of the Xinmo landslide source zone has maintained continuous deformation thus far, with velocities of similar to 3.3 mm/yr (right) and similar to 8.8 mm/yr (left), respectively.

TI  - Remote detection of marine debris using Sentinel-2 imagery: A cautious note on spectral interpretations.
T2  - Marine pollution bulletin
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Remote detection of marine debris (also called marine litter) has received increased attention in the past decade, with the Multispectral Instruments (MSI) onboard the Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites being the most used sensors. However, because of their mixed band resolutions and small sub-pixel coverage of debris within a pixel (e.g., <10%), caution is required when interpreting the spectral shapes of MSI pixels. Otherwise, the spectrally distorted shapes may be misused as spectral endmembers (signatures) or interpreted as from certain types of floating matters. Here, using simulations and MSI data, I show the origin of the spectral distortions and emphasize why both pixel averaging and pixel subtraction are critical in algorithm design and spectral interpretation for the purpose of remote detection of marine debris using Sentinel-2 MSI sensors.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Changes and GLOF Susceptibility Assessment of Glacial Lakes in Nepal from 2000 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lakes are a sensitive indicator of regional climate change and one of the initiators of glacier disasters. It is of great significance to understand the spatial distribution and change characteristics of glacial lakes for exploring their response patterns to climate change and assessing the glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) susceptibility. Based on Gaofen-1/6 PMS, Sentinel-2A/2B MSI and Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images from 2000 to 2020, we integrated geographic information technology and mathematical and statistical methods to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of glacial lakes in Nepal and their dynamic changes, and further discriminated and evaluated the GLOF susceptibility of glacial lakes. The results show that there were 2420 glacial lakes in Nepal in 2020, mainly distributed within the 4500 similar to 5500 m, with an area of 87.21 km(2) and a water storage of 1921.72 x 10(6) m(3). The number and area of glacial lakes with each area above 0.01 km(2) in Nepal showed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2020, while 499 new glacial lakes were born, 139 lakes disappeared, the area and water storage increased by 19.46 km(2), 403.07 x 10(6) m(3), respectively. Glacial lakes at altitudes <3000 m were relatively stable, while the number and area of glacial lakes at altitudes within 4500-5500 m increased rapidly. We assessed the GLOF susceptibility of 40 moraine-dammed glacial lakes with an area above 0.2 km(2) in Nepal, and found that there were 8, 12, 14 and 6 glacial lakes with low, medium, high and very high susceptibility, respectively. Among glacial lakes with very high GLOF susceptibility, potential GLOF events of Tsho Rolpa glacial lake, Lower Barun glacial lake and glacial lake with code of GL87091E27797N will cause great harm to downstream regions. GLOFs in Nepal will be in an active status in the future, therefore, the dynamics of glacial lakes and their surroundings should be continuously monitored.

TI  - Logging Pattern Detection by Multispectral Remote Sensing Imagery in North Subtropical Plantation Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest logging detection is important for sustainable forest management. The traditional optical satellite images with visible and near-infrared bands showed the ability to identify intensive timber logging. However, less intensive logging is still difficult to detect with coarse spatial resolution such as Landsat or high spatial resolution in fewer spectral bands. Although more high-resolution remote sensing images containing richer spectral bands can be easily obtained nowadays, the questions of whether they facilitate the detection of logging patterns and which spectral bands are more effective in detecting logging patterns, especially in selective logging, remain unresolved. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the combinations of visible, near-infrared, red-edge, and short-wave infrared bands in detecting three different logging intensity patterns, including unlogged (control check, CK), selective logging (SL), and clear-cutting (CC), in north subtropical plantation forests with the random forest algorithm using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. This study aims to explore the recognition performance of different combinations of spectral bands (visual (VIS) and near-infrared bands (NIR), VIS, NIR combined with red-edge, VIS, NIR combined with short-wave infrared bands (SWIR), and full-spectrum bands combined with VIS, NIR, red edge and SWIR) and to determine the best spectral variables to be used for identifying logging patterns, especially in SL. The study was conducted in Taizishan in Hubei province, China. A total of 213 subcompartments of different logging patterns were collected and the random forest algorithm was used to classify logging patterns. The results showed that full-spectrum bands which contain the red-edge and short-wave infrared bands improve the ability of conventional optical satellites to monitor forest logging patterns and can achieve an overall accuracy of 85%, especially for SL which can achieve 79% and 64% for precision and recall accuracy, respectively. The red-edge band (698-713 nm, B5 in Sentinel-2), short-wave infrared band (2100-2280 nm, B12 in Sentinel-2), and associated vegetation indices (NBR, NDre2, and NDre1) enhance the sensitivity of the spectral information to logging patterns, especially for the SL pattern, and the precision and recall accuracy can improve by 10% and 6%, respectively. Meanwhile, both clear-cutting and unlogged patterns could be well-classified whether adding a red-edge or SWIR band or both in VIS and NIR bands; the best precision and recall accuracies for clear-cutting were enhanced to 97%, 95% and 81%, 91% for unlogged, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the optical images have the potential ability to detect logging patterns especially for the clear-cutting and unlogged patterns, and the selective logging detection accuracy can be improved by adding red-edge and short-wave infrared spectral bands.

TI  - The Melbourne epidemic thunderstorm asthma event 2016: a 5-year longitudinal study
T2  - ASIA PACIFIC ALLERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In 2016, Melbourne was struck by the world's largest and most devastating epidemic thunderstorm asthma (ETSA) episode. While affected individuals displayed worsened short-term asthma control, little is known about their longer-term natural history, nor about interventions that restore control. Objective: We assessed the asthma symptomatology and related behaviours of ETSA-affected individuals through a single-centre prospective 5-year longitudinal study. We embedded an open-label observational trial investigating the role of grass pollen sublingual tablet (Oralair) allergen immunotherapy in improving asthma and allergic rhinitis symptoms. Methods: Allergic rhinitis symptom severity, frequency of asthma symptoms and inhaled corticosteroid usage were assessed via questionnaire yearly. In 2018, a subgroup of participants was enrolled in an observational study of Oralair treatment compared to control. The active group received Oralair from 2019 to 2021; both groups were followed-up for 5 years. Subgroup analyses were performed for participants with complete datasets, and who completed the trial per-protocol. Results: Year-on-year data across 5 years was available for 30 participants. The rate of persistent asthma symptoms declined from 37% to 7% in 2016 to 2021. Only 10%-27% of participants reported being completely asymptomatic in any given year. The inhaled preventer prescription rate was 67%, with only 35% being adherent. Twenty-seven participants with available data completed the Oralair trial per-protocol. No significant difference was noted between control and active groups for allergic rhinitis symptoms or asthma control, although the Oralair group saw a significant improvement in asthma control comparing 2019 with 2021. Conclusion: This is the longest documented follow-up of ETSA- affected individuals. Five years following sentinel event, there was progressive reduction but some persistence in asthma symptoms. Oralair allergen immunotherapy did not further improve allergic rhinitis or asthma symptoms compared to control, but there were no further ETSA events to test a protective effect during the study period.

TI  - Developing a Dual-Stream Deep-Learning Neural Network Model for Improving County-Level Winter Wheat Yield Estimates in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely crop yield prediction over large spatial regions is critical to national food security and sustainable agricultural development. However, designing a robust model for crop yield prediction over a large spatial region remains challenging due to inadequate surveyed samples and an under-development of deep-learning frameworks. To tackle this issue, we integrated multi-source (remote sensing, weather, and soil properties) data into a dual-stream deep-learning neural network model for winter wheat in China's major planting regions. The model consists of two branches for robust feature learning: one for sequential data (remote sensing and weather series data) and the other for statical data (soil properties). The extracted features by both branches were aggregated through an adaptive fusion model to forecast the final wheat yield. We trained and tested the model by using official county-level statistics of historical winter wheat yields. The model achieved an average R-2 of 0.79 and a root-mean-square error of 650.21 kg/ha, superior to the compared methods and outperforming traditional machine-learning methods. The dual-stream deep-learning neural network model provided decent in-season yield prediction, with an error of about 13% compared to official statistics about two months before harvest. By effectively extracting and aggregating features from multi-source datasets, the new approach provides a practical approach to predicting winter wheat yields at the county scale over large spatial regions.

TI  - Shallow Sea Topography Detection from Multi-Source SAR Satellites: A Case Study of Dazhou Island in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate measurement of underwater topography in the coastal zone is essential for human marine activities, and the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) presents a completely new solution. However, underwater topography detection using a single SAR image is vulnerable to the interference of sea state and sensor noise, which reduces the detection accuracy. A new underwater topography detection method based on multi-source SAR (MSSTD) was proposed in this study to improve the detection precision. GF-3, Sentinel-1, ALOS PALSAR, and ENVISAT ASAR data were used to verify the sea area of Dazhou Island. The detection result was in good agreement with the chart data (MAE of 2.9 m and correlation coefficient of 0.93), and the detection accuracy was improved over that of a single SAR image. GF-3 image with 3 m spatial resolution performed best in bathymetry among the four SAR images. Additionally, the resolution of the SAR image had greater influence on bathymetry compared with polarization and radar band. The ability of MSSTD has been proved in our work. Collaborative multi-source satellite observation is a feasible and effective scheme in marine research, but its application potential in underwater topography detection still requires further exploration.

TI  - Hydrological Drivers for the Spatial Distribution of Wetland Herbaceous Communities in Poyang Lake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological processes are known as major driving forces in structuring wetland plant communities, but the specific relationships are not always well understood. The recent dry conditions of Poyang Lake (i.e., the largest freshwater lake in China) are having a profound impact on its wetland vegetation, leading to the degradation of the entire wetland ecosystem. We developed an integrated framework to quantitatively investigate the relationship between the spatial distribution of major wetland herbaceous communities and the hydrological regimes of Poyang Lake. First, the wetland herbaceous community classification was built using a support-vector machine and simultaneous parameter optimization, achieving an overall accuracy of over 98%. Secondly, based on the inundation conditions since 2000, four hydrological drivers of the spatial distribution of these communities were evaluated by canonical correspondence analysis. Finally, the hydrological niches of the communities were quantified by Gaussian regression and quantile methods. The results show that there were significant interspecific differences in terms of the hydrological niche. For example, Carex cinerascens Ass was the most adaptable to inundation, while Triarrhena lutarioriparia + Phragmites australis Ass was the least. Our integrated analytical framework can contribute to hydrological management to better maintain the wetland plant community structure in the Poyang Lake area.

TI  - Monitoring Damage Caused by <i>Pantana phyllostachysae</i> Chao to Moso Bamboo Forests Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pantana phyllostachysae Chao (PPC) is one of the deadliest defoliators of Moso bamboo. Accurately locating and evaluating PPC damage is essential for the management of bamboo forests. Moso bamboo has a unique biennial growth cycle, consisting of the on-year period (bamboo shoots are incubated and then produced) and the off-year period (old leaves are dropped and then new leaves are grown, and no bamboo shoots are produced in the coming year). The similar physiological characteristics of off-year bamboo and damaged on-year bamboo create difficulties in monitoring PPC damage using remote sensing data. In this study, we synergistically used Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and field inventory data to construct machine learning (extreme gradient boosting, XGBoost) models monitoring PPC damage. The results show that the single-time observation feature-based model (using images from October) outperformed the double-time observation feature-based model (using the differences between remote sensing signals from October and February or April) due to the interference from other disturbance agents (e.g., logging and weeding). The overall accuracy (OA) values of the single-time observation feature-based model were at least 3% and 10% higher than those for double-time observation feature-based models for on- and off-year samples, respectively. With the consideration of the on- and off-year phenological differences, OA was improved by over 4%. The model without differentiation of the phenological difference tended to underestimate the damaged area of on-year bamboo and overestimate that of off-year bamboo. We also found that the responses of optical and SAR (synthetic aperture radar) features to PPC damage were different. The optical features increased or decreased with increasing damage severity. SAR features decreased significantly at the initial stage of PPC damage and then changed marginally with the increase in damage severity. The addition of SAR features to optical features improved the model performance, mainly for healthy and mildly damaged samples. The methodology developed in this study provides technical and theoretical support for the pest monitoring of bamboo forests using remote sensing data.

TI  - Analysis on Characteristics of Temporal and Spatial Changes of Land Use in the Yiluo River Basin
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/cover change (LUCC) is one of global environmental change hot issues. The study of land-use changes in the Yiluo River Basin is significant to ecological protection and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin. Based on long-term LandsatTM satellite remote sensing images, R language string diagram visualization model and linear model redundancy analysis(RDA analysis), this paper analyzed the temporal and spatial change characteristics of land use, land cover flow rate, directionand internal driving factors in the Yiluo River Basin from 1990 to 2020. The results showed: (1) From 1990 to 2020, the land change in the Yiluo River Basin showed a trend of change in forest land firstly decreasing and then increasing, arable land first increasing and then decreasing, construction land increasing as a whole, and water area decreasing as a whole. (2) In terms of quantity Every 10 years from 1990 to 2020, the total amount of change in cultivated land and forest land is the largest, followed by construction land, and the amount of change in water, grassland and unused land are very small. (3) 1990-2000, 2000-2010, 2010-2020 The mutual conversion activity of land use types and the degree of land-use change showed an upward trend, reaching the highest in 2010-2020. (4) From 1990 to 2020, the center of gravity of forest land shifts to the northeast as a whole, and the center of gravity of cultivated land migrates to the south. The change in the center of gravity of forest land and cultivated land is related to the policy of returning farmland to the forest. The construction land is generally centered around the main urban area of Luoyang City, which is related to the direction of social and economic development and urban development; (5) In terms of the driving force, rapid economic development is the main driving force for the change of land use area in the Yiluo River Basin. The promulgation and implementation of the policy of returning farmland to forest is the main reason for the change of forest land and cultivated land area. The results of this study can provide a scientific basis for the ecological protection and sustainable development of the Yellow River Basin.

TI  - Wetland mapping based on feature optimization and Google Earth Engine in Zhalong Nature Reserve
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands have very important and irreplaceable ecological service functions in protecting biodiversity and maintaining ecological balance. Due to the unique hydrological characteristics of wetlands, large-scale wetland mapping methods are usually time-consuming, labor intensive, and expensive. With the rise of big data and cloud computing platforms, there are opportunities for long time series and large-scale spatial data processing that improve largescale wetland mapping. In this study, the Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and digital elevation model derived from the Google Earth Engine were used to extract the wetland extent in the Zhalong Nature Reserve based on the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance for feature optimization and random forest. Research shows the following: (1) The JM distance for each feature showed that the optical features had the highest separation in all five features and (2) the classification after feature optimization performed best. User accuracy (UA) and producer accuracy (PA) for wetland reached 89.64% and 83.00%, respectively, and overall accuracy reached 90.76%. After feature optimization, PA and UA of wetland were each increased 4.26% and 1.07%, respectively, and the number of features was reduced from 46 to 28. The method used in this study is highly accurate in wetland mapping and can effectively avoid the problem of data redundancy. (c) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Hinge Religiosity: Articulations of Lived Religion with the Collective Dimension in Mexico
T2  - REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS SOCIALES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is based on results derived from the collective project "Religion and society in Mexico: recompositions from experience and practiced meaning". Its purpose is to explore the everyday religions of contemporary Mexico. The methodological proposal is an adaptation of the lived religion approach, but implementing a represen-tative sample of the main trends of religious change in Mexico detected by the Encreer 2016 survey. We propose the concept of hinge religiosity to avoid the individualistic bias of lived religion and include a relational perspective that allows us to focus the analysis on the way individual expectations are negotiated with the system of institutional norms and values, self-identification with respect to a wide range of affiliations and categories of belonging, individual life with socialities and communitarianisms, changes in the conti-nuity of traditions, and the contribution of faith to the solution of social problems in secular environments. Based on the empirical material provided by our interviews, we analyzed two transversal axes in the cases of the interviewees: autonomy in the processes of religious self-identification and action in the world guided by this religious identifi-cation. The analysis of the first axis was ordered according to religious affiliation and the second, according to the type of activism developed by the subjects, highlighting the dimensions of gender and sexual diversity. In the conclusions, we assess how the hinge religion approach allows us to link different scales of the analysis of religiousness and to pay attention to the continuities between the practices, experiences, and worldview elaborations of the subjects and their broader spiritual/religious context.

TI  - Monitoring Ice Phenology in Lake Wetlands Based on Optical Satellite Data: A Case Study of Wuliangsu Lake
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - It is challenging to obtain the ice phenology for a lake covered with a vast area of aquatic (shallow lake wetlands) using optical satellite data because possible clouds above the lake could contaminate the result. We developed a new method to tackle this challenge. Our target was Wuliangsu Lake, a large (330 km(2)) and shallow (1.6 m average depth) lake wetland in the Inner Mongolia Plateau. We used Landsat and Sentinel-2 imageries to extract the lake water boundary. The MOD09GQ/MYD09GQ dataset, having the highest spatial resolution among MODIS reflectivity products, was first selected to differentiate water and ice pixels. Then, we used the reflectivity state parameters containing cloud information in the dataset to filter out the cloud pixels. The ice phenology characteristics, such as freeze-up, break-up dates, and ice cover duration (ICD) between 2013 and 2022 were obtained. We further applied the air temperature correction technique to remove the outliers. The average of ICD in Wuliangsu Lake was about 127 +/- 6 days. The freeze-up start and break-up end occurred on 17 November +/- 5 days and 25 March +/- 4 days, respectively. The remote sensing results agree well with the field observation, with a mean absolute error of 2 days. The algorithm can effectively remove the influence of aquatic plants and clouds on lake ice identification, thereby satisfying the needs of daily monitoring and ice phenology research in the lake wetlands.

TI  - Linguistic and mental scope of an artwork in ukrainian and american language culture
T2  - APUNTES UNIVERSITARIOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the article is to determine and carry out a comparative analysis of the linguistic and mental sphere of the literary work in Ukrainian and American language culture on the example of short stories. These are "Two Soldiers" by William Faulkner and "For a Moment of Happiness" by Oles Honchar. The following methods were used: hermeneutic analysis, close reading, cultural -historical approach, intertextuality technique, comparative method. The speech design structure of Faulkner's short story is clear, devoid of additional artistic embellishments, the vocabulary is concise and performs pragmatic rather than aesthetic functions. Decoding available verbal markers contributes to a deeper understanding of the mental spirit of the literary text. The heroes' worldview reflected the features of intuition as the philosophical method. Honchar's short story about the linguistic and mental spheres of the organization has been subject to a strong artistic influence and psychologization. The format of the article reduced our focus to the lexical and semantic aspect of the linguistic and mental sphere of works. Promising areas of further research have been identified. First of all, it is necessary to supplement the lexical semantic analysis by generalizing syntactic stylistic observations of the discourse and metadiscourse of short stories.

TI  - Monitoring the Dynamic Changes in Vegetation Cover Using Spatio-Temporal Remote Sensing Data from 1984 to 2020
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activities and natural climate changes are the central driving forces of global ecosystems and agriculture changes. Climate changes, such as rainfall and temperature changes, have had the greatest impact on different types of plant production around the world. In the present study, we investigated the spatiotemporal variation of major crops (cotton, rice, wheat, and sugarcane) in the District Vehari, Pakistan, from 1984 to 2020 using remote sensing (RS) technology. The crop identification was pre-processed in ArcGIS software based on Landsat images. After pre-processing, supervised classification was used, which explains the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) to identify the vegetation changes. Our results showed that in the study area cultivated areas under wheat and cotton decreased by almost 5.4% and 9.1% from 1984 to 2020, respectively. Vegetated areas have maximum values of NDVI (>0.4), and built-up areas showed fewer NDVI values (0 to 0.2) in the District Vehari. During the Rabi season, the temperature was increased from 19.93 degrees C to 21.17 degrees C. The average temperature was calculated at 34.28 degrees C to 35.54 degrees C during the Kharif season in the District Vehari. Our results showed that temperature negatively affects sugarcane, rice, and cotton crops during the Rabi season, and precipitation positively affects sugarcane, rice, and cotton crops during the Kharif season in the study area. Accurate and timely assessment of crop estimation and relation to climate change can give very useful information for decision-makers, governments, and planners in formulating policies regarding crop management and improving agriculture yields.

TI  - Monitoring land use and land cover change near a nuclear power plant construction site: Akkuyu case, Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change analysis of the construction site and its surroundings of the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant project in southern Turkey was undertaken in this case study, which was supported by remotely sensed Landsat 8 image composites. The composite images compiled in 2017 and 2021 were prepared on the Google Earth Engine platform. The Random Forest algorithm was used as the classifier model. A high classification performance was obtained for both images (kappa > 0.88, overall accuracy > 90%). After the classification process, LULC maps for both years were generated, and statistical calculations for the LULC change were computed for both the entire study area (15 x 25 km) and a buffer zone with a radius of 1 km around the power plant. In the whole study area, artificial surfaces significantly increased (78.46%), whereas forests (- 8.31%) and barren lands experienced a considerable decrease (- 6.11%). In the 1 km buffer, artificial surfaces predominantly increased (113.94%), while forests and barren lands decreased dramatically (- 69.13% and - 74.28%, respectively). The agricultural areas in the study area were changed into other LULC classes: 9.1% to artificial surfaces, 27.6% to barren lands, and 21.7% to forest. The rise in the area of artificial surfaces was especially noticeable within the 1 km buffer zone: construction activities converted 36.1% of agricultural fields, 54.1% of forests, and 23.2% of barren lands into artificial surfaces. The filling activities on the seashore resulted in a loss of water bodies of up to 26.5%. The study provides an overview of how the LULC classes have evolved on the construction site and in the region. In the end, the study discusses how the current land use preferences in the region contradict the issues and concerns mentioned in the existing body of literature.

TI  - A Spatial Distribution Empirical Model of Surface Soil Water Content and Soil Workability on an Unplanted Sugarcane Farm Area Using Sentinel-1A Data towards Precision Agriculture Applications
T2  - INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining soil water content and soil workability data using remote sensing technology with passive sensors has some limitations due to cloud cover, cloud shadow, haze and smoke. This study proposes a method for computing soil water content and soil workability over large areas, faster and in near real-time based on Sentinel-1A (SAR) data. Sample data collected from sugarcane plantations in the Kediri and Sidoarjo districts in East Java, Indonesia, were used to develop a mathematical model of the proposed method using multi-polynomial regression. The performance indicators of the model (RMSE, MAPE and accuracy) were calculated with the results of RMSE = 0.213 and 0.250, MAPE = 16.39% and 18.79%, and accuracy = 83.6% and 81.2% for the training and testing models, respectively. The distribution of soil water content and soil workability can be computed and visualized using a spatial map. The future contribution of this work is to develop a decision support system for the selection of appropriate machinery for sugarcane field operations based on the principles of precision agriculture.

TI  - AgSAT: A Smart Irrigation Application for Field-Scale Daily Crop ET and Water Requirements Using Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the foreseen increase in population and the reliance on water as a key input for agricultural production, greater demand will be placed on freshwater supplies. The objective of this work was to present the newly developed Android smartphone application to calculate crop evapotranspiration in real-time to support field-scale irrigation management. As part of the answer to water shortage, we embraced technology by developing AgSAT, a Google Earth Engine-based application that optimizes water use for food production. AgSAT uses meteorological data to calculate daily water requirements using the ASCE-Penman-Monteith method (ETref) and vegetation indices from satellite imagery to derive the basal crop growth coefficient, Kcb. The performance of AgSAT to estimate ETref was assessed using climatic data from 18 meteorological stations distributed over several climatic zones worldwide. ETref estimation through the app showed acceptable results with values of 1.27, 0.9, 0.79, 0.95, and 0.5 for root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (r), modeling efficiency (NSE), concordance index (d), and percentage bias (Pbias), respectively. AgSAT guides gross irrigation requirements for crops and rationalizes water quantities used in agricultural production. AgSAT has been released, is currently in use by research scientists, agricultural producers, and irrigation managers, and is freely accessible from the Google Play and IOS Store and also at agsat.app. Our work is geared towards the development of remote sensing-based technologies that transfer significant benefits to farmers and water-saving efforts.

TI  - From Protofaith to Reality to Theism. A Systematic Exposition and Defence of Kung's "Proof of God's Existence"
T2  - RIVISTA DI FILOSOFIA NEO-SCOLASTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this essay, the author first reconstructs the goal setting and initial assumptions, starting from which the well-known reformist Catholic theologian Hans Kung strives in the tradition of the so-called "Physico-theological evidence" to argue in favor of the existence of God. At the same time, the key topic is the topic of fundamental trust in reality in relation to which the dilemma of worldview atheism or theism is formed. The author pays special attention to explaining the specific internal rationality of fundamental theistic trust in Kung's interpretation. In further consideration, three possibilities of interpretation or reinterpretation of Kung's central thesis are presented. Still, at the same time, certain deficits in his argumentation are pointed out - above all, the absence of the Christological dimension of the consideration. After rejecting in detail the criticism directed at this consideration from the position of J.L. Mackie's neo-positivism, the author concludes that Kung's concept reconstructed here deserves further reflection, a further explanation of his approach to establishing faith in God, which would include certain modifications in line with the current discussion.

TI  - The Influence of Values and Social Environment on Parents' Environmental Attitudes: Lithuanian Case Study
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The conducted research reveals the significance of parents' values and social environment factors, and their influence on pro-ecological attitudes. Parents from Lithuania were invited to participate in the study by filling out a questionnaire that aimed to assess their personal and ecological values, as well as factors of their social environment; the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale was used to assessed the pro-ecological attitude of the respondents. The results demonstrate that, among the personal values of parents, money takes a place of priority, but this cannot be treated only in the context of materialism, because parents seek the good of their children by fulfilling their needs, while also contributing to their education regarding financial literacy and consumption. In the context of ecological values, the results reveal the values of safe food and fresh air, showing how much parents care about their own and their children's health, as well as noting air pollution as one of the pressing eco-problems. The results also show that family and school are factors of the social environment that most significantly influence parents' pro-ecological attitude. The results reveal the respondents' overall support for a pro-environmental worldview, and that parents who are older, more educated and live in the city are more likely to have a pro-environmental attitude.

TI  - The Carbon Sink of Mangrove Ecological Restoration between 1988-2020 in Qinglan Bay, Hainan Island, China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the world's largest reactive carbon reservoir, the ocean plays a critical role in global climate change. Among coastal plant ecosystems, mangroves have the highest carbon storage efficiency and are prone to the impact of anthropogenic activities. In this study, taking the mangrove wetland of Qinglan Bay as an example, we extracted information on mangrove coastal surface change from 1988 to 2020 based on multi-temporal Landsat remote sensing data through field ground surveys and laboratory analysis and used the InVEST model to calculate the spatial and temporal structure of blue carbon in the mangrove area to investigate the effects of mangrove change in an ecological restoration context. The result shows that the overall area of mangrove forests exhibited a decreasing trend from 1988 to 2020, and the area of mangroves decreased from 1559.34 ha to 737.37 ha of which 52.71% was transformed into aquiculture, construction, and farm land. Accordingly, the mangrove carbon sinks from 1988 to 2020 were significantly reduced and the carbon stock decreased at an annual tendency from 1,025,901.71 tons to 712,118.69 tons. With the implementation of mangrove restoration, the decline of mangrove forests has decreased since 2003, promoting the stabilization and enhancement of carbon sinks in the mangrove wetlands of Qinglan Bay. The results of this study provide a technical method to evaluate the carbon sink contribution of mangrove wetland restoration in Hainan Province, a scientific basis and methodological innovation to monitor the carbon sink of mangrove cover change in larger regions of China, a theoretical basis to select criteria for mangrove restoration, and a scientific and systematic management strategy for ecological and mangrove restoration on Hainan Island.

TI  - Analysis of Global Sea Level Change Based on Multi-Source Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global sea level rise is both a major indicator and consequence of global warming. At present, global warming is causing sea level rise in two main ways: one is the thermal expansion of sea water, and the other is the injection of large amounts of fresh water into the ocean after glaciers and ice sheets melt. In this paper, satellite altimeter data are used to study the total changes of global sea level from 2002 to 2020. Different from most previous studies, this study proposes a calculation method of sea level anomaly using only the along track altimetry data, which is similar to considering the satellite points as tide gauges, in order to avoid the error caused by interpolation in the map data. In addition, GRACE satellite data are used to calculate the changes of global sea level caused by water increase; temperature and salinity data are used to calculate the changes from ocean thermal expansion. Next, using satellite altimetry data, the calculation results show that the global sea level rise rate in the period of 2002-2020 is 3.3 mm/a. During this period, the sea level change caused by the increase of sea water calculated with GRACE satellite data is 2.07 mm/a, and that caused by the thermal expansion of seawater is 0.62 mm/a. The sea level rise caused by the increase of water volume accounts for 62.7% of the total sea level rise.

TI  - Selection of Lunar South Pole Landing Site Based on Constructing and Analyzing Fuzzy Cognitive Maps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) of the lunar south pole have never been directly sampled. To explore and discover lunar resources, the Chinese lunar south pole exploration mission is scheduled to land in direct sunlight near the PSR, where sampling and analysis will be carried out. The selection of sites for lunar landing sampling sites is one of the key steps of the mission. The main factors affecting the site selection are the distribution of PSRs, lunar surface slopes, rock distribution, light intensity, and maximum temperature. In this paper, the main factors affecting site selection are analyzed based on lunar multi-source remote sensing data. Combined with previous engineering constraints, we then propose a comprehensive multi-factor fuzzy cognition and selection model for the lunar south site selection. An analytical model based on a fuzzy cognitive map algorithm is also established. Furthermore, to make a preliminary landing area selection, we determine the evaluation index for the candidate landing areas using fuzzy reasoning. Using the proposed model and combined scoring index, we also verify and analyze the prominent impact craters at the lunar south pole. The scores of de Gerlache (88.48 degrees S 88.34 degrees W), Shackleton (89.67 degrees S 129.78 degrees E), and Amundsen (84.5 degrees S, 82.8 degrees E) craters are determined using fuzzy interference as 0.816, 0.814, and 0.784, respectively. Moreover, using our proposed approach, we identify feasible landing sites around the de Gerlache crater close to the PSR to facilitate discovery of water ice exposures in future missions. The proposed method is capable of evaluating alternative landing zones subject to multiple engineering constraints on the Moon or Mars based on the existing data.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Dynamics and Sensitive Distance Identification of Light Pollution in Protected Areas Based on Muti-Source Data: A Case Study of Guangdong Province, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems in protected areas (PAs) are facing new challenges from light pollution. Timely assessment of light pollution in protected areas and exploration of its characteristics are positively valuable for biodiversity conservation and sustainable development. As the province with the largest number of nature reserves and the richest biodiversity in China, Guangdong's protected areas have faced more severe light pollution threats in recent years along with rapid urbanization. Hence, in this study, the temporal trends and spatial distribution of light pollution changes, the correlation between light pollution and human activities, and the sensitive distance induced by light pollution in PAs of Guangdong Province from 2000 to 2018 were analyzed based on nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing data, land-use data, and POI data. The results show that: (1) Overall, the light pollution within the PAs increased significantly in these years, with the mean value of NTL (MNTL) increasing from 8.04 to 15.21 nanoWatt/cm(2)/sr. The number of PAs affected by light pollution was 900 in 2018, accounting for 83% of the total. (2) From the perspective of spatial distribution, the PAs in the Pearl River Delta suffered from the highest intensity of light pollution. Specifically, the MNTL of PAs within the Pearl River Delta was 5.8 times and 2.8 times higher than that in northern Guangdong in 2000 and 2018, respectively. (3) There is a significant correlation between human activities and NTL in PAs within 100 km, and the most sensitive distance is within 40 km, especially the sensitivity within 20 km is much higher than that between 30-40 km. The findings of this study will provide a reference for the implementation of external lighting control and guidance measures to mitigate light pollution in protected areas in Guangdong Province.

TI  - Water Surface Mapping from Sentinel-1 Imagery Based on Attention-UNet3+: A Case Study of Poyang Lake Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The mapping of water surfaces is important for water resource and flood monitoring. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images can be used to monitor water bodies and detect floods over large areas. To address the problem of low identification accuracy in different time phases and different scales of water area, a water surface mapping method based on Attention-UNet3+ with SAR images is proposed in this paper. In the model, full-scale skip connections are introduced for combining feature maps from different scales and improving the accuracy of narrow water identification; the spatial attention module is used to obtain the importance of each connected feature, which can reduce the number of false alarms caused by speckle noise and water shadows in SAR data; the deep supervision module is used to learn hierarchical representative features from comprehensive aggregated feature maps to provide the periodic output capability of the model and meet the needs of rapid and large-scale water identification. The effectiveness of Attention-UNet3+ is verified by experiments in the Poyang Lake region with Sentinel-1 SAR images. The results show that the proposed Attention-UNet3+ outperforms the conventional threshold segmentation and deep learning models such as UNet, Deepvlabv3+, and SegNet, with an average IOU/Kappa value of 0.9502/0.9698. Multitemporal Sentinel-1 images in 2021 covering Poyang Lake are used for time series water surface mapping with the proposed method, and it is found that the detected water area of Poyang Lake has a good correlation with the corresponding water level values at observation stations. The Pearson coefficients are about 0.96. The above results indicate that the proposed method achieves good water surface mapping performance.

TI  - Automatic Supraglacial Lake Extraction in Greenland Using Sentinel-1 SAR Images and Attention-Based U-Net
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With global warming, supraglacial lakes play an important role in ice sheet stability and climate change. They are not only the main factors affecting mass balance and sea-level rise but also the key units of surface runoff storage and mass loss. To automatically map the spatiotemporal distribution of supraglacial lakes in Greenland, this paper proposes an attention-based U-Net model with Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. The extraction results show that compared with the traditional network, this method obtains a higher validation coefficient, with an F1 score of 0.971, and it is spatiotemporally transferable, able to realize the extraction of supraglacial lakes in complex areas without ignoring small lakes. In addition, we conducted a case study in the Jakobshavn region and found that the supraglacial lake area peaked in advance between spring and summer due to extreme melting events from 2017 to 2021. Meanwhile, the supraglacial lakes near the 79 degrees N Glacier tended to expand inland during the melting season.

TI  - DSNUNet: An Improved Forest Change Detection Network by Combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing images to detect forest changes is of great significance for forest resource management. With the development and implementation of deep learning algorithms in change detection, a large number of models have been designed to detect changes in multi-phase remote sensing images. Although synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have strong potential for application in forest change detection tasks, most existing deep learning-based models have been designed for optical imagery. Therefore, to effectively combine optical and SAR data in forest change detection, this paper proposes a double Siamese branch-based change detection network called DSNUNet. DSNUNet uses two sets of feature branches to extract features from dual-phase optical and SAR images and employs shared weights to combine features into groups. In the proposed DSNUNet, different feature extraction branch widths were used to compensate for a difference in the amount of information between optical and SAR images. The proposed DSNUNet was validated by experiments on the manually annotated forest change detection dataset. According to the obtained results, the proposed method outperformed other change detection methods, achieving an F1-score of 76.40%. In addition, different combinations of width between feature extraction branches were analyzed in this study. The results revealed an optimal performance of the model at initial channel numbers of the optical imaging branch and SAR image branch of 32 and 8, respectively. The prediction results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately predicting forest changes and suppressing cloud interferences to some extent.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring and Analytical Evaluation of Grasslands in the Muli Region of Qinghai, China from 2000 to 2021
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The mining area in the Muli region, Qinghai Province, China, is an important source of water and an ecological security barrier in the Qilian Mountains region and has a very important ecological status. A series of ecological problems such as vegetation degradation and loss of biodiversity caused by mining have attracted widespread attention. In this paper, we used Landsat secondary data from 2000 to 2021 from the Muli region to obtain the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of the vegetation in the Muli region by inversion of the fractional vegetation cover, above-ground biomass and the land surface phenology to comprehensively analyze the ecological changes in the vegetation in the Muli region. The results showed the following: (1) the above-ground biomass and cover of grassland in the Muli region showed a decreasing trend between 2000 and 2021, with a particularly pronounced decrease in grassland cover between 2009 and 2016; (2) the start of the vegetation growth cycle, i.e., the beginning of the vegetation growing season (SOG) became more advanced, the end of the vegetation growing season (EOG) was delayed, and the length of the growing cycle (LOG) became longer for most of the vegetation in the Muli region; (3) the results of this comprehensive analysis showed that the grassland in the Muli region showed dynamic changes with complex characteristics from 2000 to 2021, and anthropogenic disturbances had some influence on ecological indicators such as fractional vegetation cover and biomass. The extension of the vegetation growing season might be related to climate change. Based on the results of this paper, it is recommended to utilize biomass and fractional vegetation cover as indicators to assess the grass growth status of mining sites. This study analyzed the spatial and temporal characteristics of grasslands in the Muli area with several indicators, which will help relevant departments continue to improve and optimize ecological restoration measures. In addition, this study provides a reference for achieving comprehensive restoration of the ecological environment and ecological functions in mining areas.

TI  - Vegetation Productivity and Precipitation Use Efficiency across the Yellow River Basin: Spatial Patterns and Controls
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid and semi-arid climate zones, understanding the spatial patterns and biogeographical mechanisms of net primary production (NPP) and precipitation use efficiency (PUE) is crucial for assessing the function and stability of ecosystem services, as well as directing ecological restoration. Although the vegetation coverage has changed dramatically after the construction of several ecological restoration projects, due to limited observation data, fewer studies have provided a thorough understanding of NPP and PUE's recent spatial patterns and the controlling factors of different vegetation types in the Yellow River Basin (YRB). To narrow this gap, we integrated remote-sensing land-cover maps with long-term MODIS NPP and meteorological datasets to comprehend NPP and PUE spatial patterns in YRB. Furthermore, we applied structural equation models (SEM) to estimate the effect intensity of NPP and PUE controlling factors. The results showed that along geographical coordinates NPP and PUE decreased from southeast to northwest and trends were roughly consistent along latitude, longitude, and elevation gradients with segmented patterns of increasing and decreasing trends. As for climate gradients, NPP showed significant linear positive and negative trends across the mean annual precipitation (MAP) and the arid index (AI), while segmented changes for PUE. However, the mean annual average temperature (MAT) showed a positive slope for below zero temperature and no change above zero temperature for both NPP and PUE. SEM results suggested that AI determined the spatial pattern of NPP, whereas PUE was controlled by MAP and NPP. As the AI becomes higher in the further, vegetation tends to have decreased NPP with higher sensitivity to water availability. While artificial vegetation had a substantially lower NPP than original vegetation but increased water competition between the ecosystem and human society. Hence further optimization of artificial vegetation is needed to satisfy both ecological and economic needs. This study advanced our understanding of spatial patterns and biogeographic mechanisms of NPP and PUE at YRB, therefore giving theoretical guidance for ecological restoration and ecosystem function evaluation in the face of further climate change.

TI  - A Simple Band Ratio Library (BRL) Algorithm for Retrieval of Hourly Aerosol Optical Depth Using FY-4A AGRI Geostationary Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) is one of the primary payloads aboard the FY-4A geostationary meteorological satellite, which can provide high-frequency, wide coverage, and multiple spectral channel observations for China and surrounding areas. There are currently few studies on aerosol optical depth (AOD) inversion from FY-4A AGRI data. Based on AGRI data, a new land AOD retrieval algorithm called the band ratio library (BRL) algorithm was proposed in this study. The monthly average surface reflectance band ratio library was established after obtaining the relationship of band surface reflectance ratio from the MODIS combined AOD dataset. In order to calculate the hourly AOD, look-up tables (LUT) for the various aerosol models were constructed using the 6SV model. We quantitatively compared AOD produced from AGRI data with AERONET ground observations to validate the BRL algorithm. AGRI-retrieved AOD is in good agreement with AOD measured by AERONET, which has a correlation coefficient of R is 0.84, the linear regression function is AOD(AGRI) = 0.80 * AOD(AERONET) - 0.004, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is 0.16, and approximately 60% of the AGRI AOD results fall within the uncertain range of AOD = +/-(0.2 x AOD(AERONET) + 0.05). A cross-comparison was made with the MODIS AOD product provided by NASA. The comparison and verification show the proposed algorithm has a good accuracy of land AOD estimation from AGRI data.

TI  - Haze Pollution in the Unstable Atmospheric Boundary Layer Over the West Bank of Taiwan Strait Induced by Regional Transport of PM<sub>2.5</sub>
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the regional transport of particulate matter (PM2.5) leading to air pollution in Fuzhou, in the west bank of the Taiwan Strait (WBTS), which has a relatively good air quality with a lower aerosol optical depth than that of East China. The continental polluted aerosol zone over the coast of East China was identified as an aerosol transport belt, and the daily aerosol dynamics observed by MODIS remote sensing indicated the southward transport of fine particulate matter to the WBTS along the coast. The external air pollutants from regional transport contributed 84% of the PM2.5 detected in Fuzhou, while only 16% due to local emissions of air pollutants. The northerly winds of the cold front drove the southward transport of polluted air masses along the coast of the northwest Pacific from the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) to the WBTS. The vertical mixing of air pollutants from the upper boundary layer to the surface layer could be conducive to regional-transport-induced haze pollution in this coastal area of the WBTS. Fuzhou is considered a receptor region of PM2.5 transport in Eastern China, and the source region is mainly from the YRD. The results of this study have significant implications on determining the source of pollution and controlling local air quality for good air quality regions. This study also shed some light on using multi-satellites to fill the surface observation gaps in coast or nearshore areas, and to confirm the characteristics and passways of aerosol transport.

TI  - Genetic Algorithm Captured the Informative Bands for Partial Least Squares Regression Better on Retrieving Leaf Nitrogen from Hyperspectral Reflectance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen is a major nutrient regulating the physiological processes of plants. Although various partial least squares regression (PLSR) models have been proposed to estimate the leaf nitrogen content (LNC) from hyperspectral data with good accuracies, they are unfortunately not robust and are often not applicable to novel datasets beyond which they were developed. Selecting informative bands has been reported to be critical to refining the performance of the PLSR model and improving its robustness for general applications. However, no consensus on the optimal band selection method has yet been reached because the calibration and validation datasets are very often limited to a few species with small sample sizes. In this study, we address the question based on a relatively comprehensive joint dataset, including a simulation dataset generated from the recently developed leaf scale radiative transfer model (PROSPECT-PRO) and two public online datasets, for assessing different informative band selection techniques on the informative band selection. The results revealed that the goodness-of-fit of PLSR models to estimate LNC could be greatly improved by coupling appropriate band-selection methods rather than using full bands instead. The PLSR models calibrated from the simulation dataset with informative bands selected by genetic algorithm (GA) and uninformative variable elimination (UVE) method were reliable for retrieving the LNC of the two independent field-measured datasets as well. Particularly, GA was more effective to capture the informative bands for retrieving LNC from hyperspectral data. These findings should provide valuable insights for building robust PLSR models for retrieving LNC from hyperspectral remote sensing data.

A1  - Neisseria Gonorrhoeae Surveillance
TI  - Antimicrobial Susceptibility of <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> Isolates From Peru, 2018 and 2019
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Currently, in Latin America, including Peru, the treatment of gonorrhea is still empiric and information regarding antimicrobial resistance is scarce in some countries because of the limited resources, which can contribute to the rising rates of reported multidrug-resistant gonococcal strains. In that context, it is mandatory to continuously monitor and report antimicrobial resistance in N. gonorrhoeae to update treatment recommendations. Methods This descriptive study analyzed genital and anal samples from symptomatic patients who attended 15 sexually transmitted infections health facilities from 8 different regions in Peru during the years 2018 to 2019 within the framework of Sentinel Surveillance. After establishing the presumptive diagnosis, the isolates were sent to the Laboratory of Sexually Transmitted Bacteria of the National Institute of Health of Peru in Lima where the species were confirmed (N = 165) and susceptibility profiles were determined. Results Among the 165 isolates, 95.2% corresponded to male patients, between 18 and 22 years of age (40.6%), half reported having a sexual partner and being heterosexual. Clinically, 89.7% manifested the presence of urethral exudate. Microbiology showed 95.2% of the isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin and 9.1% non-susceptible to azithromycin. Reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone and cefixime was observed in 1.2% and 3.6% of the isolates respectively. All strains tested were susceptible to spectinomycin. Conclusions This study demonstrated that in Peru, fluoroquinolones should not be recommended or used in N. gonorrhoeae infections due to the high percentage of resistant strains. In addition, nationwide access to gonococcal resistance testing, molecular diagnostics and antimicrobial stewardship should be implemented to control the spread of gonococcal antimicrobial resistance.

TI  - Using Remote Sensing Methods to Study Active Geomorphologic Processes on Cantabrian Coastal Cliffs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gravitational processes on inaccessible cliffs, especially in coastal areas, are difficult to study in detail with only in situ techniques. This difficulty can be overcome by the complementary application of remote sensing methods. This work focuses on an active complex landslide affecting the slope of the Tazones Lighthouse (Cantabrian coast, North Iberian Peninsula), which has been monitored since June 2018. The aim of this research is to establish a conceptual model of the internal structure of the slope. A remote multitechnique approach was applied, including landscape deformation analysis from photogrammetric surveys, ground motion detection applying A-DInSAR techniques and Sentinel-1 satellite data, and electrical resistivity tomography. The obtained results showed the great potential of some of the remote techniques, such as UAV photogrammetry and electrical tomography, and the ineffectiveness of others, such as A-DInSAR, which failed to provide adequate results due to the profuse vegetation. This work made it possible to establish a geological model of the functioning of the slope of the Tazones Lighthouse and to deduce the surface extent of the destabilized mass (70,750 m(2)), the rupture surface shape (stepped), its in-depth extent (10-50 m), the volume of materials involved (similar to 3,550,000 m(3)) and the type of landslide (complex including a predominant translational slide). The combination of field and remote sensing data significantly increased the possibility of reaching a comprehensive geological interpretation of landslides on rocky coasts.

TI  - Multiscale feature fusion network for automatic port segmentation from remote sensing images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, remote sensing image observation technology has developed rapidly. Extracting coastlines from remote sensing images has become an indispensable means of port area measurement. Port segmentation from remote sensing images is an important method of coastline extraction and measurement. The remote sensing images used are panchromatic remote sensing images. Due to complex remote sensing image scenes and the large difference in feature information at different scales, traditional segmentation methods cannot perform effective extraction, and it is difficult to accurately segment the coastline in remote sensing images. We propose a multiscale feature fusion network for automatic port segmentation from remote sensing images. First, to reduce the redundant parameters and complex operation problems in traditional convolutional neural networks, we propose using MobileNetv2 as the base network for feature extraction to achieve a lightweight model. Then aiming at the feature differences of remote sensing images at different scales, we present atrous convolution as a convolution method for the entire network and combine a multiscale feature fusion method to extract the features of remote sensing images and improve the feature extraction ability. To reduce the problem of ships calling at the port being easily mistaken for port area and causing false segmentation, we propose a method of eliminating the ship area to reduce the interference. Finally, the comprehensive evaluation of a large number of Google port remote sensing data shows that compared with existing methods, the proposed method has the characteristics of being lightweight and having high precision.

TI  - Data Fusion of AIRS and CrIMSS Near Surface Air Temperature
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a near surface air temperature (NSAT) fused data product over the contiguous United States using Level 2 data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder, on the Aqua satellite, and the Cross-track Infrared Microwave Sounding Suite (CrIMSS), on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite. We create the fused product using Spatial Statistical Data Fusion, a procedure for fusing multiple data sets by modeling spatial dependence in the data, along with ground station data from NOAA's Integrated Surface Database (ISD) which is used to estimate bias and variance in the input satellite data sets. Our fused NSAT product is produced twice daily and on a 0.25 degrees latitude-longitude grid. We provide detailed validation using withheld ISD data and comparison with ERAS-Land reanalysis. The fused gridded product has no missing data; has improved accuracy and precision relative to the input satellite data sets, and comparable accuracy and precision to ERAS-Land; and includes improved uncertainty estimates. Over the domain of our study, the fused product decreases daytime bias magnitude by 1.7 and 0.5 K, nighttime bias magnitude by 1.5 and 0.2 K, and overall RMSE by 35% and 15% relative to the AIRS and CrIMSS input data sets, respectively. Our method is computationally fast and generalizable, capable of data fusion from multiple data sets estimating the same quantity. Finally, because our product reduces bias, it produces long-term data sets across multi-instrument remote sensing records with improved bias stationarity, even as individual missions and their data records begin and end.Plain Language Summary We have used a data fusion technique called spatial statistical data fusion (SSDF) to create an improved near surface air temperature (NSAT) data set by fusing two separate satellite data sets. NSAT is important for a variety of applications, such as drought, wildfire, and extreme heat research and prediction. The two input NSAT data sets come from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument on the Aqua satellite, and the Cross-track Infrared Microwave Sounding suite on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite. Our fused NSAT product is produced twice daily and on a 0.25 degrees latitude-longitude grid. We also performed a detailed validation using withheld reference data (which was not included in the bias-correction data) and comparison with ERAS-Land reanalysis. The new fused product has no missing data; has improved accuracy and precision relative to the input satellite data sets, and comparable accuracy and precision to ERAS-Land; and includes improved uncertainty estimates. SSDF is computationally fast and generalizable, capable of data fusion from multiple data sets so long as they estimate the same quantity. Finally, because our product reduces bias, it provides a means of creating high-quality continuous long-term data sets across the years, as individual satellite missions and their data records begin and end.

TI  - Impact of Fengyun-3E Microwave Temperature and Humidity Sounder Data on CMA Global Medium Range Weather Forecasts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the polarization characteristics of the newly launched Fengyun-3E (FY-3E) microwave sounding instruments are discussed, and its data quality is also assessed using one month of observation by the double-difference method. By comparison with the equivalent channels onboard Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) and advanced technology microwave sounder (ATMS), the data quality of FY-3E Microwave Humidity Sounder-II (MWHS-II) is improved and comparable to ATMS, while the data of FY-3E Microwave Temperature Sounder-III (MWTS-III) are slightly worse than data of FY-3D. The data of FY-3E MWTS-III are more susceptible to the early-morning orbit than the data of MWHS-II. In addition, striping noise is still present in channels 5-10 of MWTS-III. After the assessments, FY-3E microwave data are preprocessed and assimilated in the global forecast system for the Chinese Meteorology Administration (CMA-GFS). A total of six individual experiments over the period from 16 July to 15 August 2021 were conducted and the impact was evaluated with the composite score used in operation. It is shown that not only the forecasts for the southern hemisphere and tropics are improved significantly, but also the predictions for the northern hemisphere show some improvements in an overall neutral change from adding FY-3E microwave sounding instruments. The impact of FY-3E microwave radiance is equivalent to ATMS as they are assimilated individually. Furthermore, we note that the forecast impact is affected by the cloud detection scheme to a large extent.

TI  - Using Machine Learning to Extract Building Inventory Information Based on LiDAR Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The extraction of building inventory information is vital for damage assessment and planning and modelling studies. In the last few years, the conventional data extraction for building inventory was overcome using various remote sensing data and techniques. The main objectives of this study were to supply the necessary data for the structural engineers to calculate the seismic performance of existing structures. Thus, we investigated light detection and ranging (LiDAR) derivatives data to classify buildings and extract building inventory information, such as different heights of the buildings and footprint area. The most important data to achieve this was also investigated and classified using machine learning methods, such as Random Forest, Random Tree, and Optimized Forest, over the object-based segmentation results. All of the machine learning methods successfully classified the buildings with high accuracy, whereas the other methods outperformed RT. The height and footprint area results show that the archived sensitivity of the building inventory information is sufficient for the data to be further used in different applications, such as detailed structural health monitoring. Overall, this study presents a methodology that can accurately extract building information. In light of the results, future studies can be directed for investigations on determining the construction year using remote sensing data, such as multi-temporal satellite imagery.

TI  - Road extraction through digital processing and visual interpretation of satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Road extraction plays an important role in urban planning and city extension issues, as well as in road monitoring, traffic management and map updating. Technological advances may offer a wealth of data and techniques that could be implemented in road delineation and extraction, as well as in change detection projects. Among the various methods that have been developed for this purpose, remote sensing techniques and especially digital processing of satellite data could contribute significantly in this direction. This paper presents the study of a road network which concerns the city of Kastoria located in northwestern Greece and its surrounding area. The special character of the road network is closely related to the city's cultural value which is depicted in its structure. Satellite images of various spatial resolutions were employed for digital processing. Landsat 8 imagery was used in order to detect and delineate the linear features through spatial enhancement, while Landsat 5 images were used to detect changes over time through visual interpretation. Semi-automatic techniques were applied to SPOTmaps products to extract the road network, while an object-oriented approach was applied to QuickBird imagery in order to combine the spatial components with spectral properties. Through semi-automatic digitization and object-oriented workflows, the export of the studied part of the road network in vector format was achieved, thus facilitating the process and reducing the required time. The resulted data are efficient in road network delineation and could be combined with other data for road maintenance and extension, change detection issues, as well as for cultural and touristic purposes.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Gene Expression Signature Predicts Recurrence-Free Survival in Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Despite a negative SLN status, patients with Stage IIB/IIC melanoma demonstrate poor melanoma-specific survival when compared to Stage IIIA patients. In this study, we hypothesized that a molecular profile at the level of the SLN would provide potential insights into risk of disease recurrence and serve as a prognostic biomarker of patient outcomes regardless of the presence of SLN melanoma metastases. Gene expression profiling was performed on SLN biopsies using U133A 2.0 Affymetrix gene chips. Our study suggests a novel 12-gene SLN signature risk score which may predict disease recurrence in cutaneous melanoma patients managed with wide excision of the primary tumor and SLN biopsy. We sought to develop a sentinel lymph node gene expression signature score predictive of disease recurrence in patients with cutaneous melanoma. Gene expression profiling was performed on SLN biopsies using U133A 2.0 Affymetrix gene chips. The top 25 genes associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS) were selected and a penalized regression function was used to select 12 genes with a non-zero coefficient. A proportional hazards regression model was used to evaluate the association between clinical covariates, gene signature score, and RFS. Among the 45 patients evaluated, 23 (51%) had a positive SLN. Twenty-one (46.7%) patients developed disease recurrence. For the top 25 differentially expressed genes (DEG), 12 non-zero penalized coefficients were estimated (CLGN, C1QTNF3, ADORA3, ARHGAP8, DCTN1, ASPSCR1, CHRFAM7A, ZNF223, PDE6G, CXCL3, HEXIM1, HLA-DRB). This 12-gene signature score was significantly associated with RFS (p < 0.0001) and produced a bootstrap C index of 0.888. In univariate analysis, Breslow thickness, presence of primary tumor ulceration, SLN positivity were each significantly associated with RFS. After simultaneously adjusting for these prognostic factors in relation to the gene signature, the 12-gene score remained a significant independent predictor for RFS (p < 0.0001). This SLN 12-gene signature risk score is associated with melanoma recurrence regardless of SLN status and may be used as a prognostic factor for RFS.

TI  - A suggested climate service for cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea - Comparing three monitoring methods
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dense blooms of filamentous cyanobacteria are recurrent phenomena in the Baltic Sea, with occasional negative effects on the surrounding ecosystem, as well as on tourism, human health, aquaculture, and fisheries. Estab-lishing a climate service is therefore suggested; including multi-method observations of cyanobacteria biomass, biodiversity, and biogeography, in correspondence to biotic and abiotic factors. Three different approaches were compared for determination of spatial and temporal variability and trends of the blooms; 1) microscopy-based long-term data, 2) satellite remote sensing, and 3) phycocyanin fluorescence mounted on a merchant vessel. Firstly, microscopy-based data on cyanobacteria biomass from the period 2000-2020 showed that the toxin producing genus Nodularia and non-toxic Aphanizomenon both had summer means of 15 mu g C L-1, while Doli-chospermum was less dominant with a mean of 8 mu g C L-1. Some years also the Kattegat was affected by cya-nobacteria blooms, likely transported here by ocean currents. Secondly, the satellite remote sensing time series for the period 2002-2020 indicated that near surface blooms were most frequent in the Northern Baltic Proper and that near surface blooms have increased in the Bothnian Sea, starting later in the season than in the Baltic Proper. The largest extents (i.e., total area covered) were observed in 2005, 2008, and 2018. Thirdly, phyco-cyanin fluorescence from a flow through sensor mounted on a merchant vessel was used as a proxy for cyano-bacteria biomass and correlated to cyanobacteria biomass estimated by microscopy. However, the satellite remote sensing data on surface accumulations showed little resemblance to the data on cyanobacteria biomass based on water sampling and microscopy, interpreted as an effect of methods. Sensors on satellites mainly detect surface accumulations of cyanobacteria while the microscopy data was based on samples 0-10 m, thereby comprising a larger community. Data from satellite remote sensing of cyanobacteria was correlated to the phycocyanin fluorescence indicating that similar bio-optical properties are observed. Finally, results from a downscaled ocean climate model (NEMO-Nordic) were used to produce future scenarios for temperature and salinity, which directly affects cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea, supposedly by increasing in abundance and change in species composition. Short-term forecasts can be used together with observations for early warning of cyanobacteria blooms, and we suggest an internationally coordinated cyanobacteria observation and warning system for the Baltic Sea area.

TI  - A fast and accurate DE-formula algorithm to evaluate Ambartsumian-Chandrarasekhar <i>H</i>-function for isotropic scattering
T2  - ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present work, a compact, fast, and yet accurate algorithm is developed to calculate the numerical values of the Ambartsumian-Chandrasekhar's H-function for isotropic scattering and its moments on the basis of the double exponential (DE) formula of Takahashi and Mori (RIMS, Kyoto Univ., 9:721, 1974). The main improvement made in the new method is an elimination of the iterative procedure for automatic adjustment of the step-size of integrations carried out with the DE-formula. Instead, a set of optimal values for the upper limit of integration T-max and the number of division points N-T to specify the step-size of the quadrature is predetermined for calculations of the H-function with a 15-digit accuracy, and also another for the evaluations of the moments with an accuracy of 14-digits or better. FORTRAN90 subroutines HFISCA for the H-function and HFMOMENT for the moments of arbitrary degrees are subsequently constructed (their source codes and a driver together with a sample set of output are shown in Appendix of this paper). Tables of sample calculations of the H-function and its moments of degree -1 through 6 carried out by these programs are also presented. The routines HFISCA and HFMOMENT should prove useful not only in astrophysical applications but also in other disciplines of science such as the electron transports in condensed matter and remote-sensing data analyses. A request for a copy of the Fortran 90 source code of the program can be made by writing to kawabata@rs.kagu.tus.ac.jp.

TI  - Using Soil, Plant, Topographic and Remotely Sensed Data to Determine the Best Method for Defining Aflatoxin Contamination Risk Zones within Fields for Precision Management
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Contamination of crops by aflatoxins (AFs) is a real risk in the South-Eastern USA. Contamination risk at the county level based on soil type and weather in different years has been investigated. However, defining AFs contamination risk zones within fields has not yet been attempted. Drought conditions, particularly within the month of June have been linked to high levels of AFs contamination at the county level. Soil characteristics and topography are the factors influencing drought status that vary most within fields. Here, soil, plant, topography and remotely sensed information are used to define AFs contamination risk zones within two fields using different approaches. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data were used to indicate potential droughty areas and thermal IR data from LandSat imagery were used to identify hot areas. Topographic variables were also computed. Comparison tests showed that a combination of regression analysis of soil, plant and imagery data and bi-variate local Moran's I analysis of NDVI and Thermal IR data from several years was the best way to define zones for mean and maximum AFs levels. An approach based on principal components analysis of soil, plant and imagery data from 2010, a high-risk year, was best for defining zones for minimum AFs levels. Analysis of imagery from several years suggested that the zones are likely to be relatively stable in time and could be defined using only freely available sensor, topographic and soil series data. Once defined, such zones can be managed to increase profitability and reduce waste.

TI  - Digital mapping of soil texture classes for efficient land management in the Piedmont plain of Iran
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate prediction of digital soil maps allows for the evaluation of larger areas with respect to the design of efficient land management plans at the regional scale. Nowadays, there is an increasing demand for high spatial resolution-gridded soil data for crop planning and management because it saves time and costs. One of the most essential soil physical properties affecting water holding capacity, nutrient availability and crop growth is soil texture. It exhibits a high spatial variability, but accurate maps for larger scales are lacking. The aim of this research was to produce gridded maps of soil texture fractions (clay, silt and sand) using regression-based approaches and to establish soil texture classes using classification-based techniques for the semi-arid Piedmont plain of Iran. To this end, a digital elevation model and derived topographic indices, vegetation and soil-based indices generated from 4-year timeseries of remote sensing products of Landsat 8 OLI were used as covariates. The decision tree (linear) and its improved version of random forest (nonlinear) algorithms were used for both the regression and classification analysis. For both algorithms, the topography-based indices and remotely sensed products were the most important predictors for the soil particle fractions. For the estimation of the different textural classes with multiple algorithms, we recorded a moderate overall accuracy rate of 54% and a Kappa coefficient of 17% for the validation datasets. It was observed that the nonlinear classification method of the random forest was more effective, and this was also the case for the regression modelling. In general, the random forest algorithm produced a more useful gridded map to help to design regional management plans based on soil properties.

TI  - Hydrological responses to land use/land cover change in Tikur Wuha Watershed in Southern Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its diverse environmental impacts, change in land use/ land cover (LU/LC) has become a global concern. LU/LC change is a critical factor that directly impacts watershed hydrology. The study intends to assess the LU/LC dynamics and their impacts on the streamflow of the Tikur Wuha watershed (TWW) in Ethiopia. LU/LC change was assessed using Landsat images. Each image is classified using a maximum likelihood algorithm of the supervised classification method. The Soil and Water Assessment Tools (SWAT) model were used to examine the impact of LU/LC change on streamflow. The overall accuracy of the LU/LC maps ranged from 77.50 to 87.33%. The findings demonstrated an increase in built-up and cultivated areas and a decrease in shrubland, grassland, swampy areas, and water bodies. The calibration and validation results showed a reasonable performance rate of the SWAT model. The LU/LC changes, which occurred between 1978 and 2017, had increased the average annual streamflow by 8.12%, 9.78%, and 14.77% between 1978 and1988, 1978 and 1998, 1978 and 2017. The Kiremt season flow increased by 9.80% during the first half of the study period (1978-1998) and by 5.41% in the second half (1998-2017). It is risen by 15.74% in 2017 compared to in 1978. The observed changes in the streamflow have resulted from LU/LC changes in the TWW. The study suggests that quick action is required to manage the LU/LC shift and execute land use planning to ensure water availability in the watershed.

TI  - Developing a Spatiotemporal Model to Forecast Land Surface Temperature: A Way Forward for Better Town Planning
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The change in the local climate is attributed primarily to rapid urbanization, and this change has a strong influence on the adjacent areas. Lahore is one of the fast-growing metropolises in Pakistan, representing a swiftly urbanizing cluster. Anthropogenic materials sweep the usual land surfaces owing to the rapid urbanization, which adversely influences the environment causing the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) effect. For the analysis of the SUHI effect, the parameter of utmost importance is the Land Surface Temperature (LST). The current research aimed to develop a model to forecast the LST to evaluate the SUHI effect on the surface of the Lahore district. For LST prediction, remote sensing data from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and the Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensor are exploited. Different parameters are used to develop the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. In the present investigation, for the prediction of LST, the input parameters to the model included 10 years of LST data (2009 to 2019) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), road density, and elevation. Data for the year 2020 are used to validate the outcomes of the LSTM model. An assessment of the measured and model-forecasted LST specified that the extent of mean absolute error is 0.27 K for both periods. In contrast, the mean absolute percentage error fluctuated from 0.12 to 0.14%. The functioning of the model is also assessed through the number of pixels of the research area, classified based on the error in the forecasting of LST. The LSTM model is contrasted with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to evaluate the skill score factor of the LSTM model in relation to the ANN model. The skill scores computed for both periods expressed absolute values, which distinctly illustrated the efficiency of the LSTM model for better LST prediction compared to the ANN model. Thus, the LST prediction for evaluating the SUHI effect by the LSTM model is practically acceptable.

TI  - Lymph node tattooing for targeted axillary dissection in postneoadjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionSentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for patients with breast cancer with their axilla showing clinically node-positive disease (CN+ve) reduces morbidity and provides a higher quality of life by sparing axillary lymph node dissection for those patients whose axillary status changed from (CN+ve) to (CN0) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. SLNB results are not encouraging in post-NACT setting; however, when it is combined with excision of previously marked positive LN, during targeted axillary dissection (TAD), identification rate (IR), and false-negative rate (FNR) are improved. The authors used suspended carbon particles (Blackeye ink) for preoperative LN marking, being a cheap alternative. Initial findings on TAD procedure following NACT on tattooed LNs and also the findings of SLNB by injecting 1% methylene blue (MB) were reported.Patients and methodsA total of 40 patients with locally advanced breast cancer who were converted from cN+ to cN0 following NACT were divided into group A (20 patients), where TAD was performed and tattooed pathologically proven positive nodes besides SLNs were dissected, and group B (20 patients) for whom only SLNB using 1%MB was done. Backup axillary LN dissection was performed in all patients. The authors then compared IR and FNR in both groups.ResultsBlackeye ink was identified during surgery as a black stain on LNs. When the authors compared the results of TAD with SLNB, the authors found that diagnostic performance of TAD had the highest values, with FNR of 8.3% versus 15.3% in the SLNB group.ConclusionTAD using Blackeye ink and 1%MB has high IR and low FNR. It improves the accuracy of post-NACT axillary staging at very low cost.

TI  - Prediction of Axial Capacity of Concrete Filled Steel Tubes Using Gene Expression Programming
T2  - MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The safety and economy of an infrastructure project depends on the material and design equations used to simulate the performance of a particular member. A variety of materials can be used in conjunction to achieve a composite action, such as a hollow steel section filled with concrete, which can be successfully utilized in the form of an axially loaded member. This study aims to model the ultimate compressive strength (P-u) of concrete-filled hollow steel sections (CFSS) by formulating a mathematical expression using gene expression programming (GEP). A total of 149 datapoints were obtained from the literature, considering ten input parameters, including the outer diameter of steel tube (D), wall thickness of steel tube, compressive strength of concrete (f(c)'), elastic modulus of concrete (E-c), yield strength of steel (f(v)), elastic modulus of steel (E-s), length of the column (L), confinement factor (zeta), ratio of D to thickness of column, and the ratio of length to D of column. The performance of the developed models was assessed using coefficient of regression R-2, root mean squared error RMSE, mean absolute error MAE and comparison of regression slopes. It was found that the optimal GEP Model T3, having number of chromosomes N-c = 100, head size H-s = 8 and number of genes N-g = 3, outperformed all the other models. For this particular model, R-overall(2) equaled 0.99, RMSE values were 133.4 and 162.2, and MAE = 92.4 and 108.7, for training (TR) and testing (TS) phases, respectively. Similarly, the comparison of regression slopes analysis revealed that the Model T3 exhibited the highest R-2 of 0.99 with m = 1, in both the TR and TS stages, respectively. Finally, parametric analysis showed that the P-u of composite steel columns increased linearly with the value of D, t and f(y).

TI  - Soil toxic elements determination using integration of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images: Effect of fusion techniques on model performance*
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Finding an appropriate satellite image as simultaneous as possible with the sampling time campaigns is challenging. Fusion can be considered as a method of integrating images and obtaining more pixels with higher spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions. This paper investigated the impact of Landsat 8-OLI and Sentinel-2A data fusion on prediction of several toxic elements at a mine waste dump. The 30 m spatial resolution Landsat 8OLI bands were fused with the 10 m Sentinel-2A bands using various fusion techniques namely hue-saturationvalue (HSV), Brovey, principal component analysis (PCA), Gram-Schmidt (GS), wavelet, and area-to-point regression kriging (ATPRK). ATPRK was the best method preserving both spectral and spatial features of Landsat 8-OLI and Sentinel-2A after fusion. Furthermore, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model developed on genetic algorithm (GA)-selected laboratory visible-near infrared-shortwave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) spectra yielded more accurate prediction results compared to the PLSR model calibrated on the entire spectra. It was hence, applied to both individual sensors and their ATPRK-fused image. In case of the individual sensors, except for As, Sentinel-2A provided more robust prediction models than Landsat 8-OLI. However, the best performances were obtained using the fused images, highlighting the potential of data fusion to enhance the toxic elements' prediction models.

TI  - Multicentric Breast Cancer of the Axillary and Pectoral Breasts: A Case Report and Literature Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Multicentric cancer of the pectoral and ectopic breasts is extremely rare, and diagnosing this malignancy remains challenging because axillary breast cancer is easily misdiagnosed as lymph node metastasis. Moreover, there are no established treatment guidelines for this disease. We present our experience with a multicentric breast cancer patient who showed different responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and underwent surgical treatments that differed from those in previous studies. In our case, the preoperative imaging of both lesions and subsequent core needle biopsy of each lesion were crucial, as these procedures confirm the diagnosis and help decide the chemotherapy regimen based on the subtype. After NAC, the patient underwent right breast-conserving surgery, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and excision of accessory breast tissue in the right axilla. SLNB should be the initial step in staging multicentric breast cancer, unless imaging scan shows evidence of lymph node metastasis.

TI  - OneMap Drought Monitoring Analysis Based on Statistical Models
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - As the effects of droughts on agriculture and industrial water availability intensify with climate change, developing suitable drought prevention and mitigation measures has become increasingly important. However, measuring drought conditions using different indices leads to disjointed drought management responses by ministries and agencies. Additionally, indices based on only one variable are insufficient to accurately assess drought conditions. Therefore, creating and adopting a OneMap drought index would be beneficial in the assessment of drought conditions and the implementation of appropriate measures. In this study, we used multivariate statistical modeling using Bayesian principal component analysis to develop a OneMap drought index that unifies existing measures of drought conditions, including meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological drought indices. After evaluating the accuracy of the corrected OneMap drought index based on the self-organizing migrating algorithm optimization technique, it was found that the applicability of the OneMap drought index and its ability to regenerate drought were excellent for ground and satellite data. Therefore, the authors recommend implementing step-by-step drought management action plans using the integrated index to generate drought forecasts and warnings, thus promoting concerted and effective responses of local governments and authorities.

TI  - Interannual changes of land surface conditions in Asian dust source regions since 2000
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Taklimakan and Gobi deserts and the Loess Plateau in China and Mongolia are generally recognized source areas for Asian dust. However, dust emissions depend on meteorological factors such as air pressure and land surface conditions, and precise information on land surface conditions in the dust source areas and the frequency of dust events in Japan is lacking. In this study, interannual changes of land surface conditions in the springtime since 2000 were examined in a target source region (35 degrees N-50 degrees N, 100 degrees E-120 degrees E). Back trajectory analysis results showed that most dust trajectories of the past 10 years mainly followed three routes passing over this target region. Both the number of Asian dust events observed in Japan and the area with a threshold wind speed Ut of <10 m s-1 in the target region significantly decreased after 2000. Further, the area of Ut < 10 m s-1 and the number of events were significantly correlated. These results may reflect a decrease in the bare land surface area, which is associated with dust outbreaks.

TI  - Mapping the probability of freshwater algal blooms with various spectral indices and sources of training data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Algal blooms are pervasive in many freshwater environments and can pose risks to the health and safety of humans and other organisms. However, monitoring and tracking of potentially harmful blooms often relies on in-person observations by the public. Remote sensing has proven useful in augmenting in situ observations of algal concentration, but many hurdles hinder efficient application by end users. First, numerous approaches to estimate aquatic chlorophyll-alpha are available and can produce inconsistent results. Second, lack of quantitative in situ observations limits opportunities to train models for specific waterbodies, such that models developed for other systems must be used instead. We (1) implement univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the probability that aquatic chlorophyll-a concentrations exceed an accepted threshold beyond which harmful effects become likely and (2) evaluate the use of visually classified bloom/no-bloom satellite imagery to augment in situ training data. Using a binary classification of aquatic chlorophyll-alpha exceeding 10 mu g/L, we found that (1) logistic regression models were similar to 80% accurate, (2) univariate models trained with visually classified data produce nearly the same accuracy (79%) as models trained with in situ observations (80%), and (3) augmenting in situ chlorophyll-alpha observations with visual classifications outperformed (82% accuracy) models trained on in situ observations alone (80% accuracy). These results provide a framework for evaluating multiple spectral indices in retrieving algal bloom presence or absence and illustrate that training data derived directly from satellite imagery can be useful in augmenting in situ observations.

TI  - Cooling by Cyprus Lows of Surface and Epilimnion Water in Subtropical Lake Kinneret in Rainy Seasons
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Comparison between high-precipitation (HP) years and low-precipitation (LP) years led to our main findings which are as follows: Cyprus lows are instrumental in the cooling of surface and epilimnion water in subtropical Lake Kinneret and in the cooling of eastern Mediterranean surface water. Cyprus lows are responsible for cold weather, rainfall, and for an increase in cloudiness causing a decrease in solar radiation over the eastern Mediterranean and north Israel (including Lake Kinneret). In the daytime, comparison between HP and LP years of Kinneret surface water temperature (SWT) and epilimnion water temperature (WT) showed water cooling of up to 2 degrees C in HP years. This study was carried out using the 21-year period of satellite and in-situ data: (1) MODIS 1 km x 1 km resolution records of SWT, in (2) shipboard measurements of WT vertical profiles down to a depth of similar to 40 m (2000-2020). We found that a decrease in solar radiation caused by Cyprus lows (due to an increase in cloudiness) was the main factor contributing to Kinneret water cooling. In winter (December-January) when solar radiation (SR) was minimal, no water cooling was observed: the WT difference between HP and LP years was insignificant. However, in spring (March-April) when SR increased and became the main factor contributing to water heating, water cooling was observed: SWT and epilimnion WT, averaged over the HP years, was lower by similar to 2 degrees C and similar to 1.4 degrees C, respectively, than SWT and epilimnion WT, averaged over the LP years. Not only was water cooling observed in Lake Kinneret, but also in eastern Mediterranean surface water. Comparison of SWT over the eastern Mediterranean between the same HP and LP years in spring showed SWT cooling by similar to 1.2 degrees C. This is evidence of the regional character of the daytime water-cooling phenomenon caused by Cyprus lows.

TI  - Power spectrum of domain-wall network, and its implications for isotropic and anisotropic cosmic birefringence
T2  - JOURNAL OF COSMOLOGY AND ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, based on a novel analysis of the Planck satellite data, a hint of a uniform rotation of the polarization of cosmic microwave background photons, called isotropic cosmic birefringence, has been reported. The suggested rotation angle of polarization of about 0.2- 0.4 degrees is close to the fine-structure constant, alpha ' 1/137 rad ' 0.42 deg. Interestingly, this coincidence can be naturally explained over a very wide parameter range by the domain walls of axion-like particles. Furthermore, the axion-like particle domain walls predict not only isotropic cosmic birefringence but also anisotropic one that reflects the spatial distribution of the axion-like particle field on the last scattering surface. In this paper, we perform lattice simulations of the formation and evolution of domain walls in the expanding universe and obtain for the first time the two-point correlation function and power spectrum of the scalar field that constitutes the domain walls. We find that for initial fluctuations at subhorizon scales, the power spectrum is roughly consistent with analytical predictions based on random wall distributions. However, there is some excess at scales corresponding to the Hubble radius. Applying our results to the anisotropic cosmic birefringence, we predict the power spectrum of the rotation angles induced by the axion-like particle domain walls for the similar initial condition, and show that it is within reach of future observations of the cosmic microwave background.

AB  - We reported on laboratory imaging experiments conducted using a system that utilizes amplitude-modulated infrared laser light at microwave frequencies. With modulations ranging from 11.1 to 15.1 GHz on a 1.55 mu m near-infrared laser, the phase measurements of the modulation signals revealed a target shape with sub-mm precision. We also tested whether our system is able to achieve cross-range resolution in the spot-light mode synthetic aperture scheme. With the aid of "position-compensated signal processing", synthetic aperture images were formed successfully. According to predications based on the principle of normal synthetic aperture radar, the spatial resolutions of the images were shown to be inversely proportional to the width of the collected data placed in the wavenumber space.

TI  - The Approximate Analytical Solution for the Top-of-Atmosphere Spectral Reflectance of Atmosphere-Underlying Snow System over Antarctica
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The analytical solutions of the radiative transfer equation are needed for the solution of various applied atmospheric and snow optics problems. In this paper, we propose a simple analytical equation for the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) spectral reflectance. To simplify the problem under study we consider the case of Antarctica, where both snow and atmosphere are almost free of pollutants. This work is focused on the simulation of the moderate spectral resolution TOA measurements (1 nm or so) and the spectral range 400-1000 nm. The values of the coefficient of variance (CV) between the measured by the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on board Sentinel-3A and modelled spectra are smaller than 10% for most cases in Antarctica. There are regions in Eastern Antarctica, where the values of CV are smaller than 5%. The areas with larger deviations between measured and retrieved spectra could be due to the presence of clouds or structures on the snow surface not captured by the proposed model.

M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosol characterization experiments were conducted, for the first time, over AC-Ahmednagar, a semi-urban location in south-west India, using a multi-spectral solar radiometer from January 2016 to May 2018. The MODIS/Terra retrieved Level-2 daily swath AOD(550 nm) data sets during 2011-2021 were also used to infer long-term behaviour of columnar aerosols at AC-Ahmednagar. The daily-averaged, Microtops II Sun photometer measured AOD(500 nm) and AOD(1020 nm) and MODIS retrieved AOD(550) nm reveal a discernible wide spectrum of variability in their magnitudes. Magnitude-wise, AODs at both the wavelengths depict an increasing trend of about 0.05 year(-1) (AOD(500 nm)) and 0.03 year(-1) (AOD(1020 nm)). However, MODIS AOD(550 nm) illustrates statistically insignificant increasing trend of about 0.007 year(-1). Microtops II Sun photometer derived Angstrom exponent (AE) depicts a noticeable day-to-day variability with respect to its overall mean value (1.06 +/- 0.30) indicating the presence of diversesized aerosols. The AOD500 nm against AE440-870 nm contour density map analysis qualitatively characterizes different aerosol types prevalent in the atmospheric column. The weighted PSCF (WPSCF) analysis for AOD performed on a seasonal basis reveals the presence of possible contribution of long-range transported plumes of varied aerosols on different scales and types from a variety of emission sources from different regions.

AB  - Wildfires are a significant threat to environmental, social, economic and agricultural systems. This study investigated the spatiotemporal trends in wildfire activity and its interactions with climate and environmental factors in Cote d'Ivoire through remotely sensed MODIS data associated with climate, biophysical and anthropogenic data. We analysed relationships between wildfire occurrence and climate drivers using cross-correlations, while Pearson chi-squared and Kruskal-Wallis tests were selected to identify linkages between qualitative and quantitative environmental data, respectively. Seasonal Kendall and Sen's slope approaches were applied for trend analysis. During the period 2001-2019, 8150 wildfires were recorded annually, burning 2.69 million hectares per year, representing about 8.34% of Cote d'Ivoire. Fire detections and burnt areas highlighted a downward trend in all ecoregions with a predominance in the Sudanian zone. Wildfire occurrence showed a significant and strongly negative link with relative humidity and visibility, as well as a significant and positive correlation with maximum temperature, thermal amplitude and vapour-pressure deficit. Also, the spatial distribution of wildfires was significantly conditioned by environmental factors. The findings of this study will help decision makers and managers to make decisions to reduce the vulnerability of local populations to current and future wildfire hazards.

TI  - Assessment of Fire Regimes and Post-Fire Evolution of Burned Areas with the Dynamic Time Warping Method on Time Series of Satellite Images-Setting the Methodological Framework in the Peloponnese, Greece
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are considered to be an important part of numerous terrestrial ecosystems and vegetation types, being also a significant factor of ecosystem disruption. In this sense, fires play an important role in the structure and function of the ecosystems. Biomes are characterized by a specific type of fire regime, which is a synergy of the climate conditions and the characteristics of the vegetation types dominating each biome. The assessment of burned areas and the identification of the fire regimes can be implemented with freely available low- to high-resolution satellite data as those of Landsat and Sentinel-2. Moreover, the biomes are characterized by the phenology, a useful component for vegetation monitoring, especially when time series of satellite images are used. Both the identification of fire regime by reconstructing the fire history and the monitoring of the post-fire evolution of burned areas were studied with remote sensing methods. Specifically, the present paper is a pilot study implemented in a Mediterranean biome, aimed at establishing the methodological framework to (i) define fire regimes, (ii) characterize the phenological pattern of the vegetation (pre-fire situation) of the fire-affected areas, and (iii) compare the phenology of the recovered fire-affected areas with the corresponding one of the pre-fire situation. At the global level, based on MODIS fire perimeters, we found that fires are occurring at 70% in the tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands, followed by fires at tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests by 7% and by fires at deserts and xeric shrublands by 6.5%.

TI  - Internal Solitary Waves in the White Sea: Hot-Spots, Structure, and Kinematics from Multi-Sensor Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A detailed picture of internal solitary waves (ISWs) in the White Sea is presented based on an analysis of historical spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and field measurements. The major hot-spot of ISW generation locates in the southwestern (SW) Gorlo Strait (GS), characterized by the presence of strong tides, complex topography, and two distinct fronts. Here, pronounced high-frequency isopycnal depressions of 5-8 m were regularly observed during flood and flood/ebb slackening. Other regions of pronounced ISW activity are found near Solovetsky Islands and in the northwestern Onega Bay. The spatial and kinematic properties of the observed ISWs are linked to water depth, with larger wave trains and higher propagation speeds being observed over the deep regions. Direct estimates of ISW propagation speeds from sequential and single SAR images agree well, while theoretical ones obtained using a two-layer model overestimate the observed values by 2-3 times. This is explained by the effective modulation of ISW propagation speed during the tidal cycle by background currents that are not accounted for in the model. Enhanced values of diapycnic diffusion coefficient in the pycnocline layer were registered near the frontal zones, where intense 14-17 m high ISWs were regularly observed.

TI  - Estimating Groundnut Yield in Smallholder Agriculture Systems Using PlanetScope Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield is related to household food security and community resilience, especially in smallholder agricultural systems. As such, it is crucial to accurately estimate within-season yield in order to provide critical information for farm management and decision making. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to assess the most appropriate method, indices, and growth stage for predicting the groundnut yield in smallholder agricultural systems in northern Malawi. We have estimated the yield of groundnut in two smallholder farms using the observed yield and vegetation indices (VIs), which were derived from multitemporal PlanetScope satellite data. Simple linear, multiple linear (MLR), and random forest (RF) regressions were applied for the prediction. The leave-one-out cross-validation method was used to validate the models. The results showed that (i) of the modelling approaches, the RF model using the five most important variables (RF5) was the best approach for predicting the groundnut yield, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.96 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.29 kg/ha, followed by the MLR model (R-2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.84 kg/ha); in addition, (ii) the best within-season stage to accurately predict groundnut yield is during the R5/beginning seed stage. The RF5 model was used to estimate the yield for four different farms. The estimated yields were compared with the total reported yields from the farms. The results revealed that the RF5 model generally accurately estimated the groundnut yields, with the margins of error ranging between 0.85% and 11%. The errors are within the post-harvest loss margins in Malawi. The results indicate that the observed yield and VIs, which were derived from open-source remote sensing data, can be applied to estimate yield in order to facilitate farming and food security planning.

T2  - WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article suggests a method of mapping the natural and anthropogenic landscapes of river deltas based on satellite imagery in the publicly accessible information system Google Earth. In this system, images from the Landsat satellite help to identify a common landscape contour network. The contours are interpreted using super-high resolution images QuickBird and GeoEye, which are included in the system. Using detailed information for overview mapping with a hundred-times difference between the scales of interpretation and the drawn maps poses certain difficulties. The article considers different variants of the given method on the example of mapping the deltas of the Niger, Indus, Irrawaddy, Zambezi and the Huanghe River.

TI  - A Deep Neural Network Method for Water Areas Extraction Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water bodies on the Earth's surface are an important part of the hydrological cycle. The water resources of the Kerch Peninsula at this moment can be described as a network with temporary streams and small rivers that dry up in summer. Partially, they are often used in fisheries. But since permanent field monitoring is quite financially and resource-intensive, it becomes necessary to find a way for the automated remote monitoring of water bodies using remote sensing data. In this work, we used remote sensing data obtained using the Sentinel-2 satellite in the period from 2017 to 2022 during the days of field expeditions to map the water bodies of the Kerch Peninsula. As a training data set for surface water prediction, field expeditions data were used. The area for test data collection is located near Lake Tobechikskoye, where there are five water bodies. The Keras framework, written in Python, was used to build the architecture of a deep neural network. The architecture of the neural network consisted of one flattened and four dense layers fully connected. As a result, it achieved a model prediction accuracy of 96% when solving the problem of extracting the area of the water surface using remote sensing data. The obtained model showed quite good results in the task of identifying water bodies using remote sensing data, which will make it possible to fully use this technology in the future both in hydrological studies and in the design and forecasting of fisheries.

TI  - Language representation of negative emotional states in works by Lyudmila Petrushevskaya
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents an interpretation of the linguistic means of expressing negative emotional states in Lyudmila Petrushevskaya's works included in the collections Don't Get in a Car with Two People and Wanderings About Death. The aim of this research is to identify the features of the language representation of negative emotional states in Petrushevskaya's stories. Approximately 400 statements with the semantics of an emotional state were revealed in the collections; 90% of them describe the characters' negative experiences. The main research methods are descriptive, linguo-stylistic text analysis, and linguistic modeling. The analysis shows that the semantic model of an emotional state is represented by a wide range of language means that express the characters' negative emotions and experiences: fear, anger, annoyance, grief, sadness, aggression, longing, resentment, despair, etc. The linguistic model of the situation of an emotional state represented in Petrushevskaya's stories includes three main components - the predicate of the state, the subject and the causator, and two optional components - the locative and the temporative. The peculiarity of an emotional state is that it belongs to unobservable phenomena, limited in time, possessing a static feature and lacking volitional activity of the subject (carrier) of the state. The author describes the linguistic means of representing the main components of the proposition of the state: the predicate, the subject (or carrier) of the state, and the causator; emphasizes the importance of local and temporal characteristics that actualize a particular emotional state; reveals the expressive ways of nominating emotions, which verbalize the writer's worldview. The author also notes that intensifiers (standard and specific) and various stylistic means promote the linguistic expression of negative emotions: parcellation, rhetorical questions, addresses, lexical repetitions, etc. Based on the analysis, the author concludes that negative emotional states, among which fear prevails (127 statements), are characteristic for Petrushevskaya's works. The representation of basic emotions (fear, anger, sadness, etc.) shows the writer's perception of reality: the world is dangerous and cruel. The characters who find themselves in difficult and hopeless situations are on the verge of despair; therefore, in the works, both men and women suffer equally with "anguish". The linguistic representation of negative emotions in the analyzed stories reflects the general specifics of the writer's style of narration. Statements with the semantics of an emotional state are full of neologisms, substandard vocabulary, complex constructions, contradictions and oppositions, inappropriate detailing and abrupt transitions.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Forest Burnt Area, Burn Severity, and Post-Fire Recovery: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Wildland fires dramatically affect forest ecosystems, altering the loss of their biodiversity and their sustainability. In addition, they have a strong impact on the global carbon balance and, ultimately, on climate change. This review attempts to provide a comprehensive meta-analysis of studies on remotely sensed methods and data used for estimation of forest burnt area, burn severity, post-fire effects, and forest recovery patterns at the global level by using the PRISMA framework. In the study, we discuss the results of the analysis based on 329 selected papers on the main aspects of the study area published in 48 journals within the past two decades (2000-2020). In the first part of this review, we analyse characteristics of the papers, including journals, spatial extent, geographic distribution, types of remote sensing sensors, ecological zoning, tree species, spectral indices, and accuracy metrics used in the studies. The second part of this review discusses the main tendencies, challenges, and increasing added value of different remote sensing techniques in forest burnt area, burn severity, and post-fire recovery assessments. Finally, it identifies potential opportunities for future research with the use of the new generation of remote sensing systems, classification and cloud performing techniques, and emerging processes platforms for regional and large-scale applications in the field of study.

TI  - TRANSFORMATION OF THE TRADITIONAL RELIGIOSITY OF THE UKRAINIAN PEASANTRY (1920S - 1930S): CONCEPTUALIZATION OF RESEARCH PROBLEM
T2  - EMINAK
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the research paper is to highlight the set of circumstances and factors that caused the transformation of the peasantry traditional religiosity and to emphasize the interdependence of the processes in the event-contextual and mental-conscious spheres/dimensions.Scientific novelty: Despite the rather thorough scientific analysis of the issue, the dominance of the positivist approach is observed in historiography; therefore, the conceptualization of the problem makes it possible to understand the non-fragmentary factual multiplicity of certain plots, which evinced in one way or another the transformations of religiosity in the social and cultural space of the 1920s - 1930s, but it allows to clarify and generalize the reasons, nature, dynamics, and essential characteristics of the processes related to the transformation of religiosity under the new social and cultural conditions of the communist-atheist power.Conclusions. There is a certain dependency between the architectonics of human existence and the worldview benchmarks of a certain era. Therefore, not only anti-religious and anti-church propaganda (as a means of ideological influence), but also the socio-economic and political development of society (industrialization, collectivization, cultural revolution, renewal of everyday life, etc.) destroyed the former stable world of customs and rituals. Therefore, it is obviously worth talking not about the transformation of religiosity, but about complex transformations.The nature of the religiosity transformational processes depended on many factors. In the context of the eroding of old church doctrines, the revision of fixed moral and ethical norms, the onset of atheism, in the eyes of Christians, the stable world was degrading, losing sanctified traditions and moral standards. Religious integrity and the durability of religious culture were lost. In search of compensation for the emerging worldview uncertainty, anxiety, dissatisfaction, etc., the individual looked for new benchmarks, values, ideals, and ways of organizing life in society through the transformation of stable forms and ways of life. In the confrontation of two worldview cultural models, society, having undergone complex transformations, slowly adapted to the conditions established by the communist regime and its worldview instructions.

TI  - Influence of the Geographic Channel Effect on PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations over the Taipei Basin in Relation to Continental High-Pressure Systems during Winter
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In addition to the Taiwan Strait, the geographical channel effect (GCE) has been observed in the Taipei Basin during winters. This study explored the potential links amongst GCE phenomena in the basin, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) events, and position of the continental high-pressure system (CHPS). Principal component analysis was applied to classify the CHPS distribution patterns influencing PM2.5 concentrations and meteorological parameters in the Taipei metropolis. In addition, non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis and Dwass-Steel-Critchlow-Fligner tests were applied to compare the parameters amongst distinct groups. Moreover, track analysis was utilised to trace the trajectories of air masses. The merged Dark Target Aerosol Angstrom Exponent (Ocean), Deep Blue Aerosol Angstrom Exponent (Land), and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) 3 km (Land and Ocean) of Terra/MODIS and Aqua/MODIS were used to confirm the connection of long-range PM2.5 transport. Two features in the atmospheric environment induce double GCEs: (1) wind direction below 90 degrees in most of the upwind area of the Taisumi and Xindian River Basins; (2) CHPS centres moved across 110 degrees E. Double GCEs can reduce the magnitude of PM2.5 air pollution and shape the distribution of PM2.5; however, they cannot prevent PM2.5 events.

TI  - Assessing the feasibility of Landsat satellite data in monitoring water body and shoreline change along the coast of Keta
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This research explores the use of freely available multispectral Earth Observation (EO) data to monitor changes in shorelines and banks along the Keta coastline and lagoon. The researchers acquired multispectral Landsat images from the years 1986, 1991, 2013, 2015, and 2018 to delineate their respective shorelines and lagoon banks using two water extraction based indices: Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). When overlaid, the delineated water body and shoreline agree with their respective satellite images on Google earth. After the shoreline delineation, researchers used the open-source DSAS shoreline change analysis tool compatible with ArcGIS 10.1 to assess the coastline change rate along the Keta shoreline. A significant change in the shoreline was observed during the different years over the study period. The two shoreline change analyses, End Point Rate (EPR) and Linear Regression Rate (LRR) produced similar results with varying degrees of change. The delineated shoreline positions show a 1.64 m/yr. and 2.22 m/yr. mean erosion rate for EPR and LRR, respectively, between 1991-2018. The shoreline change rate agrees with recent literature, proving that EO data in water bodies and shoreline monitoring is a viable alternative to in situ data.

TI  - On the Use of Sentinel-2 NDVI Time Series and Google Earth Engine to Detect Land-Use/Land-Cover Changes in Fire-Affected Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess the potential of Sentinel-2 NDVI time series and Google Earth Engine to detect small land-use/land-cover changes (at the pixel level) in fire-disturbed environs. To capture both slow and fast changes, the investigations focused on the analysis of trends in NDVI time series, selected because they are extensively used for the assessment of post-fire dynamics mainly linked to the monitoring of vegetation recovery and fire resilience. The area considered for this study is the central-southern part of the Italian peninsula, in particular the regions of (i) Campania, (ii) Basilicata, (iii) Calabria, (iv) Toscana, (v) Umbria, and (vi) Lazio. For each fire considered, the study covered the period from the year after the event to the present. The multi-temporal analysis was performed using two main data processing steps (i) linear regression to extract NDVI trends and enhance changes over time and (ii) random forest classification to capture and categorize the various changes. The analysis allowed us to identify changes occurred in the selected case study areas and to understand and evaluate the trend indicators that mark a change in land use/land cover. In particular, different types of changes were identified: (i) woodland felling, (ii) remaking of paths and roads, and (ii) transition from wooded area to cultivated field. The reliability of the changes identified was assessed and confirmed by the high multi-temporal resolution offered by Google Earth. Results of this comparison highlighted that the overall accuracy of the classification was higher than 0.86.

TI  - The Impact of Land Cover on Selected Water Quality Parameters in Polish Lowland Streams during the Non-Vegetative Period
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The search for the best landscape predictors explaining the spatial variability of stream water chemistry is one of the most important and recent research issues. Thus, in the current study, relationships between land cover indices and selected water quality parameters were evaluated regarding the example of 54 lowland temperate streams located in central Poland. From November 2021 to March 2022, water samples were collected in the monthly timescale, and the concentrations of NH4+, NO3-, and NO2-, as well as electrical conductivity, were correlated with the percentage of land cover types calculated for total catchment area, buffer zones, cut buffer zones, and radius. For such computing, Corine Land Cover 2018 and Sentinel 2 Global Land Cover datasets were used. In the case of both datasets, results indicate significant dependence of NO3-, and NO2- concentrations, as well as EC values on cover metrics. Overall, agricultural lands favored higher concentrations of NO3- and NO2-, whereas mainly coniferous forests reduced nitrogen pollution. Significant correlations were not documented in the case of NH4+ ions, the concentrations of which could be linked to point sources from municipal activity. Correlation performance was slightly better in the case of the S2GLC dataset, while the best spatial scales were generally seen for wider buffer zones (250 and 500 m) and total catchment area. The study provided spatially extensive insight into the impact of land cover predictors at different scales on nitrogen compounds in a lowland landscape.

TI  - Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing of Intertidal Flat Habitats for Migratory Shorebird Conservation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many species of shorebirds migrate long distances from their overwintering grounds in the southern hemisphere to breeding grounds in the northern hemisphere. The coastal intertidal zone, consisting of sand and mud flats exposed at low tide and covered at high tide, is heavily used as a migratory stopover or overwintering habitat. Understanding the spatial distribution of sediment types at these stopover sites is a critical step for understanding habitat use by shorebird species. Due to their importance as overwintering and stopover habitat for the imperiled western Atlantic subpopulation of the shorebird, the red knot (Calidris canutus rufa), as well as other migratory shorebirds, the northern coast of Brazil between Para and Maranhao, and Bahia Lomas in northern Tierra del Fuego, Chile, were selected for further investigation as to the applicability of remotely sensed characterization of the intertidal flat habitats. Examination of the Landsat 8 multispectral reflectance and Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter reveals that sand and mud represent endmembers at opposite ends of a continuous gradient in feature space. While remotely sensed data can be used to discriminate between mud and sand intertidal types, the spectral relationships varied between the two very different geographic locations. The inclusion of both multispectral and radar sensing imagery can lead to important insights about the physical properties of the sediment that would be omitted by using one data source alone. Spectral unmixing techniques in Google Earth Engine were used to map the intertidal zone into general sediment classes spanning the gradient (i.e., mud, sandy mud, muddy sand, and sand). Comparison of the mapped outputs with field reference data suggests that mapping of mud- vs. sand-dominated areas can be accomplished with reasonable accuracy (overall accuracy of 75%).

TI  - Potential of ALOS2 Polarimetric Imagery to Support Management of Poplar Plantations in Northern Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Poplar is one of the most widespread fast-growing forest species. In Northern Italy, plantations are characterized by large interannual fluctuations, requiring frequent monitoring to inform on wood supply and to manage the stands. The use of radar satellite data is proving useful for forest monitoring, being weather independent and sensitive to the changes in forest canopy structure, but it has been scarcely tested in the case of poplar. Here, L-band ALOS2 (Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2) dual-pol data were tested to detect clear-cut plantations in consecutive years. ALOS2 quad-pol data were used to discriminate among different age classes, a much complex task than detecting poplar plantations extent. Results from different machine learning algorithms indicate that with dual-pol data, poplar forest can be discriminated from clear-cut areas with 80% overall accuracy, similar to what is usually obtained with optical data. With quad-pol data, four age classes were classified with moderate overall accuracy (73%) based on polarimetric decompositions, three 3 age classes with higher accuracy (87%) based on HV band. Sources of error are represented by poplar areas of intermediate age when stems, branches and leaves were not developed enough to detect by scattering mechanisms. This study demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring poplar plantations with satellite radar, which represents a growing source of information thanks to already-planned future satellite missions.

TI  - Detection of Waste Plastics in the Environment: Application of Copernicus Earth Observation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of waste plastics in the marine and terrestrial environment using satellite Earth Observation data offers the possibility of large-scale mapping and reducing on-the-ground manual investigation. In addition, costs are kept to a minimum by utilizing free-to-access Copernicus data. A Machine Learning-based classifier was developed to run on Sentinel-1 and -2 data. In support of the training and validation, a dataset was created with terrestrial and aquatic cases by manually digitizing varying landcover classes alongside plastics under the sub-categories of greenhouses, plastic, tyres and waste sites. The trained classifier, including an Artificial Neural Network and post-processing decision tree, was verified using five locations encompassing these different forms of plastic. Although exact matchups are challenging to digitize, the performance has generated high accuracy statistics, and the resulting land cover classifications have been used to map the occurrence of plastic waste in aquatic and terrestrial environments.

TI  - Lived Religion and Religious Market Theory: A Promising Dialogue. A Study of Two Peruvian Pentecostal Churches: Movimiento Misionero Mundial (MMM) and Monte de Oracion (MO)
T2  - REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS SOCIALES
M3  - Article
AB  - To counteract the absence of paradigms that explain Latin American religious transformations from their own models, this article proposes an exploratory dialogue between two interpretative frameworks assumed to be antagonistic: the religious market theory developed in the capitalist system and the lived religion approach. The reflections are illustrated in two different cases from the broad Peruvian Pentecostal spectrum: Monte de Oracion, an independent church, a family business located in a Lima slum, and the World Missionary Movement, a transnational megachurch of Puerto Rican origin with pan-Peruvian aspirations. The lived religion approach leads to an enchanted worldview outside the logic of separation into spheres. It therefore allows the theory of the religious market to be adapted to an environment that continues to function traditionally as a family business or farm, despite having some of the charac-teristics of a globalized market. This approach also reveals that attachment to certain traditions and the existential quest in changing contexts -elements apparently alien to commercial logic- end up shaping a dynamic market. These theories lead us towards the little studied and debated popular Pentecostalism, which destroys certain customs, reinterprets others, and creates new formulas. This religious movement manages to combine an attractive local rootedness for its potential members with international connections that legitimize it in a society in transition.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Forest Burned Area Detection with Various Input Variables: A Case Study of South Korea
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, an increase in wildfire incidents has caused significant damage from economical, humanitarian, and environmental perspectives. Wildfires have increased in severity, frequency, and duration because of climate change and rising global temperatures, resulting in the release of massive volumes of greenhouse gases, the destruction of forests and associated habitats, and the damage to infrastructures. Therefore, identifying burned areas is crucial for monitoring wildfire damage. In this study, we aim at detecting forest burned areas occurring in South Korea using optical satellite images. To exploit the advantage of applying machine learning, the present study employs representative three machine learning methods, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Random Forest (RF), and U-Net, to detect forest burned areas with a combination of input variables, namely Surface Reflectance (SR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). Two study sites of recently occurred forest fire events in South Korea were selected, and Sentinel-2 satellite images were used by considering a small scale of the forest fires. The quantitative and qualitative evaluations according to the machine learning methods and input variables were carried out. In terms of the comparison focusing on machine learning models, the U-Net showed the highest accuracy in both sites amongst the designed variants. The pre and post fire images by SR, NDVI, NBR, and difference of indices as the main inputs showed the best result. We also demonstrated that diverse landcovers may result in a poor burned area detection performance by comparing the results of the two sites.

TI  - Variations in Phytoplankton Primary Production Driven by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation in the East/Japan Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) regime is a major factor not only for the physical properties of the ocean but also for fishery and water resources. However, only a few studies have examined the impact of the PDO on the marine ecosystem in the East/Japan Sea. Therefore, in this study, the relationship between PDO and primary production (PP), and subsequent effects on the marine ecosystem were investigated in the East/Japan Sea using satellite data sets. PDO index showed a negative relationship with sea surface temperature (SST) and the contribution of the small phytoplankton to the total PP during the study period, whereas the mixed layer depth (MLD) and the PP showed a positive relationship with PDO index. The shallower MLD during the negative PDO phase indicates that vertical mixing may be weakened due to the stronger stratification caused by the higher SST than observed during the positive PDO phase. Consequently, we hypothesized that weakened vertical mixing may reduce nutrient supply to the euphotic layer, providing small-sized phytoplankton favored environmental conditions during the negative PDO. It is noteworthy that PDO-induced shoaling of the MLD was mainly observed in winter, which may influence the annual PP of the following year. This study shows that the annual PP in the East/Japan Sea can be largely affected through interactions between SST, MLD and subsequent changes in nutrient regime according to the PDO regime, which subsequently affects potential fishery resources in the East/Japan Sea.

TI  - Sea Water Type Classification Around the Ieodo Ocean Research Station Based On Satellite Optical Spectrum
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN EARTH SCIENCE SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The color and optical properties of seawater are determined by the interaction between dissolved organic and inorganic substances and plankton contained in it. The Ieodo -Ocean Research Institute (I-ORS), located in the East China Sea, is affected by the low salinity of the Yangtze River in the west and the Tsushima Warm Current in the south. Thus, it is a suitable site for analyzing the fluctuations in circulation and optical properties around the Korean Peninsula. In this study, seawater surrounding the I-ORS was classified according to its optical characteristics using the satellite remote reflectance observed with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Aqua and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Dataset (NOMAD) from January 2016 to December 2020. Additionally, the variation characteristics of optical water types (OWTs) from different seasons were presented. A total of 59,532 satellite match-up data (d <= 10 km) collected from seawater surrounding the I-ORS were classified into 23 types using the spectral angle mapper. The OWTs appearing in relatively clear waters surrounding the I-ORS were observed to be greater than 50% of the total. The maximum OWTs frequency in summer and winter was opposite according to season. In particular, the OWTs corresponding to optically clear seawater were primarily present in the summer. However, the same OWTs were lower than overall 1% rate in winter. Considering the OWTs fluctuations in the East China Sea, the I-ORS is inferred to be located in the transition zone of seawater. This study contributes in understanding the optical characteristics of seawater and improving the accuracy of satellite ocean color variables.

TI  - Fast and operational gap filling in satellite-derived aerosol optical depths using statistical techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations, used worldwide in the atmospheric sciences, are extremely useful for providing aerosol information within a wide spatial range. However, the coverage of aerosol data by satellite observations is sometimes of inferior quality because of the effects of surface reflectivity and clouds. To fill the gaps in aerosol optical depths (AODs) retrieved from geostationary ocean color imager observations, this study applies operational statistical techniques, including radial basis functions (RBFs) with four different weightings (i.e., linear, multiquadric, thin-plate, and inverse), Poisson, and ordinary Kriging. Based on computation time and accuracy of the individual gap-filling techniques, Poisson and the liner RBF are selected as the two best methods and then averaged with weights using one-dimensional weighted average (1DWAVG) and two-dimensional weighted average (2D-WAVG) root mean square errors. All methods produce reliable results, yielding a correlation coefficient between 0.74 and 0.87 over the entire research domain. Out of the individual techniques, the Poisson, with an initial estimation from a zonal mean of AODs, is the most accurate with the lowest computational costs, even for a large number of missing pixels and most regions, excluding East China (EC). The Poisson's high bias over EC is compensated in 1D- and 2D-WAVGs by taking more accurate estimations of the linear RBF than those of the Poisson over the region. If we consider 1D- and 2D-WAVGs in our analysis, the highest correlation is obtained from the 2D-WAVG over all regions. Because of its reliability and fast computation time, applying the 2D-WAVG can be a good solution to provide spatial-temporal continuous aerosol information. In addition to air pollution studies, such as real-time air quality predictions, estimation of ground-level particulate matter concentrations, and other applications, the fast and operational gap-filling technique can also be expanded to remote sensing data obtained from satellite observations to provide helpful and useful information for the public.

TI  - Evaluation of Different Modelling Techniques with Fusion of Satellite, Soil and Agro-Meteorological Data for the Assessment of Durum Wheat Yield under a Large Scale Application
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Food and feed production must be increased or maintained in order to meet the demands of the earth's population. Under this scenario, the question that arises is how to address the demand for agricultural products given that the pressures on land use have already increased. In addition, it is obvious that climate change will have a serious negative impact and threaten the productivity and sustainability of food production systems. Therefore, understanding and predicting the outcome of crop production, while considering adaptation and sustainability, is essential. The need for information on decision making at all levels, from crop management to adaptation strategies, is constantly increasing and methods for providing such information are urgently needed in a relatively short period of time. Thus arises the need to use effective data, such as satellite and meteorological data, but also operational tools, to assess crop yields over local, regional, national, and global scales. In this work, three modeling approaches built on a fusion of satellite-derived vegetation indices, agrometeorological indicators, and crop phenology are tested and evaluated in terms of data intensiveness for the prediction of wheat yields in large scale applications. The obtained results indicated that medium input data intensity methods are effective tools for yield assessments. The methods, namely, a semi-empirical regression model, a machine learning regression model, and a process-based model, provided high to moderate accuracies by fully relying on freely available datasets as sources of input data. The findings are comparable with those reported in the literature for detailed field experiments, thereby introducing a promising framework that can support operational platforms for dynamic yield forecasting, operating at the administrative or regional unit scale.

TI  - Trapezoid-based surface soil moisture retrieval using a pixel-to-pixel scheme: A preliminary result over the North China Plain
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The trapezoid configuration constituted by spatially distributed land surface temperature (LST) and fraction vegetation cover (FVC) has been widely used for estimating surface soil moisture (SSM) with satellite data. However, the trapezoid-based methods still suffer from a major challenge that the determination of the trapezoid pixel window is always subjective, because it requires quasi-identical atmospheric conditions to make SSM retrievals for each pixel spatially comparable. Meanwhile, the trapezoid pixel window should also contain full vegetation coverages and SSM dynamics to fulfill the inscape of the trapezoid. Due to the heterogeneity of atmospheric variables and underlying surfaces, it is commonly difficult to determine a proper trapezoid pixel window in practices. The development of the pixel-to-pixel scheme of the trapezoid aims to decrease the dependence of trapezoid-based SSM retrieval on the subjective requirements of quasi-identical atmospheric conditions, full vegetation coverages and SSM dynamics. In the present study, for each pixel over the North China Plain, a unique virtual trapezoid was created and the theoretical boundaries were determined following the principle of surface energy balance where satellite-derived essential atmospheric variables of air temperature, net surface shortwave radiation and relative humidity were provided as inputs. Based on the proposed approach, a daily/5-km SSM dataset during the growing season from April to October in 2016 was produced over the North China Plain. A preliminary evaluation reveals an overall acceptable accuracy of the estimated SSM with root mean square error of -0.06 m(3)/m(3) and -0.08 m(3)/m(3) when comparing to in-situ measurements and microwave SSM product, respectively.

TI  - Comparison of Canopy Cover and Leaf Area Index Estimation from Airborne LiDAR and Digital Aerial Photogrammetry in Tropical Forests
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) has emerged as an alternative to airborne laser scanning (ALS) for forest inventory applications, as it offers a low-cost and flexible three-dimensional (3D) point cloud. Unlike the forest inventory attributes (e.g., tree height and diameter at breast height), the relative ability of DAP and ALS in predicting canopy structural variables (i.e., canopy cover and leaf area index (LAI)) has not been sufficiently investigated by previous studies. In this study, we comprehensively compared the canopy cover and LAI estimates using DAP- and ALS-based methods over 166 selected tropical forest sample plots with seven different tree species and forest types. We also explored the relationship between field-measured aboveground biomass (AGB) and the LAI estimates. The airborne LAI estimates were subsequently compared with the Sentinel-2-based LAI values that were retrieved using a one-dimensional radiative transfer model. The results demonstrated that the DAP-based method generally overestimated the two canopy variables compared to ALS-based methods but with relatively high correlations regardless of forest type and species (R-2 of 0.80 for canopy cover and R-2 of 0.76 for LAI). Under different forest types and species, the R-2 of canopy cover and LAI range from 0.64 to 0.89 and from 0.54 to 0.87, respectively. Apparently, different correlations between AGB and LAI were found for different forest types and species where the mixed coniferous and broad-leaved forest shows the best correlation with R-2 larger than 0.70 for both methods. The comparison with satellite retrievals verified that the ALS-based estimates are more consistent with Sentinel-2-based estimates than DAP-based estimates. We concluded that DAP data failed to provide analogous results to ALS data for canopy variable estimation in tropical forests.

TI  - The Influence of Image Degradation on Hyperspectral Image Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in hyperspectral remote sensing techniques, especially in the hyperspectral image classification techniques, have provided efficient support for recognizing and analyzing ground objects. To date, most of the existing classification techniques have been designed for ideal hyperspectral images and have verified their effectiveness on high-quality hyperspectral image datasets. However, in real applications, available hyperspectral images often contain varying degrees of image degradation. Whether or not the classification accuracy will be reduced due to degradation problems in input data, and how it will be reduced become interesting questions. In this paper, we explore the effects of degraded inputs in hyperspectral image classification including the five typical degradation problems of low spatial resolution, Gaussian noise, stripe noise, fog, and shadow. Seven representative classification methods are chosen from different categories of classification methods and applied to analyze the specific influences of image degradation problems. Experiments are carried out from the aspects of single-type synthetic image degradation and mixed-type real image degradation. Consistent results from synthetic and real-data experiments show that the effects of degraded hyperspectral data in classification are related to image features, degradation types, degradation degrees, and the characteristics of classification methods. This provides constructive information for method selection in real applications where high-quality hyperspectral data are difficult to obtain and encourages researchers to develop more stable and effective classification methods for degraded hyperspectral images.

TI  - The Seasonal and Diurnal Variation Characteristics of Soil Moisture at Different Depths from Observational Sites over the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using observational data of soil moisture from the third Tibetan Plateau Experiment for atmospheric science (TIPEX III), the seasonal and diurnal variations characteristics of soil moisture at different depths of 5-160 cm from seven stations were analyzed, with emphasis on the comparative analysis of the differences of soil moisture between different sites and the differences of the synergistic relationship between soil moisture and temperature. The soil moisture was wet in the southeast and dry in the northwest. The studied sites were Lhari, Biru, Nyainrong, Amdo, Nagqu, Baingoin and Seng-ge Kambab in descending order, according to the soil moisture. The seasonal variation of soil moisture at the different sites showed a significant three-peak structure, which was more obvious in the shallow layer than in the deep layer. The first peak occurred from March to May, which was mainly due to the soil thawing in spring. The other two peaks corresponded to the two rainy seasons in the plateau. Soil moisture was the greatest during this rainy period. The diurnal variations of soil moisture and temperature in Amdo, Nagqu, Nyainrong and Baingoin showed a significant positive correlation in the four seasons. The soil moisture and temperature in Lhari and Biru were significantly positively correlated in winter and spring but negatively correlated in summer and autumn. The profiles of the soil moisture with depth varied greatly at different stations in different seasons. The distribution of soil water content at each observational site did not increase or decrease with depth but showed a certain high aquifer, which might be related to the types of the underlying surface and physical properties of soil. During the summer monsoon period, soil moisture in the shallow layer of 5-10 cm was higher at all observational sites. The spatial distribution of soil moisture in the plateau was more heterogeneous than that in the plain area, and only in the central part of the Tibetan Plateau, the soil moisture varied greatly from site to site. This also indicated that it was unreasonable to only use the soil moisture of several stations to represent the overall soil moisture of the region. The results provided a multi-angle observational basis for the validation of satellite data and parameterization of the numerical model of soil moisture over the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Remote Monitoring of NH<sub>3</sub>-N Content in Small-Sized Inland Waterbody Based on Low and Medium Resolution Multi-Source Remote Sensing Image Fusion
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In applying quantitative remote sensing in water quality monitoring for small inland rivers, the time-frequency of monitoring dramatically impacts the accuracy of time-spatial changes estimates of the water quality parameters. Due to the limitation of satellite sensor design and the influence of atmospheric conditions, the number of spatiotemporal dynamic monitoring images of water quality parameters is insufficient. Meanwhile, MODIS and other high temporal resolution images' spatial resolution is too low to effectively extract small inland river boundaries. To solve the problem, many researchers used Spatio-temporal fusion models in multisource data remote sensing monitoring of ground features. The wildly used Spatio-temporal fusion models, such as FSDAF (flexible spatial-temporal data fusion), have poor performance in heterogeneous changes of ground objects. We proposed a spatiotemporal fusion algorithm SR-FSDAF (Super-resolution based flexible spatiotemporal data fusion) to solve the problem. Based on the FSDAF, it added ESPCN to reconstruct the spatial change prediction image, so as to obtain better prediction results for heterogeneous changes. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results showed that our fusion algorithm obtained better results. We compared the band sensitivity of the images before and after fusion to find out that the sensitive band combination of NH3-N has not changed, which proved that the fusion method can be used to improve the time-frequency of NH3-N inversion. After the fusion, we compared the accuracy of linear regression and random forest inversion models and selected the random forest model with better accuracy to predict the NH3-N concentration. The inversion accuracy of NH3-N was as follows: the R-2 was 0.75, the MAPE was 23.7% and the RMSE was 0.15. The overall concentration change trend of NH3-N in the study area was high-water period < water-stable period < low water period. NH3-N pollution was serious in some reaches.

TI  - Response of NDVI and SIF to Meteorological Drought in the Yellow River Basin from 2001 to 2020
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the response of vegetation to drought is of great significance to the biodiversity protection of terrestrial ecosystem. Based on the MOD13A2 NDVI, GOSIF, and SPEI data of the Yellow River Basin from 2001 to 2020, this paper used the methods of Theil-Sen median trend analysis, Mann-Kendall significance test, and Pearson correlation analysis to analyze whether the vegetation change trends monitored by MODIS and GOSIF are consistent and their sensitivity to meteorological drought. The results showed that NDVI and SIF increased significantly (p < 0.001) at the rate of 0.496 x 10(-2) and 0.345 x 10(-2), respectively. The significant improvement area of SIF (66.49%, p < 0.05) is higher than NDVI (50.7%, p < 0.05), and the spatial distribution trend of vegetation growth monitored by NDVI and SIF is consistent. The negative value of SPEI-12 accounts for 65.83%, with obvious periodic changes. The significant positive correlation areas of SIF-SPEI in spring, summer, and autumn (R > 0, p < 0.05) were 7.00%, 28.49%, and 2.28% respectively, which were higher than the significant positive correlation areas of NDVI-SPEI (spring: 1.79%; summer: 20.72%; autumn: 1.13%). SIF responded more strongly to SPEI in summer, and farmland SIF was significantly correlated with SPEI (0.3424, p < 0.01). The results indicate that SIF is more responsive to drought than NDVI. Analyzing the response of vegetation to meteorological drought can provide constructive reference for ecological protection.

TI  - Extraction of Greenland Ice Sheet buried lakes using multi-source remote sensing data: With application to the Central West basin of Greenland
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Greenland Ice Sheet melts violently in summer, and supraglacial lakes appear in low-lying regions where the meltwater converges. The monitoring of supraglacial lakes is important as they play a key role in modulating the hydrological system and the Greenland Ice Sheet's mass balance. Recent studies show that numerous supraglacial lakes in the Greenland Ice Sheet do not refreeze completely in winter, but existing in the form of liquid water under snow or ice, which are referred as buried lakes. These buried lakes has the potential to impact the stability and mass balance of Greenland Ice Sheet. However, it is difficult to extract and analyse these buried lakes by using the visible images, because they exist under the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet. In this study, we proposed a method to automatically extract the buried lakes by using both the Landsat8 and Sentinel-1 images. This method uses visible images to extract supraglacial lakes in summer to mask the SAR images, and then adopts the Rosin Threshold Segmentation Algorithm to extract buried lakes in the Central West basin of Greenland in the winter of 2018-2019. In addition, we analysed the distribution of these buried lakes by separating the water and ice based on the backscatter coefficient. We extracted the buried lakes in selected 10 test areas with our method and compared the results with those derived from visual interpretation. The results show that our method achieves good performance with the Kappa coefficient being up to 0. 85. Moreover, the area of supraglacial lakes is 102. 28 km(2) in the Central West basin of Greenland in summer of 2018. About 43. 09% of supraglacial lakes occurred in summer do not refreeze completely and becomes the buried lakes (44. 07 km(2)) in winter.

TI  - Variation and Influencing Factors of Cloud Characteristics over Qinghai Lake from 2006 to 2019
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds are an indispensable part of climate change, and the occurrence and development of clouds in the Qinghai Lake area (QHL) have great significance for the regional energy budget and precipitation system. To a certain extent, clouds will affect the water resources, agriculture, animal husbandry, and photovoltaic power industry in this region. In this study, we used CloudSat satellite data, combined with meteorological elements and atmospheric circulation, to analyze the cloud occurrence frequency and cloud water content in QHL. The results demonstrate that the frequency of cloud occurrences in QHL is 33% with a decreasing trend from 2006 to 2019. Altostratus and Nimbostratus are the main types of cloud systems in QHL. The cloud ice water content is 62.21 mg/m(3) and the cloud liquid water content is 261.66 mg/m(3). The highest value of the vertical cloud fraction occurs from March to June, at a height of 7-11 km in QHL. The height of the mixed-phase clouds is approximately 4-8 km and the ice clouds are above 8 km. The vertical distribution of ice particles is relatively dispersed, while the vertical distribution of liquid particles is relatively concentrated. The time and height of high particle effective radius and high particle concentration are consistent with the high value of cloud water content. The decrease in total cloud occurrence frequency in QHL is caused by the increase in temperature. This study helps to clarify the detailed structure of clouds and the distribution of cloud water resources, which has an important reference value for the study of climate change impact and the sustainable development of lake resources in QHL.

TI  - Construction of Urban Green Space Network in Kashgar City, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - With the new round of western development being pushed forward and territorial spatial planning being put into place, northwest China's urbanization rate has sped up. Urbanization will inevitably affect the city's general landscape pattern and features, aggravating the landscape's fragmentation and destroying the urban ecological environment. That threatens the well-being of the residents and the city's biodiversity. Urban green space provides a habitat for the creatures in the city, and its connectivity provides corridors. Researchers and planners have developed green space networks to protect urban biodiversity and satisfy urban residents' needs for recreation and ecologically friendly open space. This study uses RS, GIS, SeNtinel Application Platform (SNAP), and Conefor Sensinode. Applying the landscape connectivity index, least-cost path model, and corridor curvature analysis to identify potential recreation and biodiversity conservation corridors with a reasonable width, identifies good quality green space patches and corridors, or which ones need improvement. The results show that: (1) The patches selected by the possible connectivity index (PC) calculated with a threshold of 100 m in the urban area of Kashgar have higher recreational attributes. (2) There are 24 effective recreational corridors in Kashgar, with a total length of 43.44 km, and 53 effective biodiversity conservation corridors, a total of 78.23 km. Suppose recreational and ecological functions are considered to build a comprehensive green space network. The 50 m recreational corridor is mainly distributed in the center, and the 30 m biodiversity conservation corridor is primarily distributed on edge. (3) We can determine the location of the new green space suitable for protection or development by analyzing the corridor curvature. Through the constructed green space network, we can find that green space planning has severe fragmentation, unfair distribution, and other problems. Based on these issues, optimizing urban green space can promote the connectivity of urban green space. Furthermore, studying the width of corridors suitable for dense urban areas is conducive to protecting urban biodiversity and resident well-being.

TI  - Integrating Multi-Scale Remote-Sensing Data to Monitor Severe Forest Infestation in Response to Pine Wilt Disease
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pine wilt disease (PWD) is one of the most destructive forest diseases that has led to rapid wilting and mortality in susceptible host pine trees. Spatially explicit detection of pine wood nematode (PWN)-induced infestation is important for forest management, policy making, and practices. Previous studies have mapped forest disturbances in response to various forest diseases and/or insects over large areas using remote-sensing techniques, but these efforts were often constrained by the limited availability of ground truth information needed for the calibration and validation of moderate-resolution satellite algorithms in the process of linking plot-scale measurements to satellite data. In this study, we proposed a two-level up-sampling strategy by integrating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys and high-resolution Radarsat-2 satellite imagery for expanding the number of training samples at the 30-m resampled Sentinel-1 resolution. Random forest algorithms were separately used in the prediction of the Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 infestation map induced by PWN. After data acquisition in Muping District during August and September 2021, we first verified the ability of a deep-learning-based object detection algorithm (i.e., YOLOv5 model) in the detection of infested trees from coregistered UAV-based RGB images (Average Precision (AP) of larger than 70% and R-2 of 0.94). A random forest algorithm trained using the up-sampling UAV infestation map reference and corresponding Radarsat-2 pixel values was then used to produce the Radarsat-2 infestation map, resulting in an overall accuracy of 72.57%. Another random forest algorithm trained using the Radarsat-2 infestation pixels with moderate and high severity (i.e., an infestation severity of larger than 0.25, where the value was empirically set based on a trade-off between classification accuracy and infection detectability) and corresponding Sentinel-1 pixel values was subsequently used to predict the Sentinel-1 infestation map, resulting in an overall accuracy of 87.63%, where the validation data are Radarsat-2 references rather than UAV references. The Sentinel-1 map was also validated by independent UAV surveys, with an overall accuracy of 76.30% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.45. We found that the expanded training samples by the integration of UAV and Radarsat-2 strengthened the medium-resolution Sentinel-1-based prediction model of PWD. This study demonstrates that the proposed method enables effective PWN infestation mapping over multiple scales.

TI  - Ground Positioning Method of Spaceborne SAR High-Resolution Sliding-Spot Mode Based on Antenna Pointing Vector
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a new high-resolution spaceborne SAR observation mode, sliding-spot imaging has the characteristics of a large squint, long aperture time, and azimuth aliasing, and because of the dechirp operation in the imaging algorithm of this mode, it is difficult to construct a direct range-Doppler equation for its geometric processing. In this paper a conformation model based on an antenna pointing vector is presented, which fully considers the influence of the dechirp operation on the range image, starts from the relative position of the dechirped range image points and the satellite, and establishes a strict conversion model between the image coordinates and geographic coordinates using the accurate satellite-ground geometric conditions. Then the forward and reverse formulas for geometric processing of the sliding-spot mode are given based on this model. Finally, geometric calibration and positioning experiments under different conditions and field spaceborne SAR data are executed. Results show that after geometric errors caused by the SAR payload have been calibrated and other factors such as atmospheric delay, platform position, and elevation error have been compensated, the uncontrolled geometric positioning accuracy can reach within 1 m-2 m, which fully proves the effectiveness of this method in the geometric positioning of high-resolution sliding-spot images.

TI  - A Land Cover Background-Adaptive Framework for Large-Scale Road Extraction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Road network data are crucial in various applications, such as emergency response, urban planning, and transportation management. The recent application of deep neural networks has significantly boosted the efficiency and accuracy of road network extraction based on remote sensing data. However, most existing methods for road extraction were designed at local or regional scales. Automatic extraction of large-scale road datasets from satellite images remains challenging due to the complex background around the roads, especially the complicated land cover types. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a land cover background-adaptive framework for large-scale road extraction. Method: A large number of sample image blocks (6820) are selected from six different countries of a wide region as the dataset. OpenStreetMap (OSM) is automatically converted to the ground truth of networks, and Esri 2020 Land Cover Dataset is taken as the background land cover information. A fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm is first applied to cluster the sample images according to the proportion of certain land use types that obviously negatively affect road extraction performance. Then, the specific model is trained on the images clustered as abundant with that certain land use type, while a general model is trained based on the rest of the images. Finally, the road extraction results obtained by those general and specific modes are combined. Results: The dataset selection and algorithm implementation were conducted on the cloud-based geoinformation platform Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Google Colaboratory. Experimental results showed that the proposed framework achieved stronger adaptivity on large-scale road extraction in both visual and statistical analysis. The C-means clustering algorithm applied in this study outperformed other hard clustering algorithms. Significance: The promising potential of the proposed background-adaptive network was demonstrated in the automatic extraction of large-scale road networks from satellite images as well as other object detection tasks. This search demonstrated a new paradigm for the study of large-scale remote sensing applications based on deep neural networks.

TI  - Study on the Parameters of Ice Clouds Based on 1.5 μm Micropulse Polarization Lidar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust aerosols can participate in the heterogeneous nucleation process as effective ice nucleation particles, thus changing the physical properties of clouds. In this paper, we used an eye-safe 1550 nm micropulse polarization single photon lidar combined with meteorological stations, HYSPLIT backward trajectory analysis, ERA5 reanalysis data, CALIPSO, Himawari-8 and Terra-MODIS satellite data to compare the difference in cloud characteristics between dust and clean cirrus cases in Jinan from 26-29 March 2022. The study found that the aerosol affected the cloud effective radius, and the cloud top temperature impacted the properties of depolarization of dust ice clouds. According to the statistical results of the upper and lower quartiles, the depolarization ratio (DPR) range of dust cirrus on 26 March was 0.46-0.49, a similar range to the clean cirrus, while that of dust cirrus on 27 March was 0.54-0.59, which seemed much larger. Different height and temperature conditions lead to differences in the habits of ice crystals in clouds, thus changing the DPR. However, the range of the DPR between clean cirrus and dust cirrus showed no obvious difference, as the former was 0.43-0.53 and the latter was 0.46-0.59. Under the condition of higher aerosol loading, the lidar range-corrected signal (RCS) of cirrus clouds was stronger, and the cloud effective radius was 48 mu m, larger than that of clean cirrus (32 mu m). This may be the effect of dust on the microphysical properties of clouds. This study discusses the indirect effects of dust aerosols on cirrus clouds and the underlying mechanisms from the perspectives of microphysics and optics, which can provide more references for urban air pollution processes and aerosol-cloud interactions.

TI  - Spectral index-driven FCN model training for water extraction from multispectral imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial water is a fundamental component of the land surface. Accurate and robust water delineation of surface water is rather challenging due to the high intra-class variability and the spectral similarity with shadows and other dark surfaces. This study proposes a new method called the water index-driven deep fully convolu-tional neural network (WIDFCN) for high-accuracy water delineation with no need to collect samples manually. We formulate water delineation as a semantic labeling problem and solve it by training a deep fully convolu-tional network (FCN), whose capability of effectively extracting multilevel spatial and spectral features is exploited for discriminating water from complex surroundings. The main obstacle of using FCN, which requires a large volume of labeled training samples, is settled by utilizing the water recognition ability of the water spectral index (WI). Specifically, the training samples are automatically generated from WI by extracting a high-precision but incomplete water mask at first, which is then expanded to enhance the completeness. This strategy ensures the high quality of the automatically generated training samples and thus the water extraction performance of the trained FCN model. Twelve test sites from Sentinel-2 imagery with various water delineation challenges all over the world are used to assess the performance relative to that of supervised and unsupervised classification methods and water spectral index thresholding methods, in terms of Kappa coefficient, precision, recall, and F1 -score. Overall, WIDFCN can achieve the highest precision and comparable recall, leading to the best water delineation accuracy with Kappa coefficient 0.9673 and F1-score 0.9696, as well as the lowest fluctuation in terms of various test sites. The results further demonstrate that WIDFCN can effectively deal with the scale and spectra variance of surface water, and has distinct robustness with respect to different kinds of shadows, including building, mountain, and cloud shadows. The findings in this study demonstrate a novel, robust, low-cost, and manual labor-free water delineation method that performs well in terms of both precision and completeness. Moreover, the core idea could provide a reference for extraction of geographic information by utilizing FCN models with no needs of manually labeling costs. Code and data will be available at https://github. com/LZhenShi/WIDFCN.

TI  - Comparison of Forest Stock Volume Inversion Methods Coupled With Multiple Features-A Case Study of Forest in Yarlung Zangbo River Basin
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing monitoring of forest resources is one of the important application directions of remote sensing. Traditional measurement methods cost a lot of workforce and material resources. Scientific forest resource prediction can improve work efficiency and reduce measurement costs. Forest stock volume is an important index to evaluate the quality of forest ecosystems. The forest stock volume inversion model is a mathematical model used to estimate the forest stock volume, which has the functions of learning and prediction. The same ground features are quite different in different light or shadow areas. The band ratio can be used to reduce the error of the results in modeling light and shadow areas to a certain extent. The forest stock volume prediction model usually selects spectral information and texture features as the main modeling factors. It does not fully consider the impact of different models on the prediction accuracy when selecting multi-characteristic variables such as band ratio, vegetation index, and topographic factors. In order to compare the accuracy of different models, this article takes Milin County in Tibet Autonomous Region as the research area, and uses Landsat OLI images, DEM data and forest resource survey data as data sources to extract analyze spectral information, texture features and topographic factors. Three forest volume inversion models based on multi-features are established. The three models are multiple stepwise regression models, BP neural network models and random forest models. The effects of different methods on the inversion of forest stock are studied. The coefficient of determination (R-2), mean absolute error (MAE) , and root mean square error (RMSE) are used to evaluate the fit and accuracy of the model. The results showed that the fit and accuracy of the random forest model are the best (R-2 = 0. 739, MAE = 55. 352 m(3) . ha(-1), RMSE-63. 195 m(3) . ha(-1)). The result is higher than the multiple stepwise regression model (R-2 = 0. 541, MAE = 58. 317 m(3) . ha(-1), RMSE = 71. 562 m(3) . ha(-1)) and BP neural network model (R-2 = 0. 477, MAE = 67. 503 m(3) . ha(-1), RMSE = 73. 226 m(3) . ha(-1)). The predicted value range of the model is 121. 3 similar to 372. 8 m(3) . ha(-1) and it is relatively close to the actual value. The results showed that the inversion of forest stock volume based on multi-features is effective in practical applications, and different models have different effects on the inversion accuracy of forest stock volume. The random forest regression model has the highest accuracy in this inversion study of forest stock volume, and it can be better applied to remote sensing monitoring of forest resources. This study can provide a reference for selecting forest stock volume inversion methods and help continuously improve the forest resource remote sensing monitoring system.

TI  - Impact of China's Rural Land Marketization on Ecological Environment Quality Based on Remote Sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The market entry of rural collective operating construction land (MERCOCL) is an important way for the Chinese government to promote the marketization of rural land. However, the impact of China's Rural Land Marketization on the ecological environment quality (EEQ) remains to be understood. Understanding these mechanisms is necessary for regional sustainable development and rational resource allocation. Therefore, a universal assessment model of China's regional EEQ was built based on the Landsat 5/8 and the national ecological index (EI) provided by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment at the national district and county scale. A total of 229 counties (32 pilot counties and other counties in the pilot cities) in China from 2011 to 2018 were taken as the research object. This paper empirically studied the evolution process, driving mechanism and spatial heterogeneity of EEQ from the perspective of MERCOCL. The study shows that China's EEQ presented a spatial distribution pattern of "high in the south, low in the north, high in the east and low in the west". When a county implemented the MERCOCL policy, its EEQ index increased by 0.342, with the improvement effect occurring in the second year after the MERCOCL implementation. Regarding the mechanism, MERCOCL mainly improved the EEQ by promoting industrial structure optimization and increasing urban population aggregation. From the perspective of spatial heterogeneity, the improvement effect of MERCOCL on EEQ was more significant in regions with lower economic development levels and latitudes (southern China). This study will facilitate an understanding of the impact of China's rural land marketization on the EEQ and provide scientific data support for government departments to formulate sustainable urban development policies that meet local conditions.

TI  - Automated Small River Mapping (ASRM) for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Based on Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery and MERIT DEM
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic variation in the water surfaces of the river networks within the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau affects the water resource availability for downstream ecosystems and human activities. Small rivers (with a river width less than 30 m) are an important component of this network, but are difficult to map in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Firstly, the width of most rivers is very narrow, at around 20 m, which appears as only one or two pixels in Sentinel-2 images and thus is susceptible to salt-and-pepper noise. Secondly, local mountain shadows, cloud shadows, and snow pixels have spectral characteristics similar to those of rivers, leading to misclassification. Therefore, we propose an automated small river mapping (ASRM) method based on Sentinel-2 imagery to address these two difficulties. A preprocessing procedure was designed to remove the salt-and-pepper noise and enhance the linear characteristic of rivers with specific widths. A flexible digital elevation model (DEM)-based post-processing was then imposed to remove the misclassifications caused by mountain shadows, cloud shadows, and snow pixels. The ASRM results achieved an overall accuracy of 87.5%, outperforming five preexisting remote sensing-derived river network products. The proposed ASRM method has shown great potential for small river mapping in the entire Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Evolution Features and Impact Factors of Urban Expansion in Underdeveloped Cities: A Case Study of Nanchang, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the expansion of urban construction land is necessary to promote rational land use and scientific territorial spatial planning. To reveal urban built-up areas, this study uses 1990-2020 Landsat remote sensing images, superimposed with NPP/VIIRS nighttime light. To extract urban construction land, support vector machines are then used to conduct classification experiments. The spatial-temporal features are analyzed using the expansion index, the shift of the center of gravity, and expansion direction, while influencing factors are analyzed using a Geodetector. The results show the following: (1) Urban construction land in Nanchang continued expanding from 1990 to 2020, by 385.22 km(2), with an average annual expansion intensity of 0.18% and an average annual growth rate of 6.2%. (2) During this time period, the expansion of urban construction land in Nanchang underwent three development stages from: low-strength with low-speed, low-strength with medium-speed, and medium-strength with low-speed expansion. The types of urban construction land expansion were primarily found to be edge expansion and outlying expansion. (3) The overall center of gravity of urban construction land shifts northwest, with significant expansion SW, NW, S, N, and W. (4) Urban planning policy is the dominant driving factor for urban expansion, whereas natural geographic factors have the weakest influence. The results suggest that planning policies should focus on strengthening the rational use and protection of land resources, and promoting the integration and coordinated development of urban functional spaces.

TI  - Mapping Lymph Node during Indocyanine Green Fluorescence-Imaging Guided Gastric Oncologic Surgery: Current Applications and Future Directions
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary The intraoperative navigation techniques develop rapidly, we present an update on current use and research on indocyanine green enhanced fluorescence imaging (ICG-FI) guided lymphangiography in gastric oncological surgery. ICG serves as a promising tattooed agent for lymphangiography, its application was restricted by the false negative lymph nodes and loss of specificity in targeting tumor cells. Besides, we summarized the current approaches for gain in sensitivity and specificity of ICG-FI guided lymphangiography in gastric oncological surgery. The next direction for reinforced ICG-FI was quantification of ICG intensity and detection of ICG distribution pattern, combining with intraoperative biopsy method. Huge strides have been made in the navigation of gastric cancer surgery thanks to the improvement of intraoperative techniques. For now, the use of indocyanine green (ICG) enhanced fluorescence imaging has received promising results in detecting sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and tracing lymphatic drainages, which make it applicable for limited and precise lymphadenectomy. Nevertheless, issues of the lack of specificity and unpredictable false-negative lymph nodes were encountered in gastric oncologic surgery practice using ICG-enhanced fluorescence imaging (ICG-FI), which restrict its application. Here, we reviewed the current application of ICG-FI and assessed potential approaches to improving ICG-FI.

TI  - Use of Remote Sensing Techniques to Estimate Plant Diversity within Ecological Networks: A Worked Example
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As there is an urgent need to protect rapidly declining global diversity, it is important to identify methods to quickly estimate the diversity and heterogeneity of a region and effectively implement monitoring and conservation plans. The combination of remotely sensed and field-collected data, under the paradigm of the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH), represents one of the most promising approaches to boost large-scale and reliable biodiversity monitoring practices. Here, the potential of SVH to capture information on plant diversity at a fine scale in an ecological network (EN) embedded in a complex landscape has been tested using two new and promising methodological approaches: the first estimates alpha and beta spectral diversity and the latter ecosystem spectral heterogeneity expressed as Rao's Quadratic heterogeneity measure (Rao's Q). Both approaches are available thanks to two brand-new R packages: "biodivMapR" and "rasterdiv". Our aims were to investigate if spectral diversity and heterogeneity provide reliable information to assess and monitor over time floristic diversity maintained in an EN selected as an example and located in northeast Italy. We analyzed and compared spectral and taxonomic alpha and beta diversities and spectral and landscape heterogeneity, based on field-based plant data collection and remotely sensed data from Sentinel-2A, using different statistical approaches. We observed a positive relationship between taxonomic and spectral diversity and also between spectral heterogeneity, landscape heterogeneity, and the amount of alien species in relation to the native ones, reaching a value of R-2 = 0.36 and R-2 = 0.43, respectively. Our results confirmed the effectiveness of estimating and mapping alpha and beta spectral diversity and ecosystem spectral heterogeneity using remotely sensed images. Moreover, we highlighted that spectral diversity values become more effective to identify biodiversity-rich areas, representing the most important diversity hotspots to be preserved. Finally, the spectral heterogeneity index in anthropogenic landscapes could be a powerful method to identify those areas most at risk of biological invasion.

TI  - Estimating PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations Using the Machine Learning RF-XGBoost Model in Guanzhong Urban Agglomeration, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a major pollutant in Guanzhong Urban Agglomeration (GUA) during the winter, and GUA is one of China's regions with the highest concentrations of PM2.5. Daily surface PM2.5 maps with a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km can aid in the control of PM2.5 pollution. Thus, the Random Forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (RF-XGBoost) model was proposed to fill the missing aerosol optical depth (AOD) at the station scale before accurately estimating ground-level PM2.5 using the recently released MODIS AOD product derived from Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC), high density meteorological and topographic conditions, land-use, population density, and air pollutions. The RF-XGBoost model was evaluated using an out-of-sample test, revealing excellent performance with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.93, root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 12.49 mu g/m(3), and mean absolution error (MAE) of 8.42 mu g/m(3). The result derived from the RF-XGBoost model indicates that the GUA had the most severe pollution in the winter of 2018 and 2019, owing to the burning of coal for heating and unfavorable meteorological circumstances. Over 90% of the GUA had an annual average PM2.5 concentrations decrease of 3 to 7 mu g/m(3) in 2019 compared to the previous year. Nevertheless, the air pollution situation remained grim in the winter of 2019, with more than 65% of the study area meeting the mean PM2.5 values higher than 35 mu g/m(3) and the maximum reaching 95.57 mu g/m(3). This research would be valuable for policymakers, environmentalists, and epidemiologists, especially in urban areas.

TI  - A Synthetic Angle Normalization Model of Vegetation Canopy Reflectance for Geostationary Satellite Remote Sensing Data
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - High-frequency imaging characteristics allow a geostationary satellite (GSS) to capture the diurnal variation in vegetation canopy reflectance spectra, which is of very important practical significance for monitoring vegetation via remote sensing (RS). However, the observation angle and solar angle of high-frequency GSS RS data usually differ, and the differences in bidirectional reflectance from the reflectance spectra of the vegetation canopy are significant, which makes it necessary to normalize angles for GSS RS data. The BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) prototype library is effective for the angle normalization of RS data. However, its spatiotemporal applicability and error propagation are currently unclear. To resolve this problem, we herein propose a synthetic angle normalization model (SANM) for RS vegetation canopy reflectance; this model exploits the GSS imaging characteristics, whereby each pixel has a fixed observation angle. The established model references a topographic correction method for vegetation canopies based on path-length correction, solar zenith angle normalization, and the Minnaert model. It also considers the characteristics of diurnal variations in vegetation canopy reflectance spectra by setting the time window. Experiments were carried out on the eight Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) images obtained on 22 April 2015 to validate the performance of the proposed SANM. The results show that SANM significantly improves the phase-to-phase correlation of the GOCI band reflectance in the morning time window and retains the instability of vegetation canopy spectra in the noon time window. The SANM provides a preliminary solution for normalizing the angles for the GSS RS data and makes the quantitative comparison of spatiotemporal RS data possible.

TI  - Refined Evaluation of Satellite Precipitation Products against Rain Gauge Observations along the Sichuan-Tibet Railway
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Being constructed in southwestern China, the Sichuan-Tibet Railway (STR) travels across the eastern Tibetan Plateau where there is the most complex terrain and changeable weather in the world. Due to sparse ground-based observations over the Tibetan Plateau, precipitation products retrieved by remote sensing are more widely used; however, satellite-based precipitation products (SPPs) have not yet been strictly and systematically evaluated along the STR. This study aims to evaluate the performance of six SPPs by a series of metrics with available ground observations along the STR during 1998-2020. The six SPPs include the datasets derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH), Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN), and Fengyun-2 satellites precipitation estimate (FY2PRE). The results indicate that most of the SPPs can capture the precipitation characteristics on multiple timescales (monthly, daily, hourly, and diurnal cycle) as shown by the evaluated metrics. The probability density functions of the daily and hourly precipitation are also well represented by the SPPs, and 30 mm day(-1) and 16 mm h(-1) are identified as the daily and hourly thresholds of extreme precipitation events along the STR. The best SPP varies at different timescales: GPM and GSMaP are suitable for the monthly and daily scale, and FY2PRE and GPM are suited to the hourly scale. In general, GPM is relatively optimum on multiple timescales, and PERSIANN gives the worst performance. In addition, the SPPs perform worse at higher altitudes and for more intense precipitation. Overall, the results from this study are expected to provide essential reference for using the SPPs in meteorological services and disaster prevention in the STR construction and its future operation.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Variation Characteristics of Actual Evapotranspiration in the Yiluo River Basin Based on the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory Model
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration is an important part of the hydrological cycle, affecting the terrestrial hydrological process and the relationship between water resource transformation. Analyzing and mastering the temporal and spatial variations in evapotranspiration are of great significance for the rational development, utilization, and protection of water resources in the basin. Based on MODIS remote sensing data and combined with meteorological and hydrological data, the PT-JPL model was used to estimate the actual evapotranspiration of the Yiluo River Basin, and the applicability of the PT-JPL model for estimating actual evapotranspiration in the basin was analyzed. The spatial and temporal characteristics of actual evapotranspiration in the Yiluo River Basin were analyzed, and the correlation between actual evapotranspiration in the basin and influencing factors such as precipitation, temperature, and vegetation was explored. The main conclusions are as follows: the PT-JPL model has good applicability in the Yiluo River Basin; the total actual evapotranspiration in the basin showed a decreasing trend, which was consistent with the trend of precipitation, indicating that the actual evapotranspiration may be limited by water conditions in the study area. The evapotranspiration of the basin was higher in the upstream and lower in the downstream, which may be related to the better vegetation coverage in the upper basin than in the downstream. As an important indicator of vegetation change, NDVI showed a good correlation with evapotranspiration, which also verified this. In addition, the correlation between evapotranspiration and temperature was also good.

TI  - DISPARATE DISCRIMINATION
T2  - MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This Article explains and analyzes a recent trend in the Supreme Court's cases regarding unintentional discrimination, where the argument is that a law has the effect of producing a disadvantage on members of a particular group. In religious discrimination cases, the Court has held that a law is presumptively unconstitutional if the law results in a comparable secular activity being treated more favorably than religious activity. Yet in racial discrimination cases, the Court has said the mere fact that a law more severely disadvantages racial minorities as a group does not suffice to establish unlawful discrimina-tion. The two tracks for unintentional discrimination claims can be understood through the lens of political process theory. One part of political process theory maintains that courts should be skeptical of laws that negatively affect discrete and insular minorities who may be politically powerless and face prejudice. One reason the Court more carefully scrutinizes laws that burden conserva-tive, (often) Christian religious groups may be that the Court views those groups as socially powerless because their views no longer command majority support and because their views are not treated with the respect the Court thinks they deserve. And the Court's decisions have the effect of redistributing power to or reinforcing power in the groups the Court believes to be socially powerless. Identifying the jurisprudential worldview that may plausibly drive these trends helps to identify the potential implications and assess the merits of the new doctrinal approach that the Court has taken in (some) antidiscrimination cases. The Court's new approach to religious discrimination claims has some virtues; in particular, the Court is probably right to consider facts from the private sphere, such as a group's economic or social power, in deciding the ap-propriate scope of judicial review. But the selectivity with which the Court has applied this approach, as well as the Court's odd assessments of various groups' power, has resulted in a problematic jurisprudence of conservative victimiza-tion that judicially protects backlash against advances in equality and antidis-crimination law.

TI  - Spatial Predictive Modeling of the Burning of Sugarcane Plots in Northeast Thailand with Selection of Factor Sets Using a GWR Model and Machine Learning Based on an ANN-CA
T2  - SYMMETRY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of the study is to apply symmetry principles to general mathematical modelling based on multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach for use in development in conjunction with geographic weighted regression (GWR) model and optimize the artificial neural network-cellular automaton (ANN-CA) model for forecasting the sugarcane plot burning area of Northeast Thailand. First, to calculate the service area boundaries of sugarcane transport that caused the burning of sugarcane with a fire radiative power (FRP) values using spatial correlation analysis approach. Second, the analysis of the spatial factors influencing sugarcane burning. The study uses the approach of symmetry in the design of algorithm for finding the optimal service boundary distance (called as cut-off) in the analysis of hot-spot clustering and uses calculations with the geographic information system (GIS) approach, and the final stage is the use of screened independent variable factors to predict the plots of burned sugarcane in 2031. The results showed that the positively related factors for the percentage of cane plot sintering in the sub-area units of each sugar plant's service were the distance to transport sugarcane plots index and percentage of sugarcane plantations in service areas, while the negative coefficients were FRP differences and density of sugarcane yield factors, according to the analysis with a total of seven spatial variables. The best GWR models display local R-2 values at levels of 0.902 to 0.961 in the service zones of Khonburi and Saikaw. An influential set of independent variables can increase the accuracy of the ANN-CA model in forecasting with kappa statistical estimates in the range of 0.81 to 0.85 The results of the study can be applied to other regions of Thailand, including countries with similar sugarcane harvesting industries, to formulate policies to reduce the exposure of sugarcane harvested by burning methods and to support the transportation of sugarcane within the appropriate scope of service so that particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) can be reduced.

TI  - Sub-Block Urban Function Recognition with the Integration of Multi-Source Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The recognition of urban functional areas (UFAs) is of great significance for the understanding of urban structures and urban planning. Due to the limitation of data sources, early research was characterized by problems such as singular data, incomplete results, and inadequate consideration of the socioeconomic environment. The development of multi-source big data brings new opportunities for dynamic recognition of UFAs. In this study, a sub-block function recognition framework that integrates multi-feature information from building footprints, point-of-interest (POI) data, and Landsat images is proposed to classify UFAs at the sub-block level using a random forest model. The recognition accuracies of single- and mixed-function areas in the core urban area of Guangzhou, China, obtained by this framework are found to be significantly higher than those of other methods. The overall accuracy (OA) of single-function areas is 82%, which is 8-36% higher than that of other models. The research conclusions show that the introduction of the three-dimensional (3D) features of buildings and finer land cover features can improve the recognition accuracy of UFAs. The proposed method that uses open access data and achieves comprehensive results provides a more practical solution for the recognition of UFAs.

TI  - Modeling Biomass for Natural Subtropical Secondary Forest Using Multi-Source Data and Different Regression Models in Huangfu Mountain, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biomass estimation is an important parameter for calculating forest carbon storage, which is of great significance for formulating carbon-neutral strategies and forest resource management measures. We aimed at solving the problems of low estimation accuracy of forest biomass with complex canopy structure and high canopy density, and large differences in the estimation results of the same estimation model under complex forest conditions. The Huangfu Mountain Forest Farm in Chuzhou City was used as the research area. As predictors, we used Gaofen-1(GF-1) and Gaofen(GF-6) satellite high-resolution imaging satellite data, combined with digital elevation model (DEM) and forest resource data. Multiple stepwise regression, BP neural network and random forest estimation models were used to construct a natural subtropical secondary forest biomass estimation model with complex canopy structure and high canopy closure. We extracted image information as modeling factors, established multiple stepwise regression models of different tree types with a single data source and a comprehensive data source and determined the optimal modeling factors. On this basis, the BP neural network and random forest biomass estimation model were established for Pinus massoniana, Pinus elliottii, Quercus acutissima and mixed forests, with the coefficient of determination n (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) as the judgment indices. The results show that the random forest model had the best biomass estimation effect among different forest types. The R-2 of Quercus acutissima was the highest, reaching 0.926, but the RMSE was 11.658 t/hm(2). The R-2 values of Pinus massoniana and mixed forest were 0.912 and 0.904, respectively. The RMSE reached 10.521 t/hm(2) and 6.765 t/hm(2), respectively; the worst result was the estimation result of Pinus elliottii, with an R-2 of 0.879 and an RMSE of 14.721 t/hm(2). The estimation result of the BP neural network was second only to that of the random forest model in the four forest types. From high precision to low precision, the order was Quercus acutissima, Pinus massoniana, mixed forest and Pinus elliottii, with R(2)s of 0.897, 0.877, 0.825 and 0.753 and RMSEs of 17.899 t/hm(2), 10.168 t/hm(2), 18.641 t/hm(2) and 20.419 t/hm(2), respectively. In this experiment, the worst biomass estimation performance was seen for multiple stepwise regression, which ranked the species in the order of Quercus acutissima, Pinus massoniana, mixed forest and Pinus elliottii, with R(2)s of 0.658, 0.622, 0.528 and 0.379 and RMSEs of 29.807 t/hm(2), 16.291 t/hm(2), 28.011 t/hm(2) and 23.101 t/hm(2), respectively. In conclusion, GF-1 and GF-6 combined with data and a random forest algorithm can obtain the most accurate results in estimating the forest biomass of complex tree species. The random forest estimation model had a good performance in biomass estimation of primary secondary forest. High-resolution satellite data have great application potential in the field of forest parameter inversion.

TI  - Instability Monitoring and Numerical Analysis of Typical Coal Mines in Southwest China Based on DS-InSAR
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the coal mines in Southwest China are located in mountainous areas with high vegetation coverage, and most activities are carried out under the mountains. The deformation monitoring and mechanical behavior analysis of the mining area helps reveal the typical mountain deformation and failure mechanism caused by underground mining activities and reduce the risk of mountain collapse in the mining area. In this manuscript, a research method for mountain stability in mining areas is proposed, which combines InSAR deformation monitoring with numerical analysis. Based on the high-precision deformation information obtained by DS-InSAR and the landslide range, a three-dimensional explicit finite difference numerical analysis method was used to reconstruct the landslide model. According to the layout of the coal mining working face, the variation mechanism of overlying stratum stress and the mountain slip in the coal mining process is inverted, and the mechanism of mountain failure and instability in the mining area is analysed. Based on the sentinel data, the experiment performed time series monitoring and inversion analysis of the mountain collapse in Nayong, Guizhou, China. The results show that mining activities a certain distance from the mountain will affect mountain stability, and there are specific mechanisms. From 2015 to 2017, the stress redistribution of overlying strata above the goaf area resulted in dense longitudinal cracks in the landslide body due to coal mining. The mountain is in a continuous damage state, and the supporting force to prevent collapse continues to decrease, resulting in a gradual decrease in landslide stability. Both the time series DS-InSAR monitoring results and numerical simulation results verify the actual occurrence and development of the on-site subsidence.

TI  - Interpreting Mangrove Habitat and Coastal Land Cover Change in the Greater Bay Area, Southern China, from 1924 to 2020 Using Historical Aerial Photos and Multiple Sources of Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal habitat dynamics and ecosystem function in response to human-induced disturbance, especially urbanization, are of increasing concern. However, how changes in landscape composition as well as habitat quantity and quality may affect the long-term sustainability of rapidly urbanizing coasts remains unclear. This study aimed to quantify the extent, change rate, patterns, change process and interrelationships of mangrove habitats, impervious surfaces, and other land cover types in Deep Bay in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA), China, the world's largest megalopolis, from 1924 to 2020. We processed historical aerial photos (1924-2020) and multiple sources of satellite data (1973-2020) for different types of land cover mapping. Post-classification analysis, including correlation analysis and change detection analysis, was conducted based on the long time-series land cover classification results. Mangrove habitats increased in Deep Bay from 1924 to 2020, except for a large area decrease from 1954 to 1964 due to the construction of tidal aquaculture ponds. Mudflat areas contributed most to the expansion of mangrove habitats of about 275 ha from 1987 to 2020. During this period, reclamation and urbanization for the construction of the megacity of Shenzhen turned large areas of water and mudflat (about 4000 ha) on the northern shore into impervious surface and urban vegetation. Overall, the landscape pattern of mangrove habitats in Deep Bay showed increasing connectivity and decreasing degree of fragmentation from 1987 to 2020. These changes have significant implications for the ecosystem services, e.g., supporting migratory waterbirds, supported by these wetlands.

However, wind farm (WF) turbulence effects can change the local climate by redistributing temperature, humidity, and heat fluxes. Previous studies indicate that WFs can significantly increase nighttime land surface temperature (LST); however, their conclusions are mainly derived from individual WFs and ignore heterogeneous impacts among multi-WFs in China. Another large source of uncertainty is that the WFs used in previous studies are mainly located in croplands or grasslands, which may obscure direct WF impacts because of the interactions between vegetation and the atmosphere. In this study, we detect impacts with MODIS LST products during 2001-2018 at sixteen WFs in the desert of northern China. The results suggest that the averaged warming impacts of WFs on LST are similar between nighttime (0.237 degrees C) and daytime (0.250 degrees C). However, the uncertainty is much greater for daytime (SD = 0.519 degrees C) than for nighttime (SD = 0.146 degrees C) due to spatially heterogeneous impacts of desert WFs on LST. Optimal structural equation models suggest that wind speed, precipitation, and distribution patterns of wind turbines mainly explain the spatial heterogeneity of the desert WF impacts on nighttime LST. Given the rapid development of WFs globally, the local warming impacts of WFs and their corresponding mechanisms should be highlighted as a high priority in the fields of energy and climate.

TI  - The Application of Magnetic Nanoparticles for Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Clinically Node-Negative Breast Cancer Patients: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Generally, the standard method of applying sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer patients is via a technetium-labeled nanocolloid (radiolabeled tracer) with or without blue dye. However, the radioactive agents may cause challenges both to hospitals and patients. Alternatively, a safer candidate method, such as SPIO, has been often introduced and validated in comparison with standard methods. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of SPIO and its clinical impact on the management of breast cancer. Based on our study, SPIO could be considered as an alternative standard of care for sentinel lymph node detection. Compared with the standard method, SPIO exhibited equivalent or even superior detection capacities, while safety could be guaranteed. Lower SPIO doses would also not impair detection capacity compared with the standard method. The absence of radioactivity of SPIO is one of the most important advantages for clinical applications. Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO), an alternative mapping agent, can be used to identify sentinel lymph nodes in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer. However, its performance in comparison with the standard method, using a radioisotope (technetium-99 m, Tc) alone or in combination with blue dye, remains controversial. Hence, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of SPIO and its clinical impact in the management of breast cancer. The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were comprehensively searched from inception to 1 May 2022. Cohort studies regarding the comparison of SPIO with standard methods for sentinel lymph node identification were included. A total of 19 prospective cohort studies, which collectively included 2298 clinically node-negative breast cancer patients undergoing sentinel lymph node identification through both the standard method and SPIO, were identified. The detection rate for sentinel lymph nodes (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.05-1.08; p < 0.001) was considerably higher in the SPIO cohorts than in the standard method cohorts, although this difference was not significant in detected patients, patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes, or positive sentinel lymph nodes. Compared with the standard method, the SPIO method could be considered as an alternative standard of care for sentinel lymph node detection in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer.

TI  - Evaluation of the Ecological Environment Quality of the Kuye River Source Basin Using the Remote Sensing Ecological Index
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat remote sensing images obtained from 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 were analyzed. The normalized vegetation index (NDVI), moisture index (WET), land surface temperature (LST), and normalized building-soil index (NDBSI) were extracted based on the four aspects of greenness, humidity, heat, and dryness. The Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) was calculated using principal component analysis to quantitatively analyze and dynamically monitor and evaluate the ecological environment changes in the Kuye River Basin over the past 20 years. From the perspective of spatial and temporal distribution, the ecological and environmental quality of Kuye River Basin had a downward trend from 2000 to 2020. The overall RSEI grade was medium or poor, and the average RSEI decreased. The proportion of excellent and good grade watershed areas decreased, whereas that of medium, low, and poor grade watershed areas increased over the study period. Spatially, RSEI decreased gradually from southeast to northwest. The degraded areas were mainly distributed in urban areas with frequent human activities. Conversely, the superior eco-environmental quality areas were mainly distributed in eastern sections of the watershed. Compared with 2000, the eco-environmental quality of the Yulin urban area and Shenmu County in the southern section of the watershed are worsening.

TI  - Aerosol Analysis of China's Fenwei Plain from 2012 to 2020 Based on OMI Satellite Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fenwei Plain plays an essential role for China's three-year action plan to protect the air environment. At present, the high-value area and maximum value of atmospheric aerosol have been effectively controlled, but the governance situation is not stable. Therefore, based on the daily ultraviolet aerosol index (UVAI) data retrieved by Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) from 2012 to 2020, combined with precipitation and temperature and air pressure and lifting index data, this paper analyzes the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and some influencing factors of UVAI in the Fenwei Plain. The results show that the overall trend of the annual average UVAI value of the Fenwei Plain in 9 years showed two "peaks" in 2013 and 2018, respectively. The high UVAI values are mainly concentrated in the southwest and central areas of the Fenwei Plain. In the study area, UVAI was highest in winter, followed by autumn and spring, and lowest in summer. There were significant negative correlations between precipitation and UVAI and between temperature and UVAI. There were significant positive correlations between air pressure and UVAI and between lifting index and UVAI. According to the backward trajectory clustering results, during the autumn and winter seasons in this area, due to the sand and dust brought by the northwest and the input of aerosols in the coal-producing area and coal-fired heating area, the UVAI value of this time period is higher.

TI  - Assessing 10 Satellite Precipitation Products in Capturing the July 2021 Extreme Heavy Rain in Henan, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - On 20 July 2021, a sudden rainstorm happened in central and northern Henan Province, China, killing at least 302 people. This extreme precipitation event incurred substantial socioeconomic impacts and resulted in serious losses. Accurate monitoring of such rainstorm events is crucial. In this study, qualitative and quantitative methods are used to comprehensively evaluate the abilities of 10 high-resolution satellite precipitation products [CMORPH-Raw (Climate Prediction Center morphing technique), CMORPH-RT, PERSIANN-CCS (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks), GPM IMERG-Early (Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement), GPM IMERG-Late, GSMaP-Now (Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation), GSMaP-NRT, FY-2F, FY-2G, and FY-2H] in capturing this extreme rainstorm event, as well as their performances in monitoring different precipitation intensities. The results show that these satellite precipitation products are able to capture the spatial distributions of the rainstorm (e.g., its location in central and northern Henan), but all products have underestimated the amount of precipitation in the rainstorm center. With the increase in precipitation intensity, the hit rate decreases, the threat score decreases, and the false alarm rate increases. CMORPH-RT is better at capturing the rainstorm than CMORPH-Raw, and it depictes the rainstorm process well; GPM IMERG-Late is more accurate than GPM IMERG-Early; GSMaP-NRT has performed better than GSMaP-Now; and PERSIANN-CCS and FY-2F perform poorly. Among the products, CMORPH-RT performs the best, which has accurately captured the center of the rainstorm, and is also the closest to the station-based observations. In general, the satellite precipitation products that integrate infrared and passive microwave data are found to be better than those that only make use of infrared data. The satellite precipitation retrieval algorithm and the amount of passive microwave data have a relatively greater impact on the accuracy of satellite precipitation products.

TI  - Estimation of Vegetation Leaf-Area-Index Dynamics from Multiple Satellite Products through Deep-Learning Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A high-quality leaf-area index (LAI) is important for land surface process modeling and vegetation growth monitoring. Although multiple satellite LAI products have been generated, they usually show spatio-temporal discontinuities and are sometimes inconsistent with vegetation growth patterns. A deep-learning model was proposed to retrieve time-series LAIs from multiple satellite data in this paper. The fusion of three global LAI products (i.e., VIIRS, GLASS, and MODIS LAI) was first carried out through a double logistic function (DLF). Then, the DLF LAI, together with MODIS reflectance (MOD09A1) data, served as the training samples of the deep-learning long short-term memory (LSTM) model for the sequential LAI estimations. In addition, the LSTM models trained by a single LAI product were considered as indirect references for the further evaluation of our proposed approach. The validation results showed that our proposed LSTMfusion LAI provided the best performance (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.82) when compared to LSTMGLASS (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 0.93), LSTMMODIS (R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 1.25), LSTMVIIRS (R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.94), GLASS (R-2 = 0.68, RMSE = 1.05), MODIS (R-2 = 0.26, RMSE = 1.75), VIIRS (R-2 = 0.44, RMSE = 1.37) and DLF LAI (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 0.98). A temporal comparison among LSTMfusion and three LAI products demonstrated that the LSTMfusion model efficiently generated a time-series LAI that was smoother and more continuous than the VIIRS and MODIS LAIs. At the crop peak growth stage, the LSTMfusion LAI values were closer to the reference maps than the GLASS LAI. Furthermore, our proposed method was proved to be effective and robust in maintaining the spatio-temporal continuity of the LAI when noisy reflectance data were used as the LSTM input. These findings highlighted that the DLF method helped to enhance the quality of the original satellite products, and the LSTM model trained by the coupled satellite products can provide reliable and robust estimations of the time-series LAI.

TI  - Correlation Analysis between Urban Green Space and Land Surface Temperature from the Perspective of Spatial Heterogeneity: A Case Study within the Sixth Ring Road of Beijing
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban greening has been widely regarded as the most effective, lasting, and economical strategy for alleviating the effects of urban heat islands (UHIs). Previous studies on the cooling effect of urban green spaces (UGSs) tend to analyze the correlation between landscape metrics and land-surface temperature (LST) based on a global parameter estimation, while ignoring urban heterogeneity and autocorrelation. This study focuses on the sixth ring road of Beijing and uses Landsat 8 imagery to retrieve the LST and extract the position of UGSs. We propose a new approach to optimize the selection of landscape metrics, to identify the least and most effective metrics to establish a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, and to plot the distribution of local regression coefficients to investigate the spatially heterogeneous cooling effects of greenspaces. The effect of UGS landscape metrics on the LST differs according to spatial location; the method enhances our understanding of the effects of UGS spatial configuration on UHIs and better guides the planning and construction of future UGSs.

TI  - Sediment and carbon dynamics during an episodic flood in an intermittent river
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The contribution of intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES) to the global carbon cycle has largely been overlooked. Flood events can impact hydrological processes, carbon (C) transport, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This study monitored river flow and sediment concentrations in an intermittent river during a flood event. Water samples were measured for water quality factors and C transport indices. CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) and CO2 flux (FCO2) were also analyzed. Remote sensing data were used to analyze soil erosion in the basin. Results indicate that the total sediment load from the flood was approximately 5503.1 t, with sediment concentrations showing a direct relationship with flow discharge. By completing a hysteresis loop and soil erosion level analysis, soil erosion from the river source and runoff surface scour were found to be the primary sources of sediment. The flood significantly increased particulate organic carbon and decreased dissolved organic carbon. During the flood, pCO(2) ranged between 669 and 1229 ppm, indicating that the IRES served as a carbon source, with pH and total dissolved solids being the main influencing factors. The FCO2 varied between 20.16 and 568.33 mg m(-2) h(-1) and revealed a significant positive correlation with pCO(2). After the flood ended, CO2 emissions increased and remained high for a long time. The study findings have substantial implications for IRES responses to extreme flood events, which are predicted to increase in intensity under climate change.

TI  - Estimating the Legacy Effect of Post-Cutting Shelterbelt on Crop Yield Using Google Earth and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shelterbelts (or windbreaks) can effectively improve the microclimate and soil conditions of adjacent farmland and thus increase crop yield. However, the individual contribution of these two factors to yield changes is still unclear since the short-term effect from the microclimate and the accumulated effect from the soil jointly affect crop yield. The latter (soil effect) is supposed to remain after shelterbelt-cutting, thus inducing a post-cutting legacy effect on yield, which can be used to decompose the shelterbelt-induced yield increase. Here, we develop an innovative framework to investigate the legacy effect of post-cutting shelterbelt on corn yield by combining Google Earth and Sentinel-2 data in Northeastern China. Using this framework, for the first time, we decompose the shelterbelt-induced yield increase effect into microclimate and soil effects by comparing the yield profiles before and after shelterbelt-cutting. We find that on average, the intensity of the legacy effect, namely the crop yield increment of post-cutting shelterbelts, is 0.98 +/- 0.03%. The legacy effect varies depending on the shelterbelt-farmland relative location and shelterbelt density. The leeward side of the shelterbelt-adjacent farmland has a more remarkable legacy effect compared to the windward side. Shelterbelts with medium-high density have the largest legacy effect (1.94 +/- 0.05%). Overall, the legacy effect accounts for 47% of the yield increment of the shelterbelt before cutting, implying that the soil effect is almost equally important for increasing crop yield compared to the microclimate effect. Our findings deepen the understanding of the mechanism of shelterbelt-induced yield increase effects and can help to guide shelterbelt management.

TI  - Rice Yield Prediction and Model Interpretation Based on Satellite and Climatic Indicators Using a Transformer Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the second largest rice producer, India contributes about 20% of the world's rice production. Timely, accurate, and reliable rice yield prediction in India is crucial for global food security and health issues. Deep learning models have achieved excellent performances in predicting crop yield. However, the interpretation of deep learning models is still rare. In this study, we proposed a transformer-based model, Informer, to predict rice yield across the Indian Indo-Gangetic Plains by integrating time-series satellite data, environmental variables, and rice yield records from 2001 to 2016. The results showed that Informer had better performance (R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 0.41 t/ha) than four other machine learning and deep learning models for end-of-season prediction. For within-season prediction, the Informer model could achieve stable performances (R-2 approximate to 0.78) after late September, which indicated that the optimal prediction could be achieved 2 months before rice maturity. In addition, we interpreted the prediction models by evaluating the input feature importance and analyzing hidden features. The evaluation of feature importance indicated that NIRV was the most critical factor, while intervals 6 (mid-August) and 12 (mid-November) were the key periods for rice yield prediction. The hidden feature analysis demonstrated that the attention-based long short-term memory (AtLSTM) model accumulated the information of each growth period, while the Informer model focused on the information around intervals 5 to 6 (August) and 11 to 12 (November). Our findings provided a reliable and simple framework for crop yield prediction and a new perspective for explaining the internal mechanism of deep learning models.

TI  - Retrieving Water Quality Parameters from Noisy-Label Data Based on Instance Selection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important part of the "air-ground" integrated water quality monitoring system, the inversion of water quality from unmanned airborne hyperspectral image has attracted more and more attention. Meanwhile, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the characteristics of small size, flexibility and quick response, and can complete the task of water environment detection in a large area, thus avoiding the difficulty in obtaining satellite data and the limitation of single-point monitoring by ground stations. Most researchers use UAV for water quality monitoring, they take water samples back to library or directly use portable sensors for measurement while flying drones at the same time. Due to the UAV speed and route planning, the actual sampling time and the UAV passing time cannot be guaranteed to be completely synchronized, and there will be a difference of a few minutes. For water quality parameters such as chromaticity (chroma), chlorophyll-a (chl-a), chemical oxygen demand (COD), etc., the changes in a few minutes are small and negligible. However, for the turbidity, especially in flowing water body, this value of it will change within a certain range. This phenomenon will lead to noise error in the measured suspended matter or turbidity, which will affect the performance of regression model and retrieval accuracy. In this study, to solve the quality problem of label data in a flowing water body, an unmanned airborne hyperspectral water quality retrieval experiment was carried out in the Xiao River in Xi'an, China, which verified the rationality and effectiveness of label denoising analysis of different water quality parameters. To identify noisy label instances efficiently, we proposed an instance selection scheme. Furthermore, considering the limitation of the dataset samples and the characteristic of regression task, we build a 1DCNN model combining a self attention mechanism (SAM) and the network achieves the best retrieving performance on turbidity and chroma data. The experiment results show that, for flowing water body, the noisy-label instance selection method can improve retrieval performance slightly on the COD parameter, but improve greatly on turbidity and chroma data.

TI  - Mapping Forest Stock Volume Based on Growth Characteristics of Crown Using Multi-Temporal Landsat 8 OLI and ZY-3 Stereo Images in Planted Eucalyptus Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Labeled as a fast-growing tree species, eucalyptus has outstanding carbon sequestration capacity. Forest stock volume (FSV) is regarded as an important parameter for evaluating the quality of planted eucalyptus forests. However, it is an intractable problem to map FSV of planted eucalyptus forests using optical images because of growth characteristics of the crown and low saturation levels. To improve the accuracy of FSV in planted eucalyptus forests, time series Landsat 8 OLI (LC8) images and ZY-3 stereo images were acquired in the study area. Additionally, then, three composite images were proposed using acquired Landsat 8 OLI images based on the size and shape of eucalyptus crowns, and several spectra variables were extracted from these composite images. Furthermore, corrected canopy height model (CCHM) was also extracted from ZY-3 stereo images. Meanwhile, four models (random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and multiple linear regression (MLR)) were used to estimate the FSV with various variable sets using the importance of the alternative variables ranked by RF. The results show that the sensitivity between proposed spectral variables and FSV is significantly improved using proposed composed images based on the growth characteristics of the crown, especially for young eucalyptus forests. After adding CCHM and stand age to the optimal variable set, the average relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of estimated FSV decreased from 41.01% to 29.94% for single LC8 images and from 32.64% to 26.47% for proposed composite LC8 images, respectively. After using the variable set extracted from composite LC8 images, the number of samples with overestimated FSV was significantly decreased for the young forest. Furthermore, forest height plays an important role in improving the accuracy of mapping FSV, whether young or mature eucalyptus forest. It was also proved that composite images related to crown close and CCHM have great potential to delay the saturation phenomenon for mapping FSV in planted eucalyptus forest.

TI  - Empirical Examinations of Whether Rural Population Decline Improves the Rural Eco-Environmental Quality in a Chinese Context
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rural population has continually declined in response to the rapid urbanization process occurring in China, and the related negative socioeconomic impacts on rural development have attracted considerable attention from scholars. Currently, few studies have investigated the eco-environmental impact of rural population decline. By employing remote-sensing data, including land-use and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, this study proposed a method based on the eco-environmental quality index (EQI) to measure the changes in the rural eco-environmental quality (REQ) at the prefectural level from 2000 to 2020. Then, we examined the impacts of rural population decline on REQ variations. We found that (1) most of the research units experienced continuous rural population decline during the research period, with the rural population density declining more than 25% from 2010 to 2020 in approximately half of the research units; (2) the REQ improved in most of the units, especially in the western region, but there were still many units that experienced a decline in the REQ, which were primarily concentrated in the coastal and central regions; (3) rural population decline improved the REQ, but its impacts varied regionally; and (4) rural population density, natural factors, and eco-environmental protection programs had significant influences on REQ variations. These findings may provide a reference for sustainable-development policies in rural China and other developing countries.

TI  - Quantitative Analysis of Tectonic Geomorphology Research Based on Web of Science from 1981 to 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tectonic geomorphology is an important research area that uses multisource data to quantify the landscape response induced by the interaction between the tectonic uplift and climate changes. In this study, a comprehensive and quantitative analysis using bibliometric and scientometrics based on the research areas, countries, institutions, journals, authors, keywords, and citations is carried out, which provides an exhaustive history of tectonic geomorphology, and points out the hopspots and trends in the research area. A total of 2796 papers and 110,111 references from 1981 to 2021 are collected from Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E) as the main data source. The results show that with the development of remote sensing, tectonic geomorphology, and the improvement of instruments and equipment, the amount of tectonic geomorphology analysis has been increasing. The journal Geomorphology is one of the most popular journals in this field. Through the co-occurrence network analysis, 12 clusters are identified in which the most popular research hotspot in tectonic geomorphology research is how to constrain the rates of active faulting using geomorphic indices. Through literature co-citation analysis, 13 research directions are extracted in which an important trend is to investigate the response of drainage divide migration to the fault slip rates. With the help of remote sensing data, physical attributes, and contextual knowledge, the reliability of measuring uplift rates under tectonic and climate changes has been increased. A future suggestion is to use multi-source heterogeneous data fusion to conduct quantitative analysis for tectonic geomorphology research.

TI  - Spatial Prediction of Total Nitrogen in Soil Surface Layer Based on Machine Learning
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to satisfy the basic requirements of sustainable agricultural development, it is important to understand the spatial distribution characteristics of soil total nitrogen (TN) content to better guide accurate fertilization to increase grain yield. To this end, this paper constructs three inversion models of partial least squares regression (PLSR), back propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector machines (SVM) with remote sensing data to predict the TN content in Datong County, Xining City, Qinghai Province, China. The results showed that the average TN content was 1.864 g/kg, and the coefficient of variation (CV) was 30.596%. The prediction accuracy of the SVM model (R-2 = 0.676, RMSE = 0.296) among the three inversion models was higher than that of the BPNN model (R-2 = 0.560, RMSE = 0.305) and the PLSR model (R-2 = 0.374, RMSE = 0.334). The model with the highest accuracy predicted the spatial distribution of TN, and TN content showed a spatial distribution trend which was high in the northwest and low in the southeast, and gradually decreased from north to south. This study provides reference basis and support for soil fertility evaluations and sustainable agricultural development.

TI  - Comparing Machine and Deep Learning Methods for the Phenology-Based Classification of Land Cover Types in the Amazon Biome Using Sentinel-1 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The state of Amapa within the Amazon biome has a high complexity of ecosystems formed by forests, savannas, seasonally flooded vegetation, mangroves, and different land uses. The present research aimed to map the vegetation from the phenological behavior of the Sentinel-1 time series, which has the advantage of not having atmospheric interference and cloud cover. Furthermore, the study compared three different sets of images (vertical-vertical co-polarization (VV) only, vertical-horizontal cross-polarization (VH) only, and both VV and VH) and different classifiers based on deep learning (long short-term memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Bidirectional GRU (Bi-GRU)) and machine learning (Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Multilayer Perceptron). The time series englobed four years (2017-2020) with a 12-day revisit, totaling 122 images for each VV and VH polarization. The methodology presented the following steps: image pre-processing, temporal filtering using the Savitsky-Golay smoothing method, collection of samples considering 17 classes, classification using different methods and polarization datasets, and accuracy analysis. The combinations of the VV and VH pooled dataset with the Bidirectional Recurrent Neuron Networks methods led to the greatest F1 scores, Bi-GRU (93.53) and Bi-LSTM (93.29), followed by the other deep learning methods, GRU (93.30) and LSTM (93.15). Among machine learning, the two methods with the highest F1-score values were SVM (92.18) and XGBoost (91.98). Therefore, phenological variations based on long Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) time series allow the detailed representation of land cover/land use and water dynamics.

TI  - Application of Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) to the Regional Characterisation of Vineyard Blocks Using Remote Sensing Time Series
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring wine-growing regions and maximising the value of production based on their region/local specificities requires accurate spatial and temporal monitoring. The increasing amount and variability of information from remote sensing data is a potential tool to assess this challenge for the grape and wine industry. This article provides a first insight into the capacity of a multiway analysis method applied to Sentinel-2 time series to assess the value of simultaneously considering spectral and temporal information to highlight site-specific canopy evolution in relation to environmental factors and management practices, which present a large diversity at this regional scale. Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) was used as an unsupervised technique to recover pure spectra and temporal signatures from multi-way spectral imagery of vineyards in the Languedoc-Roussillon region in the south of France. The model was developed using a time series of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery collected over 4978 vineyard blocks between May 2019 and August 2020. From the Sentinel-2 (spectral and temporal) signal, the PARAFAC analysis allowed the identification of spectral and temporal profiles in the form of pure components, which corresponded to vegetation and soil. The PARAFAC analysis also identified that two of the pure spectra were strongly related to characteristics and dynamics of vineyard cultivation at a regional scale. A conceptual framework was proposed in order to simultaneously consider both vegetation and soil profiles and to summarise the mass of data accordingly. This methodology allowed the computation of a concentration index that characterised how close a field was to a vegetation or a soil profile over the season. The concentration indices were validated for the vegetation and the soil over two growing seasons (2019 and 2020) with geostatistical analysis. A non-random distribution of the concentration index at the regional scale was assumed to highlight a strongly spatially organised phenomenon related to spatially organised environmental factors (soil, climate, training system, etc.). In a second step, spatial patterns of indices were subjected to the expertise of a panel of advisors of the wine industry in order to validate them in relation to vine-growing conditions. Results showed that the introduction of the PARAFAC method opened up the possibility to identify relevant spectro-temporal profiles for vine monitoring purposes.

TI  - Land Subsidence Evolution and Simulation in the Western Coastal Area of Bohai Bay, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater overexploitation and loading of buildings have been the main factors triggering land subsidence along the west coast of Bohai Bay, China, since the 2000s. Uneven subsidence has been causing damage to buildings and civil facilities, loss of elevation, increasing the risk of flood and seawater intrusion, and threatening the safety of people's lives and property. This paper analyzed the spatial and temporal features of land subsidence along the coastal area from 2003 to 2010 and from 2015 to 2020, respectively. The relations between the initiating factors and land subsidence were explored. Then, the simulation model of land subsidence was constructed through a deep learning method. During the process, multiple data were collected, including land satellite (Landsat), environmental satellite advanced synthetic aperture radar (ENVISAT ASAR) and Sentinel-1 images, leveling data, lithological data, and groundwater level data. The area occupied by buildings and vertical displacement were extracted by using supervised classification, small baseline subset (SBAS), and persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) technologies. The gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network was adopted to simulate the evolution of land subsidence. Results showed that the maximum annual vertical displacement rate decreased from -94 mm/yr during 2003-2010 to -87 mm/yr during 2015-2020. The correlation efficiency between the groundwater level of the third confined aquifer group and land subsidence was larger than the area occupied by buildings and the compressible layer thickness with subsidence. The constructed GRU neural network model can simulate subsidence from September 2019 to December 2019, with the overall RMSE and MAE being 3.16 mm and 2.19 mm, respectively. This work can facilitate an understanding of the evolution and prevention of land subsidence along the west coast of Bohai Bay, which will provide information for policy decisions and flood-fighting plans of the worldwide coastal cities.

TI  - An Improved Source Model of the 2021 <i>M<sub>w</sub></i> 6.1 Yangbi Earthquake (Southwest China) Based on InSAR and BOI Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The azimuth displacement derived by pixel offset tracking (POT) or multiple aperture InSAR (MAI) measurements is usually used to characterize the north-south coseismic deformation caused by large earthquakes (M > 6.5), but its application in the source parameter inversion of moderate-magnitude earthquakes (similar to M 6.0) is rare due to the insensitive observation accuracy. Conventional line-of-sight (LOS) displacements derived by the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) have limited ability to constrain the source parameters of the earthquake with near north-south striking. On 21 May 2021, an M-w 6.1 near north-south striking earthquake occurred in Yangbi County, Yunnan Province, China. In this study, we derive both the coseismic LOS displacement and the burst overlap interferometry (BOI) displacement from the Sentinel-1 data to constrain the source model of this event. We construct a single-segment fault geometry and estimate the coseismic slip distribution by inverting the derived LOS and BOI-derived azimuth displacements. Inversion results show that adding the BOI-derived azimuth displacements to source modeling can improve the resolution of the slip model by similar to 15% compared with using the LOS displacements only. The coseismic slip is mainly distributed 2 to 11 km deep, with a maximum slip of approximately 1.1 m. Coulomb stress calculation shows a maximum Coulomb stress increment of similar to 0.05 Mpa at the north-central sub-region of the Red River Fault. In addition, there is a small Coulomb stress increase at the Southern end of the Weixi-Weishan fault. The potential seismic risks on the Weixi-Weishan and Northwest section of the Red River faults should be continuously monitored.

TI  - Detecting Key Factors of Grasshopper Occurrence in Typical Steppe and Meadow Steppe by Integrating Machine Learning Model and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Grasshoppers are among the most dangerous agricultural pests of China. However, the monitoring, prediction and control of grasshoppers are complex and difficult. Therefore, it is crucial to detect the key factors affecting the spatial distribution of grasshopper occurrence, understand the role of the environmental factors in grasshopper occurrence, and study whether different laws exist between different grass types. Here we conduct a species-environmental matching model integrated by Maxent model and remote sensing data to identify the spatial distribution of grasshopper occurrence in Inner Mongolia of China, analyze the related environmental variables and detect the most relevant environmental factors for grasshopper occurrence both in typical steppe and meadow steppe. Grasshoppers mainly threaten natural grassland vegetation and crops. Therefore, it is of great significance to understand the relationship between environmental factors and grasshopper occurrence. This paper studies the spatial distribution and key factors of grasshopper occurrence in two grass types by integrating a machine learning model (Maxent) and remote sensing data within the major grasshopper occurrence areas of Inner Mongolia, China. The modelling results demonstrate that the typical steppe has larger suitable area and more proportion for grasshopper living than meadow steppe. The soil type, above biomass, altitude and temperature mainly determine the grasshopper occurrence in typical steppe and meadow steppe. However, the contribution of these factors in the two grass types is significantly different. In addition, related vegetation and meteorological factors affect the different growing stages of grasshoppers between the two grass types. This study clearly defines the different effects of key environmental factors (meteorology, vegetation, soil and topography) for grasshopper occurrence in typical steppe and meadow steppe. It also provides a methodology to guide early warning and precautions for grasshopper pest prevention. The findings of this study will be helpful for future management measures, to ensure grass ecological environment security and the sustainable development of grassland.

TI  - Production Capacity Evaluation of Farmland Using Long Time Series of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmland is a crucial resource for the survival and evolution of humans. The accurate evaluation of farmland production capacity (FPC) is of great significance for planting structure optimization, the improvement of low-yield farmland and sustainable utilization. The objective of this study is to quantitatively evaluate the FPC at the county scale using time series remote sensing (RS) images. Taking winter wheat as a benchmark crop, the relations between annual yield and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were established by a multiple linear regression algorithm. The mean and standard deviations (SD) of the multi-year yield of winter wheat were used to evaluate FPC and its instability using the farmland parcels as the basic unit. The results show that the estimation model for annual winter wheat yield performed best in 2011. The R2 of the modeling sample was 0.93, and the RMSE of the testing sample was 368.1 kg/ha. The FPC grades in the south and north of the study area were relatively high with a good stability, while those in the center were low with poor stability. There was a certain correlation between FPC and soil organic matter (SOM), and the correlation coefficient was 0.525 (p < 0.01). In this study, taking the farmland parcel as a basic unit instead of a pixel, long time series of multi-source RS images with medium resolution were used to monitor the per unit yield of benchmark crops and then evaluate the FPC. This can provide a method for the rapid evaluation of FPC at the county scale.

TI  - Quantitative Inversion Method of Surface Suspended Sand Concentration in Yangtze Estuary Based on Selected Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Bands
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of the surface suspended sand concentration (SSSC) in the Yangtze River estuary is extremely complex. Therefore, effective methods are needed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of SSSC inversion. Hyperspectral remote sensing technology provides an effective technical means of accurately monitoring and quantitatively inverting SSSC. In this study, a new framework for the accurate inversion of the SSSC in the Yangtze River estuary using hyperspectral remote sensing is proposed. First, we quantitatively simulated water bodies with different SSSCs using sediment samples from the Yangtze River estuary, and analyzed the spectral characteristics of water bodies with different SSSCs. On this basis, we compared six spectral transformation forms, and selected the first derivative (FD) transformation as the optimal spectral transformation form. Subsequently, we compared two feature band extraction methods: the successive projections algorithm (SPA) and the competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) method. Then, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model and back propagation (BP) neural network model were constructed. The BP neural network model was determined as the best inversion model. The new FD-CARS-BP framework was applied to the airborne hyperspectral data of the Yangtze estuary, with R-2 of 0.9203, RPD of 4.5697, RMSE of 0.0339 kg/m(3), and RMSE% of 8.55%, which are markedly higher than those of other framework combination forms, further verifying the effectiveness of the FD-CARS-BP framework in the quantitative inversion process of SSSC in the Yangtze estuary.

TI  - Deep Learning Based Burnt Area Mapping Using Sentinel 1 for the Santa Cruz Mountains Lightning Complex (CZU) and Creek Fires 2020
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The study presented here builds on previous synthetic aperture radar (SAR) burnt area estimation models and presents the first U-Net (a convolutional network architecture for fast and precise segmentation of images) combined with ResNet50 (Residual Networks used as a backbone for many computer vision tasks) encoder architecture used with SAR, Digital Elevation Model, and land cover data for burnt area mapping in near-real time. The Santa Cruz Mountains Lightning Complex (CZU) was one of the most destructive fires in state history. The results showed a maximum burnt area segmentation F1-Score of 0.671 in the CZU, which outperforms current models estimating burnt area with SAR data for the specific event studied models in the literature, with an F1-Score of 0.667. The framework presented here has the potential to be applied on a near real-time basis, which could allow land monitoring as the frequency of data capture improves.

TI  - Regional Monitoring of Fall Armyworm (FAW) Using Early Warning Systems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The second United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG2), zero hunger, aims to improve the productivity, food security, nutrition, and sustainability of small-scale farmers. The fall armyworm (FAW, Spodoptera frugiperda) has been devasting to smallholder farmer food security since it spread to sub-Saharan Africa in 2016, who have suffered massive crop losses, particularly maize, an important staple for basic sustenance. Since the FAW mainly devours green leaf biomass during the maize vegetative growth stage, the implementation of remote sensing technologies offers opportunities for monitoring the FAW. Here, we developed and tested a Sentinel 2 a+b satellite-based monitoring algorithm based on optimized first-derivative NDVI time series analysis using Google Earth Engine. For validation, we first employed the FAO Fall Armyworm Monitoring and Early Warning System (FAMEWS) mobile app data from Kenya, and then subsequently conducted field validation campaigns in Zimbabwe, Kenya, and Tanzania. Additionally, we directly observed loss of green biomass during maize vegetative growth stages caused by the FAW, confirming the observed signals of loss of the leaf area index (LAI) and the total green biomass (via the NDVI). Preliminary analyses suggested that satellite monitoring of small-scale farmer fields at the regional level may be possible with an NDVI first-derivative time series anomaly analysis using ESA Sentinel 2 a+b (R-2 = 0.81). Commercial nanosatellite constellations, such as PlanetScope, were also explored, which may offer benefits from greater spatial resolution and return interval frequency. Due to other confounding factors, such as clouds, intercropping, weeds, abiotic stresses, or even other biotic pests (e.g., locusts), validation results were mixed. Still, maize biomass anomaly detection for monitoring the FAW using satellite data could help confirm the presence of the FAW with the help of expanded field-based monitoring through the FAO FAMEWS app.

TI  - The ATI-ET Triangle Model: A Novel Approach to Estimate Soil Moisture Applied to MODIS Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A simple soil moisture (SM) estimation method is proposed using apparent thermal inertia (ATI) and evapotranspiration (ET) data. Among the methods of estimating SM by using thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing, the ATI method is widely used in bare soil and low vegetation areas. However, large surface ET will cause ATI error, resulting in lower accuracy of SM estimation. To overcome this problem, the potential of ATI-ET space for estimating the SM of bare and vegetated farmland in the dry season (no irrigation) is studied. ATI and ET data were used to construct triangle feature space, and six distance parameters are extracted from the positions of random pixels in the triangle. Some correlation estimates were made to derive those parameters that were useful for SM estimation, which were three in total. The SM estimation model consisting of these three parameters was built. Compared with the ATI model, the ATI-ET triangle model can not only be applied to areas with high ET, but also has higher accuracy in estimating SM. The ATI-ET triangle model is more suitable for application in bare soil and low vegetation areas. As the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index increases, the accuracy of the model estimates decreases. To show the high portability of the proposed model for SM estimation, we chose another set of in situ SM data acquired in Tibetan Plateau. The results proved the effectiveness of the model in other similar study regions.

TI  - Deep learning models to map an agricultural expansion area with MODIS and Sentinel-2 time series images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping changing land use and land cover (LULC) is important for land management and environment analysis. We tried to build deep learning models to classify LULC over time at an agricultural expansion area in Matopiba region, Brazil with MCD43A4 V006 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) time series data. We collected time series MODIS data and Sentinel-2 A/B MSI data from 2015 to 2020 and prepared small patches with containing blue, green, red, near-infrared, and shortwave-infrared-1 bands as features. Then the both datasets were used to build and train the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, the CNN gate recurrent unit (CNN-GRU) model, and the CNN long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) model, respectively. We evaluated these three trained models with ground truth data, and the CNN-LSTM model (overall accuracy: 91.29% from MODIS data and 89.47% from Sentinel-2 data) was better than the CNN-GRU model (overall accuracy: 89.19% from MODIS data and 88.61% from Sentinel-2 data) and the CNN model (overall accuracy: 89.17% from MODIS data and 86.02% from Sentinel-2 data). Our results also showed that the accuracy from cropland and savanna classes were higher than grassland and forest classes in all three models. These two classes generated from the CNNLSTM model performed better than the other two deep learning models. The results from these two datasets indicated that the methods were reliable for both coarse and medium spatial resolution satellite images and time series remote sensing images worked better than single image for classification problems when considering LULC change over time. The results also provided an alternative way to prepare input data from satellite images for deep learning models. Furthermore, the classification results of the whole agricultural expansion area were reasonable and it can be used as an additional dataset for further environmental analysis at a regional scale.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Changes of Ecological Environment Quality Based on RSEI: A Case Study in Ulan Mulun River Basin, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ulan Mulun River Basin is an essential ecological protective screen of the Mu Us Desert and a necessary energy base in Ordos City. With the acceleration of industrialization and urbanization, human activities have caused enormous challenges to the local ecological environment. To achieve the region's economic sustainability and make local development plans more objective, it is necessary to evaluate the basin's ecological environment quality over a period of time. First, in the Landsat historical images, we selected 5 years of data to investigate the changes in this time-period (2000-2020). Second, based on the opened remote sensing database on Google Earth Engine, we calculated the remote-sensing ecological index (RSEI) distribution map. RSEI includes greenness, temperature, humidity, and dryness. Thirdly, we assessed the ecological-environmental distribution and change characteristics in the Ulan Mulun River Basin. Finally, we analyzed the RSEI spatial auto-correlation distribution characteristics in the study area. The mean values of RSEI in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020 were 0.418, 0.421, 0.443, 0.456, and 0.507, respectively, which indicated that the ecological environment quality had gradually improved. The ecological environment quality from 2000 to 2005 had the biggest change, as the area with drastically changed water levels accounted for 78.98% of the total basin. It showed a downward trend in the central and western regions. It showed an upward trend in the eastern region. For 20 years, the area of deterioration decreased by 24.37%, and the slight change area increased by 45.84%. The Global Moran's I value ranged from 0.324 to 0.568. The results demonstrated that the Ulan Mulun River Basin ecological environment quality spatial distribution was positively correlated, and the clustering degree decreased gradually. Local spatial auto-correlation of RSEI showed that high-high(H-H) was mainly distributed in the basin's eastern and southern regions, where the population density was low and the vegetation was in good condition. Low-low(L-L) was mainly distributed in the basin's central regions and western regions, where the population density was high, and the industrial and mining enterprises were concentrated. This study provided a theoretical basis for the sustainable development of the Ulan Mulun River Basin, which is crucial for the local ecological environment and economic development.

TI  - Resilient landscape pattern for reducing coastal flood susceptibility
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating flood susceptibility, identifying flood-prone areas, and planning reasonable landscape patterns are impor-tant measures in promoting sustainable urban development and flood mitigation. To this end, this study evaluated the flood susceptibility using a neural network model depending on a flood inundation map created from satellite data from 2010 to 2020, and explanatory factors for flood inundation selected by Geodetector and regularized random for-est. Subsequently, the landscape pattern of the coastal city was quantified based on the land cover, and key landscape pattern metrics for flood susceptibility were selected at patch and class levels using statistical approaches. Eventually, urban spatial planning strategies for flood management were proposed based on the ecological significance of key met-rics. Taking Xiamen as a case study, the flood susceptibility map showed that flood-prone areas in Xiamen are mainly distributed along river banks and coastlines. Key landscape pattern metrics for flood susceptibility selected by statisti-cal approaches showed that patch-level metrics account for more explanatory power than class-level metrics, and the classes of the landscape would affect the role of patch-level metrics. Overall, the division index of the forest, the connectance index of water, the number of core areas and the fractal dimension index of urban, and the Euclidean nearest-neighbor distance of urban and water are significantly positively related to flood susceptibility, while the core area and the proximity index of urban, the similarity index, the core area index, and the edge contrast index of the forest, and the contiguity index of forest, grass, farmland, and shrub negatively related with flood susceptibility. Based on these findings, intensive urban planning and integrative Nature-based Solutions networks should be consid-ered as strategies for enhancing coastal flood resilience.

TI  - A Novel Freeze-Thaw State Detection Algorithm Based on L-Band Passive Microwave Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowing the freeze-thaw (FT) state of the land surface is essential for many aspects of weather forecasting, climate, hydrology, and agriculture. Microwave L-band emission contains rather direct information about the FT-state because of its impact on the soil dielectric constant, which determines microwave emissivity and the optical depth profile. However, current L-band-based FT algorithms need reference values to distinguish between frozen and thawed soil, which are often not well known. We present a new FT-state-detection algorithm based on the daily variation of the H-polarized brightness temperature of the SMAP L3c FT global product for the northern hemisphere, which is available from 2015 to 2021. Exploiting the daily variation signal allows for a more reliable state detection, particularly during the transition periods, when the near-surface soil layer may freeze and thaw on sub-daily time scales. The new algorithm requires no reference values; its results agree with the SMAP FT state product by up to 98% in summer and up to 75% in winter. Compared to the FT state inferred indirectly from the 2-m air temperature and collocated soil temperature at 0-7 cm of the ERA5-land reanalysis, the new FT algorithm has a similar performance to the SMAP FT product. The most significant differences occur over the midlatitudes, including the Tibetan plateau and its downstream area. Here, daytime surface heating may lead to daily FT transitions, which are not considered by the SMAP FT state product but are correctly identified by the new algorithm. The new FT algorithm suggests a 15 days earlier start of the frozen-soil period than the ERA5-land's estimate. This study is expected to extend the L-band microwave remote sensing data for improved FT detection.

TI  - Inversion of Soil Organic Matter Content Based on Improved Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is an important source of nutrients required during crop growth and is an important component of cultivated soil. In this paper, we studied the possibility of using deep learning methods to establish a multi-feature model to predict SOM content. Moreover, using Nong'an County of Changchun City as the study area, Sentinel-2A remote sensing images were taken as the data source to construct the dataset by using field sampling and image processing. The LeNet-5 convolutional neural network model was chosen as the deep learning model, which was improved based on the basic model. The evaluation metrics were selected as the root mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination R-2. Through comparison, the R-2 of the improved model was found to be higher than that of the linear regression method, Support Vector Machines (SVM) (RMSE = 2.471, R-2 = 0.4035), and Random Forest (RF) (RMSE = 2.577, R-2 = 0.4913). The result shows that: (1) It is feasible to use the multispectral data extracted from remote sensing images for soil organic matter content inversion based on the deep learning model with a minimum RMSE of 2.979 and with the R-2 reaching 0.89. (2) The choice of features has an impact on the prediction of the model to a certain extent. After ranking the importance of features, selecting the appropriate number of features for inversion provides better results than full feature inversion, and the computational speed is improved.

TI  - Sounding Data from Ground-Based Microwave Radiometers for a Hailstorm Case: Analyzing Spatiotemporal Differences and Initializing an Idealized Model for Prediction
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric physical sounding data from three ground-based microwave radiometers located in Xi'an were analyzed to explore the temporal and spatial differences of a hailstorm event and were initialized into an idealized Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to predict the total evolution of the event, which occurred on 29 July 2019. Liquid water and relative humidity profiles revealed a consistent sequence of hailstorm intensity among observations from surface meteorological stations and the FY-4A satellite, where the precipitation and cloud top temperature intensified from north to south, corresponding to the locations of the ground-based microwave radiometers in Gaoling, Weiyang, and Chang'an. Compared with those of a similar storm without hail that occurred on 9 August 2018, the humidity profiles and heights at 0 degrees C and -20 degrees C exhibited more dramatic changes. The heights at 0 degrees C and -20 degrees C obviously increased with a low-value zone in the relative humidity profiles during the strongest stage of the hailstorm in Chang'an and Weiyang. Later, the heights sharply dropped in Chang'an when strong, downward ice-phased hydrometers occurred with hail production in the storm. A time-saving, idealized WRF simulation, initialized with pre-3-h sounding data from ground-based microwave radiometers, was designed to qualitatively predict this hailstorm. The simulations consistently showed a strong-to-weak intensity of storms from Chang'an to Weiyang to Gaoling. Although the first attempt at this model has uncertainties in both the observations and the model, it provides a potential new method for single-point fine hailstorm prediction.

TI  - Assimilation of All-Sky Radiance from the FY-3 MWHS-2 with the Yinhe 4D-Var System
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared with traditional microwave humidity sounding capabilities at 183 GHz, new channels at 118 GHz have been mounted on the second generation of the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MWHS-2) onboard the Chinese FY-3C and FY-3D polar orbit meteorological satellites, which helps to perform moisture sounding. In this study, as the all-sky approach can manage non-linear and non-Gaussian behavior in cloud- and precipitation-affected satellite radiances, the MWHS-2 radiances in all-sky conditions were first assimilated in the Yinhe four-dimensional variational data assimilation (YH4DVAR) system. The data quality from MWHS-2 was evaluated based on observation minus background statistics. It is found that the MWHS-2 data of both FY-3C and FY-3D are of good quality in general. Six months of MWHS-2 radiances in all-sky conditions were then assimilated in the YH4DVAR system. Based on the forecast scores and observation fits, we conclude that the all-sky assimilation of the MWHS-2 at 118- and 183-GHz channels on FY-3C/D is beneficial to the analysis and forecast fields of the temperature and humidity, and the impact on the forecast skill scores is neutral to positive. Additionally, we compared the impacts of assimilating the 118-GHz channels and the equivalent Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSUA) channels on global forecast accuracy in the absence of other satellite observations. Overall, the impact of the 118-GHz channels on the forecast accuracy is not as large as that for the equivalent AMSUA channels. Nevertheless, all-sky radiance assimilation of MWHS-2 in the YH4DVAR system has indeed benefited from the 118-GHz channels.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis and War Impact Assessment of Agricultural Land in Ukraine Using RS and GIS Technology
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Military conflicts are one of the inevitable factors that can cause countries to suffer from food insecurity due to reduced agricultural productivity, increased food prices, and the deterioration of agricultural land and infrastructure. Farmland may become fallowed and abandoned as a result of reduced investment in agricultural management caused by military conflicts. To rapidly assess the impact of conflicts on agricultural land and food security, the utilization of effective and feasible methods for the regular monitoring agricultural management status is necessary. To achieve this goal, we developed a framework for analyzing the spatiotemporal distribution of agricultural land and assessing the impact of the Ukraine-Russia war on agricultural management in Ukraine using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) technology. The random forest (RF) classifier, gap filling and Savitzky-Golay filtering (GF-SG) method, fallow-land algorithm based on neighborhood and temporal anomalies (FANTA) algorithm, and kernel density method were jointly used to classify and reveal the spatiotemporal distribution of fallowed and abandoned croplands from 2018 to 2022 based on Landsat time series data on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results demonstrated that fallowed and abandoned croplands could be successfully and effectively identified through these proven methods. Hotspots of fallowed croplands frequently occurred in eastern Ukraine, and long-term consecutive fallow agricultural management caused cropland abandonment. Moreover, hotspots of war-driven fallowed croplands were found in western Kherson and the center of Luhansk, where the war has been escalated for a long time. This reveals that the war has had a significant negative impact on agricultural management and development. These results highlight the potential of developing an accessible methodological framework for conducting regular assessments to monitor the impact of military conflicts on food security and agricultural management.

TI  - Accumulation of Postoperative Unexpected Events Assessed by the Comprehensive Complication Index(R) as Prognostic Outcome Parameters for Kasai Procedure
T2  - CHILDREN-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction The Kasai procedure in children with biliary atresia (BA) is associated with several complications in the short-term. The Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI(R)) is a validated metric in adult surgery for the analysis of complications and morbidity in surgical patients. We aimed to analyze the CCI(R) for the first time in BA infants and to correlate its association with outcomes. Material and Methods We conducted a retrospective review of medical records of infants with type III BA undergoing the Kasai procedure between January 2011 and December 2021 at our institution. All unexpected events were ranked according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, and the CCI(R) per patient was subsequently calculated. Clavien-Dindo grades, individual events, CCI(R), and total event numbers per patient were correlated with one- and two-year outcomes post-surgery. Results A total of 131 events were identified in 101 patients (ranging 0-11 per patient). Forty-four Grade I (33.6%), 67 Grade II (51.1%), 18 Grade III (13.7%), and two sentinel events [>Grade IV] (1.5%) were documented according to Clavien-Dindo, including one death in a cardiac-associated BA patient. None of the complications significantly correlated with a poor outcome. Sixty-three (62.4%) CCI(R) scores were calculated (range 0-100). The mean CCI(R) score during the in-patient treatment post-surgery was significantly higher in patients with a poorer outcome than patients with native liver survival at one- and two-year follow-up (22.7 +/- 21.7 vs. 13.2 +/- 18.1; p = 0.02). Conclusion Not the severity of complications, but the accumulation of numerous events related to Kasai procedure were associated with a poorer outcome. Therefore, the CCI(R) is an excellent instrument for the postoperative morbidity assessment of BA patients.

TI  - Two-Dimensional Mapping of Ionospheric Total Electron Content over the Philippines Using Kriging Interpolation
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of ionospheric total electron content (TEC) was made possible with the help of satellite data, albeit in one dimension. However, ionospheric TEC maps can be produced from a collection of one-dimensional satellite data over a geographic area. Multiple mapping methods have been recognized; however, this study tried to test one of those methods: kriging interpolation. An algorithm was developed and used to reconstruct GIMs. The optimum number of stations and the semivariogram model were evaluated using GIM maps modeling 12 days of March 2015, accounting for different ionospheric conditions. This includes days of high scintillation and an ionospheric storm due to the St. Patrick's Day geomagnetic storm of 2015. It was found that 12 stations and the linear semivariogram model had the least mean error in 5 days and had the least standard deviation in 7 days, making it the optimum parameter set. This optimum set was then used to map and analyze the ionosphere using actual satellite data from the Philippine Active Geodetic Network (PAGeNet). From this, it was observed that there is a north-south gradient in VTEC in the region during the day. The VTEC in the north reaches more than 100 TECU, and, in the south, generally around 60-90 TECU depending on the ionospheric condition. VTEC was at a minimum during the night when the VTEC level decreases to around 10 TECU.

TI  - Fused LISS IV Image Classification using Deep Convolution Neural Networks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - These days, earth observation frameworks give a large number of heterogeneous remote sensing information. The most effective method to oversee such fulsomeness in utilizing its reciprocity is a vital test in current remote sensing investigation. Considering optical Very High Spatial Resolution (VHSR) images, satellites acquire both Multi Spectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images at various spatial goals. Information fusion procedures manage this by proposing a technique to consolidate reciprocity among the various information sensors. Classification of remote sensing image by Deep learning techniques using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is increasing a solid decent footing because of promising outcomes. The most significant attribute of CNN-based strategies is that earlier element extraction is not required which prompts great speculation capacities. In this article, we are proposing a novel Deep learning based SMDTR-CNN (Same Model with Different Training Round with Convolution Neural Network) approach for classifying fused (LISS IV + PAN) image next to image fusion. The fusion of remote sensing images from CARTOSAT-1 (PAN image) and IRS P6 (LISS IV image) sensor is obtained by Quantization Index Modulation with Discrete Contourlet Transform (QIM-DCT). For enhancing the image fusion execution, we remove specific commotions utilizing Bayesian channel by Adaptive Type-2 Fuzzy System. The outcomes of the proposed procedures are evaluated with respect to precision, classification accuracy and kappa coefficient. The results revealed that SMDTR-CNN with Deep Learning got the best all-around precision and kappa coefficient. Likewise, the accuracy of each class of fused images in LISS IV + PAN dataset is improved by 2% and 5%, respectively.

TI  - Impact of Sediment Deposition on Flood Carrying Capacity of an Alluvial Channel: A Case Study of the Lower Indus Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Impacts of climate change and human-made interventions have altered the fluvial regime of most rivers. The increasingly uncertain floods would further threaten the flow delivery system in regions such as Pakistan. In this study, an alluvial reach of the Indus River below Kotri barrage was investigated for the geomorphologic effects of sediments deposited over the floodplain as well as the influences on the downstream flood-carrying capacity. The hydrodynamic modeling suite HEC-RAS in combination with ground and remotely sensed data were used to undertake this analysis. Results suggest that the morphology of the river reach has degraded due to depleted flows over a long period and hydrological extremes that have led to excessive sediment deposition over the floodplain and an enhancement in flood water extension possibility over the banks. A deposition of 4.3 billion cubic meters (BCM) of sediment increased the elevation of the channel bed which in turn reduced a 17.75% flood-carrying capacity of the river reach. Moreover, the excessive deposition of sediments and the persistence of low flows have caused a loss of 48.34% bank-full discharges over the past 24 years. Consequently, the river's active reach has been flattened, with a live threat of left levee failure and the inundation of the populous city of Hyderabad. The study would gain insights into characterizing the impacts associated with a reduction in the flood-carrying capacity of the alluvial channel on account of the inadequate sediment transport capacity after heavy flow regulations.

TI  - Fire Regime Analysis in Lebanon (2001-2020): Combining Remote Sensing Data in a Scarcely Documented Area
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a recurrent disturbance in Mediterranean ecosystems. Data assemblage from forest fire services can provide useful information for understanding climate controls on daily fire hazard or long term trends. Located at the driest range of the Mediterranean bioclimate, and with contrasting socio-political systems compared to the European area, the southern Mediterranean ecosystems are subjected to more extreme climate and social events. This could potentially lead to unique fire regimes and trends worth being characterized for prevention plans and ecosystem management. However, the region is far less documented, due to missing or inhomogeneous fire records, leaving local authorities with no management strategies when large fires happen. We filled this knowledge gap for Lebanon by combining high spatial resolution Landsat data with high temporal resolution VIIRS (S-NPP and NOAA-20) and MODIS (MCD14ML) hotspots to characterize the seasonal and interannual fire regime over the 2001-2020 period. Numerous small fires were hardly detected by global remote sensing. We estimated that 2044 ha burn annually, representing 0.58% of the wildland cover, with no significant trend over the period, but with non climate-related fires detected during the year experiencing socio-political troubles. The spatial and temporal resolution of this dataset identified a particular prolonged fire season up to November, and an unusual bimodal fire season peaking in July and November. We related these features to the prolonged autumnal soil drought and high August air humidity in the region.

TI  - Kryging: geostatistical analysis of large-scale datasets using Krylov subspace methods
T2  - STATISTICS AND COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing massive spatial datasets using a Gaussian process model poses computational challenges. This is a problem prevailing heavily in applications such as environmental modeling, ecology, forestry and environmental health. We present a novel approximate inference methodology that uses profile likelihood and Krylov subspace methods to estimate the spatial covariance parameters and makes spatial predictions with uncertainty quantification for point-referenced spatial data. "Kryging" combines Kriging and Krylov subspace methods and applies for both observations on regular grid and irregularly spaced observations, and for any Gaussian process with a stationary isotropic (and certain geometrically anisotropic) covariance function, including the popular Matern covariance family. We make use of the block Toeplitz structure with Toeplitz blocks of the covariance matrix and use fast Fourier transform methods to bypass the computational and memory bottlenecks of approximating log-determinant and matrix-vector products. We perform extensive simulation studies to show the effectiveness of our model by varying sample sizes, spatial parameter values and sampling designs. A real data application is also performed on a dataset consisting of land surface temperature readings taken by the MODIS satellite. Compared to existing methods, the proposed method performs satisfactorily with much less computation time and better scalability.

TI  - Diagnostic Value of Radio-Guided Sentinel Node Detection in Patients with Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy with Modified-Extended Lymphadenectomy
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Radio-guided sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection techniques are utilized in many malignancies, including breast and penile cancer. In the setting of prostate cancer (PCa), SLNs identification had low specificity and sensitivity in available studies, and extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) remains the gold standard in the assessment of nodal invasion. Our study is the first to detect SLNs pre- and intraoperatively while performing 'whole-pelvis' modified-extended lymphadenectomy (mePLND), including lymph nodes (LNs) from the ePLND template, as well as the presacral and Marcille's fossa areas. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT) and the gamma-probe in the SLN detection, as well as to map lymphatic drainage patterns in the prostate. Results showed that the SLN detection technique has very low specificity and relatively high sensitivity and remains a poor nodal staging tool in intermediate- and high-risk PCa patients. Background. In many malignancies, sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) is being used as a nodal staging tool. We prospectively evaluated the diagnostic value of radio-guided sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection in patients with prostate cancer (PCa). This study aimed to investigate the reliability of the radio-guided SLN detection technique for perioperative localization of LNs metastases as well as to map lymphatic drainage patterns of the prostate. Methods. Forty-three patients with intermediate- or high-risk cN0cM0 PCa at conventional imaging underwent radical prostatectomy with modified-extended pelvic lymph node dissection (mePLND). A day before the planned surgery, a Tc-99m nanocolloid was injected into the prostate under the control of transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS). Preoperative single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT) imaging and intraoperative gamma-probe were used to identify SLNs. All positive lesions were excised, followed by mePLND. The excised lymph nodes (LNs) were then submitted for histopathological examination, which was used as a reference for the calculation of diagnostic parameters of the SLN technique for SPECT-CT and the intraoperative gamma-probe. Results. In total, 119 SLNs were detected preoperatively (SPECT-CT) and 118 intraoperatively (gamma-probe). The study revealed that both SLN detection techniques showed a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 6.06%. The negative predictive value (NPV) was 66.67%. SLN technique would have correctly staged nine of 10 patients, which is the same result as in the case of limited LND. However, it allowed the removal of all metastatic nodes only in four of them. SLND would have comprised 69.7% of preoperatively detected LNs, and removed 13 out of 19 positive LNs (68.42%), respectively. Conclusions. Radio-guided SLND has a low diagnostic rate and is a poor staging tool. ePLND remains the gold standard in nodal metastases assessment in PCa. Our study indicates that lymphatic drainage of the prostate and actual metastasis routes may vary significantly.

TI  - The Evolution of the Two Largest Tropical Ice Masses since the 1980s
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - As tropical glaciers continue to retreat, we need accurate knowledge about where they are located, how large they are, and their retreat rates. Remote sensing data are invaluable for tracking these hard-to-reach glaciers. However, remotely identifying tropical glaciers is prone to misclassification errors due to ephemeral snow cover. We reevaluate the size and retreat rates of the two largest tropical ice masses, the Quelccaya Ice Cap (Peru) and Nevado Coropuna (Peru), using remote sensing data from the Landsat missions. To quantify their glacial extents more accurately, we expand the time window for our analysis beyond the dry season (austral winter), processing in total 529 Landsat scenes. We find that Landsat scenes from October, November, and December, which are after the dry season, better capture the glacial extent since ephemeral snow cover is minimized. We compare our findings to past studies of tropical glaciers, which have mainly analyzed scenes from the dry season. Our reevaluation finds that both tropical ice masses are smaller but retreating less rapidly than commonly reported. These findings have implications for these ice masses as sustained water resources for downstream communities.

TI  - Performance Evaluation and Noise Mitigation of the FY-3E Microwave Humidity Sounder
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fengyun-3E, which is equipped with MicroWave Humidity Sounder 2 (MWHS-2) for detecting both temperature and humidity, is China's latest polar orbiting meteorological satellite and China's first satellite in early-morning orbit. The observation bias and observation error characteristics of MWHS-2 are evaluated by using ERA-5 as the background field. The results show that the biases range from -4 to 2 K, and the observation errors are within 1.5 K except for the window channels. A further analysis of the dependence on the scanning angles indicates that observation errors for the window channels and the 118-GHz channels increase with decreasing scanning angles. Observation errors of the window channels and water vapor channels are also latitudinally dependent, and the maximum errors in the high latitudes reach 2.0 K, while those in the tropical regions are approximately 0.8 K. In addition, the observed brightness temperature of FY-3E MWHS-2 is accompanied by striping noises along the track and high-frequency oscillation noises along the scanlines. The noise mitigation results show that both noises are approximately 0.2 K.

TI  - Primary Interannual Variability Patterns of the Growing-Season NDVI over the Tibetan Plateau and Main Climatic Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) vegetation plays an important role in the local ecosystem, which responds significantly to climate change and can affect local and large-scale weather and climate anomalies. However, little attention has been paid to its year-to-year variation. In this paper, using two NDVI datasets (GIMMS and MODIS) originated from satellite remote sensing, the variability characteristics of NDVI over the TP on the interannual time scale and associated local climatic factors were investigated. The results show that two primary patterns of NDVI governed TP during the main growing season (June-September, JJAS) for the period 1982-2020. The first one is a uniform pattern, with a consistent spatial variation over the entire TP, and the second is a dipole pattern, with an out-of-phase spatial variation of NDVI between the northern and southern TP. Interannual variations of the different climatic factors regulate the NDVI variability over the different regions of the TP. The interannual variability of the uniform NDVI pattern is mainly affected by the two local climatic factors, the preceding May-August precipitation and simultaneous JJAS sunshine duration. Specifically, NDVIs over the southern and eastern TP have a more significant response to the preceding precipitation and simultaneous sunshine duration, respectively. The variability of the dipole NDVI pattern is primarily modulated by the preceding May-August precipitation and simultaneous surface air temperature, ground surface temperature, and sunshine duration. However, NDVIs over the northern and southern TP have different degrees of response to the four climatic factors, with the most significant response being to preceding precipitation. The combined effect of these factors contributes to the formation of the interannual variability in the uniform and dipole patterns. This paper may shed light on deeply understanding the reasons for the inconsistency in variations of vegetation over the different regions of the TP under climate change. In addition to the effect of local climatic factors that this study focuses on, the influence of external climatic factors on the variability of the TP NDVI deserves further research in the future.

TI  - Wetland Successional State Affects Fire Severity in a Boreal Shield Landscape
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Boreal peatland ecosystems are generally resilient to low severity wildfire. However, climate change may increase wildfire intensity and frequency, potentially shifting wetlands to less wildfire resistant states. Peatlands formed by infilling generally undergo a succession from open water to grounded peat, with spatially complex intermediate states which may impact wildfire resistance. We explored the relationship between wetland successional states and fire severity following a > 11,000 ha wildfire in Ontario's Boreal Shield landscape. We digitized 144 wetlands of varying successional states from aerial imagery and assessed fire severity using the Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio calculated from Sentinel-2A satellite imagery. Completely peat-filled wetlands were small in area (0.7 +/- 2 ha) but were most frequent on the landscape (n = 99/144) compared to a smaller number (n = 8) of large (19 +/- 2 ha) spatially complex wetlands that comprised > 30% of the total wetland area. In wetlands covered completely, or nearly completely, by peat, fire severity was significantly higher compared to wetlands with interspersed patches of shallow open water. Moreover, > 90% of fire resistant wetlands with open water were associated with beaver dams. Wetlands with more complex surface cover experienced lower mean fire severity but greater variability in fire severity suggesting that variable fuel configuration (i.e., spatially heterogeneous surface cover) in complex wetlands limit wildfire propagation across the wetland surface. Our findings are important for landscape conservation and wildfire management, as spatially complex wetlands host a diverse array of habitats for at-risk species and may offer protection from severe wildfires as fire refugia.

TI  - Evaluating Satellite Fire Detection Products and an Ensemble Approach for Estimating Burned Area in the United States
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire location and burning area are essential parameters for estimating fire emissions. However, ground-based fire data (such as fire perimeters from incident reports) are often not available with the timeliness required for real-time forecasting. Fire detection products derived from satellite instruments such as the GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager or MODIS, on the other hand, are available in near real-time. Using a ground fire dataset of 2699 fires during 2017-2019, we fit a series of linear models that use multiple satellite fire detection products (HMS aggregate fire product, GOES-16, MODIS, and VIIRS) to assess the ability of satellite data to detect and estimate total burned area. It was found that on average models fit with fire detections from GOES-16 products performed better than those developed from other satellites in the study (modelled R-2 = 0.84 and predictive R-2 = 0.88). However, no single satellite product was found to best estimate incident burned area, highlighting the need for an ensemble approach. With our proposed modelling ensemble, we demonstrate its ability to estimate burned area and suggest its further use in daily fire tracking and emissions-modeling frameworks.

TI  - Urban Birds as Antimicrobial Resistance Sentinels: White Storks Showed Higher Multidrug-Resistant <i>Escherichia coli</i> Levels Than Seagulls in Central Spain
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a major health challenge of the 21st century. Several studies confirm the potential role of wildlife as sentinel for pathogens surveillance. Moreover, the presence of AMR bacteria in the wildlife can be considered as a good indicator of anthropization level on the ecosystem. The fast increase in AMR worldwide has been enhanced by several factors as globalization and migration. The study of antimicrobial resistance in wild birds is of great importance, as they can travel hundreds of kilometers and disseminate pathogens and AMR across different regions or even continents. The aim of this study was to compare the level of AMR in three bird species: white stork (Ciconia ciconia), lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus) and black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus). For the analysis, 17 antibiotics from the most representative classes were tested by disk-diffusion method. Results showed 63.2% of seagulls and 31.6% of white storks as carriers of antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli, and from all of them, 38.9% were considered multi-drug resistant. Betalactamics, quinolones and tetracyclines were the antibiotic classes with the highest rate of AMR. The presence of AMR bacteria in the human-animal-environmental interface is a clear example of the One Health medicine. Several studies evidence the presence of resistant bacteria in wildlife, which can be used as a good indicator of anthropization level on the ecosystem. The fast increase in AMR in the environment in the last decade has been led by several factors as globalization and migration. Migratory birds can travel hundreds of kilometers and disseminate pathogens and AMR through different regions or even continents. The aim of this study was to compare the level of AMR in three migratory bird species: Ciconia ciconia, Larus fuscus and Chroicocephalus ridibundus. For this purpose, commensal Escherichia coli has been considered a useful indicator for AMR studies. After E. coli isolation from individual cloacal swabs, antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed by the disk-diffusion method, including 17 different antibiotics. A total of 63.2% of gulls had resistant strains, in contrast to 31.6% of white storks. Out of all the resistant strains, 38.9% were considered multi-drug resistant (50% of white storks and 30% of seagulls). The antibiotic classes with the highest rate of AMR were betalactamics, quinolones and tetracyclines, the most commonly used antibiotic in human and veterinary medicine in Spain.

TI  - The Hateful People: Populist Attitudes Predict Interpersonal and Intergroup Hate
T2  - SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PERSONALITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Do populist attitudes predict a growth in feelings of hate? Or does experiencing hate predict a growth in populist attitudes? Previous research has not yet examined the relation between populist attitudes and hate over time. We conducted a two-wave study with a Dutch adult sample in the Netherlands, to examine the time-extended associations between populism and hate, thereby focusing on other individuals (N = 943) or groups (N = 851) as targets of hate. For interpersonal and intergroup hate, results uncovered an association between populist attitudes and hate, such that, earlier populist attitudes predict later feelings of hate, while the reverse associations were virtually absent. The findings provide new evidence that a populist worldview might fuel feelings of hate over time, rather than the reverse, highlighting the intense and strong negative feelings that the populist worldview can inspire among people. Further implications are discussed.

TI  - Stand Structural Characteristics Derived from Combined TLS and Landsat Data Support Predictions of Mushroom Yields in Mediterranean Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fungi provide recreational and economic services, as well as ecosystem biodiversity. Wild mushroom yields are difficult to estimate; climatic conditions are known to trigger temporally localised yields, and forest structure also affects productivity. In this work, we analyse the capacity of remotely sensed variables to estimate wild mushroom biomass production in Mediterranean Pinus pinaster forests in Soria (Spain) using generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs). In addition to climate variables, multitemporal NDVI derived from Landsat data, as well as structural variables measured with mobile Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS), are considered. Models are built for all mushroom species as a single pool and for Lactarius deliciosus individually. Our results show that, in addition to autumn precipitation, the interaction of multitemporal NDVI and vegetation biomass are most explanatory of mushroom productivity in the models. When analysing the productivity models of Lactarius deliciosus, in addition to the interaction between canopy cover and autumn minimum temperature, basal area (BA) becomes relevant, indicating an optimal BA range for the development of this species. These findings contribute to the improvement of knowledge about wild mushroom productivity, helping to meet Goal 15 of the 2030 UN Agenda.

TI  - Google Earth Engine for Informal Settlement Mapping: A Random Forest Classification Using Spectral and Textural Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and reliable informal settlement maps are fundamental decision-making tools for planning, and for expediting informed management of cities. However, extraction of spatial information for informal settlements has remained a mammoth task due to the spatial heterogeneity of urban landscape components, requiring complex analytical processes. To date, the use of Google Earth Engine platform (GEE), with cloud computing prowess, provides unique opportunities to map informal settlements with precision and enhanced accuracy. This paper leverages cloud-based computing techniques within GEE to integrate spectral and textural features for accurate extraction of the location and spatial extent of informal settlements in Durban, South Africa. The paper aims to investigate the potential and advantages of GEE's innovative image processing techniques to precisely depict morphologically varied informal settlements. Seven data input models derived from Sentinel 2A bands, band-derived texture metrics, and spectral indices were investigated through a random forest supervised protocol. The main objective was to explore the value of different data input combinations in accurately mapping informal settlements. The results revealed that the classification based on spectral bands + textural information yielded the highest informal settlement identification accuracy (94% F-score). The addition of spectral indices decreased mapping accuracy. Our results confirm that the highest spatial accuracy is achieved with the 'textural features' model, which yielded the lowest root-mean-square log error (0.51) and mean absolute percent error (0.36). Our approach highlights the capability of GEE's complex integrative data processing capabilities in extracting morphological variations of informal settlements in rugged and heterogeneous urban landscapes, with reliable accuracy.

TI  - Changes in air quality over different land covers associated with COVID-19 in Turkey aided by GEE
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increased urbanization, the rise of the manufacturing industry, and the use of fossil fuels, poor air quality is one of the most serious and pressing problems worldwide. The COVID-19 outbreak prompted absolute lockdowns in the majority of countries throughout the world, posing new research questions. The study's goals were to analyze air and temperature parameters in Turkey across various land cover classes and to investigate the correlation between air and temperature. For that purpose, remote sensing data from MODIS and Sentinel-5P TROPOMI were used from 2019 to 2021 over Turkey. A large amount of data was processed and analyzed in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Results showed a significant decrease in NO2 in urban areas. The findings can be used in long-term strategies for lowering global air pollution. Future research should look at similar investigations in various study sites and evaluate changes in air metrics over additional classes.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Change Assessment and Future Predictions in the Matenchose Watershed, Rift Valley Basin, Using CA-Markov Simulation
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover change (LULC) is known worldwide as a key factor of environmental modification that significantly affects natural resources. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of land use and land cover in the Matenchose watershed from the years 1991, 2003, and 2020, and future prediction of land use changes for 2050. Landsat TM for 1991, ETM+ for 2003, and Landsat-8 OLI were used for LULC classification for 2020. A supervised image sorting method exhausting a maximum likelihood classification system was used, with the application using ERDAS Imagine software. Depending on the classified LULC, the future LULC 2050 was predicted using CA-Markov and Land Change Models by considering the different drivers of LULC dynamics. The 1991 LULC data showed that the watershed was predominantly covered by grassland (35%), and the 2003 and 2020 LULC data showed that the watershed was predominantly covered by cultivated land (36% and 52%, respectively). The predicted results showed that cultivated land and settlement increased by 6.36% and 6.53%, respectively, while forestland and grassland decreased by 63.76% and 22.325, respectively, from 2020 to 2050. Conversion of other LULC categories to cultivated land was most detrimental to the increase in soil erosion, while forest and grassland were paramount in reducing soil loss. The concept that population expansion and relocation have led to an increase in agricultural land and forested areas was further reinforced by the findings of key informant interviews. This study result might help appropriate decision making and improve land use policies in land management options.

TI  - An Information-Theoretic Approach to Reconciling Historical Climate Observations and Impacts on Agriculture
T2  - WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Decision-makers in climate risk management often face problems of how to reconcile diverse and conflicting sources of information about weather and its impact on human activity, such as when they are determining a quantitative threshold for when to act on satellite data. For this class of problems, it is important to quantitatively assess how severe a year was relative to other years, accounting for both the level of uncertainty among weather indicators and those indicators' relationship to humanitarian consequences. We frame this assessment as the task of constructing a probability distribution for the relative severity of each year, incorporating both observational data}such as satellite measurements}and prior information on human impact}such as farmers' reports}the latter of which may be incompletely measured or partially ordered. We present a simple, extensible statistical method to fit a probability distribution of relative severity to any ordinal data, using the principle of maximum entropy. We demonstrate the utility of the method through application to a weather index insurance project in Malawi, in which the model allows us to quantify the likelihood that satellites would correctly identify damaging drought events as reported by farmers, while accounting for uncertainty both within a set of commonly used satellite indicators and between those indicators and farmers' ranking of the worst drought years. This approach has immediate utility in the design of weather-index insurance schemes and forecast-based action programs, such as assessing their degree of basis risk or determining the probable needs for postseason food assistance.

TI  - A Simple Procedure to Preprocess and Ingest Level-2 Ocean Color Data into Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data from ocean color (OC) remote sensing are considered a cost-effective tool for the study of biogeochemical processes globally. Satellite-derived chlorophyll, for instance, is considered an essential climate variable since it is helpful in detecting climate change impacts. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a planetary scale tool for remote sensing data analysis. Along with OC data, such tools allow an unprecedented spatial and temporal scale analysis of water quality monitoring in a way that has never been done before. Although OC data have been routinely collected at medium (similar to 1 km) and more recently at higher (similar to 250 m) spatial resolution, only coarse resolution (>= 4 km) data are available in GEE, making them unattractive for applications in the coastal regions. Data reprojection is needed prior to making OC data readily available in the GEE. In this paper, we introduce a simple but practical procedure to reproject and ingest OC data into GEE at their native resolution. The procedure is applicable to OC swath (Level-2) data and is easily adaptable to higher-level products. The results showed consistent distributions between swath and reprojected data, building confidence in the introduced framework. The study aims to start a discussion on making OC data at native resolution readily available in GEE.

TI  - ExtractEO, a Pipeline for Disaster Extent Mapping in the Context of Emergency Management
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid mapping of disasters using any kind of satellite imagery is a challenge. The faster the response, the better the service is for the end users who are managing the emergency activities. Indeed, production rapidity is crucial whatever the satellite data in input. However, the speed of delivery must not be at the expense of crisis information quality. The automated flood and fire extraction pipelines, presented in this technical note, make it possible to take full advantage of advanced algorithms in short timeframes, and leave enough time for an expert operator to validate the results and correct any unmanaged thematic errors. Although automated algorithms aren't flawless, they greatly facilitate and accelerate the detection and mapping of crisis information, especially for floods and fires. ExtractEO is a pipeline developed by SERTIT and dedicated to disaster mapping. It brings together automatic data download and pre-processing, along with highly accurate flood and fire detection chains. Indeed, the thematic quality assessment revealed F1-score values of 0.91 and 0.88 for burnt area and flooded area detection, respectively, from various kinds of high- and very-high- resolution data (optical and SAR).

TI  - Why Siberia is not America: Features of the Siberian character
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is dedicated to the Siberian character as a part of the Russian national character. The article aims to review the special features and traits of the Siberians character. Over the past decades, Russian social sciences have comprehended Siberia as an American model of society. The main research method contains a comparison of Siberian and American societies within the process of colonization and development of the territories of both countries. Based on anthropological, historical and sociological studies, particular results were obtained: there are significant differences between the two societies in mindset, worldview, behavior, social communication, economic activities, and many more. The reasons of the mentioned differences are based on the colonization type and climate characteristics. Siberia was colonized by only one Russian ethnic group in harsh climatic conditions. There were no external threats during the Siberian colonization. North America was colonized by several national states (Britain, France, the Netherlands, Spain) in mild climates. By the way, North American territories were also developed by African slaves who worked at plantations. Besides, America was colonized under the French threat. Native people during the colonization in Siberia and North America played different roles. These totally contrasting conditions had a huge impact on agricultural practices and farming techniques, the worldview of the whole American national character and the Siberian local character. A significant part of this study was focused on the mentality of the Siberians. The core of Siberian mentality contains two big complex categories: space and labor. Space and labor as the main patterns of mentality formed the features of cultural, social and household life of the Siberians. As a result of a comparison of the colonizations and characters of the two societies, a comparative table was drawn up. The table shows the value-based categories of the two societies: desires, purposes, type of social relations, etc. Russian and American studies were taken as sources for evaluating the features. The table shows that only a few value-based categories are similar, other categories are different significantly. Obviously, future research demands more valuebased categories for comparison and evaluation. Detailed data about Siberian and American societies will help to conduct research with accurate results for unbiased comprehension.

TI  - Navigation Using Doppler Shift From LEO Constellations and INS Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Absolute navigation using the downlink communication signals of massive low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations augmented by data from an inertial navigation system (INS) is considered. Lack of atomic clocks on-board LEO satellites requires the use of Doppler shift as a navigation observable. Furthermore, footprint limits of downlink signals' beams necessitate the use of a tightly coupled INS/radio-navigation filter in order to compensate for the fact that it is not possible to measure carrier Doppler shift simultaneously from eight or more satellites. The navigation solution error is shown for a simulation, which demonstrates the feasibility of combining measurements from LEO constellations and INS data to enable global navigation satellite systems-like navigation capabilities. Additional simulations study how navigation solution error is affected by IMU quality, signal availability, downlink spot beam steering protocol, and constellation characteristics.

TI  - Evaluation of Extreme Precipitation Indices in Brazil's Semiarid Region from Satellite Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil's semiarid region (SAB) has a heterogeneous precipitation distribution, with the occurrence of periodic droughts and occasional extreme rainfall events. The precipitation monitoring system in this region is insufficient, but remote sensing products can provide information on rainfall in areas with low data coverage. Thus, the main objective of this study was to evaluate 12 extreme precipitation indices calculated using Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) data in comparison with indices calculated from data measured by rain gauges for different SAB locations. To evaluate the IMERG product, we used rainfall data measured by 56 rain gauges during the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2020. The satellite product was evaluated through juxtaposition between the IMERG and actual rainfall data, by calculating the statistical indices bias, root-mean-squared error, Spearman correlation, and probability density function. The results showed that most of the extreme precipitation indices were well represented by the satellite data, except for the simple precipitation intensity index (SDII), in which case the correlation coefficient was 0.2. This result can be explained as this index is calculated from the exact value of daily precipitation, while the other indices are estimated by rainfall values above some thresholds. On the other hand, total annual precipitation and precipitation above 1 mm presented Spearman correlation reaching 0.97 in some locations. We conclude that the IMERG database is adequate to represent the maximum precipitation in the Brazilian semiarid region, and the extreme precipitation indices had good performance according to the region where the maximum rain occurred.

TI  - Remote sensing survey and research on internal solitary waves in the South China Sea-Western Pacific-East Indian Ocean (SCS-WPAC-EIND)
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Internal solitary waves (ISWs) are common mesoscale dynamic processes in the ocean that are spread throughout the world's oceans. The South China Sea (SCS), Western Pacific (WPAC) and Indian Ocean (EIND) (SCS-WPAC-EIND) are areas where ISWs frequently occur. In particular, in the northern part of the South China Sea, Sulu Sea, Celebes Sea, Andaman Sea, Lombok Strait and northeastern part of Taiwan Island, ISWs exist almost year-round. Remote sensing is an important technique to carry out investigations and research on ISWs on a large scale. In particular, optical sensors represented by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) can observe ISWs for a long time and on a large scale, while SAR sensors such as Sentinel-1 A/B can compensate for the deficiencies in optical sensors and comprehensively observe ISWs. Based on many years of remote sensing surveys of ISWs, this paper uses MODIS and Sentinel-1 satellite remote sensing images of more than 70 000 scenes from 2010 to 2020 to carry out survey studies of ISWs in the SCS-WPAC-EIND. The survey systematically gives the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of ISWs in the SCS-WPAC-EIND and focuses on the analysis of the ISW characteristics in main areas in the SCS-WPAC-EIND, thereby providing basic data for further research on ISWs.

TI  - ICESat-2 laser data denoising algorithm based on a back propagation neural network
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) photon data is the emerging satellite-based LiDAR data, widely used in surveying and mapping due to its small photometric spot and high density. Since ICESat-2 data collect weak signals, it is difficult to denoise in shallow sea island areas, and the quality of the denoising method will directly affect the precision of bathymetry. This paper proposes a back propagation (BP) neural network-based denoising algorithm for the data characteristics of shallow island reef areas. First, a horizontal elliptical search area is constructed for the photons in the dataset. Suitable feature values are selected in the search area to train the BP neural network. Finally, data with a geographic location far apart, including daily and nightly data, are selected respectively for experiments to test the generality of the network. By comparing the results with the confidence labels provided in the official documents of the ATL03 dataset, the DBSCAN algorithm, and the manual visual interpretation, it is proved that the denoising algorithm proposed in this paper has a better processing effect in shallowisland areas.

TI  - Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus Survey in Humans, Ticks, and Livestock in Agnam (Northeastern Senegal) from February 2021 to March 2022
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is widespread in Asia, Europe, and Africa. In Senegal, sporadic cases of CCHFV have been reported since 1960. Bordering Mauritania in northeastern Senegal, Agnam is an arid area in the region of Matam where CCHFV is endemic, which harbors a pastoralist community. Given the drought conditions of Agnam, inhabitants are in constant movement with their animals in search of pasture, which brings them into contact with pathogens such as arboviruses. To identify CCHFV in this area, we established a One Health site in order to analyze animal livestock, ticks and human samples collected over a one-year period by qRT-PCR and ELISA. Our analysis showed one (1/364) patient carried anti-CCHFV IgM and thirty-seven carried anti-CCHFV IgG (37/364). In livestock, anti-CCHFV IgG was detected in 13 (38.24%) of 34 sentinel sheep. The risk of CCHFV infection increased significatively with age in humans (p-value = 0.00117) and sheep (p-value = 1.18 x 10(-11)). Additional risk factors for CCHFV infection in sheep were dry seasons (p-value = 0.004) and time of exposure (p-value = 0.007). Furthermore, we detected a total of three samples with CCHFV RNA within Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi and Rhipicephalus guilhoni tick species. Our results highlighted the usefulness of a One Health survey of CCHFV in pastoral communities at risk of arboviruses.

TI  - Vegetation Coverage in the Desert Area of the Junggar Basin of Xinjiang, China, Based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Technology and Multisource Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation coverage information is an important indicator of desert ecological environments. Accurately grasping vegetation coverage changes in desert areas can help in assessing the quality of ecosystems and maintaining their functions. Improving remote sensing methods to detect the vegetation coverage in areas of low vegetation coverage is an important challenge for the remote sensing of vegetation in deserts. In this study, based on the fusion of MOD09GA and MOD09GQ data, 2019-2021 low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing data, and other factors (such as geographical, topographic, and meteorological factors), three types of inversion models for vegetation coverage were constructed: a multivariate parametric regression model, a support vector machine (SVM) regression model, and a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) regression model. The optimal model was then used to map the spatial distribution of vegetation coverage and its dynamic change in the Junggar Basin of Xinjiang, China, over 22 years (from 2000 to 2021). The results show that: (1) The correlation between enhanced vegetation index (EVI) obtained from image fusion and vegetation coverage in desert areas is the highest (r = 0.72). (2) Among the geographical and topographic factors, only longitude and latitude were significantly correlated with vegetation coverage (p < 0.05). The average monthly temperature and precipitation from the previous six months were correlated with the vegetation coverage (p < 0.05), but the vegetation coverage of the current month had the highest correlation with the average temperature (r = -0.27) and precipitation (r = 0.33) of the previous month. (3) Among the multivariate parametric models established by selecting the five aforementioned factors, the multiple linear regression model performed the best (R-2 = 0.64). (4) The SVM regression model was superior to the other regression models (R-2 = 0.80, mean squared error = 8.35%). (5) The average vegetation coverage in the desert area of the Junggar Basin was 7.36%, and from 2000-2021, the vegetation coverage in 54.59% of the desert area increased.

TI  - Analyses of the Impact of Soil Conditions and Soil Degradation on Vegetation Vitality and Crop Productivity Based on Airborne Hyperspectral VNIR-SWIR-TIR Data in a Semi-Arid Rainfed Agricultural Area (Camarena, Central Spain)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils are an essential factor contributing to the agricultural production of rainfed crops such as barley and triticale cereals. Changing environmental conditions and inadequate land management are endangering soil quality and productivity and, in turn, crop quality and productivity are affected. Advances in hyperspectral remote sensing are of great use for the spatial characterization and monitoring of the soil degradation status, as well as its impact on crop growth and agricultural productivity. In this study, hyperspectral airborne data covering the visible, near-infrared, short-wave infrared, and thermal infrared (VNIR-SWIR-TIR, 0.4-12 mu m) were acquired in a Mediterranean agricultural area of central Spain and used to analyze the spatial differences in vegetation vitality and grain yield in relation to the soil degradation status. Specifically, leaf area index (LAI), crop water stress index (CWSI), and the biomass of the crop yield are derived from the remote sensing data and discussed regarding their spatial differences and relationship to a classification of erosion and accumulation stages (SEAS) based on previous remote sensing analyses during bare soil conditions. LAI and harvested crop biomass yield could be well estimated by PLS regression based on the hyperspectral and in situ reference data (R-2 of 0.83, r of 0.91, and an RMSE of 0.2 m(2) m(-2) for LAI and an R-2 of 0.85, r of 0.92, and an RMSE of 0.48 t ha(-1) for grain yield). In addition, the soil erosion and accumulation stages (SEAS) were successfully predicted based on the canopy spectral signal of vegetated crop fields using a random forest machine learning approach. Overall accuracy was achieved above 71% by combining the VNIR-SWIR-TIR canopy reflectance and emissivity of the growing season with topographic information after reducing the redundancy in the spectral dataset. The results show that the estimated crop traits are spatially related to the soil's degradation status, with shallow and highly eroded soils, as well as sandy accumulation zones being associated with areas of low LAI, crop yield, and high crop water stress. Overall, the results of this study illustrate the enormous potential of imaging spectroscopy for a combined analysis of the plant-soil system in the frame of land and soil degradation monitoring.

TI  - Enhancement of tree canopy cover for the mapping of forest from the Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A forest is a piece of land dominated by trees; factors like tree density, tree height, canopy cover, land use, and ecological function discriminate different forest types. The canopy cover is instrumental in the identification of forest in the satellite imagery. Multispectral satellite imageries are very useful in feature highlighting. The combination of bands is a powerful tool not only to enhance some earth features but also to suppress others. In our study, a novel index is proposed for the delineation of tree canopy using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. A new simple vegetation ratio is proposed for the extraction of the vegetated areas including forest, farms, and other green lands, the existing normalized difference built-up index is modified, and an open surface water index is utilized to formulate a novel tree canopy cover index for the identification of tree canopy.

TI  - Impact of urban land use and land cover change on urban heat island and urban thermal comfort level: a case study of Addis Ababa City, Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in the urban heat island is caused by the replacement of vegetation cover by impervious surfaces. As the population of Addis Ababa City has increased dramatically, the vegetation cover and other land cover classes have been converted into built-up areas. This study attempted to examine the relationship between urban heat islands and urban thermal comfort (UTCL) and land use and land cover (LULC) change using geospatial technologies in Addis Ababa City, Ethiopia. Landsat TM 1991, Landsat ETM + 2005, and Landsat OLI/TIRS 2021 data were used in this study. During the study period, LULC change, land surface temperature (LST), and urban heat island were calculated using the multispectral and thermal infrared bands (1991-2021). Results revealed that the built-up area in 1991 was 96.6 km(2) (18.3%), and increased to 165.4 km(2) (31.4%) and 277.2 km(2) (52.6%) by 2005 and 2021, respectively. In contrast, agriculture and vegetation land cover classes were declined by 66.8 km(2) and 25.7 km(2), respectively between 1991 and 2021. Rapid conversion of LULC change increases the mean LST of Addis Ababa City by 8.3 degrees C over the last three decades. According to the results, a high LST was recorded over built-up regions and areas with little vegetative cover. Furthermore, the central areas of the study area suffered a greater UHI effect than the surrounding areas. The results of the urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) revealed that the UHI varies greatly across the city. Strong, stronger, and strongest urban heat islands dominated the central, southwestern, and southeastern suburbans of the study area, respectively. The excellent comfort level has declined from 16.3 km(2) (3.1%) in 1991 to 12.1 km(2) (2.3%) in 2021. The study proposed that local community awareness needs to be raised for environmental conservation through the establishment of urban green spaces that reduce UHI and increase comfort in Addis Ababa City.

TI  - Follow-up Schedule for Patients With Sentinel Node-negative Cutaneous Melanoma (The MELFO Study) An International Phase III Randomized Clinical Trial
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives and Design: The MELFO (MELanoma FOllow-up) study is an international phase III randomized controlled trial comparing an experimental low-intensity schedule against current national guidelines. Background: Evidence-based guidelines for the follow-up of sentinel node-negative melanoma patients are lacking. Methods: Overall, 388 adult patients diagnosed with sentinel node-negative primary melanoma patients were randomized in cancer centers in the Netherlands and United Kingdom between 2006 and 2016. The conventional schedule group (control: n=196) was reviewed as per current national guidelines. The experimental schedule group (n=192) was reviewed in a reduced-frequency schedule. Quality of life was the primary outcome measurement. Detection rates and survival outcomes were recorded. Patient satisfaction rates and compliance with allocated schedules were compared. Results: At 5 years, both arms expressed high satisfaction with their regimens (>97%). This study found no significant group effect on any patient-reported outcome measure scores between the follow-up protocols. In total, 75/388 (19.4%) patients recurred, with no difference in incidence found between the 2 arms (hazard ratio=0.87, 95% confidence interval: 0.54-1.39, P=0.57). Self-examination was the method of detection for 25 experimental patients and 32 control patients (75.8% vs. 76.2%; P=0.41). This study found no difference in any survival outcomes between the 2 study arms (disease-free survival: hazard ratio=1.00, 95% confidence interval: 0.49-2.07, P=0.99). Conclusions: A reduced-intensity, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage-adjusted follow-up schedule for sentinel node-negative melanoma patients is a safe strategy, and patient self-examination is effective for recurrence detection with no evidence of diagnostic delay. Patients' acceptance is very high.

TI  - Ensemble Three-Dimensional Habitat Modeling of Indian Ocean Immature Albacore Tuna (<i>Thunnus alalunga</i>) Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the vertical distribution of immature albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) in the Indian Ocean as a function of various environmental parameters. Albacore tuna fishing data were gathered from the logbooks of large-sized Taiwanese longline vessels. Fishery and environmental data for the period from 1998 to 2016 were collected. In addition to the surface variable, the most influential vertical temperature, dissolved oxygen (OXY), chlorophyll, and salinity layers were found at various depths (i.e., 5, 26, and 53 m for SST; 200, 244, and 147 m for OXY; 508, 628, and 411 for SSCI; and 411, 508, and 773 m for SSS) among 20 vertical layers based on Akaike criterion information value of generalized linear model. Relative to the 20 vertical layers base models, these layers had the lowest Akaike information criteria. For the correlation between the standardized and predicted catch per unit effort (CPUE), the correlation values for the generalized linear model (GLM), generalized additive model (GAM), boosted regression tree (BRT), and random forest (RF) model were 0.798, 0.832, 0.841, and 0.856, respectively. The GAM-, BRT-, and RF-derived full models were selected, whereas the GLM-derived full model was excluded because its correlation value was the lowest among the four models. From March to September, a higher immature albacore standardized CPUE was mainly observed from 30 degrees S to 40 degrees S. A northward shift was observed after September, and the standardized CPUE was mainly concentrated at the south coast of Madagascar from November to January.

TI  - Application of Geospatial Techniques in Evaluating Spatial Variability of Commercially Harvested Mangoes in Bangladesh
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mango is widely known as a popular fruit in South Asia, including Bangladesh. The country is a significant producer of different local and exotic varieties of mangoes in different geographic locations. Therefore, a study of fruit maturity at diverse locations and climatic conditions becomes critical for a sustainable mango production. In responding to this need, this study evaluates the variability of a few selected commercial mango (Mangifera indica L.) varieties and their maturity timeline with respect to spatial extent (longitudinal-latitudinal variations), elevation profile, and time. Remote sensing technology has been widely used for horticultural applications to study fruit phenology, maturity, harvesting time, and for mapping locational differences. In doing so, we have employed remotely sensed data, such as the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) of 30 m spatial resolution, GPM IMERGM precipitation datasets (0.1 x 0.1 degree), NASA GLDAS (Global Land Data Assimilation System) surface skin temperature (0.25 x 0.25 degree), and Noah Land Surface Model L4 3-hourly soil moisture content datasets (0.25 x 0.25 degree). Alongside these, an intensive field data collection campaign has been carried out for 2019 and 2020. It was found that 1 degrees locational variations may result in approximately 2-5 days delay of mango harvesting. The outcome of this study may enhance the appropriate planning of harvesting, production, and the commercialization of mango selection in specific geographic setting for a sustainable harvest and production system in the country.

TI  - Impossible Muse: Disenchantment and Reenchantment in Bernardo Guimaraes' and Luiz Gama's Romantic Satire
T2  - EIXO E A RODA-REVISTA DE LITERATURA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - As figures often attached to a generation of bohemian romantic poets (FRANCHETTI, 1987), Bernardo Guimaraes (1825-1884) and Luiz Gama (1830-1882) reveal a poetic affinity that, as proposed in this essay, does not limit itself to the formal and thematic compositions of their satires, but engages with the deeper meanings of poetic practice as it relates to the modern, prevailing aesthetic of Romanticism in the XIXth Century. Owing partly to the legacy of Ancient Latin and colonial-baroque satires (HANSEN; MOREIRA, 2013), Guimaraes's Poesias (1865) and Gama's Primeiras trovas burlescas de Getulino (1859) manifest in its verses the symptoms of the romantic worldview, inclined towards nostalgia and utopia, and expressed simultaneously as a melancholy disenchantment and a revolt against the ruptures of rationalism and the establishment of capitalism (LoWY; SAYRE, 2015). This wielding of farce and humor by the poets allows them to lament the impossible condition of the Muse in such a context, while mocking her ire against the bards who represent the profound artificiality of these new relations between art and life, laughing at the expense of their own romantic Weltanschauung.

TI  - Impact of land use/land cover on land surface temperature and its relationship with spectral indices in Dakahlia Governorate, Egypt
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a direct impact of urbanization and a crucial factor in global climate and land cover changes. In this research, we aim to identify the impact of land use/land cover (LULC) on LST as well as analyze the relationship between LST and three spectral indices using linear, polynomial and multiple regression models. The LST was first retrieved from Landsat imagery using single-channel algorithm. Afterwards, LULC maps were developed using maximum likelihood (ML) classifier and three spectral indices, namely Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). Finally, regression analysis was conducted to model the relationship between LST and the three spectral indices. Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS imagery of year 2019 of Dakahlia Governorate in Egypt was processed for LST retrieval as well as LULC classification. The ML classifier achieved an overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 95.14% and 0.857, respectively, while of those based on spectral indices were 94.86% and 0.777, respectively. The results demonstrated an average temperature of 35.8 degrees C, 31.2 degrees C and 27.6 degrees C for urban, vegetation and water, respectively. The LST statistics difference between classification methods of the three land covers was less 2 degrees C. Based on the regression analysis, the NDVI and NDWI indicated a negative correlation with LST, while the NDBI indicated a positive correlation with LST. The polynomial regression analysis of LST against NDVI and NDWI demonstrated a better coefficient of determination (R-2) than linear regression analysis of 0.341 and 0.305, respectively. For NDBI, linear and polynomial regression analysis demonstrated very close R-2 of 0.624 and 0.628, respectively. The multiple regression analysis of LST against NDVI, NDBI and NDWI revealed R-2 of 0.699. Consequently, the three spectral indices can be used as effective indicators for separating terrain into different classes, and hence relate their LST.

TI  - Impact of Atmospheric Correction Methods Parametrization on Soil Organic Carbon Estimation Based on Hyperion Hyperspectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Visible Near infrared and Shortwave Infrared (VNIR/SWIR, 400-2500 nm) remote sensing data is becoming a tool for topsoil properties mapping, bringing spatial information for environmental modeling and land use management. These topsoil properties estimates are based on regression models, linking a key topsoil property to VNIR/SWIR reflectance data. Therefore, the regression model's performances depend on the quality of both topsoil property analysis (measured on laboratory over-ground soil samples) and Bottom-of-Atmosphere (BOA) VNIR/SWIR reflectance which are retrieved from Top-Of-Atmosphere radiance using atmospheric correction (AC) methods. This paper examines the sensitivity of soil organic carbon (SOC) estimation to BOA images depending on two parameters used in AC methods: aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the FLAASH (Fast Line-of-Sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes) method and water vapor (WV) in the ATCOR (ATmospheric CORrection) method. This work was based on Earth Observing-1 Hyperion Hyperspectral data acquired over a cultivated area in Australia in 2006. Hyperion radiance data were converted to BOA reflectance using seven values of AOD (from 0.2 to 1.4) and six values of WV (from 0.4 to 5 cm), in FLAASH and ATCOR, respectively. Then a Partial Least Squares regression (PLSR) model was built from each Hyperion BOA data to estimate SOC over bare soil pixels. This study demonstrated that the PLSR models were insensitive to the AOD variation used in the FLAASH method, with R-cv(2) and RMSEcv of 0.79 and 0.4%, respectively. The PLSR models were slightly sensitive to the WV variation used in the ATCOR method, with R-cv(2) ranging from 0.72 to 0.79 and RMSEcv ranging from 0.41 to 0.47. Regardless of the AOD values, the PLSR model based on the best parametrization of the ATCOR model provided similar SOC prediction accuracy to PLSR models using the FLAASH method. Variation in AOD using the FLAASH method did not impact the identification of bare soil pixels coverage which corresponded to 82.35% of the study area, while a variation in WV using the ATCOR method provided a variation of bare soil pixels coverage from 75.04 to 84.04%. Therefore, this work recommends (1) the use of the FLAASH AC method to provide BOA reflectance values from Earth Observing-1 Hyperion Hyperspectral data before SOC mapping or (2) a careful selection of the WV parameter when using ATCOR.

TI  - Water Quality and Water Hyacinth Monitoring with the Sentinel-2A/B Satellites in Lake Tana (Ethiopia)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities coupled with climate change impacts are becoming the main factors in decreasing inland surface water quantity and quality, leading to the disturbance of the aquatic ecological balance. Under such conditions, the introduction and proliferation of aquatic invasive alien species are more likely to occur. Hence, frequent surface water quality monitoring is required for aquatic ecosystem sustainability. The main objectives of the present study are to analyze the seasonal variation in the invasive plant species water hyacinth (Pontederia crassipes) and biogeochemical water quality parameters, i.e., chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM), and to examine their relationship in Lake Tana (Ethiopia) during a one-year study period (2020). Sentinel-2A/B satellite images are used to monitor water hyacinth expansion and Chl-a and TSM concentrations in the water. The Case 2 Regional Coast Colour processor (C2RCC) is used for atmospheric and sunglint correction over inland waters, while the Sen2Cor atmospheric processor is used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for water hyacinth mapping. The water hyacinth cover and biomass are determined by NDVI values ranging from 0.60 to 0.95. A peak in cover and biomass is observed in October 2020, just a month after the peak of Chl-a (25.2 mg m(-3)) and TSM (62.5 g m(-3)) concentrations observed in September 2020 (end of the main rainy season). The influx of sediment and nutrient load from the upper catchment area during the rainy season could be most likely responsible for both Chl-a and TSM increased concentrations. This, in turn, created a fertile situation for water hyacinth proliferation in Lake Tana. Overall, the freely available Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and appropriate atmospheric correction processors are an emerging potent tool for inland water monitoring and management in large-scale regions under a global change scenario.

TI  - ICG lymph node mapping in cancer surgery of the upper gastrointestinal tract
T2  - CHIRURGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of the assessment of the N-status in gastric carcinoma, tumors of the gastroesophageal junction and esophageal cancer is undisputed; however, there is currently no internationally validated method for lymph node mapping in esophageal and gastric cancer. Near-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIR) is an innovative technique from the field of vibrational spectroscopy, which in combination with the fluorescent dye indocyanine green (ICG) enables intraoperative real-time visualization of anatomical structures. The ICG currently has four fields of application in oncological surgery: intraoperative real-time angiography for visualization of perfusion, lymphography for visualization of lymphatic vessels, visualization of solid tumors, and (sentinel) lymph node mapping. For imaging of the lymph drainage area and therefore the consecutive lymph nodes, peritumoral injection of ICG must be performed. Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of peritumoral injection of ICG administered 15 min to 3 days preoperatively with subsequent intraoperative visualization of the lymph nodes. So far prospective randomized studies on the validation of the method are still lacking. In contrast, the use of ICG for lymph node mapping and visualization of sentinel lymph nodes in gastric cancer has been performed in large cohorts as well as in prospective randomized settings. Up to now, multicenter studies for ICG-guided lymph node mapping during oncological surgery of the upper gastrointestinal tract are lacking. Artificial intelligence methods can help to evaluate these techniques in an automated manner in the future as well as to support intraoperative decision making and therefore to improve the quality of oncological surgery.

TI  - An Efficient Approach for Inverting the Soil Salinity in Keriya Oasis, Northwestern China, Based on the Optical-Radar Feature-Space Model
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity has been a major factor affecting agricultural production in the Keriya Oasis. It has a destructive effect on soil fertility and could destroy the soil structure of local land. Therefore, the timely monitoring of salt-affected areas is crucial to prevent land degradation and sustainable soil management. In this study, a typical salinized area in the Keriya Oasis was selected as a study area. Using Landsat 8 OLI optical data and ALOS PALSAR-2 SAR data, the optical remote sensing indexes NDVI, SAVI, NDSI, SI, were combined with the optimal radar polarized target decomposition feature component (VanZyl_vol_g) on the basis of feature space theory in order to construct an optical-radar two-dimensional feature space. The optical-radar salinity detection index (ORSDI) model was constructed to inverse the distribution of soil salinity in Keriya Oasis. The prediction ability of the ORSDI model was validated by a test on 40 measured salinity values. The test results show that the ORSDI model is highly correlated with soil surface salinity. The index ORSDI3 (R-2 = 0.656) shows the highest correlation, and it is followed by indexes ORSDI1 (R-2 = 0.642), ORSDI4 (R-2 = 0.628), and ORSDI2 (R-2 = 0.631). The results demonstrated the potential of the ORSDI model in the inversion of soil salinization in arid and semi-arid areas.

TI  - Mapping mangrove alliances using historical data in Fiji
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The mapping of mangrove alliance distributions is limited because of lack of training data and inaccessibility of sites. Mapping mangrove alliances is important for monitoring carbon storage as well as socio-economic services to local communities. This research uses alliance field data from 1978 along with current mangrove distribution for Rewa River Delta and Suva-Navua coast in Fiji to train a Random Forest model. Classification of mangrove alliances used Sentinel-1 and - 2 images along with elevation data which resulted in a 94% classification accuracy for Rewa River Delta and 74.5% Suva-Navua. Alliances within the Rewa River Delta, including Mixed, Dogo, Boreti, Landward and Tiri, were classified with greater than 85% accuracy. In comparison, most alliances in the Suva-Navua had less than 67% accuracy; the exception was Coastal Fringing alliance which represents 56% of the area and had a 92% classification accuracy. White and red mangroves were better classified when they had larger area coverage. The Random Forest model identified SWIR, NIR and elevation data as the most important variables for discriminating mangrove alliances. Compared to limited other studies that mapped mangrove alliances using optical data alone, this analysis resulted in equal or better classification results. These results show the potential of using historic data for mapping contemporary mangrove alliances in regions that often have limited validation data or accessibility. The next step is mapping recovery of mangrove alliances post-cyclone events to help conservation groups identify focused mitigation efforts.

TI  - Comparison of machine learning algorithms for mangrove species identification in Malad creek, Mumbai using WorldView-2 and Google Earth images
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on the comparison of machine learning algorithms for classifying the mangrove species of Malad creek, Mumbai, India using pixel-based and object-based approaches. As mangrove forests are complex in structure and require high resolution remotely sensed images for classifying them at the species level, traditional classification methods of remote sensing may not be suitable. In order to find an appropriate method, pixel-based random forest and K Nearest Neighbor classifiers and object-based random forest and K Nearest Neighbor classifiers were tested and compared using WorldView - 2 images. In addition, the best resolution RGB images from Google Earth were classified using random forest and K Nearest Neighbor algorithms in object-based approach and compared. The classification results showed that both object-oriented and pixel-based methods could identify the major mangrove species at the community level. However, the performance of object-based random forest classifier was better than other classification approaches in both WorldView-2 and Google Earth images with overall accuracies of 92.53% and 80.72% and kappa coefficients of 0.89 and 0.73. The overall results showed the potential of random forest classifier in object-based method for classifying the mangroves at the species level.

M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of this paper, and the novelty brought to the topic of the Industry 4.0 manufacturing systems, are related to the integration of computer vision algorithms, remote sensing data fusion techniques, and mapping and navigation tools in the Slovak automotive sector. We conducted a thorough examination of Industry 4.0-based value and supply chains, clarifying how cyber-physical production systems operate in relation to collision avoidance technologies, environment mapping algorithms, and mobility simulation tools in network connectivity systems through vehicle navigation data. The Citroen C3 and Peugeot 208 automobiles are two examples of high-tech products whose worldwide value and supply chain development trends were examined in this study by determining countries and their contributions to production. The fundamental components of the research-statistical analysis and visual analysis-were utilized in conjunction with a variety of syntheses, comparisons, and analytical methodologies. A case study was developed using PSA Group SVK data. The graphical analysis revealed that Slovakia offers the second-highest added value to the chosen items, but it also highlighted the country's slow-growing research and development (R&D) infrastructure, which could lead to a subsequent loss of investment and business as usual. Slovakia can generate better export added value by optimizing Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems in the automotive sector.

TI  - Detection of sentinel lymph node using carbon nano-particles in patients with early breast cancer
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionManagement in breast cancer is heading toward less invasive approaches with high survival and low recurrence rates. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has a high morbidity on breast cancer patients; on the other hand, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) overcomes such morbidity with comparable survival and recurrence rates. In this study, the authors aim to assess diagnostic accuracy of carbon nanoparticles (CN) in SLNB in patients with early breast cancer.Patients and methodsFrom November 2020 to March 2022, patients with early breast cancer and clinically and radiologically free axillary lymph nodes who had SLN detection using CNs followed by ALND were included. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, are pregnant, or refused consent were excluded.ResultsIn this study, 30 patients with clinically node-negative early breast cancer patients were investigated using CN for SLN mapping. Mean age of our participants was 49.2 +/- 5.8. CN technique had a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval: 80.49-100), specificity of 92.3% (95% confidence interval: 63.9-99.8), positive predictive value of 94.4%, negative predictive value of 100%, and false-negative rate=0%. The summary receiver-operating characteristics of CN showed excellent diagnostic performance with area under the curve of 0.962 (P=0.0001).ConclusionSLN mapping using proper technique is vital to avoid recurrence and promote survival and decrease morbidity without need for ALND. CN had excellent sensitivity and specificity with low false-negative rate.

TI  - Hospital Management and Public Health Role of National Hospitals after Transformation into Independent Administrative Agencies
T2  - HEALTHCARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of medical care, technological advances, and the ageing of society have led to rising medical costs. As a result, there is a demand to improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery systems, including public healthcare institutions, in order to ensure the sustainability of healthcare functions. In 2004, as part of national civil service reform in Japan, national hospitals were merged in order to form the National Hospital Organization (NHO). The NHO used new public management methods and was required to be self-financing and to maintain critical functions under a five-year management plan. The objective of this study was to examine whether the NHO was able to maintain its key function in the national infrastructure in terms of management. An analysis of the business conditions of the NHO was performed based on the financial statements from FY 2004 to FY 2018 using evaluation indexes. In the first and second periods, the NHO achieved its targeted management improvements. However, since FY 2014, even with the utmost restrictions on capital investment, the profits have not increased, and the free cash flow has been negative. Our results suggest that further organizational reforms are needed in order to sustain the NHO infrastructure in the long term and to withstand health crisis management during periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

T2  - INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. This study aimed to understand the role of information in the domains of contemplation, spirituality, and meaning and purpose. These domains can be a significant aspect of people's lives and rich in information phenomena..Method. We used narrative analysis, specifically the analysis of online videos in which people were interviewed about their lives after taking residence at a contemplative spiritual retreat centre.Analysis. We interpreted the interviews through a lens of meaning-making and used a context-centric model to identify the information phenomena at a contemplative spiritual retreat.Results. The findings: (1) Support prior research, which has identified that people engage with spiritual information as a result of a change in worldview, significant events, mystical glimpses, and to gain spiritual knowledge; (2) Deliver an account of the sources and kinds of spiritual information at a contemplative spiritual retreat centre; (3) Provide insights into how people interact with spiritual information during a contemplative spiritual retreat; (4) Suggest that residents at a contemplative spiritual retreat centre seek spiritual information primarily for affective outcomes.Conclusions. We demonstrated meaning-making as a helpful lens to interpret information interactions in the domains of contemplation, spirituality, meaning and purpose, and value in life.

TI  - A Novel Self-Cleaving Viroid-Like RNA Identified in RNA Preparations from a Citrus Tree Is Not Directly Associated with the Plant
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Viroid and viroid-like satellite RNAs are infectious, circular, non-protein coding RNAs reported in plants only so far. Some viroids (family Avsunviroidae) and viroid-like satellite RNAs share self-cleaving activity mediated by hammerhead ribozymes (HHRzs) endowed in both RNA polarity strands. Using a homology-independent method based on the search for conserved structural motifs of HHRzs in reads and contigs from high-throughput sequenced RNAseq libraries, we identified a novel small (550 nt) viroid-like RNA in a library from a Citrus reticulata tree. Such a viroid-like RNA contains a HHRz in both polarity strands. Northern blot hybridization assays showed that circular forms of both polarity strands of this RNA (tentatively named citrus transiently-associated hammerhead viroid-like RNA1 (CtaHVd-LR1)) exist, supporting its replication through a symmetric pathway of the rolling circle mechanism. CtaHVd-LR1 adopts a rod-like conformation and has the typical features of quasispecies. Its HHRzs were shown to be active during transcription and in the absence of any protein. CtaHVd-LR1 was not graft-transmissible, and after its first identification, it was not found again in the original citrus source when repeatedly searched in the following years, suggesting that it was actually not directly associated with the plant. Therefore, the possibility that this novel self-cleaving viroid-like RNA is actually associated with another organism (e.g., a fungus), in turn, transiently associated with citrus plants, is proposed.

TI  - Conspiracy theories as opportunistic attributions of power
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - A significant trend of research construes conspiracy theories as a power challenging phenomenon. Yet, there is evidence that conspiracy theories are sometimes promoted by mem-bers of relatively powerful groups (e.g., a national majority) in order to target relatively powerless groups (e.g., immigrants). Thus, conspiracy theories are not necessarily beliefs held by the relatively powerless. However, they always attribute power to the allegedly conspiring parties. As a matter of fact, without such power, the groups accused of conspiring would be unable to carry out their plans. In contrast to assuming conspiracy theories reflect objective power imbalances, we propose that they may be construed as opportunistic attri-butions of power that allow individuals to advance their in -terests (e.g., validate their worldview, strengthen or challenge social hierarchies).

TI  - Assessment of Human-Induced Effects on Sea/Brackish Water Chlorophyll-a Concentration in Ha Long Bay of Vietnam with Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a is one of the most important water quality parameters that can be observed by satellite imagery. It plays a significant function in the aquatic environments of rapidly developing coastal cities such as Ha Long City, Vietnam. Urban population growth, coal mining, and tourist activities have affected the water quality of Ha Long Bay. This work uses Sentinel-2/Multispectral Instrument (MSI) imagery data to a calibrated ocean chlorophyll 2-band (OC-2) model to retrieve chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration in the bay from 2019 to 2021. The variability of chlorophyll-a during seasons over the study area was inter-compared. The chlorophyll-a concentration was mapped by analyzing the time series of water cover on the Google Earth Engine platform. The results show that the OC-2 model was calibrated well to the conditions of the study areas. The calibrated model accuracy increased nearly double compared with the uncalibrated OC-2 model. The seasonal assessment of chl-a concentration showed that the phytoplankton (algae) developed well in cold weather during fall and winter. Spatially, algae grew densely inside and in the surroundings of aquaculture, urban, and tourist zones. In contrast, coal mining activities did not result in algae development. We recommend using the Sentinel-2 data for seawater quality monitoring and assessment. Future work might focus on model calibration with a longer time simulation and more in situ measured data. Moreover, manual atmospheric correction of optical remote sensing is crucial for coastal environmental studies.

TI  - Building Function Type Identification Using Mobile Signaling Data Based on a Machine Learning Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying building function type (BFT) is vital for many studies and applications, such as urban planning, disaster risk assessment and management, and traffic control. Traditional remote sensing methods are commonly used for land use/cover classification, but they have some limitations in BFT identification. Considering that the dynamic variations of social sensing mobile signaling (MS) data at diurnal and daily scales are directly related to BFT, in this paper, we propose a method to infer BFT using MS data obtained from mobile devices. First, based on the different patterns of population dynamics within different building types, we propose a BFT classification scheme with five categories: residential (R), working (W), entertainment (E), visiting (V), and hospital (H). Then, a random forest (RF) classification model is constructed based on two days (one workday and one weekend) of MS data with a temporal resolution of one hour to identify the BFT. According to the cross-validation method, the overall classification accuracy is 84.89%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.78. Applying the MS data-constructed RF model to the central areas of Beijing Dongcheng and Xicheng Districts, the overall detection rate is 97.35%. In addition, to verify the feasibility of the MS data, the Sentinel-2 (S2) remote sensing data are used for comparison, with a classification accuracy of 73.33%. The better performance of the MS method shows its excellent potential for BFT identification, as the spatial and temporal population dynamics reviewed based on MS data are more correlated with BFT than geometric or spectral features in remote sensing images. This is an innovative attempt to identify BFT with MS data, and such a method compensates for the scarcity of BFT studies driven by population dynamics. Overall, in this study, we show the feasibility of using time series MS data to identify BFT and we provide a new path for building function mapping at large scales.

TI  - Mannose and Hyaluronic Acid Dual-Modified Iron Oxide Enhances Neoantigen-Based Peptide Vaccine Therapy by Polarizing Tumor-Associated Macrophages
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Cancer vaccine therapy is promising, though its efficacy is compromised in an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have the potential to be repolarized to an antitumor subtype, and their antigen-presenting ability might enhance the efficacy of cancer vaccination. Here, we aimed to develop a nanoparticle with adjuvant effect that could be a carrier for neoantigen-based vaccine to target and repolarize TAMs in situ. Therefore, we prepared a hyaluronic acid and mannose dual-modified iron oxide nanoparticle, and the enhanced efficiency of nanoparticle intake of macrophages was confirmed. It could repolarize macrophages and outperformed a commercialized iron oxide nanoparticle, ferumoxytol. Combined with peptides, this nanoparticle strongly inhibited TC1 tumor growth, and 40% of mice reached complete regression. This is the first report using mannose, hyaluronic acid, and iron oxide to target TAMs and achieve ideal outcomes in vivo. This study provides a facile nanoplatform for neoantigen-based vaccine therapy and a reference for repolarizing TAMs to promote immunotherapy. Neoantigen-based cancer vaccine therapy is a breakthrough in the field of immunotherapy. However, it is difficult for vaccines against neoantigens to overcome the immunosuppressive microenvironment, where tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a significant role. Herein, we report an iron oxide nanoparticle modified with hyaluronic acid and mannose to reshape the tumor microenvironment by targeting and repolarizing TAMs from protumor M2 to antitumor M1 phenotype. Mannose decoration could confer the nanoparticle-enhanced TAM targeting ability, while hyaluronic acid and iron oxide could repolarize M2-like macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. Combined with antigenic peptides, this nanovaccine could significantly increase the infiltration of CD8(+) T cells into tumor tissue and strongly activate dendritic cells in sentinel lymph nodes. Finally, we used the dual-modified nanoparticles to first convert the tumor microenvironment and then the nanovaccine administration in a TC1 tumor model to further enhance efficacy. This strategy inhibited tumor growth and achieved a 40% cure rate in mice (two of five). In summary, this study provides a potent and rationally designed nanoadjuvant to enhance antitumor efficiency and facilitate delivery of neoantigen vaccines by repolarizing TAMs and harmonizing immune cells.

TI  - Estimating chlorophyll content of <i>Zizania latifolia</i> with hyperspectral data and random forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The amount of chlorophyll in a plant useful to indicate its physiological activity and then changes in chlorophyll content have been used as a good indicator of disease as well as nutritional and environmental stresses on plants. Chlorophyll content estimation is one of the most applications of hyperspectral remote sensing data. The aim of this study is to evaluate dimensionality reduction for estimating chlorophyll contents from hyperspectral reflectance. Random Forest (RF) has been applied to assess biochemical properties such as chlorophyll content from remote sensing data; however, an approach integrating with dimensionality reduction techniques has not been fully evaluated. A total of 200 Zizania latifolia leaves with 5 treatments from Shizuoka University field were measured for reflectance and chlorophyll content. then, the regression models were generated based on RF with three dimensionality reduction methods including principal component analysis, kernel principal component analysis and independent component analysis. This research clarified that PCA is the best method for dimensionality reduction for estimating chlorophyll content in Zizania Latifolia with a RMSE value of 5.65 +/- 0.58 mu g cm(-2).

TI  - Monitoring the Dynamics of Ephemeral Rivers from Space: An Example of the Kuiseb River in Namibia
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Ephemeral rivers are characterized by brief episodic flood events, which recharge subterraean alluvial aquifers that sustain humans, riparian vegetation, and wildlife in the hyper-arid Namib Desert. Yet we only have a poor understanding of the dynamics and feedback mechanisms in these hydrological systems as arid and semi-arid zones are typically poorly equipped with reliable in situ monitoring stations to provide necessary information. The main objective of our study is to show the potential of satellite data to monitor the dynamics of ephemeral rivers, such as the Kuiseb located in Namibia, since remotesensing offers the advantage of adapted spatial and temporal resolutions. For this study, multi-spectral imagery (Sentinel-2), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR, Sentinel-1), and SAR interferometry (Sentinel-1) data were used to produce Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maps, backscattering maps (as sigma(0)), and interferograms, respectively. These parameters provide information on the hydrologic and vegetation dynamics of the river. Strong variations in NDVI, sigma(0), and interferograms are observed during March-April 2017 and June-July 2018 in a tributary of the Kuiseb in the central Namib Desert. In those years, rain events caused the reactivation of the tributary. However, during a major flood in 2021, when no rain occured, no variations in NDVI were detected in this tributary, unlike the sigma(0) and interferogram anomalies after the flood. Thus, these variations cannot be explained by rains, which were non-existent during this period, but seem to be linked to the dynamics of the aquifer of the Kuiseb River, wherein floods recharge the alluvial aquifers and the rising water table levels produce a signal that is measurable by satellite radar sensors. All these results present a preliminary work that might be used by water resource managers to automate the processing and methods used to create an ephemeral river monitoring tool.

TI  - Heterogenous controls on lake color and trends across the high-elevation US Rocky Mountain region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global change may contribute to ecological changes in high-elevation lakes and reservoirs, but a lack of data makes it difficult to evaluate spatiotemporal patterns. Remote sensing imagery can provide more complete records to evaluate whether consistent changes across a broad geographic region are occurring. We used Landsat surface reflectance data to evaluate spatial patterns of contemporary lake color (2010-2020) in 940 lakes in the U.S. Rocky Mountains, a historically understudied area for lake water quality. Intuitively, we found that most of the lakes in the region are blue (66%) and were found in steep-sided watersheds (>22.5 degrees) or alternatively were relatively deep (>4.5 m) with mean annual air temperature (MAAT) <4.5 degrees C. Most green/brown lakes were found in relatively shallow sloped watersheds with MAAT > 4.5 degrees C. We extended the analysis of contemporary lake color to evaluate changes in color from 1984 to 2020 for a subset of lakes with the most complete time series (n = 527). We found limited evidence of lakes shifting from blue to green states, but rather, 55% of the lakes had no trend in lake color. Surprisingly, where lake color was changing, 32% of lakes were trending toward bluer wavelengths, and only 13% shifted toward greener wavelengths. Lakes and reservoirs with the most substantial shifts toward blue wavelengths tended to be in urbanized, human population centers at relatively lower elevations. In contrast, lakes that shifted to greener wavelengths did not relate clearly to any lake or landscape features that we evaluated, though declining winter precipitation and warming summer and fall temperatures may play a role in some systems. Collectively, these results suggest that the interactions between local landscape factors and broader climatic changes can result in heterogeneous, context-dependent changes in lake color.

TI  - Coastline dynamics and erosion/accretion in the estuaries of the lower Mekong Delta, Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we used Landsat satellite imagery to monitor coastline changes in critical estuaries of the lower Mekong River basin from 1989 to 2017. To delineate the shoreline dynamics, we used the automated water extraction index (AWEI) and the digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS) to calculate the rate-of-change statistics from multiple historical shoreline positions. The rate of shoreline change was assessed using linear regression (LRR) and end point rate (EPR) methods. The erosion and accretion observed in the estuaries were intermingled, with total areas of 4,732.46 and 13,471.7 ha, respectively. Erosion and accretion impacted the shoreline rates considerably at a fast pace and the erosion and accretion speeds depended on each of the five periods analyzed in this study. From 2015 to 2017, the highest erosion rate (507.78 m y-1) was recorded in the village of An Thuy in Ben Tre Province. From 2005 to 2009, the highest erosion rate (312.11 m y-1) was recorded in the village of Thoi Thuan in Ben Tre Province. The accuracy (T) of the largest erosion/accretion areas during 2005-2009 was estimated to be 87.9%, with a kappa coefficient (K) of 0.76, while the lowest overall T (78.5%) and K (0.57) were obtained for the 1989-2001 period. We calculated the total estimated erosion and accretion areas from 2017 to 2019 (estimated to be 166.14 and 1,432.29 ha, respectively), and forecasted values for 2019-2025 (235.93 and 1,126.51 ha, respectively). This study confirms that satellite imagery and statistical methods can be reliably used to analyze the shoreline changes in coastal areas, which can then support policies addressing coastal planning and development.

TI  - Recovery Dynamics of Mining-Altered Natural Ecosystems by Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINING SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The authors have developed a procedure for estimating recovery dynamics of natural ecosystems damaged by mineral mining using the satellite observation data. The procedure uses the vegetation index of phytocenosis and the temperature of underlying terrain. The case-study of apatite-bearing ore processing waste revealed the time series of the vegetation index and the underlying terrain temperature of the incipient phytocenosis as compared with the phytocenosis of the surrounding natural landscape. It is found that the recovery of the natural ecosystems by generation of a biologically active medium activate the test factors to reach the values of phytocenosis of the surrounding natural landscape. The justification is provided for usability of the retrospective earth remote sensing data on ground surface in the objective estimation of recovery dynamics of natural ecosystems damaged by mineral mining in the Arctic conditions without undertaking land exploration.

TI  - Estimating Sound Speed Profile by Combining Satellite Data with In Situ Sea Surface Observations
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Given that spatiotemporal measurement of the subsurface profile over a wide range are difficult to obtain, surface observations from satellites are often used to estimate the sound speed profile (SSP). This paper proposes a multisource method based on the self-organizing map (SOM) to improve the estimation of the SSP by merging surface observations with satellite data. Surface observations from the Kuroshio Extension Observatory (KEO) were used to supplement satellite observations (anomalies in the measured sea level and sea surface temperature) to this end. Different combinations of the surface parameters were assessed, their errors were analyzed, and differences between the results before and after the multisource parameters were used are discussed. The proposed method significantly increased the accuracy of estimating the SSP when the parameters obtained from in situ measurements were used, with a root mean square error of 2.18 m/s, less than a third of the error obtained when only satellite observations were used. The proposed method provides a new approach to determining an accurate three-dimensional structure of the sound speed when various surface observations are available.

TI  - Remote sensing indicators to assess riparian vegetation and river ecosystem health
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental managers need information to quickly detect which stressor combinations should be addressed to reverse river degradation across large study areas. The pivotal role of riparian vegetation in regulating thermal regimes and inputs of light, nutrients and organic matter has made it a major target of stressor-mitigation and conservation actions. However, due to the dendritic and extensive nature of river networks, field-based monitoring of local riparian conditions is expensive and time-consuming. Ongoing developments in remote sensing offer an unparalleled opportunity to address this challenge. Nonetheless, there is still a limited understanding of the capacity of remote sensing indicators to predict changes in local riparian and river conditions, urging for local calibration with in situ measurements. This study aims to evaluate the capacity of remote sensing to detect impacts on quality elements commonly used in river biomonitoring: riparian vegetation, abiotic river condition and macrophyte biomass. To this end, four remote sensing metrics were tested against field-based indicators in 50 stream locations from four river basins across the Northwest of Portugal: i) the lateral riparian continuity at reach scale (riparian forest buffer width), ii) the riparian vegetation density at reach scale (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI100m), and iii) the land use intensification at both reach (LUI100m) and iv) segment (LUI500m) scales. We found that the combination of remote sensing variables (riparian forest buffer width and the land use intensification index) correlated with riparian vegetation quality and dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations. We also found that the riparian vegetation density was able to predict changes in vascular plant biomass except for bryophytes. Our study provides new insights on the capacity of satellite-based indicators to assess riparian and river health, illustrating their utility for land and water managers, to identify and monitor, at a reduced cost and time, potential changes in the riparian vegetation.

TI  - Evaluation of Land Use/Land Cover Classification based on Different Bands of Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery using Neural Networks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial data analytics is an emerging technology. Artificial neural network techniques play a major role in analysing any critical dataset. Integrating remote sensing data with deep neural networks has led a way to several research problems. This paper aims at producing land use land cover map of Bangalore region, Karnataka, India with various band combinations of sentinel satellite imagery obtained from google earth engine. LULC map classes include water, urban, forest, vegetation and openland. Band combinations of satellite images represent different characteristics of spatial data. Hence, several band combinations are used to build LULC maps. Also, classified maps are generated using different neural networks with pixel-based classification approach. Appropriate performance metrics were identified to evaluate the classification results such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score and Confusion Matrix. Among neural networks, Convolutional Neural Network technique outperformed with 98.1 % of accuracy and less error rates in confusion matrix considering RGBNIR (4328) band combination of satellite imagery.

TI  - Soil loss and erosion potential estimation of Jhimruk watershed, Nepal
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion will have impact in the land productivity, water resource and watershed as a whole. The loss of top soil leads to land degradation and for an agrarian area like Jhimruk which also known as "The rice bowl of Nepal", it would be a huge consequence on the land productivity. Therefore, it is essential to know the spatial distribution of the areas susceptible to the degradation and assess the erosion potential to plan effective mitigation measures. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model was used in a Geographic Information System (GIS) to estimate the soil loss of the Jhimruk watershed, Lumbini Province, Nepal. This research aimed to calculate the erosional soil loss status of the local governments lying inside the watershed. For this, remote sensing data obtained from various sources were used to generate the factor maps to calculate the soil loss through RUSLE. A 13-year mean annual precipitation data from the 8 meteorological stations in and around the watershed were used. The mean annual soil loss of the watershed was found to be 13.4 tons per hectare per year (t/ha/yr). However, the soil loss was calculated to be as high as 182 t/ha/yr. 68.82% of the total area of the watershed lie under very low erosion class and thus, have low conservation priority. On the other hand 7.73% of the total area of the watershed lie under extremely high erosion class and, thus, have a high conservation priority class. The mean erosion rate from the barren land was found to be highest (23.179 t/ha/yr) followed by agricultural (21.40 t/ha/yr) and forest area had the lowest erosion rate, i.e., 7.90 t/ha/yr.

TI  - Evaluation of machine learning approaches for surface water monitoring using Sentinel-1 data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of mosquito breeding habitats requires the production of surface water maps on a regular basis and at a high-resolution using mapping algorithms. To map surface water, several machine learning (ML) algorithms were evaluated, taking advantage of frequently available synthetic aperture radar imagery from the Sentinel-1 mission with a 10-m spatial resolution and a large dataset of field observations of the water state (inundated/dry) in rice paddies and wetlands. One-class support vector machine, one-class self-organizing map, and multilayer perceptron with automatic relevance determination (MLP-ARD) algorithms were trained and assessed to examine their accuracy in detecting surface water. Results show the robustness of the MLP-ARD algorithm, which provides an overall accuracy of 0.974 for a single date and 0.892 for a 5-month study period from May to September. The accuracy of water detection was found to be mainly affected by the presence of dense and high vegetation in inundated fields and the presence of floating vegetation or algae.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Species Classification Methods Using DART-TOF-MS Data for Five Coniferous Wood Species
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Various problems worldwide are caused by illegal production and distribution of timber, such as deception about timber species and origin and illegal logging. Numerous studies on wood tracking are being conducted around the world to demonstrate the legitimacy of timber. Tree species identification is the most basic element of wood tracking research because the quality of wood varies greatly from species to species and is consistent with the botanical origin of commercially distributed wood. Although many recent studies have combined machine learning-based classification methods with various analytical methods to identify tree species, it is unclear which classification model is most effective. The purpose of this work is to examine and compare the performance of three supervised machine learning classification models, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN), in identifying five conifer species and propose an optimal model. Using direct analysis in real-time ionization combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (DART-TOF-MS), metabolic fingerprints of 250 individual specimens representing five species were collected three times. When the machine learning models were applied to classify the wood species, ANN outperformed SVM and RF. All three models showed 100% prediction accuracy for genus classification. For species classification, the ANN model had the highest prediction accuracy of 98.22%. The RF model had an accuracy of 94.22%, and the SVM had the lowest accuracy of 92.89%. These findings demonstrate the practicality of authenticating wood species by combining DART-TOF-MS with machine learning, and they indicate that ANN is the best model for wood species identification.

TI  - An Object-Based Weighting Approach to Spatiotemporal Fusion of High Spatial Resolution Satellite Images for Small-Scale Cropland Monitoring
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous crop monitoring often requires a time-series set of satellite images. Since satellite images have a trade-off in spatial and temporal resolution, spatiotemporal image fusion (STIF) has been applied to construct time-series images at a consistent scale. With the increased availability of high spatial resolution images, it is necessary to develop a new STIF model that can effectively reflect the properties of high spatial resolution satellite images for small-scale crop field monitoring. This paper proposes an advanced STIF model using a single image pair, called high spatial resolution image fusion using object-based weighting (HIFOW), for blending high spatial resolution satellite images. The four-step weighted-function approach of HIFOW includes (1) temporal relationship modeling, (2) object extraction using image segmentation, (3) weighting based on object information, and (4) residual correction to quantify temporal variability between the base and prediction dates and also represent both spectral patterns at the prediction date and spatial details of fine-scale images. The specific procedures tailored for blending fine-scale images are the extraction of object-based change and structural information and their application to weight determination. The potential of HIFOW was evaluated from the experiments on agricultural sites using Sentinel-2 and RapidEye images. HIFOW was compared with three existing STIF models, including the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF), and Fit-FC. Experimental results revealed that the HIFOW prediction could restore detailed spatial patterns within crop fields and clear crop boundaries with less spectral distortion, which was not represented in the prediction results of the other three models. Consequently, HIFOW achieved the best prediction performance in terms of accuracy and structural similarity for all the spectral bands. Other than the reflectance prediction, HIFOW also yielded superior prediction performance for blending normalized difference vegetation index images. These findings indicate that HIFOW could be a potential solution for constructing high spatial resolution time-series images in small-scale croplands.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - River bank line shifting and channel migration due to river bank erosion and accretion causes inevitable geomorphic hazards in Gangetic West Bengal, India. Channel oscillation and associated river bank erosion-accretion is the widespread hydrogeomorphic phenomenon of the Bhagirathi-Hooghly river. In the present analysis, an attempt has been made to investigate the pattern of bank line shifting and river bank erosion-accretion dynamics of the 85 km long upper reach of the Hooghly river for the last 100 years with the use of geospatial techniques. The study is based on police station maps (1917-1921), topographical sheets (1954) and Landsat imageries of 1972, 1990, 2005 and 2020, which were collected from different sources. Sinuosity index, radius-wavelength ratio and bend-tightness index of different time periods have been computed for analyzing the temporal changes that occurred in the study reach. The result shows that the sinuosity index decreased from 1.95 in 1921 to 1.87 in 2020 and the areal extension of bank erosion and accretion decreases. This study has also developed a model for future prediction of river centerlines in the coming decades to identify future hazard zones. The overall channel migration of the upper reach of the Hooghly river indicates the oscillatory nature of the river channel. Channel widening, meander bend development and lateral movement of the channel are responsible for erosion and accretion of the bank. Therefore, the present analysis may be helpful for the identification and mapping of future vulnerable areas and make a plan for the lives of the people living near the bank line for their safety and sustainability.

AB  - This article explores the characteristic features of simple hunter-gatherer societies. It is less interested in the empirical diversity of such foraging groups and their respective peculiarities than in their shared structural characteristics. First and foremost, it focuses on how these societies refrained from systematic stockpiling and on the general equality among their members. The contribution starts by discussing the evolution of simple hunter-gatherer societies but concentrates on reconstructing the entanglement and structural integration of their strategies for subsistence, their social structure, and worldview. It does not aim at presenting new empirical findings, but at developing a structural or rather sociologically elementary description of this type of social organization.

TI  - Diagnostic Study of the Lightning Potential Index and Electric Field in Two Thunderstorm Cases over Bangladesh
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A thunderstorm is an extreme weather event that has become one of the most alarming disasters in Bangladesh because of its frequent occurrence and devastation in recent years. This study investigates the physical and dynamical characteristics of thunderstorms and their associated lightning over Bangladesh using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Two thunderstorm cases that occurred over central and south-western regions of Bangladesh on April 25, 2018, and May 11, 2018, have been simulated using three domains of 9-km, 3-km, and 1-km horizontal grid sizes. The simulated results are then compared with the observations from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD), University of Wyoming, and Meteorological & Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre (MOSDAC). Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) and Total Total Index (TTI) are analyzed and found to be 1500 J/kg and 48 degrees C, respectively, 10 hours before both events. Vertical wind has been found around 4 m/s before the event. Ice and graupel mixing ratios are found at very high concentrations at the cloud center. Lightning Potential Index (LPI) has been calculated using mixing ratios of different hydrometeors and vertical wind. The LPI is found to be 0.2 to 0.8 J/kg for the two cases. For estimating the electric field inside the thunderclouds, an algorithm that considers ice and graupel as leading charge carriers has been used. The electric field is found to be 70 kV/m at an altitude of 8 km for the first case and -125 kV/m at an altitude of 7 km for the second case. All the parameters are found favorable for the initiation of thunderstorms and lightning occurrence. It indicates that the algorithm suggested in this study can be used to predict high-impact weather events in Bangladesh.

TI  - A comparison of radar and optical remote sensing to detect cyclone-induced canopy disturbance in two subtropical forest landscapes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing is a tool frequently used to assess cyclone-induced forest disturbances. However, the frequent cloud cover limits the availability of optical data in cyclone basins. On the other hand, radar remote sensing is not affected by cloud cover and has been used to detect windthrows. Yet, the potential of radar sensing in monitoring cyclone damages of varying magnitudes across forest landscapes remains unclear. Here, we compared radar remote sensing to optical remote sensing of four cyclone disturbances in the Fushan Experimental Forest of northern Taiwan and the El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico using Landsat 8 and C-band Sentinel-1 satellite data. We analyzed the change in two optical vegetation indices, EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and NDII (Normalized Difference Infrared Index), and three radar-based metrics, co- and cross-polarized backscatters (VV, VH) and their ratio (Canopy Development Index, CDI) after cyclone disturbances and during approximately the same periods of non-cyclone years. We assessed the improved temporal resolution permitted by Sentinel-1 constellation on the detection of forest canopy disturbance. Bootstrapped comparisons indicated that both optical and radar indices detected canopy change, but their correlations were not significant. Improved temporal resolution of CDI allowed to distinguish cyclone-induced canopy change from the phenological variation and even change by nearby cyclones. Although this, VV and VH backscatters responded more closely to cyclone disturbances than their ratio. Our results demonstrate that the C-band backscatter intensities can track cyclone-induced change of forest canopies, and provide an assessment of C-band capabilities to monitor cyclone disturbances.

TI  - Continual Contrastive Learning for Cross-Dataset Scene Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of remote sensing technology, the continuing accumulation of remote sensing data has brought great challenges to the remote sensing field. Although multiple deep-learning-based classification methods have made great progress in scene classification tasks, they are still unable to address the problem of model learning continuously. Facing the constantly updated remote sensing data stream, there is an inevitable problem of forgetting historical information in the model training, which leads to catastrophic forgetting. Therefore, we propose a continual contrastive learning method based on knowledge distillation and contrastive learning in this paper, which is named the Continual Contrastive Learning Network (CCLNet). To overcome the problem of knowledge forgetting, we first designed a knowledge distillation module based on a spatial feature which contains sufficient historical knowledge. The spatial and category-level knowledge distillation enables the model to effectively preserve the already learned knowledge in the current scene classification model. Then, we introduced contrastive learning by leveraging the comparison of augmented samples and minimizing the distance in the feature space to further enhance the extracted feature during the continual learning process. To evaluate the performance of our designed model on streaming remote sensing scene data, we performed three steps of continuous learning experiments on three datasets, the AID, RSI, and NWPU datasets, and simulated the streaming of remote sensing scene data with the aggregate of the three datasets. We also compared other benchmark continual learning models. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieved superior performance in the continuous scene classification task.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Modeling Using Remote Sensing Data and Random SubSpace-Based Functional Tree Classifier
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a random subspace-based function tree (RSFT) was developed for landslide susceptibility modeling, and by comparing with a bagging-based function tree (BFT), classification regression tree (CART), and Naive-Bayes tree (NBTree) Classifier, to judge the performance difference between the hybrid model and the single models. In the first step, according to the characteristics of the geological environment and previous literature, 12 landslide conditioning factors were selected, including aspect, slope, profile curvature, plan curvature, elevation, topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land use, soil, distance to river and distance to the road. Secondly, 328 historical landslides were randomly divided into a training group and a validation group in a ratio of 70/30, and the important analysis of landslide points and conditional factors was carried out using the functional tree (FT) model. In the third step, all data are loaded into FT, RSFT, BFT, CART, and NBTree models for the generation of landslide susceptibility maps (LSM). Comparisons were made by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to determine efficiency and effectiveness. According to the verification results, the five models selected this time all perform reasonably, but the RSFT model has the highest prediction rate (AUC = 0.838), which is better than the other three single machine learning models. The results of this study also demonstrated that the hybrid model generally improves the predictive power of the benchmark landslide susceptibility models.

TI  - Assessment of Water Stress Conditions in Central Italy by the Use of Ground and Remotely Sensed Weather Datasets
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Aridity and drought, which are determined by climatic and temporary water scarcity, respectively, are important limiting factors for plant gross primary production. These phenomena are commonly assessed and/or monitored by means of weather indices, most of which are based on observations of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. The estimation of such indices over large areas can be carried out using multiple datasets, i.e., those derived from weather stations, satellite images, and ground radars. The possibility of using interpolated or remotely sensed datasets in place of ground measurements was currently investigated for Tuscany, a region in Central Italy, showing complex and heterogeneous environmental features. The former weather datasets were first evaluated versus corresponding ground measurements. Next, the basic weather variables were combined and cumulated over 30-60 days to yield synthetic indicators of water deficit, which were assessed in the same way. Finally, these indicators were evaluated to predict the soil water conditions of a meadow and an olive grove during the 2021 summer period. The results obtained indicate that the use of the multi-source weather datasets induces only a minor deterioration of the water stress indicators and is therefore efficient to monitor the water status of different ecosystems with high spatial (200 m) and temporal (daily) details.

TI  - Effect of urbanization on energy balance and evapotranspiration in an Amazon-Cerrado transition region in Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon-Cerrado transition region has a high rate of deforestation for agriculture, livestock, logging, and for the increase in urban areas of cities. The development of cities in this region in recent decades has increased the deforestation process and modified the local microclimate and the exchange of energy and water between the surface and the atmosphere. However, the magnitude of the change in energy and water exchanges due to urbanization is unknown for most Brazilian cities, especially in the Amazon-Cerrado region. Thus, the objective was to evaluate the spatiotemporal change in energy balance and in evapotranspiration (ET) patterns over three decades of urbanization in Sinop. The surface energy balance (SEB) and ET were estimated by the SEB algorithms for land with Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper images from the Sinop region, Mato Grosso, Brazil, in 1985, 2000, and 2010. The estimated SEB and ET were validated with measurements in a flux tower in the Amazon-Cerrado transition forest 50 km from the urban area of Sinop. The components of the SEB, except the soil/storage heat flux (G), had a strong correlation, and the ET had a moderate correlation with measurements in the flux tower. The surface albedo (a sup), land surface temperature (LST), sensible heat flux (H), and G of the study area increased over the years, while the normalized difference vegetation index, latent heat flux (LE), and ET decreased over the years. Buildup and grassland areas had lower values of NDVI, Rn, LE, and ET and higher values of a sup, LST, H, and G than forest areas. Therefore, the urbanization of Sinop has decreased available energy for ET and increased the energy to heat the air and soil. (c) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the factors affecting the formation of channel patterns and dynamics in the Givi-chay River during the period 2019-2000 were analysed. To evaluate the river strength, flaw stress and its effects on channel morphology, Landsat 7 and 8 images, topographic maps, geology, and hydrological and field data were used. According to the results of the calculation of hydrological indicators, in terms of 15, the index, a significant difference is seen among upstream and downstream stations. Therefore, it can be found that the presence of the Givi Dam has created a good platform for intensifying the hydrological and morphological changes of the river plan. The particular strength of the river in all parts of the fourth interval and the ninth, 12th, eighth (second interval) levels causes the erosion threshold to soar. The highest amount of shear stress was observed in the second interval at 12, 13, and 9, respectively. Generally, the changes of the Givi River Plan include expansion of existing meanders, displacement of paths, increase of curvature and formation of small meanders and formation of channel pattern and dynamics, affected by discharge provision, sediment discharge due to dam construction, lithological resistance of the riverbed and human interference.

TI  - Bayesian Approach for Optimizing Forest Inventory Survey Sampling with Remote Sensing Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In large-area forest inventories, a trade-off between the amount of data to be sampled and the corresponding collection costs is necessary. It is not always possible to have a very large data sample when dealing with sampling-based inventories. It is therefore important to optimize the sampling design with the limited resources. Whereas this sort of inventories are subject to these constraints, the availability of remote sensing (RS) data correlated with the forest inventory variables is usually much higher. For this reason, the RS and sampled field measurement data are often used in combination for improving the forest inventory estimation. In this study, we propose a model-based data sampling method founded on Bayesian optimization and machine learning algorithms which utilizes RS data to guide forest inventory sample selection. We evaluate our method in empirical experiments using real-world volume of growing stock data from the Aland region in Finland. The proposed method is compared against two baseline methods: simple random sampling and the local pivotal method. When a suitable model link is selected, the empirical experiments show on best case on average up to 22% and 79% improvement in population mean and variance estimation respectively over baselines. However, the results also illustrate the importance of model selection which has a clear effect on the results. The novelty of the study is in the application of Bayesian optimization in national forest inventory survey sampling.

TI  - Impact of Inclusion of the Indirect Effects of Sulfate Aerosol on Radiation and Cloudiness in the INMCM Model
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The parameterization of aerosol-cloud interaction has been updated in the INMCM48 model by including the sulfate aerosol content. The impact of sulfate aerosol inclusion on the cloud droplet number concentration, cloud cover, net radiation at the top of the atmosphere, and cloud transmission of solar radiation is assessed. It is shown that including sulfate aerosol in the parameterization of the aerosol-cloud interaction allows us to correctly reproduce changes in cloud transmission from 1980 to 2005 in the INMCM48 model compared to the ERA-Interim reanalysis and the data from the solar radiation reconstruction model for several stations located in northern Eurasia, where strong changes in the content of sulfate aerosol are observed. According to preliminary estimates, the average global radiative forcing due to the aerosol indirect effect is -0.13 W/m(2) for 2005 relative to 1850.

TI  - Building a network of sentinel centres for the care of women in an abortion situation: advances in Latin America and the Caribbean
T2  - BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous reports have already estimated the overall number of abortions and the number of unsafe abortions in Latin America. Conversely, there are few reliable data from this region to inform public policies aiming to meet women's needs. In this context, the Latin American Centre of Perinatology (Centro Latinoamericano de Perinatologia (CLAP)) created a network specialising in the care of women in an abortion situation (CLAP MUSA-Network) in an attempt to strengthen healthcare surveillance in Latin America by using the Perinatal Information System (Sistema Informatico Perinatal (SIP)). This system was developed by the CLAP with a special module named SIP Abortion (SIP-A), a data collection tool designed by Latin American experts to be routinely used in cases of legal and incomplete abortions. The SIP-A follows the standards established by WHO, allowing investigators to systematise information, generate local reports and monitor changes after training and follow-up interventions based on national guidelines. This network promotes collaborative work between institutions to strengthen epidemiological surveillance, cooperative investigation and development of a critical mass of professionals skilled in sexual and reproductive health. Currently, 29 sentinel centres from 13 countries jointly work exchanging information to improve surveillance of healthcare indicators of women in an abortion situation. Latin America was the first region in the world to have a network of sentinel centres that continuously monitors healthcare provision to these women. Data collected by this network are already being used to design, implement and evaluate public policies.

TI  - Estimating Regional Snow Line Elevation Using Public Webcam Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is of high relevance for the Earth's climate system, and its variability plays a key role in alpine hydrology, ecology, and socioeconomic systems. Measurements obtained by optical satellite remote sensing are an essential source for quantifying snow cover variability from a local to global scale. However, the temporal resolution of such measurements is often affected by persistent cloud coverage, limiting the application of high resolution snow cover mapping. In this study, we derive the regional snow line elevation in an alpine catchment area using public webcams. We compare our results to the snow line information derived from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Sentinel-2 snow cover products and find our results to be in good agreement therewith. Between October 2017 and the end of June 2018, snow lines derived from webcams lie on average 55.8 m below and 33.7 m above MODIS snow lines using a normalized-difference snow index (NDSI) of 0.4 and 0.1, respectively, and are on average 53.1 m below snow lines derived from Sentinel-2. We further analyze the superior temporal resolution of webcam-based snow cover information and demonstrate its effectiveness in filling temporal gaps in satellite-based measurements caused by cloud cover. Our findings show the ability of webcam-based snow line elevation retrieval to complement and improve satellite-based measurements.

TI  - UAS Hyperspatial LiDAR Data Performance in Delineation and Classification across a Gradient of Wetland Types
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands play a critical role in maintaining stable and productive ecosystems, and they continue to be at heightened risk from anthropogenic and natural degradation, especially along the rapidly developing Atlantic Coastal Plain of North America. As such, strategies to develop up-to-date and high-resolution wetland inventories and classifications remain highly relevant in the context of accelerating sea-level rise and coastal changes. Historically, satellite and airborne remote sensing data along with traditional field-based methods have been used for wetland delineation, yet, more recently, the advent of Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) platforms and sensors is opening new avenues of performing rapid and accurate wetland classifications. To test the relative advantages and limitations of UAS technologies for wetland mapping and classification, we developed wetland classification models using UAS-collected multispectral and UAS-collected light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data relative to airborne-derived LiDAR models of wetland types ranging from palustrine to estuarine. The models were parameterized through a pixel-based random forest algorithm to evaluate model performance systematically and establish variable importance for a suite of variables including topographic, hydrologic, and vegetation-based indices. Based on our experimental results, the average overall classification accuracy and kappa coefficients for the UAS LiDAR-derived models are 75.29% and 0.74, respectively, compared to 79.80% and 0.75 for the airborne LiDAR-derived models, with significant differences in the spatial representation of final wetland classes. The resulting classification maps for the UAS models capture more precise wetland delineations than those of airborne models when trained with ground reference data collected at the same time as the UAS flights. The similar accuracy between the airborne and UAS models suggest that the UAS LiDAR is comparable to the airborne LiDAR. However, given poor revisit time of the airborne surveys and the high spatial resolution and precision of the UAS data, UAS-collected LiDAR provides excellent complementary data to statewide airborne missions or for specific applications that require hyperspatial data. For more structurally complex wetland types (such as the palustrine scrub shrub), UAS hyperspatial LiDAR data performs better and is much more advantageous to use in delineation and classification models. The results of this study contribute towards enhancing wetland delineation and classification models using data collected from multiple UAS platforms.

TI  - Mass balance estimation of Mulkila glacier, Western Himalayas, using glacier melt model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main water supplies in Asia is known to be melting water from Himalayan glaciers. One of the most important metrics to analyze and evaluate potential shifts in freshwater supplies from glacier storage is the estimate of mass balance. The present study aims at estimating the glacier mass balance with the help of remote sensing and in situ data for the Mulkila, a benchmark glacier situated in the Bhaga basin of Western Himalayas. The inter-annual difference in the run-off of glaciers is associated with the annual change in glacier mass. To estimate the mass balance of the Mulkila glacier, the current study uses the transient snowline, accumulation area ratio (AAR), and glacier melt model. For 10 consecutive hydrological years from 2009 to 2018, the analysis was conducted using 40 cloud-free Landsat 5/7/8 and Sentinel-2 datasets. Additionally, in situ meteorological weather data for calculating precipitation and changes in temperature were also used. For the period of study, a cumulative mass balance of - 6.66 m.w.e. for 10 years and a mean mass balance of - 0.66 +/- 0.27 m.w.e./year were obtained. A negative mass balance obtained for many consecutive hydrological years indicates the effect of climate change and global warming on the glacier ice thinning. This directly affects the regional or local environment and, in the long run, alters water supply. The findings of the present study help in preparing an immediate commitment to curb future warming both at the local and regional scale.

TI  - Long-term variability of satellite derived total alkalinity in the southwest Bay of Bengal
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal and inter-annual variability of Total Alkalinity (TA) concentration was studied in the Bay of Bengal from 2003 to 2019 by using MODIS-Aqua derived sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS) products. The satellite derived TA showed a positive relationship with in-situ TA with (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = +/- 27.53 mu Mol/kg, SEE = +/- 32.16 and uncertainty error = 2287 mu Mol/kg). The seasonal SST, SSS and TA portray the clear seasonal pattern between the seasons without any rapid change increase or decrease in trend observed over the years. In contrast to other seasons, the spring inter-monsoon was observed to have a warm surface water temperature with high salinity and TA. Strong wind and excessive cloud cover during the summer monsoon result in the reduction of ocean surface heat, which favours sea surface cooling and shallow mixed layer depth, resulting in low SST, SSS, and TA compared to the spring inter-monsoon. During fall inter-monsoon, the reversal of East India coastal current directs warm water from north to south and the weak wind that prevails in this region enhances stratification. During winter, low-saline water compensates the static stability loss by thermal inversion from the sea surface resulting in surface cooling with coldest SST, low SSS and TA during this period.

TI  - Comparison of S5P/TROPOMI Inferred NO<sub>2</sub> Surface Concentrations with In Situ Measurements over Central Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper is to evaluate the surface concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) inferred from the Sentinel-5 Precursor Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (S5P/TROPOMI) NO2 tropospheric column densities over Central Europe for two time periods, summer 2019 and winter 2019-2020. Simulations of the NO2 tropospheric vertical column densities and surface concentrations from the Long-Term Ozone Simulation-European Operational Smog (LOTOS-EUROS) chemical transport model are also applied in the methodology. More than two hundred in situ air quality monitoring stations, reporting to the European Environment Agency (EEA) air quality database, are used to carry out comparisons with the model simulations and the spaceborne inferred surface concentrations. Stations are separated into seven types (urban traffic, suburban traffic, urban background, suburban background, rural background, suburban industrial and rural industrial) in order to examine the strengths and shortcomings of the different air quality markers, namely the NO2 vertical column densities and NO2 surface concentrations. S5P/TROPOMI NO2 surface concentrations are inferred by multiplying the fraction of the satellite and model NO2 vertical column densities with the model surface concentrations. The estimated inferred TROPOMI NO2 surface concentrations are examined further with the altering of three influencing factors: the model vertical leveling scheme, the versions of the TROPOMI NO2 data and the air mass factors applied to the satellite and model NO2 vertical column densities. Overall, the inferred TROPOMI NO2 surface concentrations show a better correlation with the in situ measurements for both time periods and all station types, especially for the industrial stations (R > 0.6) in winter. The calculated correlation for background stations is moderate for both periods (R similar to 0.5 in summer and R > 0.5 in winter), whereas for traffic stations it improves in the winter (from 0.20 to 0.50). After the implementation of the air mass factors from the local model, the bias is significantly reduced for most of the station types, especially in winter for the background stations, ranging from +0.49% for the urban background to +10.37% for the rural background stations. The mean relative bias in winter between the inferred S5P/TROPOMI NO2 surface concentrations and the ground-based measurements for industrial stations is about -15%, whereas for traffic urban stations it is approximately -25%. In summer, biases are generally higher for all station types, especially for the traffic stations (similar to-75%), ranging from -54% to -30% for the background and industrial stations.

TI  - Nearly Three Centuries of Lava Flow Subsidence at Timanfaya, Lanzarote
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 1730-1736 eruption on Lanzarote was one of the most significant volcanic eruptions to occur on the Canary Islands, with lavas covering over 200 km(2). Globally, it is volumetrically the third largest known subaerial basaltic fissure eruption in the past 1,100 years. Here we use Sentinel-1 and ENVISAT interferograms on both ascending and descending orbits to construct a time series of line-of-sight surface displacements and calculate linear vertical deformation rates. We resolve a constant subsidence rate of about 6 mm/yr associated with an area of similar to 20 km(2) within the central and western portion of the Timanfaya lava flows relative to the rest of the island. This is consistent over the 28-year period (1992-2020) covered by the Sentinel-1 and ENVISAT data when combined with the previously published European Remote-Sensing Satellite data. Time series constructed using Sentinel-1 short interval interferograms have previously been shown to suffer systematic biases and we find that by making longer period interferograms these biases can be mitigated (when compared against an averaged stack of 1-year interferograms). Cooling-driven contraction of an intrusion would require improbably large sill thickness to achieve the observed subsidence rates. Our observations are consistent with the cooling of lavas on the order of one hundred meters, twice as thick as previous estimates, which suggests overall lava volume for this eruption may have been underestimated. This is also evidence of the longest duration of lava flow subsidence ever imaged which indicates that these cumulative thick flows can continue to deform significantly even three centuries after emplacement.

TI  - Detection and Relative Quantification of Neodymium in Sillai Patti Carbonatite Using Decision Tree Classification of the Hyperspectral Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A recent increase in the importance of Rare Earth Elements (REEs), proportional to advancements in modern technology, green energy, and defense, has urged researchers to look for more sophisticated and efficient exploration methods for their host rocks, such as carbonatites. Hyperspectral remote sensing has long been recognized as having great potential to identify the REEs based on their sharp and distinctive absorption features in the visible near-infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) electromagnetic spectral profiles. For instance, neodymium (Nd), one of the most abundant Light Rare Earth Elements (LREEs), has among the most distinctive absorption features of REEs in the VNIR part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Centered at similar to 580, similar to 745, similar to 810, and similar to 870 nm in the VNIR, the positions of these absorption features have been proved to be independent of the mineralogy that hosts Nd, and the features can be observed in samples as low in Nd as 1000 ppm. In this study, a neodymium index (NI) is proposed based on the 810 nm absorption feature and tested on the hyperspectral images of the Sillai Patai carbonatite samples to identify Nd pixels and to decipher the relative concentration of Nd in the samples based on the depth of the absorption feature. A preliminary spectral study of the carbonatite samples was carried out using a spectroradiometer to determine the presence of Nd in the samples. Only two of the absorption features of Nd, centered at similar to 745 and similar to 810 nm, are prominent in the Nd-rich samples. The other absorption features are either weak or suppressed by the featureless spectra of the associated minerals. Similar absorption features are found in the VNIR and SWIR images of the rock samples captured by the laboratory-based hyperspectral cameras that are processed through Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to filter the signal and noise from the reflectance data. An RGB false-color composite of continuum-removed VNIR reflectance bands covering wavelengths of 587.5, 747.91, and 810.25 nm efficiently displayed the spatial distribution of Nd-rich hotspots in the hyperspectral image. The depth of the 810 nm absorption feature, which corresponds to the concentration of Nd in a pixel, is comparatively greater in these zones and is quantified using the proposed NI such that the deeper the absorption feature, the higher the NI. To quantify the Nd-rich pixels in the continuum-removed VNIR images, different threshold values of NI are introduced into a decision tree classifier which generates the number of pixels in each class. The strength of the proposed NI coupled with the decision tree classifier is further supported by the accuracy assessment of the classified images generating the Kappa coefficient of 0.82. Comparing the results of the remote sensing data obtained in this study with some of the previously published studies suggests that the Sillai Patti carbonatite is rich in Nd and associated REEs, with some parts of the samples as high in Nd concentration as 1000 ppm.

TI  - On the capacity of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar in detecting floating macroalgae and other floating matters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Various types of floating macroalgae and other floating matters have been reported in the global oceans and inland waters, and their remote detection has relied primarily on passive optical sensors. These sensors provide multiple spectral bands and frequent revisits, yet they all suffer from clouds. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagers are active sensors that overcome this obstacle, yet their capacity in detecting macroalgae and other floating matters is generally unknown. Here, through statistical analysis and comparison of the Sentinel-2/MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Sentinel-1/SAR imagery, we attempt to fill this knowledge gap. The types of floating matters considered in this study include macroalgae (Ulva Prolifera in the Yellow Sea, Sargassum horneri in the East China Sea, and Sargassum fluitans/natans in the Caribbean Sea), cyanobacteria (Microcystis, Nodularia spumigena, and Trichodesmium), dinoflagellates (green and red Noctiluca), organic matters (sea snots and brine shrimp cysts), and marine debris (driftwood). Of these, the only floating matter that can be definitively detected in Sentinel-1/SAR imagery is U. prolifera, followed by the occasional detection of S. fluitans/natans and driftwood. In all detection cases, the macroalgae features always appear in Sentinel-1/SAR imagery with positive contrast from the surrounding waters. Because of the all-weather measurements, SAR observations can therefore complement those from the optical sensors in monitoring and tracking U. prolifera and S. fluitans/natans in their respective regions.

TI  - Characteristics and Drivers of Marine Heatwaves in the Western Equatorial Indian Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatio-temporal characteristics of the interannual variability and long-term trend of the marine heatwaves (MHWs) and related dynamic mechanisms in the western equatorial Indian Ocean (WEIO) are investigated using satellite observations. A prominent MHW hot spot is found in a region of the WEIO (48 degrees E-54 degrees E, 2 degrees S-2 degrees N), with a mean MHWs' intensity, duration, and frequency of 1.54 degrees C, 13.33 days, and 1.97 times, respectively. MHWs in the hot spot region have significant interannual variability after removing the long-term trend, associated with Indo-Pacific major climate modes. In 1982/1983, 1983/1984, 1987/1988, 1997/1998, 2006/2007, 2009/2010, 2011/2012, 2012/2013, 2014/2015, 2015/2016, and 2019/2020, the MHWs occurred with longer duration, higher frequency, and more total days. These years correspond to a positive Indian Ocean Dipole, or an El Nino event, or both. The occurrence of MHWs accompanied by anomalous positive sea surface height suggests that oceanic planetary wave processes modulate MHWs in the WEIO. Westward-propagating downwelling equatorial Rossby waves triggered by anomalous equatorial easterly winds drive the convergence of warm upper-ocean water and weaken the upwelling of cool subsurface water, which favor anomalously warm sea surface temperature (SST) and the occurrence of MHWs. In addition, the westward-propagating off-equatorial downwelling Rossby waves in the southern tropical Indian Ocean also affect MHWs in the WEIO through the propagation and reflection of waves. The annual MHW frequency, duration, and total days in the hot spot region increase up to 1.56 times, 4.95 days, and 31.72 days per decade, respectively, related to the significant increase in mean SST under global warming.

TI  - Prior Knowledge-Based Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Fine Classification of Land Covers in Surface Mining Landscapes
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification is critical for urban sustainability applications. Although deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have been widely utilized, they have rarely been used for land cover classification of complex landscapes. This study proposed the prior knowledge-based pretrained DCNNs (i.e., VGG and Xception) for fine land cover classifications of complex surface mining landscapes. ZiYuan-3 data collected over an area of Wuhan City, China, in 2012 and 2020 were used. The ZiYuan-3 imagery consisted of multispectral imagery with four bands and digital terrain model data. Based on prior knowledge, the inputs of true and false color images were initially used. Then, a combination of the first and second principal components of the four bands and the digital terrain model data (PD) was examined. In addition, the combination of red and near-infrared bands and digital terrain model data (43D) was evaluated (i.e., VGG-43D and Xcep-43D). The results indicate that: (1) the input of 43D performed better than the others; (2) VGG-43D achieved the best overall accuracy values; (3) although the use of PD did not produce the best models, it also provides a strategy for integrating DCNNs and multi-band and multimodal data. These findings are valuable for future applications of DCNNs to determine fine land cover classifications in complex landscapes.

TI  - Incremental Road Network Update Method with Trajectory Data and UAV Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - GPS trajectory and remote sensing data are crucial for updating urban road networks because they contain critical spatial and temporal information. Existing road network updating methods, whether trajectory-based (TB) or image-based (IB), do not integrate the characteristics of both types of data. This paper proposed and implemented an incremental update method for rapid road network checking and updating. A composite update framework for road networks is established, which integrates trajectory data and UAV remote sensing imagery. The research proposed utilizing connectivity between adjacent matched points to solve the problem of updating problematic road segments in networks based on the features of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) map-matching method in identifying new road segments. Deep learning is used to update the local road network in conjunction with the flexible and high-precision characteristics of UAV remote sensing. Additionally, the proposed method is evaluated against two baseline methods through extensive experiments based on real-world trajectories and UAV remote sensing imagery. The results show that our method has higher extraction accuracy than the TB method and faster updates than the IB method.

TI  - Characterization of Long-Time Series Variation of Glacial Lakes in Southwestern Tibet: A Case Study in the Nyalam County
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lakes are important freshwater resources in southern Tibet. However, glacial lake outburst floods have significantly jeopardized the safety of local residents. To better understand the changes in glacial lakes in response to climate change, it is necessary to conduct a long-term evaluation on the areal dynamics of glacial lakes, assisted with local observations. Here, we propose an innovative method of classification and stacking extraction to accurately delineate glacial lakes in southwestern Tibet from 1990 to 2020. Based on Landsat images and meteorological data, we used geographic detectors to detect correlation factors. Multiple regression models were used to analyze the driving factors of the changes in glacier lake area. We combined bathymetric data of the glacial lakes with the changes in climatic variables and utilized HEC-RAS to determine critical circumstances for glacial lake outbursts. The results show that the area of glacial lakes in Nyalam County increased from 27.95 km(2) in 1990 to 52.85 km(2) in 2020, and eight more glacial lakes were observed in the study area. The glacial lake area expanded by 89.09%, where we found significant growth from 2015 to 2020. The correlation analysis between the glacial lake area and climate change throughout the period shows that temperature and precipitation dominate the expansion of these lakes from 1990 to 2020. We also discover that the progressive increase in water volume of glacial lakes can be attributed to the constant rise in temperature and freeze-thaw of surrounding glaciers. Finally, the critical conditions for the glacial lake's outburst were predicted by using HEC-RAS combined with the changes in the water volume and climatic factors. It is concluded that GangxiCo endures a maximum water flow of 4.3 x 10(8) m(3), and the glacial lake is in a stable changing stage. This conclusion is consistent with the field investigation and can inform the prediction of glacial lake outbursts in southwestern Tibet in the future.

TI  - Hypoalbuminemia and the Higher Risk of Perioperative Sentinel Adverse Events in Patients Undergoing Total Shoulder Arthroplasty: A Propensity Score Matched Analysis
T2  - ARCHIVES OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-ABJS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of hypoalbuminemia (HA) on sentinel adverse events after total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA).Methods: Patients who underwent primary TSA from 2015-2018 were collected from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database. Patients with HA (serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL) were compared to patients with normal serum albumin. A probit regression model was used to estimate a propensity score. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the effect of HA on sentinel adverse events after surgery.Results: A total of 4,337 patients were included, 8.2% of patients had HA. Patients with HA had higher rates of sentinel adverse events (14.0% vs 5.5%, P<0.01) compared with patients who had normal serum albumin. Reoperation (4.5% vs 1.5%, P<0.01), readmission (11.2% vs 3.9%, P<0.01), urinary tract infection (0.8% vs 0.03%, P<0.01) and pulmonary embolism (1.1% vs 0.2%, P=0.01) were higher in patients with HA. The odds ratio for a sentinel event for patients with HA was 2.6 (95% CI: 1.54, 4.44, P<0.01) when compared to a propensity score-matched control group.Conclusion: Patients with HA are at increased risk of sentinel adverse events following TSA compared to patients with normal serum albumin levels.

TI  - Comparison of High-Resolution Satellite Precipitation Products in Sub-Saharan Morocco
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation is a crucial source of data in hydrological applications for water resources management. However, several regions suffer from limited data from a ground measurement network. Remotely sensed data may provide a viable alternative for these regions. This study aimed to evaluate six satellite products (GPM-F, CHIRPS, PERSIANN-CCS-CDR, GPM-L, GPM-E and PDIR-Now), with high spatio-temporal resolution, in the sub-Saharan regions of Morocco. Precipitation observation data from 33 rain-gauge stations were collected and used over the period from September 2000 to August 2020. The assessment was performed on three temporal scales (daily, monthly and annually) and two spatial scales (pixel and basin scales), using different quantitative and qualitative statistical indices. The results showed that the GPM-F product performed the best, according to the different evaluation metrics, up to events with 40 mm/day, while the GPM near real-time products (GPM-E and GPM-L) were better at detecting more intense rainfall events. At the daily time scale, GPM-E and GPM-L and, on monthly and annual scales, CHIRPS and PERSIANN-CCS-CDR, provided satisfactory precipitation estimates. Moreover, the altitude-based analysis revealed a bias increasing from low to high altitudes. The continental and mountainous basins showed the lowest performance compared to the other locations closer to the Atlantic Ocean. The evaluation based on the latitudes of rain gauges showed a decrease of bias towards the most arid zones. These results provide valuable information in a scarcely gauged and arid region, showing that GPM-F could be a valuable alternative to rain gauges.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INSIGHTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to identify the effect of seasonal land surface temperature variation on the COVID-19 infection rate. The study area of this research is Bangladesh and its 8 divisions. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform has been used to extract the land surface temperature (LST) values from MODIS satellite imagery from May 2020 to July 2021. The per-day new COVID-19 cases data has also been collected for the same date range. Descriptive and statistical results show that after experiencing a high LST season, the new COVID-19 cases rise. On the other hand. the COVID-19 infection rate decreases when the LST falls in the winter. Also. rapid ups and downs in LST cause a high number of new cases. Mobility, social interaction, and unexpected weather change may be the main factors behind this relationship between LST and COVID-19 infection rates.

TI  - Unsupervised Representation Learning of GRACE Improves Groundwater Predictions
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a crucial source of the world's drinking and irrigation water. Nonetheless, it is being rapidly depleted in many parts of the world. To enact policy decisions to preserve this precious resource, policymakers need real-time data on the groundwater levels in their local area. However, groundwater monitoring wells are costly and scarce in supply. The use of satellite imagery is a promising alternative with its ability to provide continuous information over a large area. Machine learning has also emerged as an alternative to computationally intensive physics-based models. However, advancements in machine learning such as unsupervised learning methods have never been translated to groundwater modeling. Thus, in this paper, learned representations were generated for the GRACE satellite for the first time. When used as an input to groundwater prediction models, the learned representations reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) by up to 19% and improve the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) by up to 8x compared to traditional satellite data inputs at three different spatial scales: national, state, and county. The learned representations are able to discern fine-grained patterns from the coarse satellite data, globally downscaling the GRACE satellite. Crucially, the globally trained representations have the potential to improve the performance of virtually every machine learning-based groundwater prediction model. With accurate measurements, local officials are empowered to make proactive decisions to ensure the stability of their region's water.

TI  - Modelling the Hydrological Response to Urban Land-Use Changes in Three Wetland Catchments of the Western Himalayan Region
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the impact of land use land cover (LULC) changes on runoff is crucial for the sustainable management of wetland catchments. This study modelled the impacts of LULC changes on runoff in three urban wetland catchments using the United States Environment Protection Agency's Stormwater Management Model (SWMM). Land cover maps of 1980 and 2017 delineated from satellite data were reclassified using the geographic information system (GIS) to derive impervious surfaces of three wetland catchments in Srinagar city. The findings revealed a drastic reduction of the pervious area from 2249.6 ha to 1883 ha and a corresponding increase in the impervious surfaces from 321 ha to 704.8 ha including all three catchments. Runoff simulations revealed that from 1980-2017, runoff volume increased by 154%, 76.3%, and 159.5% in the Anchar, Brari Nambal, and Khushalsar catchments, respectively. The results indicate that increased runoff and peak volumes are driven by the land-use change, particularly the increase of urban spaces in wetland areas. For mitigating the negative impacts of runoff, rain gardens, a best management practice (BMP) with low impact development (LID) properties were distributed in the catchments based on the availability of open space, cost, and effectiveness. Simulations indicate that the rain gardens would reduce runoff volume by 46.8%, 10.8%, and 48.6% at 50% of runoff treated, and by 89.4%, 13.4%, and 86.8% at 100% of runoff treated, in the Anchar, Brari Nambal, and Khushalsar catchments, respectively. The results of this study could support environmentally-friendly land use planning for the protection and management of wetland catchments.

TI  - Region-Specific Remote-Sensing Models for Predicting Burn Severity, Basal Area Change, and Canopy Cover Change following Fire in the Southwestern United States
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of burn severity and forest change following wildfire are used to determine changes in forest cover, fuels, carbon stocks, soils, wildlife habitat, and to evaluate fuel and fire management strategies and effectiveness. However, current remote-sensing models for assessing burn severity and forest change in the U.S. are generally based on data collected from California, USA, forests and may not be suitable in other forested ecoregions. To address this problem, we collected field data from 21 wildfires in the American Southwest and developed region-specific models for assessing post-wildfire burn severity and forest change from remotely sensed imagery. We created indices (delta normalized burn ratio (dNBR), relative delta normalized burn ratio (RdNBR), and the relative burn ratio (RBR)) from Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery using pre- and post-fire image pairs. Burn severity models built from southwest U.S. data had clear advantages compared to the current California-based models. Canopy cover and basal area change models built from southwest U.S. data performed better as continuous predictors but not as categorical predictors.

TI  - Estimation of Sea Ice Production in the North Water Polynya Based on Ice Arch Duration in Winter During 2006-2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The North Water Polynya (NOW) is the largest recurrent Arctic coastal polynya. The formation of the NOW is critically dependent on the development of an ice arch that defines its northern boundary. In this study, high-resolution ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar data, Sentinel-1A data, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data were employed to identify the spatio-temporal characteristics of the ice arch during 2006-2019. Polynya pixels were identified based on the thin ice thickness (TIT), using a threshold of TIT <0.2 m, from which the polynya extent, heat flux, and ice production (IP) were estimated. The results show the different locations of the ice arch in different years, with a mean duration of 132 +/- 69 days. The average annual polynya extent over the 14 years is similar to 38.8 +/- 8 x 10(3) km(2), and we found that it is more closely correlated with wind speed during the winter and air temperature during early spring. The average heat flux drops from about 248 W/m(2) in the winter months to about 34 W/m(2) in May. The average accumulated IP varies significantly every year, with an average of 144 +/- 103 km(3), and peak values in March in most years. No apparent interannual trends are shown for the polynya area, heat flux, and IP during 2006-2019. The results also show that IP calculated based on the ice arch data is approximately 25% lower than that obtained by assuming a fixed time, location, and duration for the polynya.

Twenty-one strains of entomopathogenic fungi affecting mosquitoes in Central Brazil were studied: 7 of Beauveria bassiana, 7 of Metarhizium humberi, 3 of M. anisopliae, 2 of Cordyceps sp. and one each of Akanthomyces saksenae and Simplicillium lamellicola. These fungi were isolated from field-collected mosquito adults (3 strains) or larvae (a single strain); the other 17 strains were isolated from laboratory-reared Aedes aegypti sentinel larvae set out in partially immersed cages placed in diverse small-to middle-sized aquatic mosquito habitats in or close to areas with secondary tropical forest. The frequent recovery of normally soil-borne Metarhizium spp. and B. bassiana from aquatic habitats is notable. Our laboratory findings indicated that M. anisopliae IP 429 and IP 438 and M. humberi IP 421 and IP 478 were highly active against immature stages and, together with M. anisopliae IP 432, also against adults. These strains appear to be the most promising candidates to develop effective control strategies targeting the different developmental stages of A. aegypti, the most important vector of viral diseases in humans in the tropics.

TI  - Patterns and drivers of recent land cover change on two trailing-edge forest landscapes
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is altering the distribution of woody plants by influencing demographic processes and modifying disturbance regimes. Trailing-edge forests may be particularly vulnerable to these effects because they exist at warm, dry margins of tree distributions. To better understand recent climate-driven changes in trailing-edge forests, we used Landsat time series and 1558 field reference plots to develop annual land cover maps from 1985 to 2020 in two large, biodiverse landscapes in central Arizona, USA. We then combined annual land cover maps with tree ring records and spatial data describing interannual climate, terrain, bark beetle (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) activity, wildfire, and harvest to quantify drivers of forest change. Throughout the two landscapes, forest extent declined by 0.3 % and 0.8 % from 1985 to 2020. However, considerable variation occurred within the study period, with abrupt (ca. 1-2 years) declines in forest extent followed by gradual (ca. 10 years) recovery on each landscape. Pinyon-juniper (Pinus edulis, Pinus monophylla, and/or Juniperus spp.) cover increased from 1985 to ca. 2000 but declined after 2000, a period of extreme drought and regional tree die-off. In contrast, pineoak (Pinus ponderosa and Quercus spp.) cover increased from 2000 to 2020, primarily due to declines in ponderosa pine and mixed conifer cover over the same period. Wildfire was a key driver of transitions from forest to non-forest cover in our study area, with the occurrence of multiple compounded drought years playing an important role in unburned areas. By driving transitions to alternative forest types or non-forest cover, disturbance and drought will increasingly shape forest dynamics and ecosystem transformations throughout the southwestern US.

TI  - Variability in hospital costs for short stay emergent laparoscopic appendectomy
T2  - SURGERY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Acute care surgery (ACS) diagnoses including appendicitis comprise 20% of inpatient admissions in the U.S. and 25% of hospital costs. To inform cost reduction efforts, we sought to measure variability in hospital costs for short stay emergent laparoscopic appendectomy.Methods: VIZIENT Clinical Data Base was queried for adult and pediatric patients who underwent emergent lap-aroscopic appendectomy for appendicitis with length of stay <= 3 days. We extracted calendar FY 2019 direct costs (DC) by age group and diagnosis code for sites reporting at least 5 cases. Costs in the database are derived from actual charges multiplied by a site-and cost center-specific cost-to-charge ratio. Labor portions are scaled by the area wage index. Sites were ranked by vigintile of DC per case to provide confidentiality and blinding.Results: In a total of 128 hospitals, median number of cases per site was 35.5 (Interquartile range (IQR) 20-65) with a total of 6585 cases analyzed. Highest cost centers by descending order were OR, Medical/Surgical Supplies, Routine Floor Care, Pharmacy, Emergency Room, Anesthesia, Laboratory, and CT scans, with all others each less than 2% of total costs. The relation between OR costs and total costs was strong but not complete. Mean DC per case was $4609. DC did not correlate with age, diagnosis code, or case volume per site.Conclusions: Wide variation in cost of laparoscopic appendectomy among medical centers suggests potential for significant cost reduction. Strategic opportunities in cost reduction appear to lie inside and outside the OR. Key message: Wide variation in cost of laparoscopic appendectomy and individual cost centers suggest a multi -pronged cost-reduction strategy should be used.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Spatial and temporal changes of land uses and its relationship with surface temperature in western Iran
T2  - ATMOSFERA
M3  - Article
AB  - A split-window algorithm has been used in the Ilam dam watershed to determine the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and types of land use. Landsat satellite images of the TM sensor for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010 and Landsat 8 (OLI Sensor) for 2015 and 2018 are used. After geometric and radiometric corrections of satellite images, land use maps are extracted by using the fuzzy ARTMAP method. An accuracy assessment showed that the highest value of the kappa coefficient was 94% with a total accuracy of 0.95 for 2015, and the lowest kappa coefficient value was 87% with a total accuracy of 0.9 for 1990. The high values of these coefficients indicate the acceptable accuracy of using Landsat's remote sensing data for land use detection. The most important land use change is related to dense forest and sparse forest land uses, with decreases of 20.07 and 17.04%, respectively. The minimum LST measures in 1990, 2010, and 2018 in dense forest are 21.27, 30.55 and 33.82 degrees C, respectively. The maximum LSTs for the sparse forest land use in 1990 and 2010 are 52.48 and 56.09, and 56.10 degrees C for the dense forest land use in 2018. As a result, the average LST in agricultural lands was lower than in sparse forest and rangeland;, which is mainly due to the high moisture content and the greater evapotranspiration rate. Land use/land cover variations from 1990 to 2018 show that all land uses have experienced an increase in LST.

TI  - A Novel Approach to Vaccine Development: Concomitant Pathogen Inactivation and Host Immune Stimulation by Peroxynitrite
T2  - VACCINES
M3  - Article
AB  - The design of efficient vaccines for long-term protective immunity against pathogens represents an objective of utmost public health priority. In general, live attenuated vaccines are considered to be more effective than inactivated pathogens, yet potentially more reactogenic. Accordingly, inactivation protocols which do not compromise the pathogen's ability to elicit protective immunity are highly beneficial. One of the sentinel mechanisms of the host innate immune system relies on the production of reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI), which efficiently inactivate pathogens. Peroxynitrite (PN) is a prevalent RNI, assembled spontaneously upon the interaction of nitric oxide (NO) with superoxide. PN exerts its bactericidal effect by via the efficient oxidation of a broad range of biological molecules. Furthermore, the interaction of PN with proteins results in structural/chemical modifications, such as the oxidation of tryptophan, tyrosine, and cysteine residues, as well as the formation of carbonyl, dityrosine, and nitrotyrosine (NT). In addition to their role in innate immunity, these PN-mediated modifications of pathogen components may also augment the antigenicity of pathogen peptides and proteins, hence contributing to specific humoral responses. In the study reported here, a novel approach for vaccine development, consisting of pathogen inactivation by PN, combined with increased immunity of NT-containing peptides, is implemented as a proof-of-concept for vaccination against the intracellular pathogen Francisella tularensis (F. tularensis). In vivo experiments in a murine model of tularemia confirm that PN-inactivated F. tularensis formulations may rapidly stimulate innate and adaptive immune cells, conferring efficient protection against a lethal challenge, superior to that elicited by bacteria inactivated by the widely used formalin treatment.

TI  - Comparison of pixel, sub-pixel and object-based image analysis techniques for co-seismic landslides detection in seismically active area in Lesser Himalaya, Pakistan
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Decision makers require timely and exact delineation of landslide information for effective and quick response to a co-seismic or rainfall-triggered calamity. Remote sensing (RS) techniques provide prompt disaster responses on a local to regional scale, particularly in remote, isolated, and inaccessible places. These techniques, which are divided into pixel, sub-pixel, and object-based techniques, each have their own set of advantages and disadvantages. This study aims to investigate and evaluate the virtues and drawbacks of pixel, sub-pixel, and Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA)-based approach for detecting co-seismic landslides in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan (Lesser Himalayas). Using SPOT and ASTER imagery, a comparison of classification techniques based on the MLC (Maximum Likelihood Classifier), the Co-Registration of Optically Sensed Images and Correlation (COSI-Corr), and the OBIA was performed. On SPOT-5 images, MLC and OBIA approaches were applied, while ASTER images were used for sub-pixel classification. Overall accuracy for pixel-based MLC is 80.8, 90.9% for the sub-pixel COSI-Corr method, and 91.4% for OBIA. As a result, it can be inferred that COSI-Corr and OBIA-based classification outperformed the pixel-based MLC classification technique. The OBIA result is more spatially consistent than the pixel-based outcomes with speckled pixel effects, and depending on visual interpretation. Due to varied geomorphic conditions, the OBIA's ruleset makes it difficult to apply in different terrains. The COSI-Corr technique uses low-cost satellite data with a medium resolution to produce a plausible output. For this technique to work, suitable pre- and post-seismic event images (optical and digital elevation model) must be available (free of shadows and clouds).

TI  - Investigating the environmental impacts of coal mining using remote sensing and in situ measurements in Ruqigou Coalfield, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - China is the largest producer and consumer of coal in the world. The extraction of coal is increasing intensively to meet the needs of the ever-increasing population and industries. However, coal mining has resulted in environmental changes, including deforestation, air, water, soil, and landform deterioration. This study investigates the impact of mining on the environment in Ruqigou coalfield by utilising in situ and remote sensing data. Field data collected include temperature, gas compositions, and water samples. Multi-temporal Landsat data of 1991, 2003, and 2019 were used in monitoring the impact of mining on different land covers, especially vegetation. A supervised classification was performed to assess the changes in land cover. In order to track the changes in vegetation, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) was employed. To study the changes in coal fire areas, thermal anomalies were extracted from the thermal infrared data using a dynamic thresholding technique. The results of in situ analyses show that water quality is unfit for domestic, industrial, and agricultural use. All the gas sampling sites emit noxious gases such as CO2, CO, NO2 and degrade the local air quality. The classified maps and vegetation indices show a significant decrease in vegetation. The thermal anomalies show an increase in fire areas over the years. Thus, it could be concluded that the conjunctive use of field-based measurements and remote sensing data can be a powerful tool for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the environmental impacts associated with large-scale mining.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 Countermeasures on Pediatric Infections
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) Background: General infection control measures have been implemented at the societal level against COVID-19 since the middle of 2020, namely, hand hygiene, universal masking, and social distancing. The suppressive effect of the social implementation of general infection control measures on pediatric infections has not been systematically assessed. (2) Methods: We addressed this issue based on publicly available data on 11 pediatric infections reported weekly by sentinel sites in Osaka and Iwate prefectures in Japan since 2010. We obtained the 5-year average for 2015-2019 and compared it to the weekly report for 2020-2021. (3) Results: The rate of 6 of the 11 pediatric infections decreased significantly during 2020-2021, regardless of the magnitude of the prevalence of COVID-19 in both areas. However, only RSV infection, one of the six infections, was endemic in 2021. Exanthem subitum was not as affected by COVID-19 countermeasures as other diseases. (4) Conclusions: The social implementation of infectious disease control measures was effective in controling certain infectious diseases in younger age groups, where compliance with the countermeasures should not be as high as that of adults.

TI  - Evaluation of Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam Lake Using Remote Sensing Data and GIS
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Ethiopia began constructing the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in 2011 on the Blue Nile near the borders of Sudan for electricity production. The dam was constructed as a roller-compacted concrete (RCC) gravity-type dam, comprising two power stations, three spillways, and the Saddle Dam. The main dam is expected to be 145 m high and 1780 m long. After filling of the dam, the estimated volume of Nile water to be bounded is about 74 billion m(3). The first filling of the dam reservoir started in July 2020. It is crucial to monitor the newly impounded lake and its size for the water security balance for the Nile countries. We used remote sensing techniques and a geographic information system to analyze different satellite images, including multi-looking Sentinel-2, Landsat-9, and Sentinel-1 (SAR), to monitor the changes in the volume of water from 21 July 2020 to 28 August 2022. The volume of Nile water during and after the first, second, and third filling was estimated for the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) Reservoir Lake and compared for future hazards and environmental impacts. The proposed monitoring and early warning system of the Nile Basin lakes is essential to act as a confidence-building measure and provide an opportunity for cooperation between the Nile Basin countries.

TI  - The Assessment of Climate Change Impacts and Land-use Changes on Flood Characteristics: The Case Study of the Kelani River Basin, Sri Lanka
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the changes in climate and land use/land cover (LULC) over time is important for developing policies for minimizing the socio-economic impacts of riverine floods. The present study evaluates the influence of hydro-climatic factors and anthropogenic practices related to LULC on floods in the Kelani River Basin (KRB) in Sri Lanka. The gauge-based daily precipitation, monthly mean temperature, daily discharges, and water levels at sub-basin/basin outlets, and both surveyed and remotely sensed inundation areas were used for this analysis. Flood characteristics in terms of mean, maximum, and number of peaks were estimated by applying the peak over threshold (POT) method. Nonparametric tests were also used to identify the climatic trends. In addition, LULC maps were generated over the years 1988-2017 using Landsat images. It is observed that the flood intensities and frequencies in the KRB have increased over the years. However, Deraniyagala and Norwood sub-basins have converted to dry due to the decrease in precipitation, whereas Kithulgala, Holombuwa, Glencourse, and Hanwella showed an increase in precipitation. A significant variation in atmospheric temperature was not observed. Furthermore, the LULC has mostly changed from vegetation/barren land to built-up in many parts of the basin. Simple correlation and partial correlation analysis showed that flood frequency and inundation areas have a significant correlation with LULC and hydro-climatic factors, especially precipitation over time. The results of this research will therefore be useful for policy makers and environmental specialists to understand the relationship of flood frequencies with the anthropogenic influences on LULC and climatic factors.

TI  - Identifying Nematode Damage on Soybean through Remote Sensing and Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying nematode damage in large soybean areas is not always achievable in a practical way. Multispectral reflectance sensors have not been thoroughly evaluated to detect nematode damage in soybeans (Glycine max L.). The main research aims of this study were to: (i) determine the bivariate relationship between individual spectral bands and vegetation indices (VIs) relative to soybean conditions (symptomatic versus asymptomatic), and (ii) to select the best model for identifying plant conditions using three algorithms (logistic regression-LR, random forest-RF, conditional inference tree-CIT) and three options for data input using bands, vegetation indices (VIs), and bands plus VIs. The trial was conducted in Brazil on three on-farm soybean fields presenting different species of nematode infestation. Multispectral imagery was obtained using a drone-mounted MicaSense RedEdge (R) sensor. At each sampling, georeferenced point nematode infestation and spectral measurements of soybean plants were retrieved for the classification of symptomatic and asymptomatic areas, according to the threshold level adopted. Bivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA), LR, RF, and CIT were used to select the multispectral bands/VIs that discriminated among symptomatic and asymptomatic plants, assessing the best model via their respective parameters for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The greatest classification accuracy (>0.70) was achieved when using the CIT algorithm with the spectral bands only, with green (560 +/- 20 nm) and near-infrared (840 +/- 40 nm) included as the main spectral input variables in the model. These results demonstrate the potential of combining remotely sensed data and machine learning to distinguish nematode-symptomatic and asymptomatic soybean plants.

TI  - Malaria Research for Tailored Control and Elimination Strategies in the Greater Mekong Subregion
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - The malaria landscape in the Greater Mekong Subregion has experienced drastic changes with the ramp -up of the control efforts, revealing formidable challenges that slowed down the progress toward malaria elimination. Problems such as border malaria and cross-border malaria introduction, multidrug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, the persistence of Plasmodium vivax, the asymptomatic parasite reservoirs, and insecticide resistance in primary vectors require integrated strategies tailored for individual nations in the region. In recognition of these challenges and the need for research, the Southeast Asian International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research has established a network of researchers and stakeholders and conducted basic and translational research to identify existing and emerging problems and develop new countermeasures. The installation of a comprehensive disease and vector surveillance system at senti-nel sites in border areas with the implementation of passive/active case detection and cross-sectional surveys allowed timely detection and management of malaria cases, provided updated knowledge for effective vector control measures, and facilitated the efficacy studies of antimalarials. Incorporating sensitive molecular diagnosis to expose the significance of asymptomatic parasite reservoirs for sustaining transmission helped establish the necessary evidence to guide tar-geted control to eliminate residual transmission. In addition, this program has developed point-of-care diagnostics to monitor the quality of artemisinin combination therapies, delivering the needed information to the drug regulatory authori-ties to take measures against falsified and substandard antimalarials. To accelerate malaria elimination, this program has actively engaged with stakeholders of all levels, fostered vertical and horizontal collaborations, and enabled the effective dissemination of research findings.

TI  - Quantification of Underwater <i>Sargassum</i> Aggregations Based on a Semi-Analytical Approach Applied to Sentinel-3/OLCI (Copernicus) Data in the Tropical Atlantic Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - "Sargassum" is a pelagic species of algae that drifts and aggregates in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. The number of Sargassum aggregations increased in the Caribbean Sea during the last decade. The aggregations eventually wash up on shores thus leading to a socio-economic issue for the population and the coastal ecosystem. Satellite ocean color data, such as those provided by the Sentinel-3/OLCI satellite sensor (Copernicus), can be used to detect the occurrences of Sargassum and to estimate their abundance per pixel using the Maximum Chlorophyll Index (noted MCI). Such an index is, however, ineffective if the algae are located beneath the sea surface, which frequently happens, considering the rough Caribbean oceanic waters. The objective of this study is to propose a relevant methodology that enables the detection of underwater Sargassum aggregations. The methodology relies on the inversion of the radiative transfer equation in the water column. The inverted model provides the immersion depth of the Sargassum aggregations (per pixel) and their fractional coverage from the above water reflectances. The overall methodology has been applied to Sentinel-3/OLCI data. The comparison with the MCI method, which is solely devoted to the sea surface retrieval of Sargassum aggregations, shows that the proposed methodology allows retrieving about twice more Sargassum aggregation occurrences than the MCI estimates. A relative increase of 31% of the fractional coverage over the entire study area is observed when using the proposed method in comparison to MCI method. For the satellite scenes considered here, the rate of Sargassum aggregations immersed between 2 m and 5 m depth ranges between 30% and 51% over the total amount (i.e., surface + in-water), which clearly demonstrates the importance of considering the retrieval of in-water aggregations to gain understanding on Sargassum spatial variability in the oceanic and coastal ecosystems.

TI  - An Ecological Expert System Optimization for Assessing Environmental Water Requirements of Hypersaline Lakes
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study proposes an applicable methodology to optimize environmental water requirement of hypersaline lakes with a focus on Urmia lake as the case study in which remote sensing analysis, machine learning model and fuzzy expert system are linked. A machine learning model was developed to simulate effective abiotic parameters in which bands of operational land imager (Landsat 8) were inputs and depth and total dissolved solids were the outputs of the model. Moreover, an ecological expert system using Mamadani fuzzy inference system was developed to generate the habitat suitability map for the selected target species. Then, a multivariate linear model was developed to assess unit habitat suitability in which water level and total inflow of the lake were the variables of the model. An optimization model was developed to assess environmental water requirement in which habitat suitability between natural and regulated flows and water supply loss was minimized. The multivariate linear model was applied to assess habitat suitability in the optimization model. Based on the results in the case study, the proposed combined model is able to balance the ecological requirements and water demand by allocating 60% and 40% of total inflow to environmental water requirement and water demand respectively. Average habitat loss proposed by the optimal environmental water requirement was less than 20% which implies the robustness of the model. Generating habitat suitability maps of the lake by a reliable method which is used in the environmental flow optimization might be the significance of the proposed method.

TI  - COVID-19 lockdown improves air quality in Morocco
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Several measures have been taken to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, almost all non-essential activities in Morocco have been halted since March 20, 2020. From that date, Morocco announced the lockdown for one month and it was extended until June 10, 2020. The main objective of this paper is to study the effects of the lockdown measures on air quality, by analyzing dust PM2.5, NO2, and O3. The dust PM2.5 analysis was carried out from 2016 to 2020. NO2 and O3 analysis was carried out in 2019 and 2020. This study, which is based on satellite data from TROPOMI Sentinel 5P and MERRA, has shown that Morocco has experienced an improvement in air quality during the lockdown. A significant reduction in surface dust PM2.5 and tropospheric NO2 was observed (-10%,-4%, respectively on average). The total column of ozone recorded a slight increase on average of around 1%. Moreover, we demonstrate that a significant part of particulate pollution and NO2 emissions are incoming mainly from the northern and northern-eastern borders of Morocco.

TI  - Features of the Field of Internal Waves on the Abkhazian Shelf of the Black Sea according to Remote Sensing Data and In Situ Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The field of internal waves in the Black Sea is quite significant. The Black Sea shelf is of particular interest, but it has not been studied enough in some specific regions. For example, a narrow and steep shelf of Abkhazia has been poorly explored. Particularly unexplored are the actual parameters and causes of the generation of internal waves in this area. In this article, we have attempted to fill this gap by analyzing remote sensing data and in situ data. An analysis of a set of optical multispectral satellite images (Sentinel-2, Landsat-8) and a collection of sea-truth data of the shelf zone of Abkhazia was carried out to identify features of internal wave fields of this region. In situ data were acquired over 9 years using ADCP, CTD, and SVP probes and moored stations with point and line temperature sensors. It is shown that internal waves are widespread on the Abkhazian shelf. They appear as trains of short-period waves (as a rule, soliton-like). The quantitative parameters and features of internal waves are shown and analyzed. The form of manifestation and direction of internal wave trains' travel depend on the mechanisms of their origin, among which are the transformations of inertial internal waves, generation by river plumes, and submesoscale structures. In general, the article is the most complete and relevant study of the field of internal waves on the shelf of Abkhazia.

TI  - A New Fire Danger Index Developed by Random Forest Analysis of Remote Sensing Derived Fire Sizes
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies using remote sensing data for fire danger prediction have primarily relied on fire ignitions data to develop fire danger indices (FDIs). However, these data may only represent conditions suitable for ignition but may not represent fire danger conditions causing escalating fire size. The fire-related response variable's scalability is a key factor that forms a basis for an FDI to include a broader range of fire danger conditions. Remote sensing derived fire size is a scalable fire characteristic encapsulating all possible fire sizes that previously occurred in the landscape, including extreme fire events. Consequently, we propose a new FDI that uses remote sensing derived fire size as a response variable. We computed fire sizes from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite instrument burned area. We applied random forest (RF) and logistic regression (LR) to develop the FDI for Australia. RF models performed better than LR, and the higher predicted probabilities demonstrated higher chances for ignited fires to be escalated to larger fire sizes at a regional scale across Australia. However, the predicted probabilities cannot be related to the specific range of fire sizes due to data limitations. Further research with higher temporal and spatial resolution data of both the response and predictor variables can help establish a better relationship between a specific range of fire sizes and the predicted probabilities.

TI  - Wind Field Retrieval with Rain Correction from Dual-Polarized Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery Collected during Tropical Cyclones
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to include rain effects in wind field retrieval from C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery collected under tropical cyclone conditions. An effective and operationally attractive approach to detect rain cells in SAR imagery is proposed and verified using four Sentinel-1 (S-1) SAR images collected in dual-polarized (vertical-vertical (VV) and vertical-horizontal (VH)) interferometric-wide swath imaging mode during the Satellite Hurricane Observation Campaign. SAR images were collocated with ancillary observations that include sea surface wind and rain rate from the Stepped-Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) on board of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration aircraft. The winds are inverted from VV- and VH-polarized S-1 image using the CMOD5.N and S1IW.NR geophysical model functions (GMFs), respectively. Location and radius of cyclone's eye, together with the TC central pressure, are calculated from the VV-polarized SAR-derived wind and a parametric model. A cost function is proposed that consists of the difference between the measured VV-polarized SAR normalized radar cross section (NRCS) and the NRCS predicted using CMOD5.N forced with the wind speed retrieved by the VH-polarized SAR images using S1IW.NR GMF and the wind direction retrieved from the patterns visible in the SAR image. This cost function is related to the SFMR rain rate. Experimental results show that the difference between measured and predicted NRCS values range from 0.5 dB to 5 dB within a distance of 100 km from the cyclone's eye, while the difference increases spanning from 3 dB to 6 dB for distances larger than 100 km. Following this rationale, first the rain bands are extracted from SAR imagery and, then, the composite wind fields are reconstructed by replacing: (1) dual-polarized SAR-derived winds over the rain-free regions; (2) winds simulated using the radial-vortex model over the rain-affected regions. The validation of the composite wind speed against SFMR winds yields a 0.7 correlation (COR) at all flow directions up to retrieval speeds of 70 m s(-1). This result outperforms the winds estimated using the VH-polarized S1IW.NR GMF, which call for high error accuracy, such as about 4 m s(-1) with a 0.45 COR ranged from 330 degrees to 360 degrees.

TI  - Molecular Epidemiology of <i>mcr-1</i>-Positive <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> Isolates: Results from Russian Sentinel Surveillance (2013-2018)
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The dissemination of mobile colistin resistance (mcr) genes is a serious healthcare threat because polymyxins represent "last-line" therapeutics for multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of colistin resistance and mcr genes and characteristics of clinical Escherichia coli (Eco) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kpn) isolates and plasmids carrying these genes in Russia. Methods: A total of 4324 Eco and 4530 Kpn collected in the frame of sentinel surveillance in 2013-2018 were tested for susceptibility to colistin and other antibiotics using the broth microdilution method. mcr genes were screened by real-time PCR. Phylogeny, genomic features and plasmids of mcr-positive isolates were assessed using whole-genome sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analysis. Results: Colistin resistance was detected in 2.24% Eco and 9.3% Kpn. Twenty-two (0.51%) Eco and two (0.04%) Kpn from distant sites carried mcr-1.1. Most mcr-positive isolates co-harbored ESBLs and other resistance determinants to various antibiotic classes. The mcr-positive Eco belonged to 16 MLST types, with ST359 being most common; Kpn belonged to ST307 and ST23. mcr-1.1 was carried mainly in IncI2 (n = 18) and IncX4 (n = 5) plasmids highly similar to those identified previously in human, animal and environmental isolates. Conclusion: This study demonstrated a dissemination of "typical" mcr-bearing plasmids among diverse Eco and Kpn genotypes and across a wide geographic area in Russia. Given the frequent association of mcr with other resistance determinants and potential clinical impact, the continual surveillance of this threat is warranted.

TI  - Monitoring of high temperature weather episodes with Satellite data over the Indian region
T2  - MAUSAM
M3  - Article
AB  - INSAT-3D/3R Geosatellites are in orbit at 74 degrees E and 82 degrees E positions respectively and operating in staggering mode of 15 minute temporal frequency providing continuous coverage in high spatial domain through 6 channel Imager data. Satellite derived geophysical parameters like Outgoing Long wave Radiation (OLR), L and Surface Temperature (LST) and Upper Tropospheric Humidity etc are found to very useful in monitoring the high temperature weather episodes affecting almost entire country like Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar, Madhya Pradesh (MP), Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh (AP), Telengana, Tamilnadu Orissa etc starting from mid of March-2022. The actual temperatures in the above said areas persisting above normal (similar to 4 to 7 degrees C) from Mid March to Mid April-2022 and caused heat wave conditions in most of the places of the country. The persistency of the prevailing heat wave conditions is not only related to surface features but also upper air anticyclonic circulations and sinking of dry air over the affected areas. The entire feedback cycle from lower to middle troposphere operating with dry air mass (Northerly) almost entire Northwest , Central and parts of South (Maharashtra, AP and Telangana) and kwp the areas warm and above normal temperature range. The eastward moving systems also not reaching to lower northern latitudes and moving away and keeping away moisture laden winds.This paper brought out the role of INSAT-3D/3R satellite derived products in monitoring such high temperature episodes. Such type of weather events blended with the support of climatological features of prevailing weather systems of the season can be utilized in forecasting and its persistence over the area. It is seen from the study that, the OLR vales threshold ranges from 330 -380 watt/m(2) in pockets of wanner temperatures or suffering from heat %Nave conditions. Similarly, the Land surface temperature and UTH values 306 -325 degrees K & 05-25 % respectively. The IPWV values in mm are also varies from 2-12 nun during mid-March to mid-April-2022.The satellite and climatological information can be clubbed together up to village level to help the society and disaster management authorities at state /district level in advance of such high impact weather events. This study is done with limited data sets and in future, it will be carried out lir larger domain and a suitable the long period average (LPA) of past INSAT data (daily, monthly, seasonal), so that area %vise thresholds can be generated from almost for entire Indian domain.

T2  - METHOD & THEORY IN THE STUDY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - This response picks up on two key themes identified by Wolfaart: that of the contested aims of "religious literacy " and the lack of an evidence base for its efficacy. Focusing on the context of formal schooling, the idea of "worldview literacy " is presented as an alternative to "religious literacy ". Rather than an outcome of education, "worldview literacy " is presented as a process of encounter in plurality, an educational praxis that brings young people to a greater understanding of the dynamic diversity of worldviews and of themselves as social actors therein. This reconciles what are often seen as competing aims of Religious Education and provides a framework for a more distributed worldviews education. It is suggested that amidst a preoccupation with measurement, attention needs to be refocused on the value of the educational process itself.

TI  - Retrieval of Chlorophyll-a Concentrations Using Sentinel-2 MSI Imagery in Lake Chagan Based on Assessments with Machine Learning Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is an important characterized parameter of lakes. Monitoring it accurately through remote sensing is thus of great significance for early warnings of water eutrophication. Sentinel Multispectral Imager (MSI) images from May to September between 2020 and 2021 were used along with in-situ measurements to estimate Chl-a in Lake Chagan, which is located in Jilin Province, Northeast China. In this study, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) models, which had similar performances, were generated by six single bands and six band combinations. The RF model was then selected based on the assessments (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 2.51 mu g L-1, MAPE = 9.86%), since its learning of the input features in the model conformed to the bio-optical properties of Case 2 waters. The study considered Chl-a concentrations in Lake Chagan as a seasonal pattern according to the K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) classification. The RF model also showed relatively stable performance for three seasons (spring, summer and autumn) and it was applied to map Chl-a in the whole lake. The research presents a more reliable machine learning (ML) model with higher precision than previous empirical models, as shown by the effects of the input features linked with the biological mechanisms of Chl-a. Its robustness was revealed by the temporal and spatial distributions of Chl-a concentrations, which were consistent with in-situ measurements in the map. This research was capable of revealing the current ecological situation in Lake Chagan and can serve as a reference in remote sensing of inland lakes.

TI  - Mapping and Monitoring Forest Plantations in Sao Paulo State, Southeast Brazil, Using Fraction Images Derived from Multiannual Landsat Sensor Images
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a method, based on orbital remote sensing, to map the extent of forest plantations in Sao Paulo State (Southeast Brazil). The proposed method uses the random forest machine learning algorithm available on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. We used 30 m annual mosaics derived from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images and from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images for the 1985 to 1995 and 2013 to 2021 time periods, respectively. These time periods were selected based on the planted areas' rotation, especially the eucalypt's short rotation. To classify the forest plantations, green, red, NIR, and MIR spectral bands, NDVI, GNDVI, NDWI, and NBR spectral indices, and vegetation, shade, and soil fractions were used for both sensors. These indices and the fraction images have the advantage of reducing the volume of data to be analyzed and highlighting the forest plantations' characteristics. In addition, we also generated one mosaic for each fraction image for the TM and OLI datasets by computing the maximum value through the period analyzed, facilitating the classification of areas occupied by forest plantations in the study area. The proposed method allowed us to classify the areas occupied by two forest plantation classes: eucalypt and pine. The results of the proposed method compared with the forest plantation areas extracted from the land use and land cover maps, provided by the MapBiomas product, presented the Kappa values of 0.54 and 0.69 for 1995 and 2020, respectively. In addition, two pilot areas were used to evaluate the classification maps and to monitor the phenological stages of eucalypt and pine plantations, showing the rotation cycle of these plantations. The results are very useful for planning and managing planted forests by commercial companies and can contribute to developing an automatic method to map forest plantations on regional and global scales.

TI  - Impact of Cloud Condensation Nuclei Reduction on Cloud Characteristics and Solar Radiation during COVID-19 Lockdown 2020 in Moscow
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We used MODIS observations to retrieve number concentration of cloud droplets (N-d) at cloud lower boundary during spring 2018-2020 for the Moscow region. Looking through the similar synoptic situations of the northern clear air advection, we obtained N-d within the limits of 200-300 cm(-3). During the lockdown period, with similar northern advection conditions, the reduction of N-d on 40-50 cm(-3) (or 14-16%), with the increase in droplet effective radius by 8 +/- 1% and cloud optical thickness reduction by 5 +/- 2%, was observed in contrast to the values in typical conditions in 2018-2019. We used these values for setting up corresponding parameters in numerical simulations with the COSMO-Ru model. According to the numerical experiments, we showed that the observed reduction in cloud droplet concentration by 50 cm(-3) provides a 5-9 W/m(2) (or 9-11%) increase in global irradiance at ground in overcast cloud conditions with LWP = 200-400 g/m(2).

TI  - The rising swarms of jellyfish in Indian waters: the environmental drivers, ecological, and socio-economic impacts
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - A four-decade data of jellyfish aggregation from 1980 to 2020 were taken to discern whether there has been an actual rise in jellyfish swarm in Indian coastal and estuarine waters. Despite frequent jellyfish aggregations and beach strandings in Indian waters, jellyfish aggregations have been poorly investigated and there is a dearth of information on the swarm-forming jellyfish, their preferred season, and the location of swarming. Therefore, our review aims to account for the frequency of swarming phenomenon annually and the appearance of new swarm-forming jellyfish species. The term 'jellyfish' refers to the medusae stage of phylum Cnidaria (Cubozoa, Hydrozoa, and Scyphozoa) only in this review. The present work postulates a geospatial spread and swarm-forming jellyfish species to increase in recent times. More than 23 coastal locations of India have witnessed jellyfish aggregations and beach stranding in the last four decades. Seasonal oceanographic conditions prevailing during the summer monsoon, fall, and early winter promoted jellyfish aggregations and swarming. Only two jellyfish species were known to form aggregates during 1981-1990, but the diversity of jellyfish species increased to nine by 2011-2020. The development of predictive models from remote sensing data can be useful to warn humans and coastal industries of the approaching swarm.

TI  - Effect of COVID-19-induced lockdown on NO<sub>2</sub> pollution using TROPOMI and ground-based CPCB observations in Delhi NCR, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study investigates the reduction in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels using satellite-based (Sentinel-5P TROPOMI) and ground-based (Central Pollution Control Board) observations of 2020. The lockdown duration, monthly, seasonal and annual changes in NO2 were assessed comparing the similar time period in 2019. The study also examines the role of atmospheric parameters like wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and atmospheric pressure in altering the monthly and annual values of the pollutant. It was ascertained that there was a mean reduction of similar to 61% (similar to 66.5%), similar to 58% (similar to 51%) in daily mean NO2 pollution during lockdown phase 1 when compared with similar period of 2019 and pre-lockdown phase in 2020 from groundbased (satellite-based) measurements. April month with similar to 57% (similar to 57%), summer season with-48% (similar to 32%) decline and an annual reduction of similar to 20% (similar to 18%) in tropospheric NO2 values were observed (p <0.001) compared to similar time periods of 2019. It was assessed that the meteorological parameters remained almost similar during various parts of the year in 2019 and 2020, indicating a negligent role in reducing the values of atmospheric pollution, particularly NO2 in the study area. It was concluded that the halt in anthropogenic activities and associated factors was mainly responsible for the reduced values in the Delhi conglomerate. Similar work can be proposed for other pollutants to holistically describe the pollution scenario as an aftermath of COVID-19-induced lockdown.

TI  - Abattoir-based serological surveillance for transboundary and zoonotic diseases in cattle and swine in Cambodia: a pilot study in Phnom Penh province during 2019 and 2020
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - A pilot animal disease surveillance program was implemented at four abattoirs in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, between October 2019 and January 2020. A total of 1141 samples were collected from 477 cattle and 664 swine. Serological testing was performed using commercial antibody ELISA kits for zoonotic and high-impact animal diseases, namely brucellosis, Q fever, classical swine fever (CSF), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and African swine fever (ASF). Only two samples tested positive for Brucella antibodies (0.2%, 95% CI 0.4-0.6, n = 1141). The seroprevalence of Q fever was 0.8% (95% CI 0.3-2.1, n = 477) in the cattle samples, while CSF, PRRS and ASF in pigs were 55.4% (95% CI 51.6-59.2, n = 655), 81.2% (95% CI 78.1-84.0, n = 655) and 2.6% (95% CI 1.6-4.1, n = 664), respectively. All 38 doubtful and 17 positive ASF antibody ELISA samples were negative when tested by real-time PCR. Univariate analyses demonstrated that the factor significantly associated with positive results of ASF was the abattoir location (p-value = 0.002). Based on logistic regression models, significant risk factors for CSF were province of origin (p-value = 1.7 x 10(-6)), abattoir (p-value = 3.6 x 10(-11)) and PRRS positivity (p-value = 0.004), and for PRRS were province of origin (p-value = 0.0004) and CSF positivity (p-value = 0.001). In conclusion, the seroprevalences of zoonotic diseases in this study were very low. The high prevalence of CSF and PRRS antibodies were most likely the result of vaccination. All ASF seropositive pigs, including those that gave equivocal results, originated from large-scale Cambodian-based commercial farms, as well as Thailand, which raises questions about possible illegal vaccination or low-pathogenicity ASF variants. The pilot abattoir serological surveillance program described here has the potential to provide a sentinel for incursions of novel and endemic pathogens, although further work is required to demonstrate its capacity to provide information on the longitudinal disease trends.

TI  - <i>Gypsy</i> Anarchism: Navigating Ethnic and Political Identities
T2  - EUROPEAN HISTORY QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the many stereotypes included in the generally negative - occasionally Romantic - representations and discourses that have burdened the Romani people is the alleged existence of a natural link between the 'Gypsy' way of life and anarchism. This article studies the extent of an actual historical relationship between anarchism as a political worldview and the 'Gypsy'-Roma ethnic status beyond reductionist stereotypes. It investigates, on the one hand, the agency of Romani subjects in the labour movement and anarchism by means of a case study of Spain in the interwar years, and, on the other, it examines the cases of a number of European emigrants who chose to closely link anarchism as a political option to a Romani identity in their struggle against capitalism and fascism. Both sets of case studies are used to reflect on the political nature of racial-ethnic identity constructions, to question the dilemmas of cultural appropriation and to propose a dense analysis that reveals the historicity of identities of this type.

TI  - WHY THE 2008 AND 2012 ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN To PACIFY CIUDAD JUAREz FAILED?
T2  - COLMENA-REVISTA DE LA UNIVERSIDAD AUTONOMA DEL ESTADO DE MEXICO
M3  - Article
AB  - Ciudad Juarez is a strategic crossing point for drugs toward the United Sta-tes. From 2008 to 2012, it was named the most violent city during the war among the drug cartels. In the middle of the war, the federal government sent to the city the army, the navy, and the federal police to pacify Ciudad Juarez. Likewise, the govern-ment implemented an advertising campaign to invite the citizens of Juarez to stren-gthen its community and be loyal to the authorities. Both objectives were rejected by the people of Juarez. This paper reviews the advertising materials to find mistakes in their creation. The methodology is a comparative analysis of the visual elements and the worldview of the citizens of Juarez in these years. The results were: Generic ele-ments, alien symbols, discredited characters, wrong media, messages saturation, dis-sociation between signs, and contempt to the citizens of the city.

TI  - Ultra-Hypofractionation for Whole-Breast Irradiation in Early Breast Cancer: Interim Analysis of a Prospective Study
T2  - BIOMEDICINES
M3  - Article
AB  - We report on the early clinical outcomes of a prospective series of early breast cancer (EBC) patients treated with ultra-hypofractionated post-operative whole-breast irradiation (WBI) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and axillary management. Primary endpoints were patient's compliance and acute toxicity. Secondary endpoints included physician-rated cosmesis and ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence (IBTR). Acute toxicity was evaluated at the end of WBI, 3 weeks and 6 months thereafter, according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (v. 5.0). Patients were treated between September 2021 and May 2022. The treatment schedule for WBI consisted of either 26 Gy in 5 fractions over one week (standard approach) or 28.5 Gy in 5 fractions over 5 weeks (reserved to elders). Inverse planned intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was used employing a static technique. A total of 70 patients were treated. Fifty-nine were treated with the 26 Gy/5 fr/1 w and 11 with the 28.5 Gy/5 fr/5 ws schedule. Median age was 67 and 70 in the two groups. Most of the patients had left-sided tumours (53.2%) in the 26 Gy/5 fr/1 w or right-sided lesions (63.6%) in the 28.5 Gy/5 fr/5 ws group. Most of the patients had a clinical T1N0 disease and a pathological pT1pN0(sn) after surgery. Ductal invasive carcinoma was the most frequent histology. Luminal A intrinsic subtyping was most frequent. Most of the patients underwent BCS and sentinel lymph node biopsy and adjuvant endocrine therapy. All patients completed the treatment program as planned. Maximum detected acute skin toxicities were grade 2 erythema (6.7%), grade 2 induration (4.4%), and grade 2 skin colour changes. No early IBTR was observed. Ultra-hypofractionated WBI provides favourable compliance and early clinical outcomes in EBC after BCS in a real-world setting.

TI  - Multithematic Geoscience Data Integration for Identification of Mineral Potential Areas in Parts of Central Indian Precambrian Craton
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper highlights the results of multi-thematic geoscience data integration involving geological, geophysical, geochemical and remote sensing data sets, for an area of 4000 Sq. Km in parts of Precambrian Bastar craton, Chhattisgarh. The present team has been able to identify two discrete mineral potential areas for base metal sulphides, Sn, W and REE in sheared and altered felsic volcanics in Kotra-Bhansula area and for gold in propylitically altered meta basalts in Bhursatola-Khampura area. The dataset utilized during collation and integration includes (i) high resolution aeromagnetic data (ii) 1:50000 geological data covering lithostructural and mineralisation attributes (iii) 1:50 k geochemical data for 61 elements (iv) multispectral ASTER satellite data and its derivative alteration maps. Thematic data and derivative maps were studied and interpreted for evaluation of concerned parameters for estimating their role in mineralisation. The data integration has been implemented in three steps beginning with GIS based spatial modelling using Fuzzy logic method resulting into production of mineral favourability map, followed by detailed field evaluation and characterization of the identified mineral favourability areas. Eventual identification of potential areas was based on synthesis of modelling output, field outcome and laboratory results of analyses carried out on critical samples collected from mineral favourability areas. The identified two mineral potential areas are recommended for further detailed exploration for gold, base metal, Sn, W and REE through surface and sub-surface probing.

TI  - Satellite-Derived Photosynthetically Available Radiation at the Coastal Arctic Seafloor
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has affected the Arctic Ocean (AO) and its marginal seas significantly. The reduction of sea ice in the Arctic region has altered the magnitude of photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) entering the water column, impacting primary productivity. Increasing cloudiness in the atmosphere and rising turbidity in the coastal waters of the Arctic region are considered as the major factors that counteract the effect of reduced sea ice on underwater PAR. Additionally, extreme solar zenith angles and sea-ice cover in the AO increase the complexity of retrieving PAR. In this study, a PAR algorithm based on radiative transfer in the atmosphere and satellite observations is implemented to evaluate the effect of these factors on PAR in the coastal AO. To improve the performance of the algorithm, a flag is defined to identify pixels containing open-water, sea-ice or cloud. The use of flag enabled selective application of algorithms to compute the input parameters for the PAR algorithm. The PAR algorithm is validated using in situ measurements from various coastal sites in the Arctic and sub-Arctic seas. The algorithm estimated daily integrated PAR above the sea surface with an uncertainty of 19% in summer. The uncertainty increased to 24% when the algorithm was applied year-round. The PAR values at the seafloor were estimated with an uncertainty of 76%, with 36% of the samples under sea ice and/or cloud cover. The robust performance of the PAR algorithm in the pan-Arctic region throughout the year will help to effectively study the temporal and spatial variability of PAR in the Arctic coastal waters. The calculated PAR data are used to quantify the changing trend in PAR at the seafloor in the coastal AO with depth < 100 m using MODIS-Aqua data from 2003 to 2020. The general trends calculated using the pixels with average PAR > 0.415 mol m(-2) day(-1) at the seafloor during summer indicate that the annual average of PAR entering the water column in the coastal AO between 2003 and 2020 increased by 23%. Concurrently, due to increased turbidity, the attenuation in the water column increased by 22%. The surge in incident PAR in the water column due to retreating sea ice first led to increased PAR observed at the seafloor (similar to 12% between 2003 and 2014). However, in the last decade, the rapid increase in light attenuation of the water column has restricted the increase in average annual PAR reaching the bottom in the coastal AO.

TI  - Improvement of the "Triangle Method" for Soil Moisture Retrieval Using ECOSTRESS and Sentinel-2: Results over a Heterogeneous Agricultural Field in Northern India
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - For the purpose of deriving spatiotemporal estimates of soil moisture, the triangle method is one of the most widely used approaches today utilizing remote sensing data. Generally, those techniques are based on the physical relationships that exist when a satellite-derived land surface temperature (Ts) is plotted against a spectral vegetation index (VI). The present study proposes an improvement in the triangle method in retrieving soil moisture over heterogeneous areas. In particular, it proposes a new approach in robustly identifying the extreme points required for the technique's implementation. Those extreme points are then used in calculating fractional vegetation cover (Fr) and scaled Ts. Furthermore, the study proposes a new approach for calculating the coefficients required to develop the relationships between surface soil moisture (SSM) and Fr/Ts, which is implemented using a model and field data. As a case study, an agricultural field in the Varanasi district in India has been used, on which the triangle method is implemented using ECOSTRESS and Sentinel-2 data. The much-improved spatial resolution satellite data of similar to 70 m from ECOSTRESS allowed deriving more vivid results of SSM spatial variability for the study area. Comparisons between field soil moisture calculated using the proposed method returned an RMSE of 0.03 and R-2 value of 0.84, which are considered very satisfactory. The methodology proposed herein and the results obtained are of significant value with regards to the triangle method, contributing to ongoing efforts at present examining its use for operational product development at a global scale.

TI  - Peat Fire Detection to Estimate Greenhouse Gas Emissions
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Peat fires differ from other wildfires by significant carbon loss, the emission of greenhouse gases and other combustion products as well as by serious environmental consequences. Not only biomass but also peat is burnt. A possibility of detecting peat fires from satellite and ground-based data is considered for the fires in the Moscow region in 2010. The peat fire detection technique was tested by superimposing data on thermal anomalies from Terra/Aqua MODIS satellite data on the peatland contours, as well as by analyzing the vegetation cover changes before fires and the next year using the Landsat satellite multispectral data. Threshold values were found for the fire duration, maximum temperature, and maximum fire radiative power that characterize peat fires and can be used to discriminate between fires on peat lands and peat fires themselves for taking into account emissions not only from biomass burning but also from soil carbon loss.

TI  - Comprehensiveness of care for women with depression Association between primary care use and cervical cancer screening
T2  - CANADIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To explore comprehensiveness of care in patients with depression by examining associations between a diagnosis of depression, frequency of primary care visits, and Papanicolaou test completion. Design Cross-sectional retrospective survey using electronic medical record data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network. Setting Primary care practices in Ontario. Participants Women aged 21 to 69 eligible to receive Pap tests in 2015. Main outcome measures Associations between 2 predictors (depression and number of primary care visits in 2015) and Pap test completion were measured. Results Overall, 125,258 women were included: 20.5% completed a Pap test and 16.4% had a diagnosis of depression. Having a diagnosis of depression was associated with lower likelihood of Pap test completion (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=0.92, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.95). A greater number of primary care visits was associated with a higher likelihood of Pap test completion; this association was stronger in women with a diagnosis of depression (AOR=4.9, 95% CI 4.16 to 5.69) than in those without (AOR=3.4, 95% CI 3.25 to 3.60). Conclusion While depression was associated with fewer completed Pap tests, women with depression who saw their family doctors more often were more likely to be screened for cervical cancer. More primary care visits for depression treatment may be associated with an improved likelihood of screening for cervical cancer.

AB  - study aimed to adapt Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to solve the problem of change detection using remote sensing imagery. Specifically, the goal was to investigate the impact of each CNN layer to detect changes between two satellite images acquired on two different dates. As low-level CNN layers detect fine details (small changes) and higher-level layers detect coarse details (large changes), the idea was to assign a weight to each layer and use a genetic algorithm based on a training dataset to generalize the detection process on the test dataset. The results showed the effectiveness of the proposed approach based on two real-life datasets.

TI  - Factors influencing acceptance, adoption and adherence to sentinel node biopsy recommendations in the Australian Melanoma Management Guidelines: a qualitative study using an implementation science framework.
T2  - Implementation science communications
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel node biopsy (SN biopsy) is a surgical procedure used to accurately stage patients with primary melanoma at high risk of recurrence. Although Australian Melanoma Management Guidelines recommend SN biopsy be considered in patients with melanomas>1mm thick, SN biopsy rates in Australia are reportedly low. Our objective was to identify factors impacting the acceptance, adoption and adherence to the Australian SN biopsy guideline recommendations.METHODS: Opinions of Australian key informants including clinicians, representatives from melanoma education and training providers, professional associations and colleges, and melanoma advocacy organisations were collected through semi-structured interviews (n=29) and from publicly released statements (n=14 news articles). Data analysis involved inductive and deductive thematic analysis using Flottorp's determinants framework.RESULTS: A complex interplay of contemporary and historical factors was identified as influencing acceptance, adoption and adherence to the SN biopsy guideline recommendations at the individual, guideline, patient, organisational and social levels. Expert and peer opinion leaders have played an important role in facilitating or inhibiting adoption of guideline recommendations, as have financial incentives driven by healthcare-funding policies and non-financial incentives including professional identity and standing. Of critical importance have been the social and knowledge boundaries that exist between different professional groups to whom the guidelines apply (surgeons, dermatologists and primary care practitioners) with adherence to the guideline recommendations having the potential to shift work across professional boundaries, altering a clinician's workflow and revenue. More recently, the emergence of effective immunotherapies and targeted therapies for patients at high risk of recurrence, the emergence of new opinion leaders on the topic (in medical oncology), and patient demands for accurate staging are playing crucial roles in overcoming the resistance to change created by these social and knowledge boundaries.CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance and adherence to SN biopsy guideline recommendations in Australia over the past 20years has involved a process of renegotiation and reframing of the evidence for SN biopsy in melanoma by clinicians from different professional groups and networks. This process has helped to refine the evidence for SN biopsy and our understanding of appropriate adoption. New effective systemic therapies have changed the balance towards accepting guideline recommendations.

TI  - Using Landsat and MODIS satellite collections to examine extent, timing, and potential impacts of surface water inundation in California croplands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The state of California, United States of America produces many crop products that are both utilized domestically and exported throughout the world. With nearly 39,000 km2 of croplands, monitoring unintentional and intentional surface water inundation is important for water resource management and flood hazard readiness. We examine inundation dynamics in California croplands from 2003 to 2020 by intersecting monthly surface water maps (n = 216 months) derived using two satellite remote sensing platforms (Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer [MODIS]) with a high-quality cropland map generated by the California Department of Water Resources. Surface water maps were produced using the Dynamic Surface Water Extent model, in which satellite image pixels are classified into different levels of detection confidence. Our analysis focused on calculating monthly and annual occurrence of "high confidence" water for each satellite collection across eight cropland types and 58 counties. Results indicate that 49.9% (MODIS) to 56.4% (Landsat) of croplands were inundated at least once during the 18-year timespan. Rice crops, due to their unique need of consistent surface water and dominance as a crop type in CA, had the highest proportion of and mean annual inundation area, while citrus crops had the lowest. Mean monthly inundation patterns in most croplands followed California's precipitation patterns with high inundation during the winter and spring rainy season. At the county level, croplands in the southern Central Valley typically had high occurrences of inundation in conjunction with large crop areas. Exposure and sensitivity of inundation for three crop types (citrus, deciduous, and vineyards) that are typically less associated with intentional inundation were geographically variable, but overall were generally highest in counties in the southern Central Valley, California's primary agricultural region. Flood and precipitation related crop insurance claims indicated that rice had the highest mean indemnity payout for any month with damages typically occurring in March and April. Insurance claims were also high in deciduous fruit and nut crops, which had peak damages in February. A comparison between inundation results and insurance claims suggests that the inundation mapped by our process coincides with claim activity. These data elucidate water inundation patterns across the state that can serve to inform farmers, insurers, decision makers, resource managers, and flood mitigation professionals.

TI  - A Novel Dual-Branch Neural Network Model for Flood Monitoring in South Asia Based on CYGNSS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave remote sensing is widely applied in flood monitoring due to its independence from severe weather conditions, which usually restrict the usage of optical sensors. However, it is challenging to track the variation process of flood events in a timely manner by traditional active and passive microwave techniques, since they cannot simultaneously provide measurements with high spatial and temporal resolution. The emerging Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) technique with high spatio-temporal resolution offers a new solution to the dynamic monitoring of flood inundation. Considering the high sensitivity of GNSS-R signals to flooding, this paper proposes a dual-branch neural network (DBNN) with a convolution neural network (CNN) and a back propagation (BP) neural network for flood monitoring. The CNN module is used to automatically extract the abstract features from delay-Doppler maps (DDMs), while the BP module is fed with GNSS-R typical features, such as surface reflectivity and power ratio, as well as vegetation information from Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite (SMAP) data. In the experiments, the superiority of the DBNN method is firstly demonstrated by comparing it with the surface reflectivity and power ratio methods. Then, the spatio-temporal variation process of the 2020 South Asian flood events is analyzed by the proposed method based on Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) data. The understanding of flood change processes could help enhance the capacity for resisting flood disasters.

TI  - A New Post-hoc Flat Field Measurement Method for the Solar X-Ray and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager Onboard the FengYun-3E Satellite
T2  - RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY AND ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations are widely used in solar activity research and space weather forecasting since they can observe both the solar eruptions and the source regions of the solar wind. Flat field processing is indispensable to remove the instrumental non-uniformity of a solar EUV imager in producing high-quality scientific data from original observed data. FengYun-3E (FY-3E) is a meteorological satellite operated in a Sun-synchronous orbit, and the routine EUV imaging data from the Solar X-ray and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (X-EUVI) onboard FY-3E has the characteristic of concentric rotation. Taking advantage of the concentric rotation, we propose a post-hoc flat field measurement method for its EUV 195 angstrom channel in this paper. This method removes the small-scale and time-varying component of coronal activities by taking the median value for each pixel along the time axis of a concentric rotation data cube, and then derives the large-scale and invariable component of the quiet coronal radiation, and finally generates a flat field image. The flat field can be generated with cadences from hundreds of minutes (one orbit) to several days. Higher flat field accuracy can be achieved by employing more data. Further analysis shows that our method is able to measure the instrumental spot-like non-uniformity possibly caused by contamination on the detector, which mostly disappears after the in-orbit self-cleaning process. It can also measure the quasi-periodic grid-like non-uniformity, possibly from the obscuration of the support mesh on the rear filter. After flat field correction, these instrumental non-uniformities from the original data are effectively removed. Moreover, the X-EUVI 195 angstrom data after dark and flat field corrections are consistent with the 193 angstrom imaging data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, verifying the suitability of the method. The post-hoc method does not occupy observation time, which is advantageous for space weather operations. Our method is not only suitable for FY-3E/X-EUVI but also a candidate method for the flat field measurement of future solar EUV telescopes.

TI  - Developing a New Parameterization Scheme of Temperature Lapse Rate for the Hydrological Simulation in a Glacierized Basin Based on Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature lapse rate (TLR) is an important parameter for simulations of snow/glacier melts in alpine watersheds. However, the traditional scheme estimates TLR mainly based on a limited number of stations and may not be suitable for alpine watersheds with scarce observations. To overcome this problem, this study developed a new basin-oriented TLR scheme based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature data which was applied in a typical glacierized watershed on the northern slope of the Himalayas. The new TLR scheme was evaluated by comparison with the station-based traditional TLR scheme in terms of performance in simulations of both snow cover area and runoff using the same hydrological model. The results showed that the monthly TLRs estimated by the new scheme presented a more reasonable seasonal pattern than those estimated by the traditional scheme. The model using the new TLR scheme showed better performance in discharge simulations of low-runoff months than that using the traditional TLR scheme. The R-squared value of multiyear mean monthly snow cover area of the former (0.82) was also higher than that of the latter (0.56). This study provides an efficient framework for estimating TLR based on remote sensing for alpine watersheds with scarce observations.

TI  - Glacier Boundary Mapping Using Deep Learning Classification over Bara Shigri Glacier in Western Himalayas
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier, snow, and ice are the essential components of the Himalayan cryosphere and provide a sustainable water source for different applications. Continuous and accurate monitoring of glaciers allows the forecasting analysis of natural hazards and water resource management. In past literature, different methodologies such as spectral unmixing, object-based detection, and a combination of various spectral indices are commonly utilized for mapping snow, ice, and glaciers. Most of these methods require human intervention in feature extraction, training of the models, and validation procedures, which may create bias in the implementation approaches. In this study, the deep learning classifier based on ENVINet5 (U-Net) architecture is demonstrated in the delineation of glacier boundaries along with snow/ice over the Bara Shigri glacier (Western Himalayas), Himachal Pradesh, India. Glacier monitoring with Landsat data takes the advantage of a long coverage period and finer spectral/spatial resolution with wide coverage on a larger scale. Moreover, deep learning utilizes the semantic segmentation network to extract glacier boundaries. Experimental outcomes confirm the effectiveness of deep learning (overall accuracy, 91.89% and Cohen's kappa coefficient, 0.8778) compared to the existing artificial neural network (ANN) model (overall accuracy, 88.38% and kappa coefficient, 0.8241) in generating accurate classified maps. This study is vital in the study of the cryosphere, hydrology, agriculture, climatology, and land-use/land-cover analysis.

TI  - Evaluation of remote sensing and modeled chlorophyll-α products of the Baltic Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Baltic Sea is an optically very complex study object for watercolor remote sensing because of the high quantity of colored dissolved organic matter, two optically distinct phytoplankton seasons, high variability in concentrations of optically active substances, and low sun angles. Despite this, there are numerous remote sensing and modeled chlorophyll-alpha (Chl-alpha) products publicly available for the Baltic Sea. Sixteen openly accessible Chl-a products were tested with 267 in situ Chl-a measurements that were carried out in Estonian marine waters during 2016 to 2021. All modeled products and about half of the remote sensing products failed to produce reliable results. The best-performing remote sensing Chl-alpha product was Case(2)/ Regional CoastColour produced from Sentinel-3 ocean and land color imager (OLCI) reflectance with R-2 = 0.55, root mean squared error oRMSETHORN = 4.5 mgm(-3), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 74%. In addition, eight different band ratio algorithms were applied on Sentinel(-3) OLCI and Sentinel(-2) multispectral instrument data. The best remote sensing band ratio algorithm was derived from top-of-atmosphere reflectance of Sentinel(-3) data using 665, 709, and 754 nm bands (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 3.9 mgm(-3), and MAPE = 63%). Our results show good suitability of Sentinel-3 for Chl-a retrieval. However, the high uncertainties suggest for the further product development and validation needs. (c) The Authors.

TI  - Assessment of Sentinel-2-MSI Atmospheric Correction Processors and In Situ Spectrometry Waters Quality Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The validation of algorithms developed from in situ reflectance to estimate water quality variables has the challenge of atmospheric correction (AC) when applied to satellite images. Estimating water quality variables from satellite images requires an accurate estimation of remote sensing reflectances (Rrs) which vary according to the AC applied. Validation processes for both Rrs and water quality algorithms were carried out, relating the in situ Rrs (convoluted to Sentinel-2-MSI spectral response function) with the satellite Rrs coming from different ACs (C2RCC, C2X, C2XC, and Polymer), and also relating the in situ water quality variable data with estimated water quality variable values, applying the water quality algorithms to the Rrs obtained for each AC. Regarding the Rrs validation results, the best ACs tested in this work were C2XC and Polymer. Regarding the water quality algorithm validation, the best results were also obtained using C2XC and Polymer Rrs. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the water quality algorithms developed from in situ reflectances since they are not specific to an AC and can be used with any processor.

TI  - Spatially Continuous Mapping of Forest Canopy Height in Canada by Combining GEDI and ICESat-2 with PALSAR and Sentinel
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous large-scale mapping of forest canopy height is crucial for estimating and reporting forest carbon content, analyzing forest degradation and restoration, or to model ecosystem variables such as aboveground biomass. Over the last years, the spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor specifically designed to acquire forest structure information, Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), has been used to extract forest canopy height information over large areas. Yet, GEDI has no spatial coverage for most forested areas in Canada and other high latitude regions. On the other hand, the spaceborne LiDAR called Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) provides a global coverage but was not specially developed to study forested ecosystems. Nonetheless, both spaceborne LiDAR sensors obtain point-based information, making spatially continuous forest canopy height estimation very challenging. This study compared the performance of both spaceborne LiDAR, GEDI and ICESat-2, combined with ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1 and -2 data to produce continuous canopy height maps in Canada for the year 2020. A set-aside dataset and airborne LiDAR (ALS) from a national LiDAR campaign were used for accuracy assessment. Both maps overestimated canopy height in relation to ALS data, but GEDI had a better performance than ICESat-2 with a mean difference (MD) of 0.9 m and 2.9 m, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.2 m and 5.2 m, respectively. However, as both GEDI and ALS have no coverage in most of the hemi-boreal forests, ICESat-2 captures the tall canopy heights expected for these forests better than GEDI. PALSAR-2 HV polarization was the most important covariate to predict canopy height, showing the great potential of L-band in comparison to C-band from Sentinel-1 or optical data from Sentinel-2. The approach proposed here can be used operationally to produce annual canopy height maps for areas that lack GEDI and ICESat-2 coverage.

TI  - Amphibian collapses increased malaria incidence in Central America *
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity in ecosystems plays an important role in supporting human welfare, including regulating the transmission of infectious diseases. Many of these services are not fully-appreciated due to complex environmental dynamics and lack of baseline data. Multicontinental amphibian decline due to the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) provides a stark example. Even though amphibians are known to affect natural food webs-including mosquitoes that transmit human diseases-the human health impacts connected to their massive decline have received little attention. Here we leverage a unique ensemble of ecological surveys, satellite data, and newly digitized public health records to show an empirical link between a wave of Bd-driven collapse of amphibians in Costa Rica and Panama and increased human malaria incidence. Subsequent to the estimated date of Bd-driven amphibian decline in each 'county' (canton or distrito), we find that malaria cases are significantly elevated for several years. For the six year peak of the estimated effect, the annual expected county-level increase in malaria ranges from 0.76 to 1.1 additional cases per 1000 population. This is a substantial increase given that cases country-wide per 1000 population peaked during the timeframe of our study at approximately 1.5 for Costa Rica and 1.1 for Panama. This previously unidentified impact of biodiversity loss illustrates the often hidden human welfare costs of conservation failures. These findings also show the importance of mitigating international trade-driven spread of similar emergent pathogens like Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans.

TI  - Geographically aware estimates of remotely sensed water properties for Chesapeake Bay
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed water properties are important for a variety of applications, including validation of Earth systems models (ESMs), habitat suitability models, and sea level rise projections. For the validation of next-generation, high or multi-resolution (30 to 60 km) ESMs in particular, the usefulness of operational forecasting products and directly observing satellite-based sensors for validation is limited due to their temporal availability and spatial resolution of < 1 year (in some cases) and > 30 km(2), respectively. To address this validation data gap, we developed a data-driven model to produce high-resolution (< 1 km(2)) estimates of temperature, salinity, and turbidity over decadal time scales as required by next-generation ESMs. Our model fits daily moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua reflectance data to surface observations (< 1 mdepth) from 2000-2021 in the Chesapeake Bay. The resulting models have similar error statistics as prior efforts of this type for salinity [root mean square error (RMSE): 2.3] and temperature (RMSE: 1.8 C). However, unlike prior efforts, our model is designed as a pipeline meaning that it has the advantage of producing predictions of water properties in future time periods as additional MODIS data becomes available. We also include novel geographically aware predictive features insofar as they capture geographic variation in the influence of flow and surface water exchange in upstream coastal watersheds.

TI  - Early-onset burdensome multimorbidity: an exploratory analysis of sentinel conditions, condition accrual sequence and duration of three long-term conditions using the 1970 British Cohort Study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The prevalence of multiple long-term condition (LTC) multimorbidity is increasing with younger onset among socioeconomically deprived populations. Research on life course trajectories towards multimorbidity is limited and early-onset multimorbidity poorly characterised. Understanding sentinel conditions (the first LTC occurring in the life course), the sequence of LTC accrual and the permanency of the reporting of LTCs may help identify time points for prevention efforts. We used a longitudinal birth cohort to estimate the prevalence of a common three-condition early-onset multimorbidity (multiple long-term condition multimorbidity (MLTC-M)) group at midlife, describe the frequency of sentinel conditions, the sequence of LTC accrual and explore the permanency of one of these conditions: psychological distress. Setting 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70). Participants 17 196 cohort members born in 1970. Outcome measures Prevalence of the most common three-condition multimorbidity group at age 46. The nature and timing of sentinel conditions, the sequencing patterns of subsequent LTC accrual and the permanency of the reporting of psychological distress. Results At age 46 high blood pressure, psychological distress and back pain were the most common three-condition MLTC-M group, (4.3%, n=370). A subgroup of 164 (44.3%) people provided complete information on LTC across all time points. Psychological distress measured by the Malaise Index was the most common sentinel condition, occurring in 25.0% (n=41), followed by back pain (22%, n=36). At age 26, 45.1% (75/164) reported their sentinel condition. The most common sequence of LTC accrual was the co-reporting of psychological distress and back pain followed by high blood pressure. Almost one-third (30.5%, n=50) reported a variation of psychological distress across the adult life course. Conclusion In these exploratory analyses, psychological distress and back pain were the most common sentinel conditions, and along with high blood pressure these three conditions represented the most common three-condition MLTC-M group. These analyses suggest that birth cohorts, like the BCS70, may usefully inform life course-multimorbidity research.

TI  - Multiplicative Long Short-Term Memory with Improved Mayfly Optimization for LULC Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) monitoring is crucial for global transformation, sustainable land control, urban planning, urban growth prediction, and the establishment of climate regulations for long-term development. Remote sensing images have become increasingly important in many environmental planning and land use surveys in recent times. LULC is evaluated in this research using the Sat 4, Sat 6, and Eurosat datasets. Various spectral feature bands are involved, but unexpectedly little consideration has been given to these characteristics in deep learning models. Due to the wide availability of RGB models in computer vision, this research mainly utilized RGB bands. Once the pre-processing is carried out for the images of the selected dataset, the hybrid feature extraction is performed using Haralick texture features, an oriented gradient histogram, a local Gabor binary pattern histogram sequence, and Harris Corner Detection to extract features from the images. After that, the Improved Mayfly Optimization (IMO) method is used to choose the optimal features. IMO-based feature selection algorithms have several advantages that include features such as a high learning rate and computational efficiency. After obtaining the optimal feature selection, the LULC classes are classified using a multi-class classifier known as the Multiplicative Long Short-Term Memory (mLSTM) network. The main functionality of the multiplicative LSTM classifier is to recall appropriate information for a comprehensive duration. In order to accomplish an improved result in LULC classification, a higher amount of remote sensing data should be processed. So, the simulation outcomes demonstrated that the proposed IMO-mLSTM efficiently classifies the LULC classes in terms of classification accuracy, recall, and precision. When compared with ConvNet and Alexnet, the proposed IMO-mLSTM method accomplished accuracies of 99.99% on Sat 4, 99.98% on Sat 6, and 98.52% on the Eurosat datasets.

TI  - An Examination of the Recent Stability of Ozonesonde Global Network Data
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent Assessment of Standard Operating Procedures for Ozonesondes 2.0 (WMO/GAW Report #268) addressed questions of homogeneity and long-term stability in global electrochemical concentration cell (ECC) ozone sounding network time series. Among its recommendations was adoption of a standard for evaluating data quality in ozonesonde time series. Total column ozone (TCO) derived from the sondes compared to TCO from Aura's Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) is a primary quality indicator. Comparisons of sonde ozone with Aura's Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) are used to assess the stability of stratospheric ozone. This paper provides a comprehensive examination of global ozonesonde network data stability and accuracy since 2004 in light of the sudden post-2013 TCO "dropoff" of similar to 3%-4% that was reported previously at select stations (Stauffer et al., 2020, ). Comparisons with Aura OMI TCO averaged across the network of 60 stations are stable within about +/- 2% over the past 18 years. Sonde TCO has similar stability compared to three other TCO satellite instruments, and the stratospheric ozone measurements average to within +/- 5% of MLS from 50 to 10 hPa. Thus, sonde data are reliable for trends, but with a caveat applied for a subset of dropoff stations in the tropics and subtropics. The dropoff is associated with only one of two major ECC instrument types. A detailed examination of ECC serial numbers pinpoints the timing of the dropoff. However, we find that overall, ozonesonde data are stable and accurate compared to independent measurements over the past two decades.Plain Language Summary Ozonesondes provide accurate ozone measurements from the surface to similar to 30-km altitude and are used as a reference for studies of satellite data, trends, pollution, and climate. Updated guidelines for sonde preparation and adoption of sonde total column ozone (TCO) comparisons with satellite TCO as a "data quality" reference were published in 2021 by the Assessment of Standard Operating Procedures for Ozonesondes (ASOPOS) 2.0 panel in WMO/GAW Report 268. We report the first application of the ASOPOS 2.0 protocol to TCO evaluation from the 60-station global ozonesonde network (42,042 profiles total). With Aura OMI TCO as the satellite reference (October 2004 to mid-2021), we find that TCO readings from the global ozonesonde network are remarkably stable, consistently within +/- 2% of the satellite. An exception occurs at only a small subset of tropical and subtropical locations that use one type of ozonesonde instrument. The latter result confirms our earlier report that a sudden TCO drop occurs at selected sites after 2013. The timing and magnitude of the dropoff are revisited. The hypothesis that ozonesonde production changes are a contributor remains, with station-specific factors possibly affecting the magnitude of the bias. Overall, global ozonesonde network data are of high quality and stability.

TI  - Measuring the Impact of Conservation: The Growing Importance of Monitoring Fauna, Flora and Funga
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Many stakeholders, from governments to civil society to businesses, lack the data they need to make informed decisions on biodiversity, jeopardising efforts to conserve, restore and sustainably manage nature. Here we review the importance of enhancing biodiversity monitoring, assess the challenges involved and identify potential solutions. Capacity for biodiversity monitoring needs to be enhanced urgently, especially in poorer, high-biodiversity countries where data gaps are disproportionately high. Modern tools and technologies, including remote sensing, bioacoustics and environmental DNA, should be used at larger scales to fill taxonomic and geographic data gaps, especially in the tropics, in marine and freshwater biomes, and for plants, fungi and invertebrates. Stakeholders need to follow best monitoring practices, adopting appropriate indicators and using counterfactual approaches to measure and attribute outcomes and impacts. Data should be made openly and freely available. Companies need to invest in collecting the data required to enhance sustainability in their operations and supply chains. With governments soon to commit to the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, the time is right to make a concerted push on monitoring. However, action at scale is needed now if we are to enhance results-based management adequately to conserve the biodiversity and ecosystem services we all depend on.

TI  - Monitoring Non-Linear Ground Motion above Underground Gas Storage Using GNSS and PSInSAR Based on Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several methods allow accurate measurement of terrain surface motions. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSSes) and interferometry with synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) stand out in terms of measurement accuracy among them. In principle, both methods make it possible to evaluate a three-dimensional vector of the motion of points on the terrain surface. In this work, we dealt with the evaluation of motions in the up-down (U-D) and east-west direction (E-W) over underground gas storage (UGS) from InSAR. One crucial step in breaking down PSInSAR line of sight (LOS) measurements to U-D and E-W components is getting time series derived from individual tracks to the same time frame. This is usually performed by interpolation, but we used an innovative approach: we analyzed individual time series using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), which is suitable for periodic noisy and irregularly sampled data; we selected the most significant period, created LSP models, and used them instead of the original time series. Then, it was possible to derive time series values for any arbitrary time step. To validate the results, we installed one GNSS receiver in the Tvrdonice UGS test area to perform independent measurements. The results show a good agreement in the evaluation of motions by both methods. The correlation coefficient between horizontal components from both PSInSAR and GNSS was 0.95 in the case of the E-W component, with an RMSE of 1.75 mm; for U-D they were 0.78 and 2.35 mm, respectively. In addition to comparing the motions in the U-D and E-W directions, we also created a comparison by converting GNSS measurements to a line of sight of the Sentinel-1 satellite to evaluate the conformity of InSAR and GNSS measurements. Based on descending track, the correlation coefficient between LOS from both methods is, on average, 0.97, with an RMSE of 2.70 mm.

TI  - HYDROLOGICAL IMROVEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECT OF TRANSFORMING HYDROLOGICAL ELEMENTS OF THE ESTUARINE FLUCTUATION ZONE
T2  - Acta Hydrobiologica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuarine fluctuation zone is the key area for pollutant reduction in tributaries in reservoir. Affected by runoff scouring, river channel downcutting is a common problem in estuarine fluctuation zone, which makes the low purification efficiency of the runoff. Aimed at the weak ability of pollutant reduction of the estuarine fluctuation zone, the technology of improving purification efficiency by transforming hydrological elements with multi-stage submerged dam, which can form a surface flow constructed wetland, was proposed. The estuarine fluctuation zone of the Bajia River in the Biliuhe Reservoir was taken as a case study in this paper. By comparing the water quality and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), acquired through on-site monitoring and satellite imagery of Sentinel-2A and the situation before and after the construction, the influence of the project was analyzed. The water surface area and the water level as well as the hydraulic retention time in the estuary were all effectively improved. With the change of hydrological elements, the emergent plants grew well without human intervention, while the vegetation on the floodplain was significantly improved due to the increase of underground water level. Due to the influence of flooding, the pollutants on the land were released. The precipitation of the original pollutants in the flooded area has a significant impact on wetland water quality. The maximum removal rates of TN and NH3--N reached 72.61% and 75.95% in July 2020, while those in October 2019 were 22.06% and 27.95%, respectively. As a whole, the removal rates were good in surface flow constructed wetlands in China, while the improvement of TP and NH3-N removal efficiencies was not obvious, which may be caused by the precipitation of original pollutants. The hydrological elements transformation technology can effectively improve the purification capacity of the estuarine fluctuation zone and promote the reduction of pollutants in the basin.

TI  - Updating Inventory, Deformation, and Development Characteristics of Landslides in Hunza Valley, NW Karakoram, Pakistan by SBAS-InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hunza Valley, in the northwestern Karakoram Mountains, North Pakistan, is a typical region with many towns and villages, and a dense population and is prone to landslides. The present study completed landslide identification, updating a comprehensive landslide inventory and analysis. First, the ground surface deformation was detected in the Hunza Valley by SBAS-InSAR from ascending and descending datasets, respectively. Then, the locations and boundaries were interpreted and delineated, and a comprehensive inventory of 118 landslides, including the 53 most recent InSAR identified active landslides and 65 landslides cited from the literature, was completed. This study firstly named all 118 landslides, considering the demand for globally intensive research and hazard mitigation. Finally, the deformation, spatial-topographic development, and distribution characteristics in the Hunza Valley scale and three large significant landslides were analyzed. Information on 72 reported landslides was used to construct an empirical power law relationship linking landslide area (A(L)) to volume (V-L) (V-L = 0.067 x A(L)(1.351)), and this formula predicted the volume of 118 landslides in this study. We discovered that the landslides from the literature, which were interpreted from optical images, had lower levels of velocity, area, elevation, and height. The SBAS-InSAR-detected active landslide was characterized by higher velocity, larger area, higher elevation, larger slope gradient, larger NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), and greater height. The melting glacier water and rainfall infiltration from cracks on the landslide's upper part may promote the action of a push from gravity on the upper part. Simultaneously, the coupling of actions from river erosion and active tectonics could have an impact on the stability of the slope toe. The up-to-date comprehensive identification and understanding of the characteristics and mechanism of landslide development in this study provide a reference for the next step in landslide disaster prevention and risk assessment.

TI  - Forest Carbon Flux Simulation Using Multi-Source Data and Incorporation of Remotely Sensed Model with Process-Based Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest carbon flux is critical to climate change, and the accurate modeling of forest carbon flux is an extremely challenging task. The remote sensing model (the MODIS MOD_17 gross primary productivity (GPP) model (MOD_17)) has strong practicability and is widely used around the world. The ecological process (the Biome-BioGeochemical Cycles Multilayer Soil Module model (Biome-BGCMuSo)) model can describe most of the vegetation's environmental and physiological processes on fine time scales. Nevertheless, complex parameters and calibrations pose challenges to the application and development of models. In this study, we optimized all the input parameters of the MOD_17 model for the calibration of the Biome-BGCMuSo model to obtain GPP with continuous spatiality. To determine the contribution of input parameters to the GPP of different forest types, an Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST) was performed on the Biome-BGCMuSo model firstly. Then, we selected the sample points of each forest type and its different ecological gradients (30 for each type), using the GPP simulation value of the optimized MOD_17 model corresponding to the time and space scale to calibrate the Biome-BGCMuSo model, to drive the calibrated Biome-BGCMuSo, and we simulated the different forest types' net primary productivity (NPP). According to dendrochronological measurements, the NPP simulation results were verified on the whole regional scale. The results showed that the GPP values of different forest types were highly sensitive to C:N-leaf (C:N of leaf), SLA1 (canopy average specific leaf area in phenological phase 1), and FLNR (fraction of leaf N in Rubisco). The coefficient of determination (R-2) between the simulated forest NPP and the measured NPP was 0.64, and the root-mean-square (RMSE) was 26.55 g/C/m(2)/year. Our study aims to reduce uncertainty in forest carbon fluxes simulated by the Biome-BGCMuSo model, providing feedback for understanding forest ecosystem carbon cycling, vegetation productivity, and climate change.

TI  - Delineation and evaluation of the captive limestone mining area change and its influence on the environment using multispectral satellite images for industrial long-term sustainability
T2  - CLEANER ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamics in Limestone mining sites are usually subjected to spatiotemporal land cover change, which has a long-term impact on the land and environment. The objectives of this article are mapping demarcation, and transformation assessment of active captive limestone mines and their impact assessment on the environment at the Yerraguntla cement industrial region in YSR Kadapa district, Andhra Pradesh, India from the year 2006-2019 using Remote Sensing & Geographical Information System (RS&GIS). In this research work, first, the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) is computed, second NDVI image is resampled using NDVI threshold values, and the Nearest-Neighbor sampling method uses the QGIS raster calculator, which produces the mines area of 469.92 ha with Sentinel-2A MSI and 555.39 ha with Landsat-8(OLI) which is evaluated with delineated high resolution (similar to 1m/pixels) Google Earth image (486.47 ha) from Google Earth Pro (freeware) and industry reports (487.10 ha) in 2019. Third active mines are demarcated using NDVI breakpoints. Results found that the limestone Mining area increased by 206.10% from 2006 to 2019, with Producer's Accuracy (PA), User's Accuracy (UA), and Kappa coefficients of 98.82%, 92.79%, and 0.92 in 2019, and 96.74%, 85.17 %t, and 0.82 in 2006. The compatibility between Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A NDVI images is determined with Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.84 in 2019. In 2019, a linear negative Regression slope was revealed between NDVI & LST with a Correlation coefficient of 0.248, indicating negative environmental influences and vegetation control on LST. This research will aid industry and environmental engineers in comprehending the effects of limestone mine changes on LST and proposing an environmentally acceptable land-environmental management plan for long-term sustainability.

TI  - Road Network Extraction from SAR Images with the Support of Angular Texture Signature and POIs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban road network information is an important part of modern spatial information infrastructure and is crucial for high-precision navigation map production and unmanned driving. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a widely used remote-sensing data source, but the complex structure of road networks and the noises in images make it very difficult to extract road information through SAR images. We developed a new method of extracting road network information from SAR images by considering angular (A) and texture (T) features in the sliding windows and points of interest (POIs, or P), and we named this method ATP-ROAD. ATP-ROAD is a sliding window-based semi-automatic approach that uses the grayscale mean, grayscale variance, and binary segmentation information of SAR images as texture features in each sliding window. Since POIs have much-duplicated information, this study also eliminates duplicated POIs considering distance and then selects a combination of POI linkages by discerning the direction of these POIs to initially determine the road direction. The ATP-ROAD method was applied to three experimental areas in Shanghai to extract the road network using China's Gaofen-3 imagery. The experimental results show that the extracted road network information is relatively complete and matches the actual road conditions, and the result accuracy is high in the three different regions, i.e., 89.57% for Area-I, 96.88% for Area-II, and 92.65% for Area-III. Our method together with our extraction software can be applied to extract information about road networks from SAR images, providing an alternative for enriching the variety of road information.

TI  - A Method to Estimate Clear-Sky Albedo of Paddy Rice Fields
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a major crop type in the global agroecosystem, paddy rice fields contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions. Surface albedo plays a vital role in estimating carbon emissions. However, it is difficult to find a broadband albedo estimation over paddy rice fields. The objective of this study was to derive an applicable method to improve albedo estimation over a paddy rice field. Field multiangle reflectance and surface albedo were collected throughout the growing season. A physically based model (AMBRALS) was utilized to reconstruct the directional reflectance into the spectral albedo. Multiple spectral albedos (at the wavelengths of 470, 550, 660, 850, 1243, 1640 and 2151 nm) were calculated, and new narrowband to broadband conversion coefficients were derived between the observed spectral albedo and broadband albedo. The conversion schemes showed high consistency with the field albedo observations in the shortwave (285-3000 nm), infrared (700-3000 nm), and visible (400-700 nm) bands. This method can help improve albedo estimation in partially submerged environments.

TI  - Remote sensing of optical properties of smoke aerosols: simulation experiment and application based on spaceborne data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring the microscopic and macroscopic optical properties of smoke aerosols is important in column concentration retrieval by remote sensing for environmental monitoring. Based on the radiation transfer theory, we constructed a physical model to correlate microscopic and macroscopic optical properties of smoke aerosols. According to the experiment, the mass extinction coefficient and mass angular scattering coefficient of smoke aerosols in the visiblenear infrared (400 to 2400 nm) show the strongest extinction and scattering effects on the visible light, which are negatively correlated with wavelength. They were applied to smoke column concentration retrieval based on Landsat8/operational land imager and MODIS images by the established model. Then the optimal bands for smoke detection were analyzed. It indicates that the surface underlying the smoke has impact on the optimal band of smoke detection, and redlight band is optimal for vegetation background.

TI  - Analysis of the Impact of Landscape Patterns on Urban Heat Islands: A Case Study of Chengdu, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The urbanization process, such as population growth and the expansion of roads, railways, residential areas, and industrial areas, causes severe landscape fragmentation and changes in the surface temperature balance, resulting in the heat island effect. This study used Landsat data to study the impact of landscape patterns on urban heat islands (UHIs) and temporal-spatial change characteristics. In addition, spatial correlation analysis was employed to detect the relationships between land surface temperature (LST) and landscape patterns. The results showed that the impervious surfaces landscape area increased significantly, and the Woodland landscape area increased. However, the bare land, cropland, and water body area decreased. The cohesion of cropland and woodland landscape in the suburb decreased, and there was a high degree of fragmentation. The difference between the contributions of the central city and suburbs to the whole region is narrowing, and the expansion of urban heat islands is shifting from the central city to the suburbs. The percentage of landscape index (PLAND) and the patch cohesion index (COHESION) of woodland, water body, and cropland were negatively correlated with LST. Meanwhile, the PLAND and COHESION of impervious surface and bare land were positively correlated with LST, and the splitting index (SPLIT) was the opposite of the PLAND and COHESION. The fragmentation of impervious surfaces and bare land landscapes reduces the UHI effect. Based on these results, countermeasures to mitigate the heat island effect are proposed. These measures will play an essential role in improving urban ecology and the environmental quality of human settlements.

TI  - Exploring the Impacts of Data Source, Model Types and Spatial Scales on the Soil Organic Carbon Prediction: A Case Study in the Red Soil Hilly Region of Southern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate mapping of soil organic carbon (SOC) is of great significance to understanding the spatial patterns of soil fertility and conducting soil carbon cycle research. Previous studies have dedicated considerable efforts to the spatial prediction of SOC content, but few have systematically quantified the effects of environmental covariates selection, the spatial scales and the model types on SOC prediction accuracy. Here, we spatially predicted SOC content through digital soil mapping (DSM) based on 186 topsoil (0-20 cm) samples in a typical hilly red soil region of southern China. Specifically, we first determined an optimal covariate set from different combinations of multiple environmental variables, including multi-sensor remote sensing images (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2), climate variables and DEM derivatives. Furthermore, we evaluated the impacts of spatial resolution (10 m, 30 m, 90 m, 250 m and 1000 m) of covariates and the model types (three linear and three non-linear machine learning techniques) on the SOC prediction. The results of the performance analysis showed that a combination of Sentinel-1/2-derived variables, climate and topographic predictors generated the best predictive performance. Among all variables, remote sensing covariates, especially Sentinel-2-derived predictors, were identified as the most important explanatory variables controlling the variability of SOC content. Moreover, the prediction accuracy declined significantly with the increased spatial scales and achieved the highest using the XGBoost model at 10 m resolution. Notably, non-linear machine learners yielded superior predictive capability in contrast with linear models in predicting SOC. Overall, our findings revealed that the optimal combination of predictor variables, spatial resolution and modeling techniques could considerably improve the prediction accuracy of the SOC content. Particularly, freely accessible Sentinel series satellites showed great potential in high-resolution digital mapping of soil properties.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Database of Health Insurance Claims and Specific Health Checkups of Japan (NDB) Open Data Japan is helpful for attaining simple and comprehensive understanding of medical care in Japan. Herein, we investigated the transition of anti-HIV-drug use in Japan over a 4-year period from fiscal year (FY) 2016 to FY 2019 using data on anti-HIV drugs that were extracted from the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th NDB Open Data Japan. Then, the data were stratified by mechanism of action, single-tablet regimen (STR) or non-STR, age groups, and sex and analyzed. Throughout the study period, the prescription volume for tenofovir alafenamide fumarate as the backbone drug and integrase strand transfer inhibitors as the anchor drug increased. In FY 2019, STRs constituted approximately 44% of the total combination antiretroviral therapy regimens, 1.6 times higher than that in FY 2016 (27%). With the advent of newer drugs and regimens, the differences in anti-HIV drugs prescribed to patients of different ages and sex gradually diminished; however, differences were unremarkable in the first period, especially between sexes. The NDB Open Data Japan made it relatively easy to evaluate recent trends in anti-HIV prescription in Japan, indicating its usefulness for continuous surveys in this field.

TI  - Impact of Land Cover Change on a Typical Mining Region and Its Ecological Environment Quality Evaluation Using Remote Sensing Based Ecological Index (RSEI)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological environment in mining cities has become an important part of ecological construction. This paper takes Tongling, a mining city, as the research area, and uses Landsat series remote sensing images from 2000 to 2020 as data sources. Using the principal component analysis method and the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) integrated with four indexes of greenness, humidity, dryness, and heat, the ecological disturbance of the mining area was evaluated and studied. Meanwhile, the land cover spatiotemporal classification of Tongling city was extracted by the maximum likelihood method. Furthermore, landscape metrics were used, based on the information on open-pit mining areas, to quantitatively analyze the ecological environment quality and its change characteristics in the study area. The results show that (1) RSEI can better characterize the ecological quality of Tongling city, greenness and humidity are positively correlated with it, dryness and heat are negatively correlated with it, and dryness and RSEI have the highest correlation coefficient, indicating that urban expansion will cause ecological environment deterioration to a certain extent. (2) The ecological environment quality of the research area showed a "decline-rising" trend, and the mean value of RSEI decreased from 0.706 to 0.644. Spatially, the areas with poor RSEI are mainly distributed in the central urban area and the open-pit mining area in the south. (3) Land cover change leads to changes in landscape metrics, and most landscape-level metrics are positively or negatively correlated with RSEI. The more concentrated the land cover type distribution is, the smaller the change is, and the more regional RSEI can be improved. (4) The mean value of RESI of the ten open-pit mining areas in Tongling city decreased significantly, with a maximum decrease of 52.73%. Among them, the RESI decline rate in the area around the no.1 open pit mine is 0.034/year. The ecological degradation in Tongling city is attributed to the rapid expansion of built-up areas and the development of the mining industry. The research results can provide a scientific basis for protecting the ecological environment of mining cities.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hetao Plain and Xing'an League are the major cultivated areas and main grain-producing areas in Inner Mongolia, and their crop planting structure significantly affects the grain output and economic development in Northern China. Timely and accurate identification, extraction, and analysis of typical crops in Xing'an League and Hetao Plain can provide scientific guidance and decision support for crop planting structure research and food security in ecological barrier areas in Northern China. The pixel samples and the neighborhood information were fused to generate a spectral spatial dataset based on single-phase Sentinel-2 images. Skcnn_Tabnet, a typical crop remote sensing classification model, was built at the pixel scale by adding the channel attention mechanism, and the corn, sunflower, and rice in the Hetao Plain were quickly identified and studied. The results of this study suggest that the model exhibits high crop recognition ability, and the overall accuracy of the three crops is 0.9270, which is 0.1121, 0.1004, and 0.0874 higher than the Deeplabv3+, UNet, and RF methods, respectively. This study confirms the feasibility of the deep learning model in the application research of large-scale crop classification and mapping and provides a technical reference for achieving the automatic national crop census.

TI  - Winter Wheat Lodging Area Extraction Using Deep Learning with GaoFen-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The timely and accurate detection of wheat lodging at a large scale is necessary for loss assessments in agricultural insurance claims. Most existing deep-learning-based methods of wheat lodging detection use data from unmanned aerial vehicles, rendering monitoring wheat lodging at a large scale difficult. Meanwhile, the edge feature is not accurately extracted. In this study, a semantic segmentation network model called the pyramid transposed convolution network (PTCNet) was proposed for large-scale wheat lodging extraction and detection using GaoFen-2 satellite images with high spatial resolutions. Multi-scale high-level features were combined with low-level features to improve the segmentation's accuracy and to enhance the extraction sensitivity of wheat lodging areas in the proposed model. In addition, four types of vegetation indices and three types of edge features were added into the network and compared to the increment in the segmentation's accuracy. The F1 score and the intersection over union of wheat lodging extraction reached 85.31% and 74.38% by PTCNet, respectively, outperforming other compared benchmarks, i.e., SegNet, PSPNet, FPN, and DeepLabv3+ networks. PTCNet can achieve accurate and large-scale extraction of wheat lodging, which is significant in the fields of loss assessment and agricultural insurance claims.

TI  - Analysis of Floating Macroalgae Distribution around Japan Using Global Change Observation Mission-Climate/Second-Generation Global Imager Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Floating macroalgae information is required to manage coastal environments and fishery resources effectively. In situ observations and analyses can result in under-sampling, thereby challenging the comprehension of the floating macroalgae abundance and spatiotemporal alterations. This study reports the spatiotemporal variation of floating macroalgae distribution around Japan from 2018 to 2021 using Global Change Observation Mission-Climate/second-generation Global Imager data. We employed the floating algae index (FAI) scaled from local ocean FAI to minimize the effect of spatial variation in ocean color. Fractional macroalgae coverage in a pixel was determined using a linear unmixing algorithm with lower and upper thresholds. The lower threshold was determined using the cumulative frequency of the scaled FAI, and the upper threshold was modified based on the more precise Sentinel-2 data. The results revealed that monthly macroalgae coverage varies spatially and seasonally, peaking in the spring and summer in the southwestern area. The macroalgae distribution particularly expanded from the East China Sea to west Japan during spring. In 2018-2021, the total biomass of the offshore floating macroalgae was estimated to be 8880-133,790, 8460-141,900, 3910-70,380, and 4620-61,870 tons. The findings of this study validated the empirical knowledge about specific locations and can serve as a reference to analyze temporal and spatial variations in future studies.

TI  - Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Chinese Inland Water Clarity at Multiple Spatial Scales between 1984 and 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity (Secchi disk depth, SDD) provides a sensitive tool to examine the spatial pattern and historical trend in lakes' trophic status. However, this metric has been insufficiently explored despite the availability of remotely-sensed data. Based on the published SDD datasets derived from Landsat images, we analyzed the spatial and inter-annual variations in water clarity and examined the impact of natural and anthropogenic factors on these trends at multiple scales, i.e., five lake regions, provinces, and watersheds. Lake clarity was lowest in Northeast (0.60 +/- 0.09 m) and East China (1.23 +/- 0.17 m) and highest in the Tibet Plateau (3.32 +/- 0.38 m). Over the past 35 years, we found a significant trend of increased SDD in 18 (out of 32) provinces (only Yunnan province exhibited a significant decreasing trend) and in 77 (out of 155) watersheds (only 5 watersheds showed a significant decreasing trend). Lakes in eastern-northeastern China exhibited a higher probability of decreasing trend, while the trend was inverse for lakes in the Tibet-Qinghai region. The results of water clarity interannual change trends showed they were closely related to the spatial scale of analysis. At the watershed level, these trends were mainly driven by anthropogenic factors, with night-time brightness (13.84%), agricultural fertilizer use (11.17%), and wastewater (9.64%) being the most important. Natural factors (temperature, wind, and NDVI) explained about 18.2% of the SDD variance. Our findings for the SDD spatio-temporal trend provide valuable information for guiding water protection management policy-making and reinforcement in China.

TI  - Flash Flood Susceptibility Assessment and Zonation by Integrating Analytic Hierarchy Process and Frequency Ratio Model with Diverse Spatial Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash floods are the most dangerous kinds of floods because they combine the destructive power of a flood with incredible speed. They occur when heavy rainfall exceeds the ability of the ground to absorb it. The main aim of this study is to generate flash flood maps using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Frequency Ratio (FR) models in the river's floodplain between the Jhelum River and Chenab rivers. A total of eight flash flood-causative physical parameters are considered for this study. Six parameters are based on remote sensing images of the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS), Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and Sentinel-2 Satellite, which include slope, elevation, distance from the stream, drainage density, flow accumulation, and land use/land cover (LULC), respectively. The other two parameters are soil and geology, which consist of different rock and soil formations, respectively. In the case of AHP, each of the criteria is allotted an estimated weight according to its significant importance in the occurrence of flash floods. In the end, all the parameters were integrated using weighted overlay analysis in which the influence value of drainage density was given the highest weight. The analysis shows that a distance of 2500 m from the river has values of FR ranging from 0.54, 0.56, 1.21, 1.26, and 0.48, respectively. The output zones were categorized into very low, low, moderate, high, and very high risk, covering 7354, 5147, 3665, 2592, and 1343 km(2), respectively. Finally, the results show that the very high flood areas cover 1343 km(2), or 6.68% of the total area. The Mangla, Marala, and Trimmu valleys were identified as high-risk zones of the study area, which have been damaged drastically many times by flash floods. It provides policy guidelines for risk managers, emergency and disaster response services, urban and infrastructure planners, hydrologists, and climate scientists.

TI  - Remote Sensing on Alfalfa as an Approach to Optimize Production Outcomes: A Review of Evidence and Directions for Future Assessments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is one of the most relevant forage crops due to its importance for livestock. Timely harvesting is critical to secure adequate forage quality. However, farmers face challenges not only to decide the optimal harvesting time but to predict the optimum levels for both forage production and quality. Fortunately, remote sensing technologies can significantly contribute to obtaining production and quality insights, providing scalability, and supporting complex farming decision-making. Therefore, we aim to develop a systematic review of the current scientific literature to identify the current status of research in remote sensing for alfalfa and to evaluate new perspectives for enhancing prediction of both biomass and quality (herein defined as crude protein and fibers) for alfalfa. Twelve papers were included in the database from a total of 198 studies included in the initial screening process. The main findings were (i) more than two-thirds of the studies focused on predicting biomass; (ii) half of the studies used terrestrial platforms, with only 33% using drones and 17% using satellite for remote sensing; (iii) no studies have used satellites assessed alfalfa quality traits; (iv) improved biomass and quality estimations were obtained when remote sensing data was combined with environmental information; (v) due to a direct relationship between biomass and quality, modeling them algorithmically improves the accuracy of estimation as well; (vi) from spectral wavelengths, dry biomass was better estimated in regions near 398, 551, 670, 730, 780, 865, and 1077 nm, wet biomass in regions near 478, 631, 670, 730, 780, 834, 933, 1034, and 1538 nm, and quality traits identified with narrow and very specific wavelengths (e.g., 398, 461, 551, 667, 712, and 1077 nm). Our findings might serve as a foundation to guide further research and the development of handheld sensors for assessing alfalfa biomass and quality.

TI  - Recommendations to enhance breeding bird diversity in managed plantation forests determined using LiDAR
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread afforestation is a crucial component of climate mitigation strategies worldwide. This presents a significant opportunity for biodiversity conservation if forests are appropriately managed. Within forests, structural and habitat diversity are known to be critical for biodiversity but pragmatic management recommendations are lacking. We make a comprehensive assessment of the effects of habitat variables on bird populations using data from over 4000 ha of forested landscape. We combine high-resolution remote sensing data with comprehensive management databases to classify habitat attributes and measure the response of six taxonomic and functional diversity metrics: species richness, Shannon diversity, functional richness, functional evenness, functional divergence, and functional dispersion. We use a novel approach that combines hierarchical partitioning analysis with linear models to determine the relative importance of different habitat variables for each bird diversity metric. The age class of forest stands was consistently the most important variable across all bird diversity metrics, outperforming other structural measures such as horizontal and vertical heterogeneity and canopy density. Shrub density and gap fraction were each significantly associated with one bird diversity metric. In contrast, variables describing within-stand structural heterogeneity (vertical and horizontal) were generally less important while tree species identity (e.g., conifer or broadleaved) was not significant for any bird diversity metric. Each of the six bird diversity metrics had different patterns of independent variable importance and significance, emphasizing the need to consider multiple diversity metrics in biodiversity assessments. Similarly, the optimal resolution for remote sensing metrics varied between structural variables and bird diversity metrics, suggesting that the use of remote sensing data in biodiversity studies could be greatly improved by first exploring different resolutions and data aggregations. Based on the results from this comprehensive study, we recommend that managers focus on creating habitat diversity at the between-, rather than exclusively within-stand scale, such as by creating a matrix of different age classes, to maximize bird diversity. This recommendation for forest managers is powerful yet pragmatic in its simplicity.

TI  - Improved Landscape Expansion Index and Its Application to Urban Growth in Urumqi
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic determination of quantitative parameters describing the pattern of urban expansion is extremely important for urban planning, urban management and civic resource configuration. Though the widely adopted LEI (landscape expansion index) has exhibited the potential to capture the evolution of urban landscape patterns using multi-temporal remote sensing data, erroneous determination still exists, especially for patches with special shapes due to the limited consideration of spatial relationships among patches. In this paper, we improve the identification of urban landscape expansion patterns with an enhancement of the topological relationship. We propose MCI (Mean patch Compactness Index) and AWCI (Area-Weighted Compactness Index) in terms of the moment of inertia shape index. The effectiveness of the improved approach in identifying types of expansion patches is theoretically demonstrated with a series of designed experiments. Further, we apply the proposed approaches to the analysis of urban expansion features and dynamics of urban compactness over Urumqi at various 5-year stages using available SUBAD-China data from 1990-2015. The results achieved by the theoretical experiments and case application show our approach effectively suppressed the effects induced by shapes of patches and buffer or envelope box parameters for the accurate identification of patch type. Moreover, the modified MCI and AWCI exhibited an improved potential in capturing the landscape scale compactness of urban dynamics. The investigated 25-year urban expansion of Urumqi is dominated by edge-expansion patches and supplemented by outlying growth, with opposite trends of increasing and decreasing, with a gradual decrease in landscape fragmentation. Our examination using the proposed MCI and AWCI indicates Urumqi was growing more compact in latter 15-year period compared with the first 10 years studied, with the primary urban patches tending to be compacted earlier than the entire urban setting. The historical transformation trajectories based on remote sensing data show a significant construction land gain-from 1.06% in 1990 to 6.96% in 2015-due to 289.16 km(2) of recently established construction, accompanied by fast expansion northward, less dynamic expansion southward, and earlier extension in the westward direction than eastward. This work provides a possible means to improve the identification of patch expansion type and further understand the compactness of urban dynamics.

TI  - Actualities in the Morphology and Immunohistochemistry of Cutaneous and Ocular Melanoma: What Lies Ahead? A Single-Centre Study
T2  - BIOMEDICINES
M3  - Article
AB  - Melanoma is the most aggressive melanocytic tumor whose incidence is continuously increasing worldwide. Methods: We highlight the morphological, immunohistochemistry, and particularities of various melanoma types based on the cases diagnosed in our department from 2017 to 2021. Results: We present 100 melanoma cases and one capsular nevus case. The most common type was nodular melanoma. The immunohistochemistry markers used were SRY-box transcription factor 10 (SOX10), S100 protein, human melanoma black 45 (HMB45), and melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1 (Melan-A). Uveal melanoma and conjunctival melanoma represent particular tumors with independent prognostic factors. Uveal melanoma requires assessment of macrophages, microvascularisation, and mitoses. Sentinel lymph node metastases are essential targets that provide staging tools. Conjunctival melanoma and capsular nevi are diagnostic pitfalls. Conclusion: Melanoma can appear in various forms, and sometimes the diagnosis might be unclear. Today, immunohistochemistry remains the most important tool in confirming the diagnosis and prognosis for this type of neoplasia.

TI  - Shear wave elastography as a supplemental tool in the assessment of unsuspicious axillary lymph nodes in patients undergoing breast ultrasound examination
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To define reference values for shear wave elastography (SWE) in unsuspicious axillary lymph nodes in patients undergoing breast ultrasound exam-ination.Methods: In total, 177 clinically and sonographically unsuspicious axillary lymph nodes were prospectively evaluated with SWE using Virtual Touch Tissue Imaging Quantification (VTIQ) in 175 women. Mean values of tissue stiffness for axillary fatty tissue, lymph node cortex, and lymph node hilus were measured. Addition-ally, test-retest reliability of SWE in the assessment of axillary lymph node stiffness was evaluated by repeating each measurement three times. Results: In 177 axillary lymph nodes, the mean stiffness of lymph node cortex, hilus, and surrounding fatty tissue as quantified by SWE was 1.90 m/s (SD: 0.34 m/s), 2.02 m/s (SD: 0.37 m/s), and 1.75 m/s (SD: 0.38 m/s), respectively. The mean stiffness of cortex and hilus was significantly higher compared to fatty tissue (p < 0.0001). SWE demonstrated good test-retest reliability in the assess-ment of stiffness of the lymph node hilus, cortex, and the surrounding fatty tissue with an intraclass correlation of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.75; 0.83), 0.75 (95% CI: 0.70; 0.79), and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74; 0.82), respectively, (p < 0.0001).Conclusions: Reference values for SWE in unsuspicious axillary lymph nodes are determined. These results may help to better identify axillary lymph node metastasis for breast cancer patients when combined with other lymph node features. SWE is a reliable method for the objective quantification of tissue stiffness of axillary lymph nodes.Advances in knowledge: This study presents physiolog-ical reference values for tissue stiffness by examining the axillary lymph nodes with SWE in 175 women with sono-morphologically unsuspicious lymph nodes.

TI  - Geo3o1: a tool for 3D georeferencing accuracy assessment of tri-stereo images by state-of-the-art sensor dependent orientation model
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We subjected a tool for 3D georeferencing accuracy assessment of tri-stereo primary images of Pleiades 1A/1B/Neo, SPOT 6/7, and Gokturk-1, developed in the MATLAB environment considering their private sensor-dependent orientation model. Although the orientation model has been developed by the image vendors, the major contribution of Geo3o1 was the two-step adjustment process. The basic stages of estimating the 3D georeferencing accuracy were (i) estimating the direct georeferencing accuracy by raw orientation parameters, (ii) preadjustment of look angles using ground control points (GCPs), and (iii) bundle adjustment. In addition, the efficiency and validation of exterior orientation parameters and also the correlation among interior and exterior orientation parameters could be analyzed. Geo3o1 has the capability of handling the images in stereo or tri-stereo modes. The case study has been carried out by the Pleiades 1A panchromatic tri-stereo primary images with 50-cm geometric resolution. About 90 points were used as GCPs/ICPs in two distribution scenarios. The accuracy on ground was estimated centimeter level at GCPs whereas the accuracy was naturally coarser at ICPs at similar to +/- 1 GSD. The efficiency and validation of exterior orientation parameters and the correlations were also shown by two samples. The research was carried out over an undulating, mountainous area in Zonguldak, Turkiye. (c) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Characterization of Volcanic Cloud Components Using Machine Learning Techniques and SEVIRI Infrared Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic explosive eruptions inject several different types of particles and gasses into the atmosphere, giving rise to the formation and propagation of volcanic clouds. These can pose a serious threat to the health of people living near an active volcano and cause damage to air traffic. Many efforts have been devoted to monitor and characterize volcanic clouds. Satellite infrared (IR) sensors have been shown to be well suitable for volcanic cloud monitoring tasks. Here, a machine learning (ML) approach was developed in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to detect a volcanic cloud and to classify its main components using satellite infrared images. We implemented a supervised support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to segment a combination of thermal infrared (TIR) bands acquired by the geostationary MSG-SEVIRI (Meteosat Second Generation-Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager). This ML algorithm was applied to some of the paroxysmal explosive events that occurred at Mt. Etna between 2020 and 2022. We found that the ML approach using a combination of TIR bands from the geostationary satellite is very efficient, achieving an accuracy of 0.86, being able to properly detect, track and map automatically volcanic ash clouds in near real-time.

TI  - A Review of Spectral Indices for Mangrove Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems provide critical goods and ecosystem services to coastal communities and contribute to climate change mitigation. Over four decades, remote sensing has proved its usefulness in monitoring mangrove ecosystems on a broad scale, over time, and at a lower cost than field observation. The increasing use of spectral indices has led to an expansion of the geographical context of mangrove studies from local-scale studies to intercontinental and global analyses over the past 20 years. In remote sensing, numerous spectral indices derived from multiple spectral bands of remotely sensed data have been developed and used for multiple studies on mangroves. In this paper, we review the range of spectral indices produced and utilised in mangrove remote sensing between 1996 and 2021. Our findings reveal that spectral indices have been used for a variety of mangrove aspects but excluded identification of mangrove species. The included aspects are mangrove extent, distribution, mangrove above ground parameters (e.g., carbon density, biomass, canopy height, and estimations of LAI), and changes to the aforementioned aspects over time. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was found to be the most widely applied index in mangroves, used in 82% of the studies reviewed, followed by the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) used in 28% of the studies. Development and application of potential indices for mangrove cover characterisation has increased (currently 6 indices are published), but NDVI remains the most popular index for mangrove remote sensing. Ultimately, we identify the limitations and gaps of current studies and suggest some future directions under the topic of spectral index application in connection to time series imagery and the fusion of optical sensors for mangrove studies in the digital era.

TI  - ACCURACY PERFORMANCE OF SATELLITE-DERIVED SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE PRODUCTS FOR THE INDONESIAN SEAS
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA TECHNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The precision of sea surface temperature (SST) from remote sensing data is essential to recognize SST fluctuations prompted by extreme weather conditions due to global climate warming, such as tropical cyclones (TCs). Since 1981 the active remote sensing of satellite-based SST measurements has been around and proliferating to date in Indonesia. However, there has not been much research on the validation of several remote sensing datasets in Indonesia's seas that has limited coverage of buoy observations. Moreover, no studies correspond to which data are the most precise in describing SST fluctuations in tropical storms. In this study, six remote sensing/satellite (Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA), Regional Australian Multi-Sensor SST Analysis (RAMSSA), Global Australian Multi-Sensor SST Analysis (GAMSA), Microwave Infrared Optimally Interpolated (MWIROI), Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution (MUR), and K10) data are validated and compared to analyze SST fluctuations in TC as a case study. The validation method uses the Haversine distance formula to reach the highest quality iQuam data with satellite data. The comparison analysis is performed by plotting the SST and wind slop in a TC area. Based on the validation, The OSTIA, RAMSSA, GAMSSA, and MWIROI datasets ranked in the top 4 of the smallest RMSEs with values < 0.5. Moreover, in the SST and wind slop in a TC area, TC affects SST cooling as detected in the MUR and K10 datasets where there is a decrease of > 2 oC. In the MWIROI, the decline is more noticeable significant > 3 oC.

TI  - Climate change traces on Lhonak Glacier using geospatial tools
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The northwestern side of Sikkim Himalayas is selected to study the climatic variability. In this study, the regional assessment of glacier lakes area increasing over the 30 years is calculated and correlated with the land surface temperature using Geospatial technology in the North West Sikkim Himalaya. For this site, glacier lakes have been mapped with Landsat (4-5) MSS/TM and Landsat 8 (OLI) satellite imagery acquired in the years 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020. The glacier area (North Lhonak glacier, Lhonak glacier, and South Lhonak glacier) and the glacier lakes area are calculated for the given years, and found that area of the glacier is shrinking and area of the Lhonak and South Lhonak lake is increasing over the years. The land surface temperature of the area was calculated in this study to determine the rate at which the temperature of the area has increased over the years. Due to surface temperature rise, the glaciers are melting, and this melting of glaciers is increasing the area of Lhonak glacier lake and South Lhonak glacier lake. Remote sensing and GIS technique are very helpful to evaluate the risk assessment of GLOFs for remote mountainous areas.

AB  - Development of an Automated Test System (ATS) is a process that involves extensive study and knowledge of current test technologies, determination of the requirements, and a simple design approach. Communication payload architecture has changed from broad beam to spot beam technology, providing more bandwidth and power. As the number of transponders increases, the conventional way of testing payload requires more time; this, in turn, increases total cost, specifically thermal-vacuum test.

TI  - Improving Estimates and Change Detection of Forest Above-Ground Biomass Using Statistical Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Forests store approximately as much carbon as is in the atmosphere, with potential to take in or release carbon rapidly based on growth, climate change and human disturbance. Above-ground biomass (AGB) is the largest carbon pool in most forest systems, and the quickest to change following disturbance. Quantifying AGB on a global scale and being able to reliably map how it is changing, is therefore required for tackling climate change by targeting and monitoring policies. AGB can be mapped using remote sensing and machine learning methods, but such maps have high uncertainties, and simply subtracting one from another does not give a reliable indication of changes. To improve the quantification of AGB changes it is necessary to add advanced statistical methodology to existing machine learning and remote sensing methods. This review discusses the areas in which techniques used in statistical research could positively impact AGB quantification. Nine global or continental AGB maps, and a further eight local AGB maps, were investigated in detail to understand the limitations of techniques currently used. It was found that both modelling and validation of maps lacked spatial consideration. Spatial cross validation or other sampling methods, which specifically account for the spatial nature of this data, are important to introduce into AGB map validation. Modelling techniques which capture the spatial nature should also be used. For example, spatial random effects can be included in various forms of hierarchical statistical models. These can be estimated using frequentist or Bayesian inference. Strategies including hierarchical modelling, Bayesian inference, and simulation methods can also be applied to improve uncertainty estimation. Additionally, if these uncertainties are visualised using pixelation or contour maps this could improve interpretation. Improved uncertainty, which is commonly between 30% and 40%, is in addition needed to produce accurate change maps which will benefit policy decisions, policy implementation, and our understanding of the carbon cycle.

TI  - Geomorphological Evidence of High River Runoff in the Volga Basin during the Late Glacial
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Large paleochannels are considered to be a geomorphological phenomenon. The landscape-geomorphological traces of large paleochannels on the floodplains of the Volga River basin are reviewed, the regularities in their distribution are considered, and an improved method of analyzing the river floodplain topography based on remote sensing data is proposed. Based on analysis of high-resolution satellite images and digital elevation models of the Volga River valleys, more than 1700 sites with large paleochannels have been mapped. The morphology of the paleochannel makes it possible to reveal the landscape and climatic differences between the northern and southern parts of the basin. The distribution of large paleochannels in the Volga River basin is likely indicative of the fact that the duration and severity of paleoclimatic episodes of high river runoff on the East European Plain was maximum in the area occupied by recent steppes and forest-steppes. To the north and south of this area, there were fewer episodes of high runoff, and therefore, not too many geomorphological traces were left in the river valleys.

TI  - Impact of Climate Change on Spatio-Temporal Distribution of Glaciers in Western Karakoram Region since 1990: A Case Study of Central Karakoram National Park
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in the Upper Indus Basin (UIB) in Pakistan are the major source of water, irrigation, and power production for downstream regions. Global warming has induced a substantial impact on these glaciers. In the present study, Landsat images were utilized to evaluate the glaciers for the period from 1990-2020 in the Central Karakoram National Park (CKNP) region to further correlate with climate parameters. The results reveal that glaciers are retreating and the highest (2.33 km(2)) and lowest (0.18 km(2)) recession rates were observed for Biafo and Khurdopin glaciers, respectively. However, a minor advancement has also been observed for the period from 1990-2001. More than 80% of glacier recession was recorded between 2009-2020 because mean summer temperature increased at both Skardu and Gilgit meteorological stations, while precipitation decreased at both stations from 2005-2020. The increase in mean summer temperature and decrease in winter precipitation resulted in glacial retreat, which will lead to water scarcity in the future as well as affect the agriculture sector and hydropower production in downstream areas of the Indus River basin.

TI  - Reporting of melanoma cell densities in the sentinel node refines outcome prediction
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel node biopsy is a key procedure to predict prognosis in melanoma. In a prospective study we compare reporting on melanoma cell densities in cytospin preparations with semiquantitative histopathology for predicting outcome.Patients and methods: Sentinel nodes from 900 melanoma patients were bisected. One half of each node was disaggregated mechanically. The melanoma cell density (number of HMB45 positive cells per million lymphocytes with at least one cell showing morphological features of a melanoma cell) was recorded after examining two cytospins. For the second half the maximum diameter of metastasis was determined after haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistological staining of three slides.Results: Cytospins were positive for melanoma in 218 of 900 patients (24%). Routine pathology was positive in 111 of 900 (12%) patients. A more extensive pathological workup in cytospin-only positive patients led to a revised diagnosis (from negative to positive) in 23 of 101 patients (22.7%). We found a moderate but significant correlation between melanoma cell densities (determined in cytospins) and the maximum diameter of metastasis (determined by pathology) (rho = 0.6284, p < 0.001). At a median follow-up of 37 months (IQR 25-53 months) melanoma cell density (cytospins) (p < 0.001), thickness of melanoma (p = 0.008) and ulceration status (p = 0.026) were significant predictors for melanoma specific survival by multivariable testing and were all confirmed as key predictive factors by the random forest model. Maximum diameter of metastases, age and sex were not significant by multivariable testing (all p > 0.05).Conclusion: Recording melanoma cell densities by examining two cytospins accurately predicts melanoma outcome and outperforms semiquantitative histopathology.

TI  - Intra-Plot Variable N Fertilization in Winter Wheat through Machine Learning and Farmer Knowledge
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The variable fertilization rate (VFR) technique has demonstrated its ability to reduce nutrient losses by adapting the fertilizer dose to crop needs. However, transferring this technology to farms is not easy. This study aimed to make a variable fertilization map in a commercial plot where there is no data from a yield monitor, combining machine learning techniques and farmer's knowledge. In addition to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from Sentinel-2 and a digital elevation model (DEM), information captured by a yield monitor in 2019 was used to train and validate models. Among the 15 algorithms trained, the best result was obtained by the random forest (RF), with an RMSE of 496 and R-2 of 0.90. Using the "leave one out" technique, the capacity to predict an entire plot was tested. Finally, the RF algorithm was tested on a 12-hectare wheat plot where no yield data were available. The novelty of this work lies in the collaborative work developed between farmers and researchers to implement the VRF technique in plots where precise yield data do not exist and in the "leave one out" validation. The collaboration between scientists and farmers resulted in a very positive exchange of information that allowed the farmer to change the fertilization strategy of the whole farm and the scientists to better understand how soil properties and plot history affect yield.

TI  - Prediction of soil water contents and erodibility indices based on artificial neural networks: using topography and remote sensing
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to predict some soil water contents and soil erodibility indices with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) using remote sensing data (Landsat 8 OLI TIRS) and topographic variables from a digital elevation model (DEM) in a semi-arid ecosystem. In models, the input variables were derived from remote sensing imaging and DEM. The output variables were field capacity, wilting point, aggregate stability index, structural stability index, dispersion ratio, and clay flocculation index. This study was realized in the watersheds of the Koruluk dam, the Kizlarkalesi, and the Telme ponds built for agricultural irrigation in Gumushane-Siran. The soil samples were obtained from two depths (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm) from 59 soil profiles. Besides field capacity, wilting point, and aggregate stability analysis, undispersed/dispersed sand, silt, clay contents, and organic matter analysis were performed due to their strong effect on soil moisture, soil water content, and erodibility indices. The correlation analysis results showed significant relationships between soil characteristics and soil water contents/soil erodibility indices. The remote sensing variables were derived from three Landsat images of 2015 (June, July, and September). The performance results of MLP ANN models predicted for soil water contents and erodibility indices ranged from 0.75 to 0.90 for R-2, 0.046-4.115 for root mean square error (RMSE), 4.46-6.54 for normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), and 0.042-0.186 for mean absolute error (MAE). Topography was a more significant group of variables that affected soil water contents and soil erodibility indices and the feature importance of topography in the prediction was over 55%. The results showed that the use of topographic variables together with remote sensing variables in MLP ANN modeling increased the performance of the models.

TI  - A Deletion Encompassing the Furin Cleavage Site in the Spike Encoding Gene Does Not Alter SARS-CoV-2 Replication in Lung Tissues of Mink and Neutralization by Convalescent Human Serum Samples
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to lose the furin polybasic cleavage site (FCS) following adaptation on cell culture. Deletion occurring in this region, which may include also the FCS flanking regions, seem not to affect virus replication in vitro; however, a chimeric SARS-CoV-2 virus without the sole FCS motif has been associated with lower virulence in mice and lower neutralization values. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 virus lacking the FCS was shed to lower titers from experimentally infected ferrets and was not transmitted to cohoused sentinel animals, unlike wild-type virus. In this study, we investigated the replication kinetics and cellular tropism of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate carrying a 10-amino acid deletion in the spike protein spanning the FCS in lung ex vivo organ cultures of mink. Furthermore, we tested the neutralization capabilities of human convalescent SARS-CoV-2 positive serum samples against this virus. We showed that this deletion did not significantly hamper neither ex vivo replication nor neutralization activity by convalescent serum samples. This study highlights the importance of the preliminary phenotypic characterization of emerging viruses in ex vivo models and demonstrates that mink lung tissues are permissive to the replication of a mutant form of SARS-CoV-2 showing a deletion spanning the FCS. Notably, we also highlight the need for sequencing viral stocks before any infection study as large deletions may occur leading to the misinterpretation of results.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Neighborhood Size on Temporal Convolutional Networks for Modeling Land Cover Change
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change (LCC) studies are increasingly using deep learning (DL) modeling techniques. Past studies have leveraged temporal or spatiotemporal sequences of historical LC data to forecast changes with DL models. However, these studies do not adequately assess the association between neighborhood size and DL model capability to forecast LCCs, where neighborhood size refers to the spatial extent captured by each data sample. The objectives of this research study were to: (1) evaluate the effect of neighborhood size on the capacity of DL models to forecast LCCs, specifically Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN-TCN), and (2) assess the effect of auxiliary spatial variables on model capacity to forecast LCCs. First, each model type and neighborhood setting configuration was assessed using data derived from multitemporal MODIS LC for the Regional District of Bulkley-Nechako, Canada, comparing subareas exhibiting different amounts of LCCs with trends obtained for the full region. Next, outcomes were compared with three other study regions. The modeling results were evaluated with three-map comparison measures, where the real-world LC for the next timestep, the real-world LC for the previous timestep, and the forecasted LC for the next year were used to calculate correctly transitioned areas. Across all regions explored, it was observed that increasing neighborhood sizes improved the DL model's capabilities to forecast short-term LCCs. CNN-TCN models forecasted the most correct LCCs for several regions while reducing error due to quantity when provided additional spatial variables. This study contributes to the systematic exploration of neighborhood sizes on selected spatiotemporal DL techniques for geographic applications.

TI  - Ocean Variability Beneath the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf Inferred From Basal Melt Rate Time Series
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fourteen phase-sensitive radars (ApRES) were deployed on the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS) to measure variability in its basal melt rate. Melt rates from sites along the Ronne Depression vary seasonally, consistent with the dynamics of the propagation of seasonal dense water from the western ice front into the cavity. Several sites at the back of the FRIS cavity feature a signal with two seasonal maxima. Sub-ice shelf oceanographic data available from one of the sites indicate that this signal is caused by two different pathways followed by the same source water. Inter-annual variability is strongest along a direct flow pathway between western Ronne Ice Front and western Berkner Island. Highest melting occurred in 1999 and 2018, following anomalously low summer sea-ice concentrations in front of the ice shelf. Inter-annual melt rate variability at the back of the FRIS cavity is limited. If present, it is expressed as a suppression or delay in the arrival of the seasonal melt rate minimum, which can be understood in terms of inter-annual stratification changes and variable inflow pathways toward the sites. Long term mean ApRES melt rates agree with estimates from satellite data over eastern FRIS. However, the satellite estimates overstate the area of active basal freezing in the western part of the ice shelf. Furthermore, the temporal melt rate variability from the satellite estimates exaggerates the range of variability at both seasonal and inter-annual time scales with any correspondence between the in-situ and remotely derived inter-annual variability being limited to a single site.

TI  - Modelling Worldviews as Stable Metabolisms
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence and evolution of worldviews is a complex phenomenon that requires strong and rigorous scientific attention in our hyperconnected world. On the one hand, cognitive theories have proposed reasonable frameworks but have not reached general modeling frameworks where predictions can be tested. On the other hand, machine-learning-based applications perform extremely well at predicting outcomes of worldviews, but they rely on a set of optimized weights in a neural network that does not comply to a well-founded cognitive framework. In this article, we propose a formal approach used to investigate the establishment of and change in worldviews by recalling that the realm of ideas, where opinions, perspectives and worldviews are shaped, resemble, in many ways, a metabolic system. We propose a general modelization of worldviews based on reaction networks, and a specific starting model based on species representing belief attitudes and species representing belief change triggers. These two kinds of species combine and modify their structures through the reactions. We show that chemical organization theory combined with dynamical simulations can illustrate various interesting features of how worldviews emerge, are maintained and change. In particular, worldviews correspond to chemical organizations, meaning closed and self-producing structures, which are generally maintained by feedback loops occurring within the beliefs and triggers in the organization. We also show how, by inducing the external input of belief change triggers, it is possible to change from one worldview to another, in an irreversible way. We illustrate our approach with a simple example reflecting the formation of an opinion and a belief attitude about a theme, and, next, show a more complex scenario containing opinions and belief attitudes about two possible themes.

TI  - Healthcare workers as a sentinel surveillance population in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - SINGAPORE MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are a critical resource in the effort to control the COVID-19 pandemic. They are also a sentinel surveillance population whose clinical status reflects the effectiveness of the hospital's infection prevention measures in the pandemic.Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in Singapore General Hospital (SGH), a 1,822-bed tertiary hospital. Participants were all HCWs working in SGH during the study period. HCW protection measures included clinical workflows and personal protective equipment developed and adapted to minimise the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. HCW monitoring comprised staff contact logs in high-risk locations, twice-daily temperature monitoring, assessment of HCWs with acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) in the staff clinic and, in the event of an exposure, extensive contact tracing, detailed risk assessment and risk-based interventions. HCW surveillance utilised monitoring data and ARI presentations and outcomes.Results: In the ten-week period between 6 January 2020 and 16 March 2020, 333 (17.1%) of 1,946 HCWs at risk of occupational COVID-19 presented with ARI. 32 (9.6%) screened negative for SARS-CoV-2 from throat swabs. Five other HCWs developed COVID-19 attributed to non-clinical exposures. From the nine COVID-19 exposure episodes investigated, 189 HCW contacts were identified, of whom 68 (36.2%) were placed on quarantine and remained well.Conclusion: Early in an emerging infectious disease outbreak, close monitoring of frontline HCWs is essential in ascertaining the effectiveness of infection prevention measures. HCWs are at risk of community disease acquisition and should be monitored and managed to prevent onward transmission.

TI  - A geospatial approach in monitoring the variations on surface soil moisture and vegetation water content: a case study of Palakkad District, Kerala, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture and vegetation water content play an important role in studies involving vegetation, drought, and climate change. The present paper gives details of how to calculate the Soil Moisture Index (SMI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) using Landsat 7 ETM + and Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data and how spatially and temporally it has been changed over Palakkad District, Kerala. The present study develops an image processing method using band 3 (Green), band 4(Red), band 5 (NIR), band 6 (SWIR 1), and band 10 (TIR) of Landsat 8 and band 2 (Green), band 3 (Red), band 4 (NIR), band 5 (SWIR) and band 6 (TIR) of Landsat 7 data for determining the different spectral indices. The relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are based on experimental parameterization for soil moisture index. Both LST and NDVI are considered indispensable data to obtain SMI calculation. The statistical analysis of NDVI and LST was exposed in the standardized regression coefficient. The study found a weak negative correlation between NDVI and LST in both 2001 (R-2 = 0.37) and 2021 (R-2 = 0.16). As the LST increases, the vegetative cover reduces due to the record of high temperatures in the study area. The SMI result for 2021 shows that the majority of the study area experienced extreme anomalies when compared to the 2001 result. Second, a significant negative correlation existed between SMI and LST (R-2 = 0.664 in 2001 and R-2 = 1 in 2021), which indicates that the surface soil moisture reduces with LST. The normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) value ranges from - 0.71 to 0.75 in 2001 and - 0.33 to 0.40 in 2021. In 2001 and 2021, the normalized difference water index (NDWI) ranges from - 0.47 to 0.64 and - 0.531 to 0.154, respectively. Therefore, the current study gives a clear understanding of considerable variations in soil moisture and vegetation water content in the Palakkad District during the study period.

TI  - Estimation of Chlorophyll-A Concentration with Remotely Sensed Data for the Nine Plateau Lakes in Yunnan Province
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantitative retrieval of the chlorophyll-a concentration is an important remote sensing method that is used to monitor the nutritional status of water bodies. The high spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 MSI and its subdivision in the red-edge band highlight the characteristics of water chlorophyll-a, which is an important detection tool for assessing water quality parameters in plateau lakes. In this study, the Nine Plateau Lakes in the Yunnan-Kweichow Plateau of China were selected as the study area. Using Sentinel-2 MSI transit images and in situ measured chlorophyll-a concentration as the data source, the chlorophyll-a concentrations of plateau lakes (CCAPLs) were investigated, and the surface temperatures of plateau lakes (STPLs) were retrieved to verify the hypothesis that the lake surface temperature could increase the chlorophyll-a concentration. By comparing feature importance using a random forest (RF), the Sentinel-2 MSI surface reflectance and in situ data were linearly fitted using four retrieval spectral indices with high feature importance, and the accuracy of the estimated concentration of chlorophyll-a was evaluated by monitoring station data in the same period. Then, Landsat-8 TIRS Band 10 data were used to retrieve the STPL with a single-channel temperature retrieval algorithm and to verify the correlation between the STPL and the CCAPL. The results showed that the retrievals of the CCAPL and the STPL were consistent with the actual situation. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the fifteenth normalized difference chlorophyll-a index (NDCI15) was 0.0249. When the CCAPL was greater than 0.05 mg/L and the STPL was within 28-34 degrees C, there was a positive linear correlation between the CCAPL and the STPL. These results will provide support for the remote sensing monitoring of eutrophication in plateau lakes and will contribute to the scientific and effective management of plateau lakes.

TI  - ShuffleCloudNet: A Lightweight Composite Neural Network-Based Method for Cloud Computation in Remote-Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The occlusion of cloud layers affects the accurate acquisition of ground object information and causes a large amount of useless remote-sensing data transmission and processing, wasting storage, as well as computing resources. Therefore, in this paper, we designed a lightweight composite neural network model to calculate the cloud amount in high-resolution visible remote-sensing images by training the model using thumbnail images and browsing images in remote-sensing images. The training samples were established using paired thumbnail images and browsing images, and the cloud-amount calculation model was obtained by training a proposed composite neural network. The strategy used the thumbnail images for preliminary judgment and the browsing images for accurate calculation, and this combination can quickly determine the cloud amount. The multi-scale confidence fusion module and bag-of-words loss function were redesigned to achieve fast and accurate calculation of cloud-amount data from remote-sensing images. This effectively alleviates the problem of low cloud-amount calculation, thin clouds not being counted as clouds, and that of ice and clouds being confused as in existing methods. Furthermore, a complete dataset of cloud-amount calculation for remote-sensing images, CTI_RSCloud, was constructed for training and testing. The experimental results show that, with less than 13 MB of parameters, the proposed lightweight network model greatly improves the timeliness of cloud-amount calculation, with a runtime is in the millisecond range. In addition, the calculation accuracy is better than the classic lightweight networks and backbone networks of the best cloud-detection models.

TI  - Shortwave Infrared Multi-Angle Polarization Imager (MAPI) Onboard Fengyun-3 Precipitation Satellite for Enhanced Cloud Characterization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate measurement of the radiative properties of clouds and aerosols is of great significance to global climate change and numerical weather prediction. The multi-angle polarization imager (MAPI) onboard the Fengyun-3 precipitation satellite, planned to be launched in 2023, will provide the multi-angle, multi-shortwave infrared (SWIR) channels and multi-polarization satellite observation of clouds and aerosols. MAPI operates in a non-sun-synchronized inclined orbit and provides images with a spatial resolution of 3 km (sub-satellite) and a swath of 700 km. The observation channels of the MAPI include 1030 nm, 1370 nm, and 1640 nm polarization channels and corresponding non-polarization channels, which provide observation information from 14 angles. In-flight radiometric and polarimetric calibration strategies are introduced, aiming to achieve radiometric accuracy of 5% and polarimetric accuracy of 2%. Simulation experiments show that the MAPI has some unique advantages of characterizing clouds and aerosols. For cloud observation, the polarization phase functions of the 1030 nm and 1640 nm around the scattering angle of a cloudbow show strong sensitivity to cloud droplet radius and effective variance. In addition, the polarized observation of the 1030 nm and 1640 nm has a higher content of information for aerosol than VIS-NIR. Additionally, the unique observation geometry of non-sun-synchronous orbits can provide more radiometric and polarization information with expanded scattering angles. Thus, the multi-angle polarization measurement of the new SWIR channel onboard Fengyun-3 can optimize cloud phase state identification and cloud microphysical parameter inversion, as well as the retrieval of aerosols. The results obtained from the simulations will provide support for the design of the next generation of polarized imagers of China.

TI  - Effects of Effective Precipitation and Accumulated Temperature on the Terrestrial EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) in the Yellow River Basin, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - To identify the vegetation dynamics and relationship with the hydrothermal conditions in the Yellow River basin (YRB), the spatial-temporal variations of EVI, effective precipitation (Epr), accumulated temperature (At), and their relationships were obtained based on the MODIS EVI data and meteorological data from the YRB during 2001-2020. The results indicate that EVI trends increased during 2001 to 2020, especially in the farmland, forestland, and grassland ecosystems. Epr and At have also increased over the last 20 years. Epr mostly increased faster in the grassland, and water bodies and wetland ecosystems. At mostly increased faster in the water bodies and wetland, desert, and forest ecosystems. Affected by Epr and At, the correlation between the EVI and hydrothermal conditions varied under different hydrothermal conditions. Compared to the At, the Epr was the restrictive factor for the EVI variations in the terrestrial ecosystem in the YRB. In addition, the dynamical thresholds of the EVI, Epr, and At were confirmed. This study can improve the understanding of vegetation variations and their response to regional climate change, which is critical for ecological conservation and the high-quality development of the YRB.

TI  - Winter Wheat Yield Prediction Using an LSTM Model from MODIS LAI Products
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Yield estimation using remote sensing data is a research priority in modern agriculture. The rapid and accurate estimation of winter wheat yields over large areas is an important prerequisite for food security policy formulation and implementation. In most county-level yield estimation processes, multiple input data are used for yield prediction as much as possible, however, in some regions, data are more difficult to obtain, so we used the single-leaf area index (LAI) as input data for the model for yield prediction. In this study, the effects of different time steps as well as the LAI time series on the estimation results were analyzed for the properties of long short-term memory (LSTM), and multiple machine learning methods were compared with yield estimation models constructed by the LSTM networks. The results show that the accuracy of the yield estimation results using LSTM did not show an increasing trend with the increasing step size and data volume, while the yield estimation results of the LSTM were generally better than those of conventional machine learning methods, with the best R-2 and RMSE results of 0.87 and 522.3 kg/ha, respectively, in the comparison between predicted and actual yields. Although the use of LAI as a single input factor may cause yield uncertainty in some extreme years, it is a reliable and promising method for improving the yield estimation, which has important implications for crop yield forecasting, agricultural disaster monitoring, food trade policy, and food security early warning.

TI  - Factors Influencing Seasonal Changes in Inundation of the Daliyaboyi Oasis, Lower Keriya River Valley, Central Tarim Basin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological water diversion project (EWDP) in the Tarim River Basin, China, aims to allocate more surface water to downstream reaches to restore the degraded ecosystems. However, seasonal changes in ecological water diversion; the factors (natural and anthropogenic) controlling the ecological water diversion, whether the seasonal delivery of water temporally corresponded to the vegetation's seasonal water demands; and the benefits of the ecological water diversion through overflowing surface water irrigation are unclear. To address the above issues, this study examines the intra-annual changes and its influencing factors in ecological water diversion (inundation) in the Daliyaboyi Oasis in the lower Keriya River valley within the Tarim Basin, discusses whether the seasonal delivery of water temporally corresponded to the vegetation's seasonal water demands, and assesses the ecological benefits of overflowing surface water irrigation. Inundation was quantified by digitizing monthly changes in the inundated area from 2000 to 2018 in the oasis using 184 Landsat images. The results demonstrate that seasonal changes in the inundated area varied significantly, with maximum peaks occurring in February and August; a period of minimal inundation occurred in May. Differences in the July/August peak (i.e., July or August) in inundation dominated the inter-annual variations in the inundated area over the 19-year study period. The two peaks in the inundation area were temporally consistent with the vegetation's seasonal water demand. Local residents have used ecological water to irrigate vegetation in different parts of the oasis during different seasons, an approach that expanded the inundated area. The February peak in the inundated area is closely linked to elevated downstream groundwater levels and the melting of ice along the river. The August peak is related to a peak in runoff from headwater areas. The minimum May value is correlated to a relatively low value in upstream runoff and an increase in agricultural water demand. Thus, natural factors control the intra-annual and inter-annual variations in the inundated area. Humans changed the spatial distribution of the inundated area and enhanced the water's ecological benefits, but did not alter the correlation between peak periods of inundation and vegetation water demand. The results from this study improve our understanding of the benefits of the EWDP in the Tarim River Basin.

TI  - Deformation Detection and Attribution Analysis of Urban Areas near Dianchi Lake in Kunming Using the Time-Series InSAR Technique
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The main city of Kunming is located on the north bank of Dianchi Lake. The complex geological environment, large-scale construction, and expansion of the city in recent years have caused uneven land surface subsidence and threatened public safety. In this study, Sentinel-1 ascending and descending orbit datasets were collected for the period of February 2018 to May 2021. The characteristics of surface displacement in the Kunming downtown area were monitored using the time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique, and attribution analysis was performed. It was found that areas with more severe surface settlement were concentrated in the International Exhibition Center area and the large, newly built communities near Dianchi Lake and the Xiaobanqiao Region. The multifactor attribution analysis results demonstrated that the subsidence areas are concentrated in urban villages and engineered, construction-intensive areas in the lakeside sedimentary layer area, with the maximum displacement rate reaching -23.12 mm/a in the line-of-sight direction of the Sentinel-1 ascending dataset. The reliability of the InSAR results was cross-validated with ascending and descending results. This study provides a scientific reference for urban development planning and potential geological disaster detection in Kunming.

TI  - A Cluster-Based Partition Method of Remote Sensing Data for Efficient Distributed Image Processing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data stream partitioning is a fundamental and important mechanism for distributed systems. However, use of an inappropriate partition scheme may generate a data skew problem, which can influence the execution efficiency of many application tasks. Processing of skewed partitions usually takes a longer time, need more computational resources to complete the task and can even become a performance bottleneck. To solve such data skew issues, this paper proposes a novel partition method to divide on demand the image tiles uniformly into partitions. The partitioning problem is then transformed into a uniform and compact clustering problem whereby the image tiles are regarded as image pixels without spectrum and texture information. First, the equal area conversion principle was used to select the seed points of the partitions and then the image tiles were aggregated in an image layout, thus achieving an initial partition scheme. Second, the image tiles of the initial partition were finely adjusted in the vertical and horizontal directions in separate steps to achieve a uniform distribution among the partitions. Two traditional partition methods were adopted to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method in terms of the image segmentation testing, data shuffle testing, and image clipping testing. The results demonstrated that the proposed partition method solved the data skew problem observed in the hash partition method. In addition, this method is designed specifically for processing of image tiles and makes the related processing operations for large-scale images faster and more efficient.

TI  - A Transferable Learning Classification Model and Carbon Sequestration Estimation of Crops in Farmland Ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent agricultural activities in farmland ecosystems bring challenges to crop information extraction from remote sensing (RS) imagery. The accurate spatiotemporal information of crops serves for regional decision support and ecological assessment, such as disaster monitoring and carbon sequestration. Most traditional machine learning algorithms are not appropriate for prediction classification due to the lack of historical ground samples and poor model transfer capabilities. Therefore, a transferable learning model including spatiotemporal capability was developed based on the UNet++ model by integrating feature fusion and upsampling of small samples for Sentinel-2A imagery. Classification experiments were conducted for 10 categories from 2019 to 2021 in Xinxiang City, Henan Province. The feature fusion and upsampling methods improved the performance of the UNet++ model, showing lower joint loss and higher mean intersection over union (mIoU) values. Compared with the UNet, DeepLab V3+, and the pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet), the improved UNet++ model exhibits the best performance, with a joint loss of 0.432 and a mIoU of 0.871. Moreover, the overall accuracy and macro F-1 values of prediction classification results based on the UNet++ model are higher than 83% and 58%, respectively. Based on the reclassification rules, about 3.48% of the farmland was damaged in 2021 due to continuous precipitation. The carbon sequestration of five crops (including corn, peanuts, soybean, rice, and other crops) is estimated, with a total carbon sequestration of 2460.56, 2549.16, and 1814.07 thousand tons in 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. The classification accuracy indicates that the improved model exhibits a better feature extraction and transferable learning capability in complex agricultural areas. This study provides a strategy for RS semantic segmentation and carbon sequestration estimation of crops based on a deep learning network.

TI  - Agricultural Field Boundary Delineation with Satellite Image Segmentation for High-Resolution Crop Mapping: A Case Study of Rice Paddy
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Parcel-level cropland maps are an essential data source for crop yield estimation, precision agriculture, and many other agronomy applications. Here, we proposed a rice field mapping approach that combines agricultural field boundary extraction with fine-resolution satellite images and pixel-wise cropland classification with Sentinel-1 time series SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery. The agricultural field boundaries were delineated by image segmentation using U-net-based fully convolutional network (FCN) models. Meanwhile, a simple decision-tree classifier was developed based on rice phenology traits to extract rice pixels with time series SAR imagery. Agricultural fields were then classified as rice or non-rice by majority voting from pixel-wise classification results. The evaluation indicated that SeresNet34, as the backbone of the U-net model, had the best performance in agricultural field extraction with an IoU (Intersection over Union) of 0.801 compared to the simple U-net and ResNet-based U-net. The combination of agricultural field maps with the rice pixel detection model showed promising improvement in the accuracy and resolution of rice mapping. The produced rice field map had an IoU score of 0.953, while the User's Accuracy and Producer's Accuracy of pixel-wise rice field mapping were 0.824 and 0.816, respectively. The proposed model combination scheme merely requires a simple pixel-wise cropland classification model that incorporates the agricultural field mapping results to produce high-accuracy and high-resolution cropland maps.

TI  - Enhancing Earth Observation Throughput Using Inter-Satellite Communication
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation systems play important roles in many critical applications. The rapid increase of the number of satellites and their sensing capability, however, makes it challenging to send the massive amount of observed data back to the Earth. One promising direction to enhance the earth observation throughput is to use inter-satellite communication. Towards this, we identify two key design factors: 1) the capability to support on-demand scheduling of inter-satellite communication; and 2) the capability to co-optimize the scheduling of observation and transmission missions. For both, rigorous study is needed to determine whether they provide sufficient throughput gain to justify their additional complexity. Our work formulates a generic earth observation and transmission problem to study the maximum network throughput under different settings. By succinctly modeling the different constraints using a generalized time-varying graph representation, we can efficiently find the optimal scheduling solutions. We conduct an extensive study, which shows that using 40 relay satellites from the "starlink" constellation can increase the throughput of 10 sensing satellites from the "Gaofen" constellation by more than 400%. In particular, on-demand scheduling under heavy load and co-optimization of observation/transmission under light but time-critical load can improve the throughput by more than 180% and 100%, respectively.

TI  - Remote Sensing Estimation of Forest Aboveground Biomass Based on Lasso-SVR
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the Lutou Forest Farm as the research area, the Lasso algorithm was used for characteristic selection, and the optimal combination of variables was input into the support vector regression (SVR) model. The most suitable SVR model was selected to estimate the aboveground biomass of the forest through the comparison of the kernel function and optimal parameters, and the spatial distribution map of the aboveground biomass in the study area was drawn. The significance analysis of special variables showed good correlations between forest aboveground biomass and each vegetation index. There was a more significant correlation with some remote sensing bands, a less significant correlation with some texture features, and a strong correlation with DEM in the terrain features. When the parameters C is 2 and g is 0.01, the SVR model has the highest precision, which can illustrate 73% of the forest aboveground biomass, with the validation set R-2 being 0.62. The statistical analysis of the results shows that the total aboveground biomass of the Lutou Forest Farm is 4.82x10(5) t. The combination of Lasso with the SVR model can improve the estimation accuracy of forest aboveground biomass, and the model has a strong generalization ability.

TI  - A Random Forest Model for Drought: Monitoring and Validation for Grassland Drought Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy of drought monitoring models is crucial for drought monitoring and early warning. Random forest (RF) is being used widely in the field of artificial intelligence. Nonetheless, the application of a random forest model in grassland drought monitoring research is yet to be further explored. In this study, various drought hazard factors were integrated based on remote sensing data, including from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), as multisource remote sensing data. Based on the RF, a comprehensive grassland drought monitoring model was constructed and tested in Inner Mongolia, China, as an example. The critical issue addressed is the construction of a grassland drought disaster monitoring model based on meteorological data and multisource remote sensing data by using an RF model, and the verification of the accuracy and reliability of its monitoring results. The results show that the grassland drought monitoring model could quantitatively monitor the drought situation in Inner Mongolia grasslands. There was a significantly positive correlation between the drought indicators output by the model and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) measured in the field. The correlation coefficients (R) between the drought degree were 0.9706 and 0.6387 for the training set and test set, respectively. The consistent rate between the model drought index and the SPEI reached 87.90%. Drought events in Inner Mongolia were monitored from April to September in wet years, normal years, and dry years using the constructed model. The monitoring results of the model constructed in this study were in accordance with the actual drought conditions, reflecting the development and spatial evolution of drought conditions. This study provides a new application method for the comprehensive assessment of grassland drought.

TI  - Vegetation Growth Status and Topographic Effects in Frozen Soil Regions on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), which is known as Earth's "Third Pole", is a driver of global climate change, and long-term monitoring of QTP vegetation can reveal changes attributable to climatic and human influences. Previous research monitoring vegetation on the QTP focused primarily on spatiotemporal variations of vegetation indices, while few studies have considered fractional vegetation cover (FVC) in relation to topographic and frozen soil factors. We used MODIS-EVI, digital elevation models, and frozen soil data to investigate topographic effects on vegetation growth status in different soil types on the QTP during 2000-2020. (1) FVC showed a trend of increase during 2000-2020, and the FVC on the QTP decreased from the southeast to the northwest in spatial distribution. FVC in permafrost regions was the lowest, followed by seasonal frozen soil areas; FVC in unfrozen areas was the highest. (2) With increasing elevation, FVC of permafrost, seasonal frozen, and unfrozen soil areas showed downward trends for each aspect. In seasonal frozen soil areas, at elevation <= 4000 m (>4000 m), FVC of sunny (shady) slopes was greater than that of shady (sunny) slopes. In permafrost regions, except at elevations of 3000-4000 m, FVC of shady slopes was greater than that of sunny slopes. In unfrozen soil areas, at elevation >4000 m, FVC of sunny slopes was obviously greater than that of shady slopes. (3) With increasing slope, FVC in seasonal frozen and permafrost soil (unfrozen soil) regions showed a trend of increase (decrease). In seasonal frozen soil areas, FVC of sunny (shady) slopes was greater than that of shady (sunny) slopes on slopes <= 6 degrees (>6 degrees). In permafrost regions, FVC of sunny slopes was less than that of shady slopes. With increasing slope, the influence of aspect became more obvious. In unfrozen soil areas, FVC of sunny slopes was slightly greater than that of shady slopes. Topographic effects especially the elevation and slope effects might significantly affect the spatiotemporal variations of vegetation growth status in frozen soil regions on the QTP.

TI  - Characterizing Spatiotemporal Patterns of Winter Wheat Phenology from 1981 to 2016 in North China by Improving Phenology Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology provides important information for wheat growth management and the estimation of wheat yield and quality. The relative threshold method has been widely used to retrieve phenological metrics from remotely sensed data owing to its simplicity. However, the thresholds vary substantially among phenological metrics and locations, hampering us from effectively detecting spatial and temporal variations in winter wheat phenology. In this study, we developed a calibrated relative threshold method based on ground phenological observations. Compared with the traditional relative threshold method, our method can minimize the bias and uncertainty caused by unreasonable thresholds in determining phenological dates. On this basis, seven key phenological dates and three growth periods of winter wheat were estimated from long-term series (1981-2016) of the remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for North China (106 degrees 18 '-122 degrees 41 ' E, 28 degrees 59 '-39 degrees 57 ' N). Results show that the pre-wintering phenological dates of winter wheat (i.e., emergence and tillering) occurred in December in the south and in mid- to late- October in the north, while the post-wintering phenological dates (i.e., green-up onset, jointing, heading, milky stage, and maturity) exhibited the opposite pattern, that is, January to May in the south and February to June in the north. Consequently, the vegetative growth period increased from 49 days in the south to 77 in the north, and the reproductive growth period decreased from 51 days to 29 days. At the regional scale, all winter wheat phenological dates predominantly advanced, with the most pronounced advancement being for green-up onset (-0.10 days/year, p > 0.1), emergence (-0.09 days/year, p > 0.1), and jointing (-0.08 days/year, p > 0.1). The vegetative growth period and reproductive growth period at the regional scale predominantly extended by 0.03 (p > 0.1) and 0.09 (p < 0.001) days/year, respectively. In general, the later phenological events (i.e., heading, milky stage, and maturity) tended to advance with higher temperature, while the earlier phenological events (i.e., emergence, tillering, green-up onset, and jointing) showed a weak correlation with temperature, suggesting that the earlier events might be mainly affected by management while later ones were more responsive to warming. These findings provide a critical reference for improving winter wheat management under the ongoing climate warming.

TI  - The Use of Satellite Data-Based "Critical Relative Humidity" in Cloud Parameterization and Its Role in Modulating Cloud Feedback
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The critical relative humidity (RHc), which approximately measures the subgrid-scale variability of moisture, is important to cloud parameterization. Based on the diagnostics from CloudSat/CALIPSO satellite data, we propose an improved RHc formula that incorporates geographic dependence and allows for non-monotonic variations in the vertical. With the parameterized RHc, a cloud macrophysics scheme is constructed in which fractional cloudiness and subgrid-scale condensation are synergistically solved, with the latter being calculated using two different approaches. Results show the new scheme largely alleviates the underestimation of high- and mid-level clouds in the default model. The performance is also superior to the simulations applying a globally uniform RHc as conventionally used in the literature. Varying RHc and the techniques for computing subgrid-scale condensation leads to a marked diversity in cloud feedback, which nearly replicates the range of uncertainty found in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 models. Using smaller RHc leads to larger spread than using larger ones. And the spread caused by different techniques for calculating subgrid-scale condensation is larger than that caused by the choice of RHc. While many previous studies have emphasized the diversity of cloud feedback due to low clouds, varying RHc and its implementation leads to diversity of cloud feedback being mainly due to optically thick clouds. These results highlight the importance of RHc in inducing uncertainty of cloud feedback, as well as notes of caution to modelers when using RHc to tune models.

TI  - Gap-Filling and Missing Information Recovery for Time Series of MODIS Data Using Deep Learning-Based Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensors onboard satellite platforms with short revisiting periods acquire frequent earth observation data. One limitation to the utility of satellite-based data is missing information in the time series of images due to cloud contamination and sensor malfunction. Most studies on gap-filling and cloud removal process individual images, and existing multi-temporal image restoration methods still have problems in dealing with images that have large areas with frequent cloud contamination. Considering these issues, we proposed a deep learning-based method named content-sequence-texture generation (CSTG) network to generate gap-filled time series of images. The method uses deep neural networks to restore remote sensing images with missing information by accounting for image contents, textures and temporal sequences. We designed a content generation network to preliminarily fill in the missing parts and a sequence-texture generation network to optimize the gap-filling outputs. We used time series of Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data in different regions, which include various surface characteristics in North America, Europe and Asia to train and test the proposed model. Compared to the reference images, the CSTG achieved structural similarity (SSIM) of 0.953 and mean absolute errors (MAE) of 0.016 on average for the restored time series of images in artificial experiments. The developed method could restore time series of images with detailed texture and generally performed better than the other comparative methods, especially with large or overlapped missing areas in time series. Our study provides an available method to gap-fill time series of remote sensing images and highlights the power of the deep learning methods in reconstructing remote sensing images.

TI  - Desert Soil Salinity Inversion Models Based on Field In Situ Spectroscopy in Southern Xinjiang, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is prominent environmental issue in arid and semi-arid regions, such as Xinjiang in Northwest China. Salinization severely restricts economic and agricultural development and would lead to ecosystem degradation. Finding a method of rapidly and accurately determining soil salinity (SS) is one of the main challenges in salinity evaluation, saline soil development, and utilization. In situ visible and near infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy has proven to be a promising technique for detecting soil properties since it can realize real-time, rapid detection of SS. However, it still remains challenging whether Vis-NIR in situ spectroscopy can invert SS with high accuracy due to the interference of environmental factors (e.g., light, water vapor, solar altitude angle, etc.) on the spectral in the field. To fill this knowledge gap, we collected Vis-NIR in situ spectral and lab-measured SS data from 135 surface soil samples in the Kongterik Pasture Nature Reserve (KPNR) in the desert oasis ecotone of southern Xinjiang, China. We used genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and simulated annealing (SA) algorithms to select the feature bands of SS. Subsequently, we combined extreme learning machines (ELM), back-propagation neural networks (BPNN), and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to build inversion models of SS. The results showed that different feature bands selection methods could improve the Vis-NIR in situ spectral prediction model accuracy. Either SS inversion models were built using full-band spectral data or feature-band spectral data. Compared with the full-band (401-2400 nm) spectral modeling, the validation set R-2 of ELM, BPNN, and CNN models built selected feature bands selected by PSO, GA, and SA, respectively, were improved by more than 0.06. The accuracy of predicting SS varied widely among modeling methods. The accuracy of CNN model was obviously higher than that of BPNN and ELM models. The optimal hybrid model for predicting SS constructed in this study is SA-CNN model (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 9.41 g kg(-1), RPD = 1.81, RPIQ = 2.37). This study showed that the spectral feature bands selection methods can reduce the influence of environmental factors on in situ spectroscopy and significantly enhance the inversion accuracy of SS. The present study provided that estimating SS using in situ Vis-NIR spectral is feasible.

TI  - Land Surface Albedo Estimation and Cross Validation Based on GF-1 WFV Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface albedo (LSA) represents the ability of the land surface to reflect solar radiation. It is one of the driving factors in the energy balance of land surface radiation and in land-air interactions. In this paper, we estimated the land surface albedo based on GF-1 WFV satellite data that have a high spatial and temporal resolution and cross-validated the albedo estimation results. The albedo estimations and validations were performed in the Ganzhou District, Zhangye City, China, and the Sindh Province, Pakistan. We used the direct estimation method which used a radiative transfer simulation to establish the relationship between the narrow band top of the atmosphere bidirectional reflectance and the land broadband albedo to estimate the albedo data. The results were validated with ground data, Landsat data, MODIS products, and GLASS products. The results show that the method can produce highly accurate albedo estimation results on different land cover types (RMSE: 0.026, R-2: 0.835) and has a good consistency with the existing albedo products. This study makes a significant contribution to improving the utilization of GF data and contributes to the understanding of land-air interactions.

TI  - Sugarcane Biomass Prediction with Multi-Mode Remote Sensing Data Using Deep Archetypal Analysis and Integrated Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of multi-mode remote sensing data for biomass prediction is of potential value to aid planting management and yield maximization. In this study, an advanced biomass estimation approach for sugarcane fields is proposed based on multi-source remote sensing data. Since feature interpretability in agricultural data mining is significant, a feature extraction method of deep archetypal analysis (DAA) that has good model interpretability is introduced and aided by principal component analysis (PCA) for feature mining from the multi-mode multispectral and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing data pertaining to sugarcane. In addition, an integrated regression model integrating random forest regression, support vector regression, K-nearest neighbor regression and deep network regression is developed after feature extraction by DAA to precisely predict biomass of sugarcane. In this study, the biomass prediction performance achieved using the proposed integrated learning approach is found to be predominantly better than that achieved by using conventional linear methods in all the time periods of plant growth. Of more significance, according to model interpretability of DAA, only a small set of informative features maintaining their physical meanings (four informative spectral indices and four key LiDAR metrics) can be extracted which eliminates the redundancy of multi-mode data and plays a vital role in accurate biomass prediction. Therefore, the findings in this study provide hands-on experience to planters with indications of the key or informative spectral or LiDAR metrics relevant to the biomass to adjust the corresponding planting management design.

TI  - Agricultural drought assessment and monitoring using MODIS-based multiple indices: the case of North Wollo, Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is the most sensitive sector which has largely been affected by the impacts of drought. The study aims to detect and characterize agricultural droughts using MODIS-based multiple indices in North Wollo, Ethiopia. Two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets (MOD13Q1 and MOD11A2) for the period 2000 to 2019 were used to generate Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST). Accordingly, NDVI anomaly, Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI) were computed to characterize agricultural droughts during the crop growing season. Both the NDVI anomaly and VCI confirmed that there was no single drought-free year in the area throughout the study period. TCI showed relatively exaggerated drought stress than the other indices. However, VHI indicated lower area coverage and a lower level of stress than its aggregates (VCI and TCI). Specifically, 2002, 2004, 2009, 2010, and 2015 were all identified as severe drought years, where over 60% of the area was affected by droughts. Results of the regression analysis indicated that VCI, TCI, and VHI were having significant positive trends with precipitation in the majority of the districts. Using the aggregated drought frequency of each index, 13.5, 73.7, and 12.8% of the area were under moderate, high, and extremely high levels of agricultural drought occurrence, respectively, and the likelihood of implied risks. Therefore, all the districts of North Wollo were affected by persistent drought stress. Such drought recurrences have the potential to impose significant impacts on the agro-based livelihoods of the local community demanding ongoing drought monitoring and the application of effective early warning systems.

TI  - Quantification of Effects of Errors in the Cloud Properties on the Representation of the Surface Downward Shortwave Flux Based on MERRA-2 in Japan
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The evaluation of the representation of the surface downward shortwave flux (DSF) from atmospheric reanalysis data products is required to obtain reliable information for the resource assessment of surface solar energy. The representation of the DSF from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), reanalysis data product was evaluated using surface solar radiation from ground-based observations in Japan. The cloud fraction (CFR) and cloud optical thickness (COT) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were also used as references. The CFR from MERRA-2 tends to be smaller than that from MODIS, and the correlation between the difference in the CFR and that in the DSF is negative. The correlation between the difference in the COT and that in the DSF is weakly negative. To quantify the effects of the difference in the CFR and COT to that of the DSF, a regression model based on an artificial neural network architecture that emulates the process of the DSF in MERRA-2 was constructed. Numerical experiments using the emulator quantify contributions of each of the differences in the CFR and COT and joint contributions of the two variables. In addition, a cluster analysis was performed to clarify the differences in the seasonal changes in the monthly mean bias error (MBE) in the DSF among ground observation stations, and three clusters were identified. Contributions of the differences in the CFR and COT to the seasonal change in the monthly MBE were also clarified using the results of the numerical experiments.

TI  - Growing Stock Volume Estimation for Daiyun Mountain Reserve Based on Multiple Linear Regression and Machine Learning
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing provides an easy, inexpensive, and rapid method for detecting forest stocks. However, the saturation of data from different satellite sensors leads to low accuracy in estimations of the growing stock volume in natural forests with high densities. Thus, this study added actual data to improve the accuracy. The Daiyun Mountain Reserve was the study area. Landsat 8 operational land imager data were combined with remote sensing data and actual measurements. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and machine learning methods were used to construct a model for estimating the growing stock volume. The decision tree model showed the best fit. By adding the measured data to the model, the saturation could effectively be overcome to a certain extent, and the fitting effect of all the models can be improved. Among the estimation models using only remote sensing data, the normalized difference vegetation index showed the strongest correlation with the model, followed by the annual rainfall and slope. The decision tree model was inverted to produce a map of the accumulation distribution. From the map, the storage volume in the west was lower than that in the east and was primarily confined to the middle-altitude area, consistent with field survey results.

TI  - Detection of geothermal anomalies in the Northern Lake Abaya geothermal field, Main Ethiopian Rift
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of geothermal anomalies using Thermal Infrared (TIR) remote sensing data is challenging because of how sensor specifications (such as the infrared wavelength used for the measurement, spectral dependence of the emissivity, angle at which the measurement is made, state of the surface and height of the sensor above the surface) and physical parameters (such as solar radiation, topography, albedo, soil compaction and coherence of rocks) affect Land Surface Temperature (LST) retrieval and analysis. This work tests whether TIR remote sensing measurements with thorough spatial and temporal sampling can improve LST retrievals. Multi-temporal TIR data from 2000 through 2019 from Landsat 7 and 8 TIR instruments and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) were used to detect geothermal areas in the geologically active region of the southern Main Ethiopian Rift. In addition, field-based temperature data from 19 sites were evaluated for com-parison to the remotely detected geothermal anomaly areas. We have used the single-channel algorithm and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) method of emissivity retrieval to derive LST for each year. The result shows that the mean LST is highest in 2003 (320.1 K) and lowest in 2019 (303.1 K). The change in mean LST was between-9 K to 13 K. These LST results from ASTER images were validated with MODIS LST products and showed a correlation coefficient 0.6. LST of the year 2003 has been much closer to the actual temperature value from field data. Fifteen sites (79%) fit with the identified geothermal anomaly areas. LST values in known geothermal activity sites show no correlation (< 0.5) with time attesting. That is, even though LST varies with time (e.g., day and night and seasonal changes), the LST of areas with geothermal potential remain more or less constant on yearly basis.

TI  - Double-Differenced dNBR: Combining MODIS and Landsat Imagery to Map Fine-Grained Fire MOSAICS in Lowland <i>Eucalyptus</i> Savanna in Kakadu National Park, Northern Australia
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - A neglected dimension of the fire regime concept is fire patchiness. Habitat mosaics that emerge from the grain of burned and unburned patches (pyrodiversity) are critical for the persistence of a diverse range of plant and animal species. This issue is of particular importance in frequently burned tropical Eucalyptus savannas, where coarse fire mosaics have been hypothesized to have caused the recent drastic population declines of small mammals. Satellites routinely used for fire mapping in these systems are unable to accurately map fine-grained fire mosaics, frustrating our ability to determine whether declines in biodiversity are associated with local pyrodiversity. To advance this problem, we have developed a novel method (we call 'double-differenced dNBR') that combines the infrequent (c. 16 days) detailed spatial resolution Landsat with daily coarse scale coverage of MODIS and VIIRS to map pyrodiversity in the savannas of Kakadu National Park. We used seasonal Landsat mosaics and differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) to define burned areas, with a modification to dNBR that subtracts long-term average dNBR to increase contrast. Our results show this approach is effective in mapping fine-scale fire mosaics in the homogenous lowland savannas, although inappropriate for nearby heterogenous landscapes. Comparison of this methods to other fire metrics (e.g., area burned, seasonality) based on Landsat and MODIS imagery suggest this method is likely accurate and better at quantifying fine-scale patchiness of fire, albeit it demands detailed field validation.

TI  - Integrating plot-based and remotely sensed data to map vegetation types in a New Zealand warm-temperate rainforest
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions(1) What can be learned by extending a national classification into unsampled forest types? (2) Are both remotely sensed and environmental predictors needed to model and map associations? (3) For mapping, are LiDAR-generated canopy structure parameters or reflectance from spectral imagery more useful? (4) How can we assess uncertainty of a final map? LocationWarawara Forest, Northland, New Zealand. MethodsWe sampled 205 vegetation plots and assigned them to an existing national classification using the fuzzy classification framework of noise clustering. Plots too distinct to be assigned were used to define new associations. We produced spatial models of each association using boosted regression trees. Predictors included 11 environmental, 11 canopy reflectance, and 17 canopy structure variables. We created a composite map by assigning each map pixel to the association with the highest occurrence probability. We evaluated uncertainty by examining locations where no class was predicted with probability above 0.2 and by creating a confusion map based on entropy. ResultsForty-five plots were assigned to six of 79 existing national associations and 147 plots were used to define two new forest associations. Three shrubland types are widespread nationally, whereas two young forest types are northern. Three mature forest types are narrowly distributed nationally, with the new "High-elevation hardwood forest" largely restricted to Warawara Forest. Three associations were mapped using remotely sensed predictors alone, whereas two also required environmental predictors. Overall, canopy reflectance predictors explained more deviance than canopy structure. Examining locations where no association was predicted well and where multiple associations were predicted equally showed areas mapped as younger forests to have greatest uncertainty. ConclusionsIn answering our questions, we present a vegetation classification and map for Warawara Forest that provides a framework to guide the indigenous people's management responses to threats to valued communities and their species.

TI  - Nationwide Surveillance of Antifungal Resistance of <i>Candida</i> Bloodstream Isolates in South Korean Hospitals: Two Year Report from Kor-GLASS
T2  - JOURNAL OF FUNGI
M3  - Article
AB  - We incorporated nationwide Candida antifungal surveillance into the Korea Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (Kor-GLASS) for bacterial pathogens. We prospectively collected and analyzed complete non-duplicate blood isolates and information from nine sentinel hospitals during 2020-2021, based on GLASS early implementation protocol for the inclusion of Candida species. Candida species ranked fourth among 10,758 target blood pathogens and second among 4050 hospital-origin blood pathogens. Among 766 Candida blood isolates, 87.6% were of hospital origin, and 41.3% occurred in intensive care unit patients. Adults > 60 years of age accounted for 75.7% of cases. Based on species-specific clinical breakpoints, non-susceptibility to fluconazole, voriconazole, caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin was found in 21.1% (154/729), 4.0% (24/596), 0.1% (1/741), 0.0% (0/741), and 0.1% (1/741) of the isolates, respectively. Fluconazole resistance was determined in 0% (0/348), 2.2% (3/135, 1 Erg11 mutant), 5.3% (7/133, 6 Pdr1 mutants), and 5.6% (6/108, 4 Erg11 and 1 Cdr1 mutants) of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis isolates, respectively. An echinocandin-resistant C. glabrata isolate harbored an F659Y mutation in Fks2p. The inclusion of Candida species in the Kor-GLASS system generated well-curated surveillance data and may encourage global Candida surveillance efforts using a harmonized GLASS system.

TI  - Application of Multi-Source Data for Mapping Plantation Based on Random Forest Algorithm in North China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of plantation poses new challenges for mapping forest, especially in mountainous regions. Using multi-source data, this study explored the capability of the random forest (RF) algorithm for the extraction and mapping of five forest types located in Yanqing, north China. The Google Earth imagery, forest inventory data, GaoFen-1 wide-field-of-view (GF-1 WFV) images and DEM were applied for obtaining 125 features in total. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) method selected 32 features for mapping five forest types. The results attained overall accuracy of 87.06%, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.833. The mean decrease accuracy (MDA) reveals that the DEM, LAI and EVI in winter and three texture features (entropy, variance and mean) make great contributions to forest classification. The texture features from the NIR band are important, while the other texture features have little contribution. This study has demonstrated the potential of applying multi-source data based on RF algorithm for extracting and mapping plantation forest in north China.

TI  - Flood Detection in Dual-Polarization SAR Images Based on Multi-Scale Deeplab Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The proliferation of massive polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data helps promote the development of SAR image interpretation. Due to the advantages of powerful feature extraction capability and strong adaptability for different tasks, deep learning has been adopted in the work of SAR image interpretation and has achieved good results. However, most deep learning methods only employ single-polarization SAR images and ignore the water features embedded in multi-polarization SAR images. To fully exploit the dual-polarization SAR data and multi-scale features of SAR images, an effective flood detection method for SAR images is proposed in this paper. In the proposed flood detection method, a powerful Multi-Scale Deeplab (MS-Deeplab) model is constructed based on the dual-channel MobileNetV2 backbone and the classic DeeplabV3+ architecture to improve the ability of water feature extraction in SAR images. Firstly, the dual-channel feature extraction backbone based on the lightweight MobileNetV2 separately trains the dual-polarization SAR images, and the obtained training parameters are merged with the linear weighting to fuse dual-polarization water features. Given the multi-scale space information in SAR images, then, a multi-scale feature fusion module is introduced to effectively utilize multi-layer features and contextual information, which enhances the representation of water features. Finally, a joint loss function is constructed based on cross-entropy and a dice coefficient to deal with the imbalanced categorical distribution in the training dataset. The experimental results on the time series of Sentinel-1A SAR images show that the proposed method for flood detection has a strong ability to locate water boundaries and tiny water bodies in complex scenes. In terms of quantitative assessment, MS-Deeplab can achieve a better performance compared with other mainstream semantic segmentation models, including PSPNet, Unet and the original DeeplabV3+ model, with a 3.27% intersection over union (IoU) and 1.69% pixel accuracy (PA) improvement than the original DeeplabV3+ model.

TI  - Cloud Screening Method in Complex Background Areas Containing Snow and Ice Based on Landsat 9 Images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The first step in the application of Landsat 9 imagery is cloud screening, and the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) has made cloud screening an important part of the World Climate Research Program. The accurate identification of clouds in remote sensing satellite images containing snow and ice on the subsurface has been a challenging task in the cloud screening process. It is imperative to fully exploit the characteristic heterogeneous information of the cloud and snow subsurface, to solve the problem of cloud-snow confusion in the snow and ice environment, and to carry out research on cloud screening technology without interference from the snow and ice subsurface. In view of this, this paper will systematically carry out research on cloud screening methods in snow and ice environments. In this paper, we propose the building of a cloud screening algorithm that takes into account the difficulty of the fact that snow and ice on the subsurface can easily interfere with cloud recognition, and the influence of an empirical threshold or statistical threshold that makes its application less effective, and then establish a dynamic threshold cloud screening algorithm that is suitable for snow and ice environments. The research results will provide new ideas and perspectives to solve the problem of surface-type interference that most of the existing cloud screening algorithms contend with.

TI  - Eco-Environmental Effects of Changes in Territorial Spatial Pattern and Their Driving Forces in Qinghai, China (1980-2020)
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - As urbanization and industrialization have advanced in leaps and bounds, the territorial spatial pattern of Qinghai has experienced profound transformation and reconstruction, which has been directly reflected in land-use changes and affected the eco-environment. In this context, we constructed a functional classification system of "production-living-ecological" (PLE), used remote sensing data for six periods from 1980 to 2020, and employed the land transfer matrix, eco-environmental quality index, ecological contribution rate of land-use transformation and geographical detectors to analyze the changes in the territorial spatial patterns, eco-environmental effects and driving forces of eco-environmental quality. The results revealed that (1) the spatial distribution of the province was characterized by the relative agglomeration of the production and living spaces and the absolute dominance of ecological spaces; (2) The eco-environmental quality of the region portrayed a steady improvement, with a significant reduction in the medium-low and low-quality areas; and (3) the annual average precipitation, proportion of non-agricultural area, and socio-economic factors had a significant impact on the eco-environmental quality of the region, meanwhile, national economy and ecological policies are important indirect driving forces of eco-environmental quality. Our findings will provide guidelines for territorial spatial management and serve as a reference for eco-environmental protection in Qinghai.

TI  - Responses of NDVI to Climate Change and LUCC along Large-Scale Transportation Projects in Fragile Karst Areas, SW China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The fragile karst habitat is extremely sensitive to human activities such as large-scale engineering construction. To explore the influence of the construction and operation of the GH (Guiyang-Huangguoshu) highway on the vegetation within a certain range and the response of NDVI to climate factors, Landsat data were used to synthesize annual NDVI maps using the maximum value compositing method. Trend, correlation, and coefficient of variation analyses were performed. The results demonstrate that: (1) During the construction and operation periods, NDVI showed an overall upward trend, and the NDVI value and growth rate in the contrast area were greater than those in the core area; (2) the correlation between temperature and vegetation cover along the GH highway was stronger than that between precipitation and vegetation; (3) construction of the GH highway has had a significant impact on the surrounding vegetation, with the impact on vegetation ecology along the road mainly concentrated within the 2 km range. The increase of artificial surfaces along the road has had a great impact on the NDVI, and the vegetation cover change in the core area is more significant than that in the contrast area; and (4) the overall disturbance of the GH highway project to the surrounding ecology was mainly observed in the form of low and medium fluctuations. This study aims to provide a reference for environmental assessment and management in karst areas.

TI  - The Monitoring and Analysis of Land Subsidence in Kunming (China) Supported by Time Series InSAR
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - As urban construction has been leaping forward recently, large-scale land subsidence has been caused in Kunming due to the special hydrogeological conditions of the city; the subsidence scope has stretched out, and the subsidence rate has been rising year by year. As a consequence, Kunming's sustainable development has seriously hindered. The PS-InSAR (Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) and the SBAS-InSAR (Small Baseline Subsets Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) technologies were adopted to process the descending Sentinel-1A data stacks from July 2018 to November 2020 to monitor the land subsidence of Kunming, so as to ensure the sustainable development of the city. Moreover, the causes were analyzed. As revealed by the results, (1) the overall subsidence trend of Kunming was large in the south (Dian lakeside), whereas it was relatively small in the north. The significant subsidence areas showed major distributions in Xishan, Guandu and Jining district. The maximal average subsidence rates of PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR were -78 mm/a and -88 mm/a, respectively. (2) The ground Subsidence field of Kunming was analyzed, and the correlation coefficient R-2 of the two methods was reported as 0.997. In comparison with the leveling data of the identical period, the root mean square error (RMSE) is 6.5 mm/a and 8.5 mm/a, respectively. (3) Based on the urban subway construction data, geological structure, groundwater extraction data and precipitation, the causes of subsidence were examined. As revealed by the results, under considerable urban subways construction, special geological structures and excessive groundwater extraction, the consolidation and compression of the ground surface could cause the regional large-area subsidence. Accordingly, the monthly average precipitation in Kunming in the identical period was collected for time series analysis, thereby indicating that the land subsidence showed obvious seasonal variations with the precipitation. The results of this study can provide data support and facilitate the decision-making for land subsidence assessment, forecasting and construction planning in Kunming.

TI  - Estimation of Snow Depth from AMSR2 and MODIS Data based on Deep Residual Learning Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) brightness temperature (TB) observations have long been utilized for snow depth (SD) estimation. However, the traditional approaches which are based on 'point-to-point' predictions ignore the spatial heterogeneity within a AMSR2 pixel and are limited by the coarse spatial resolution of the AMSR2 sensor. To solve these problems, a novel deep 'area-to-point' SD estimation model, based on a deep residual learning network by combining convolutional neural networks (CNN) and residual blocks, was proposed. The model utilizes all channels of AMSR2 TB data along with Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference snow index (NDSI) data and auxiliary geographic information. Taking the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) as the study area, the SD with a spatial resolution of 0.005 degrees over the 2019-2020 snow season is estimated, and the accuracy is validated by in situ SD observations from 116 stations. The results show that: (1) the proposed SD estimation model shows desirable accuracy as the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias error (MBE), and coefficient of determination (R-2) of the proposed SD estimation method are 2.000 cm, 0.656 cm, -0.013 cm, and 0.847, respectively. (2) The SD estimation error is slightly larger in medium elevation or medium slope or grassland areas, and the RMSE is 2.247 cm, 3.084 cm, and 2.213 cm, respectively. (3) The proposed SD estimation method has the most satisfactory performance in low-elevation regions, and the RMSE is only 0.523 cm. The results indicate that through considering the spatial heterogeneity of snow cover and utilizing the high spatial resolution snow information presented by the MODIS snow cover product, the proposed model has good SD estimation accuracy, which is promising for application in other study regions.

TI  - Probabilistic Tracking of Annual Cropland Changes over Large, Complex Agricultural Landscapes Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland expansion is expected to increase across sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries in the next thirty years to meet growing food needs across the continent. These land transformations will have cascading social and ecological impacts that can be monitored using novel Earth observation techniques that produce datasets complementary to national cropland surveys. In this study, we present a flexible Bayesian data synthesis workflow on Google Earth Engine (GEE) that can be used to fuse optical and synthetic aperture radar data and demonstrate its ability to track agricultural change at national scales. We adapted the previously developed Bayesian Updating of Land Cover (Unsupervised) algorithm (BULC-U) by integrating a shapelet and slope thresholding algorithm to identify the locations and dates of cropland expansion and implemented a tiling scheme to allow the processing of large volumes of imagery. We apply this approach to map annual cropland change from 2000 to 2015 for Zambia (750,000 km(2)), a country that is experiencing rapid growth in agricultural land. We applied our cropland mapping approach to a time series of unsupervised classifications developed from Landsat 5, 7, 8, Sentinel-1, and ALOS PALSAR within 1476 tiles covering Zambia. The annual cropland changes maps reveal active cropland expansion between 2000 to 2015 in Zambia, especially in the Southern, Central, and Eastern provinces. Our accuracy assessment estimates that we have identified 27.5% to 69.6% of the total cropland expansion from 2000 to 2015 in Zambia (commission errors between 6.1% to 37.6%), depending on the slope threshold. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of Bayesian data fusion and shapelet, slope-based thresholding to synthesize optical and synthetic aperture radar for monitoring agricultural changes in situations where training data are scarce. In addition, the annual cropland maps provide one of the first spatially continuous, annually incremented accounts of cropland growth in this region. Our flexible, cloud-based workflow using GEE enables multi-sensor, national-scale agricultural change monitoring at low cost for users.

TI  - Calibration Inter-Comparison of MODIS and VIIRS Reflective Solar Bands Using Lunar Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral band observations from Terra and Aqua MODIS, launched in December 1999 and May 2002, respectively, and from SNPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS, launched in November 2011 and October 2017, respectively, have continuously enabled a broad range of applications and studies of the Earth system and its changes via a set of geophysical and environmental parameters. The quality of MODIS and VIIRS science and environmental data products relies strongly on the calibration accuracy and stability of individual sensors, as well as their calibration consistency, especially for the data products generated using observations from sensors across different platforms. Both MODIS and VIIRS instruments carry a similar set of on-board calibrators for their on-orbit calibration. Besides, lunar observations are regularly scheduled and implemented in support of their reflective solar bands (RSB) calibration, especially their long-term stability monitoring. In this paper, we provide an overview of MODIS and VIIRS solar and lunar calibration methodologies applied for the RSB on-orbit calibration, and describe the approach developed for their calibration inter-comparisons using lunar observations, including corrections for the effects caused by differences in the relative spectral response and adopted solar spectra between individual sensors. The MODIS and VIIRS calibration inter-comparison results derived from their regularly scheduled lunar observations are presented and discussed, including associated uncertainties and a comparison with those derived using the Earth-view targets. Also discussed are remaining challenges in lunar calibration and inter-comparison for the Earth-observing sensors, as well as on-going efforts for future improvements.

TI  - Analysis of Potential Precursory Pattern at Earth Surface and the Above Atmosphere and Ionosphere Preceding Two Mw ≥ 7 Earthquakes in Mexico in 2020-2021
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Comprehensive analyses of seismic precursory characteristics may provide evidence for the possible mechanisms of lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling (LAIC). The integrated monitoring data from space and ground measurements makes it possible to reveal the potential earthquake precursory pattern obeying LAIC. In this paper, we study seismic precursors from air temperature data of the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) based Total Electron Content (TEC) and electron density retrieved from Swarm satellite (Alpha) data in two Mw >= 7.0 earthquakes in Mexico in 2020-2021. We find seismic thermal anomalies can be identified from temperature variation in the lithosphere and atmosphere by improved tidal force fluctuant analysis (TFFA). The spatial-temporal evolution of seismic thermal anomalies is significantly different from that of non-seismic thermal anomalies. In addition, synergistic observations of the Swarm Alpha satellite and GNSS stations can provide more comprehensive information about perturbations in the ionosphere. The results show that anomalies originate along fault lineaments near the epicenter, leading to air pressure gradient and ionization process in the atmosphere, followed by ionospheric perturbations. Furthermore, composite anomalies of LAIC first appear around a month before earthquakes and tend to recur several times over earthquake preparation phases. Our study provides more evidence for understanding the characteristics of earthquake precursors.Plain Language Summary The physical processes of earthquake preparation have triggered plenty of scientific interest and discussion. The information and energy can be transported from underground to the lithosphere, atmosphere, and ionosphere, in the form of various precursors before earthquakes. However, previous studies reported the inconsistent occurrence time of observed precursors in the lithosphere, atmosphere, and ionosphere. It is necessary to explore the earthquake precursory pattern to integrate different types of anomalies and tease out their temporal relationship. We apply tidal force fluctuant analysis to anomaly detection of atmospheric and surface temperature based on National Center for Environmental Prediction reanalysis data, and Swarm Alpha satellite data and GNSS stations data are used to detect ionospheric perturbations. The results from two earthquakes in Mexico, Mw = 7.4 earthquake in 2020 and Mw = 7.0 earthquake in 2021, show that precursors follow the time rule from the lithosphere to the atmosphere and then to the ionosphere. Also, earthquake precursors appear around a month before earthquakes and have repeatability. This pattern could provide an important advance for earthquake prediction from multi-source data.

TI  - Retrieval of aerosol optical depth from GF-6 wide field of view 16-m data based on deep blue algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is an important indicator for air pollution monitoring. We obtain AOD from the GF-6 satellite, which was launched on June 2, 2018 by China. Beijing is selected as the study area. Based on the deep blue algorithm, the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer surface reflectance product is used to correct and establish the surface reflectance library, and the AOD is retrieved from the GF-6 wide field of view (WFV) blue band. So, the application of the deep blue algorithm in a GF-6 WFV camera is realized. The aerosol is divided into three models: a custom model, a continental model, and an urban model in second simulation of the satellite signal in the solar spectrum model. To improve the accuracy of retrieval results, we recalculated the aerosol component concentration ratio based on GF-6 WFV data and ground observation as the custom model. The retrieval results of the three aerosol models show that the central and southern urban areas are higher than the mountainous areas in the northwest, indicating that human emission is the main source of air pollution in Beijing. The retrieval results of the custom model, continental model, and urban model are compared with the ground observation. The error of urban model retrieval is large, and the determination coefficient R-2 is only 0.3671. The results of the custom model and continental model are similar. The R-2 of the custom is 0.8942, which is higher than that of the continental (0.8872). We analyze the relationship between the retrieved AOD of the three aerosol models and top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and find that the custom AOD has the best sensitivity to TOA reflectance, whereas the urban AOD has the worst sensitivity. So, the custom aerosol model is closer to the real aerosol situation in Beijing. (c) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Can improving the spatial equity of urban green space mitigate the effect of urban heat islands? An empirical study
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The role of urban green space (UGS) in mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effect has been demonstrated in a growing body of literature. However, the potential influence of the spatial equity of UGS distribution on the UHI effect has largely been overlooked. The present study aims to identify this potential influence using the spatial equity of UGS and the land surface temperature (LST) as measures of UGS spatial distribution and UHIs, respectively. A comprehensive spatial distribution map of UGS was generated by combining the UGS coverage fraction data within urban impervious pixels and the green cover data outside urban impervious pixels. Then, the spatial equity of UGS distribution across all urban impervious pixels was determined using the Gini coefficient. In addition, an LST map was derived using the thermal infrared spectral bands of Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS products. A case study of Dongguan, a highly urbanized city in China, showed that (1) the distribution of both UGS and LSTs were spatially aggregated in all the towns of the city, (2) the LST of urban impervious pixels was negatively correlated with the area of surrounding UGS, and (3) the Gini coefficient of UGS was positively correlated with the proportion of hot and cool areas, but negatively correlated with the proportion of medium hot and medium-cool areas. These findings indicate that increasing the amount of UGS is beneficial to the reduction of urban average LSTs, while promoting the spatial equity of UGS distribution is conducive to reducing the spatial aggregation of LSTs within urban areas, thereby improving the overall urban thermal environment. Therefore, as a nature based solution, promoting the spatial equity of UGS distribution could enhance the overall cooling effect of UGS more effectively at the city scale, and thus further underpin the sustainable development of the urban environment.

TI  - A model for the early identification of sentinel lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer based on contrast-enhanced ultrasound and clinical features
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study was designed to establish a model for the early identification of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in patients with breast cancer (BC). The SLN metastasis predictive model was established with a retrospective training set of 365 patients with BC and was re-evaluated using a prospective validation set of 402 patients with BC. The multivariable analysis indicated that the tumor diameter [odds ratio (OR), 1.189; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.124-1.257; P<0.001], menopause (OR, 1.011; 95% CI, 0.603-1.436; P<0.001), estrogen receptor (ER) expression (OR, 3.199; 95% CI, 1.077-6.567; P=0.043) and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) type (OR, 10.563; 95% CI, 6.890-28.372; P<0.001) were independent predictors of SLN status in patients with BC. The SLN metastasis predictive model was as follows: (0.173 x tumor diameter)-(4.490 x menopause) + (2.322 x ER) + (5.445 x CEUS type)-1.9521. In the training set, the model was highly sensitive (83.6%) and specific (94.3%) for the early identification of SLN metastasis. Similarly, in the validation set, the model was highly sensitive (70.4%) and specific (89.5%) for the early identification of SLN metastasis in patients with BC. Overall, in the present study, a model was successfully established to predict SLN metastasis in patients with BC that includes tumor diameter, menopausal status, ER expression and CEUS detection.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Prediction of Ground-Level Ozone Concentration Based on Bayesian Maximum Entropy by Combining Monitoring and Satellite Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ozone (O-3) pollution is one of the predominant environmental problems, and exposure to high O-3 concentrations has a significant negative influence on both human health and ecosystems. Therefore, it is essential to analyze spatio-temporal characteristics of O-3 distribution and to evaluate O-3 exposure levels. In this study, O-3 monitoring and satellite data were used to estimate O-3 daily, seasonal and one-year exposure levels based on the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) model with a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, China. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) results showed that R-2 for daily and one-year exposure levels were 0.81 and 0.69, respectively, and the corresponding values for RMSE were 19.58 mu g/m(3) and 4.40 mu g/m(3), respectively. The simulation results showed that the heavily polluted areas included Tianjin, Cangzhou, Hengshui, Xingtai, and Handan, while the clean areas were mainly located in Chengde, Qinhuangdao, Baoding, and Zhangjiakou. O-3 pollution in summer was the most severe with an average concentration of 134.5 mu g/m(3). In summer, O-3 concentrations in 87.7% of the grids were more than 100 mu g/m(3). In contrast, winter was the cleanest season in the BTH region, with an average concentration of 51.1 mu g/m(3).

TI  - A Group-Wise Feature Enhancement-and-Fusion Network with Dual-Polarization Feature Enrichment for SAR Ship Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is a significant and challenging task. However, most existing deep learning-based SAR ship detection approaches are confined to single-polarization SAR images and fail to leverage dual-polarization characteristics, which increases the difficulty of further improving the detection performance. One problem that requires a solution is how to make full use of the dual-polarization characteristics and how to excavate polarization features using the ship detection network. To tackle the problem, we propose a group-wise feature enhancement-and-fusion network with dual-polarization feature enrichment (GWFEF-Net) for better dual-polarization SAR ship detection. GWFEF-Net offers four contributions: (1) dual-polarization feature enrichment (DFE) for enriching the feature library and suppressing clutter interferences to facilitate feature extraction; (2) group-wise feature enhancement (GFE) for enhancing each polarization semantic feature to highlight each polarization feature region; (3) group-wise feature fusion (GFF) for fusing multi-scale polarization features to realize polarization features' group-wise information interaction; (4) hybrid pooling channel attention (HPCA) for channel modeling to balance each polarization feature's contribution. We conduct sufficient ablation studies to verify the effectiveness of each contribution. Extensive experiments on the Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR ship dataset demonstrate the superior performance of GWFEF-Net, with 94.18% in average precision (AP), compared with the other ten competitive methods. Specifically, GWFEF-Net can yield a 2.51% AP improvement compared with the second-best method.

TI  - Mechanical Property Model of Q620 High-Strength Steel with Corrosion Effects
T2  - BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-strength steel (HSS) is widely used in engineering structures, due to its superior material performance, but corrosion tends to occur in steel structures with time. The corrosion effects on mechanical performance of Q620 HSS were investigated experimentally. The electrochemical accelerated corrosion test was conducted to generate corroded Q620 HSS specimens (rho = 0 similar to 60%). With increases in the corrosion degree, corrosion performance became more and more non-uniform. The tensile coupon test was conducted to clarify mechanical properties of corroded Q620 HSS specimens. With increases in corrosion degree, f(y), f(u), epsilon(u) and E decreased, correspondingly. The effect of corrosion on e y could be ignored. With the deepening of corrosion, the necking of Q620 HSS specimens was weakened, which reduced their ductility. The simplified constitutive model consisting of nominal yield point (epsilon(y), f(y)) and ultimate point (epsilon(u), f(u)) was proposed to quantify the mechanical properties of Q620 HSS with different corrosion degrees. After the numerical fitting, relationships between the corrosion degree and mechanical properties were clarified. Based on the results of numerical fitting, mechanical properties of corroded Q620 HSS specimens were worse than those of specimens with idealized uniform corrosion. The adverse effect of corrosion on epsilon(uc) was more obvious than that on strength properties. Comparison among different mild steels and HSSs was performed. Different indexes were chosen to clarify corrosion effects on the ductility of corroded Q620 HSS specimens. This study considers and discusses the research on corrosion rates, the relationships between service time, service environment, corrosion form and strength properties of Q620 HSS.

TI  - Multi-Source Time Series Remote Sensing Feature Selection and Urban Forest Extraction Based on Improved Artificial Bee Colony
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forests maintain the ecological balance of cities and are significant in promoting the sustainable development of cities. Therefore, using advanced remote sensing technology to accurately extract forest green space in the city and monitor its change in real-time is very important. Taking Nanjing as the study area, this research extracted 55 vegetation phenological features from Sentinel-2A time series images and formed a feature set containing 81 parameters together with 26 features, including polarimetric- and texture-related information extracted from dual-polarization Sentinel-1A data. On the basis of the improved ABC (ABC-LIBSVM) feature selection method, the optimal feature subset was selected, and the forest coverage areas in the study area were accurately described. To verify the feasibility of the improved feature selection method and explore the potential for the development of multi-source time series remote sensing for urban forest feature extraction, this paper also used the random forest classification model to classify four different feature sets. The results revealed that the classification accuracy based on the feature set obtained by the ABC-LIBSVM algorithm was the highest, with an overall accuracy of 86.80% and a kappa coefficient of 0.8145. The producer accuracy and user accuracy of the urban forest were 93.21% and 82.45%, respectively. Furthermore, by combining the multi-source time series Sentinel-2A optical images with Sentinel-1A dual-polarization SAR images, urban forests can be distinguished from the perspective of phenology, and polarimetric- and texture-related features can contribute to the accurate identification of forests.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Automatic Extraction of Cyanobacterial Blooms from Sentinel-2 MSI Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) in inland water have emerged as a major global environmental challenge. Although satellite remote sensing technology has been widely used to monitor CyanoHABs, there are also some automatic extraction methods of CyanoHABs based on spectral indices (such as gradient mode, fixed threshold, and the Otsu method, etc.), the accuracy is generally not very high. This study developed a high-precision automatic extraction model for CyanoHABs using a deep learning (DL) network based on Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument (MSI) data of Chaohu Lake, China. First, we generated the CyanoHABs "ground truth" dataset based on visual interpretation. Thereafter, we trained the CyanoHABs extraction model based on a DL image segmentation network (U-Net) and extracted CyanoHABs. Then, we compared three previous automatic CyanoHABs extraction methods based on spectral index threshold segmentation and evaluated the accuracy of the results. Based on "ground truth", at the pixel level, the F1 score and relative error (RE) of the DL model extraction results are 0.90 and 3%, respectively, which are better than that of the gradient mode (0.81,40%), the fixed threshold (0.81, 31%), and the Otsu method (0.53, 62%); at CyanoHABs area level, the R-2 of the scatter fitting between DL model result and the "ground truth" is 0.99, which is also higher than the other three methods (0.90, 0.92, 0.84, respectively). Finally, we produced the annual CyanoHABs frequency map based on DL model results. The frequency map showed that the CyanoHABs on the northwest bank are significantly higher than in the center and east of Chaohu Lake, and the most serious CyanoHABs occurred in 2018 and 2019. Furthermore, CyanoHAB extraction based on this model did not cause cloud misjudgment and exhibited good promotion ability in Taihu Lake, China. Hence, our findings indicate the high potential of the CyanoHABs extraction model based on DL in further high-precision and automatic extraction of CyanoHABs from large-scale water bodies.

TI  - A Random Forest Algorithm for Landsat Image Chromatic Aberration Restoration Based on GEE Cloud Platform-A Case Study of Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the growth of cloud computing, the use of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to conduct research on water inversion, natural disaster monitoring, and land use change using long time series of Landsat images has also gradually become mainstream. Landsat images are currently one of the most important image data sources for remote sensing inversion. As a result of changes in time and weather conditions in single-view images, varying image radiances are acquired; hence, using a monthly or annual time scale to mosaic multi-view images results in strip color variation. In this study, the NDWI and MNDWI within 50 km of the coastline of the Yucatan Peninsula from 1993 to 2021 are used as the object of study on GEE platform, and mosaic areas with chromatic aberrations are reconstructed using Landsat TOA (top of atmosphere reflectance) and SR (surface reflectance) images as the study data. The DN (digital number) values and probability distributions of the reference image and the image to be restored are classified and counted independently using the random forest algorithm, and the classification results of the reference image are mapped to the area of the image to be restored in a histogram-matching manner. MODIS and Sentinel-2 NDWI products are used for comparison and validation. The results demonstrate that the restored Landsat NDWI and MNDWI images do not exhibit obvious band chromatic aberration, and the image stacking is smoother; the Landsat TOA images provide improved results for the study of water bodies, and the correlation between the restored Landsat SR and TOA images with the Sentinel-2 data is as high as 0.5358 and 0.5269, respectively. In addition, none of the existing Landsat NDWI products in the GEE platform can effectively eliminate the chromatic aberration of image bands.

TI  - The Description and Application of BRDF Based on Shape Vectors for Typical Landcovers
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - As the inherent attribute of land cover, anisotropy leads to the heterogeneity of directional reflection; meanwhile, it creates the opportunity for retrieving characteristics of land surface based on multi-angle observations. BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) is the theoretical expression of anisotropy and describes the reflectance in terms of incident-view geometry. Prior BRDF knowledge is used to achieve the multi-angle retrieval for earth observation systems with a narrow FOV (Field of View). Shape indicators are a feasible way to capture the characteristics of BRDF or to build an a priori database of BRDF. However, existing shape indicators based on the ratio of reflectance or the weight of scattering effects are too rough to describe the BRDF's shape. Thus, it is necessary to propose new shape vectors to satisfy the demand. We selected six typical land covers from MODIS-MCD12 on the homogeneous underlayers as the study sites in North America. The daily BRDF is retrieved by MODIS-BRDF parameters and the RossThick-LiSparseR model. When the SZA (Solar Zenith Angle) is set at 45 degrees, seven directions (-70 degrees, -45 degrees, -20 degrees, 0 degrees, 20 degrees, 45 degrees, and 70 degrees) including edge spot, zenith spot, hot spot and approximate dark spot of the BRDF principal plane were selected to construct two vectors by the change rate of reflectance and angle formulation: Partial Anisotropic Vector (PAV) and Angular Effect Vector (AEV). Then, we assessed the effectiveness of PAV and AEV compared with ANIX (Anisotropic Index), ANIF (Anisotropic Factor) and AFX (Anisotropic Flat Index) by two typical BRDF shapes. The representativeness of PAV and AEV for the original BRDF was also assessed by cosine similarity and error transfer function. Lastly, the application of hot spot components in AEV for land cover classification, the monitoring of land cover in mining areas and the adjustment effect by NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) were investigated. The results show that (1) the shape vectors have good representativeness compared with original BRDF. The representativeness of PAV assessed by cosine similarity is 0.980, 0.979 and 0.969, and the representativeness of AEV assessed by error transfer function is 0.987, 0.991 and 0.994 in the three MODIS broadbands of Near Infrared (NIR, 0.7-5.0 mu m), Short Wave (SW, 0.3-5.0 mu m) and Visible (VIS, 0.3-0.7 mu m). (2) Some components of shape vectors have high correlation with AFX. The correlation coefficient between hot spot components in AEV and AFX is 0.936, 0.945 and 0.863, respectively, in NIR, SW and VIS bands. (3) The shape vectors show potentiality for land cover classification and the monitoring of land cover in mining areas. The correlation coefficients of hot spot components in AEV for MODIS-pixels with the same types (0.557, 0.561, 0.527) are significantly higher than MODIS-pixels with various types (0.069, 0.055, 0.051) in NIR, SW and VIS bands. The coefficients of variation for hot spot components are significantly higher after land reclamation (0.0071, 0.0099) than before land reclamation (0.0020, 0.0028). (4) The correlation between NDVI and the BRDF shapes is poor in three MODIS broad bands. The correlation coefficients between NDVI and the BRDF shapes in three temporal scales of annual, seasonal and monthly phases are only 0.134, 0.063 and 0.038 (NIR), 0.199, 0.185 and 0.165 (SW), and 0.323, 0.320 and 0.337 (VIS), on average.

TI  - Improving Landslide Recognition on UAV Data through Transfer Learning
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - As a frequent geological disaster, landslides cause serious casualties and economic losses every year. When landslides occur, rapid access to disaster information is the premise of implementing disaster relief and reduction. Traditional satellite remote sensing may not be able to timely obtain the image data from the disaster areas due to orbital cycle and weather impacts. Visual interpretation of remote sensing data and machine learning methods need to be improved the detection efficiency. This paper studies landslide recognition based on the UAV remote sensing image. The affected area of the Zhangmu Port region in Tibet by the Nepal earthquake occurred on 25 April 2015 was selected to carry out the landslide investigation. Aiming at the problem of insufficient training sample data of landslides, we adopt the transfer learning method. The evaluation indexes show that the proposed method can automatically identify landslide disasters. Comparing with the SSD model, our new approach has better detection performance, providing thus accurate data support for scientific decision-making of disaster rescue.

TI  - Winter Wheat Total Nitrogen Content Estimation Based on UAV Hyperspectral Remote Sensing
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen is one of the necessary nutrient elements for crops' growth and development, and crops' total nitrogen content is the main index to characterize its nitrogen status. Monitoring the spatial distribution of winter wheat total nitrogen content at the field scale can assist in accurate and quantitative topdressing and reduce environmental pollution. UAV (Unmanned aerial vehicle) hyperspectral data can provide an important data source for crop growth information inversion due to its high resolution, high timeliness and low cost. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) , a new ensemble learning algorithm with high efficiency and strong generalization ability, can be effectively applied to build a winter wheat total nitrogen content estimation model based on remote sensing data and predict the spatial distribution of winter wheat total nitrogen content at field scale. Therefore, this study selected the winter wheat at the jointing stage in the national soil quality observation and experimental station as the study object and carried out the following work: (1) we obtained the canopy imaging spectral image of winter wheat at the jointing stage with a hyperspectral imager mounted on a low-altitude UAV, and total nitrogen content data of 126 samples combined with ground sampling data. (2) The spectral characteristics of the winter wheat canopy at the jointing stage were analyzed, and the correlation between spectral reflectance of 176 bands and total nitrogen content was analyzed according to the Person correlation coefficient. (3) A winter wheat total nitrogen content estimation model based on UAV hyperspectral at the jointing stage was built with the XGBoost algorithm under different soil fertility conditions. The results showed that; (1) there was a strong correlation between spectral reflectance and total nitrogen content of winter wheat in 176 bands, and the correlation coefficients between spectral reflectance and total nitrogen content in all bands except 735. 5 nm were greater than 0. 5; (2) The UAV hyperspectral remote sensing estimation model of winter wheat total nitrogen content at jointing stage based on XGBoost algorithm shows high accuracy (R-2 = 0. 76, RMSE = 2. 68); (3) The estimation model of winter wheat total nitrogen content based on XGBoost algorithm can obtain the spatial distribution map of total nitrogen content at field scale under different soil fertility conditions, which shows a significant spatial difference on the whole. This study can provide a scientific basis for the accurate and quantitative topdressing of winter wheat and also provide a reference for the application of UAV hyperspectral remote sensing in precision agriculture.

TI  - A Multi-Temporal Network for Improving Semantic Segmentation of Large-Scale Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of deep learning, semantic segmentation technology has gradually become the mainstream technical method in large-scale multi-temporal landcover classification. Large-scale and multi-temporal are the two significant characteristics of Landsat imagery. However, the mainstream single-temporal semantic segmentation network lacks the constraints and assistance of pre-temporal information, resulting in unstable results, poor generalization ability, and inconsistency with the actual situation in the multi-temporal classification results. In this paper, we propose a multi-temporal network that introduces pre-temporal information as prior constrained auxiliary knowledge. We propose an element-wise weighting block module to improve the fine-grainedness of feature optimization. We propose a chained deduced classification strategy to improve multi-temporal classification's stability and generalization ability. We label the large-scale multi-temporal Landsat landcover classification dataset with an overall classification accuracy of over 90%. Through extensive experiments, compared with the mainstream semantic segmentation methods, our proposed multi-temporal network achieves state-of-the-art performance with good robustness and generalization ability.

TI  - A Prior Semantic Network for Large-Scale Landcover Change of Landsat Imagery
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landcover change can reflect changes in the natural environment and the impact of human activities. Remotely sensed big data with large-scale and multi-temporal key characteristics provide the data support for landcover change information extraction. The development of deep learning provides technical method support for information extraction from remotely sensed big data. However, the current mainstream deep learning change detection methods only establish the changing relationship between two phases of images. They cannot directly extract the ground object categories before and after the change. It is easily affected by pseudo-changes caused by the color difference of multi-temporal images, resulting in many false detections. In this paper, we propose a prior semantic network and a difference enhancement block module to establish prior guidance and constraints on changing features to solve the pseudo-change problem. We propose a semantic-change integrated single-task network, which can simultaneously extract multi-temporal landcover classification and landcover change. On the self-made, large-scale multi-temporal Landsat dataset, we have performed multi-temporal landcover change information extraction, reaching an overall accuracy of 83.1% and achieving state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we thoroughly analyzed the landcover change results in the study area from 2005 to 2020.

TI  - High-Resolution Inversion Method for the Snow Water Equivalent Based on the GF-3 Satellite and Optimized EQeau Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution snow water equivalent studies are important for obtaining a clear picture of the potential of water resources in arid areas, and SAR-based sensors can achieve meter-level snow water equivalent inversion. The advanced C-band SAR satellite Gaofen-3 (GF-3) can now achieve meter-level observations of the same area within one day and has great potential for the inversion of the snow water equivalent. The EQeau model is an empirical method for snow water equivalent inversion using C-band SAR satellites, but the model has major accuracy problems. In this paper, the EQeau model is improved by using classification of underlying surface types and polarization decomposition, and the inversion of the snow water equivalent was also completed using the new data source GF-3 input model. The results found that: (1) the classification of underlying surface types can significantly improve the fit between the snow thermal resistance and the backscattering coefficient ratio; (2) the accuracy of the snow density extracted by the GF-3 satellite using the Singh-Cloude Three-Component Hybrid (S3H) decomposition is better than IDW spatial interpolation, and the overall RMSE can reach 0.005 g/cm(3); (3) the accuracy of the optimized EQeau model is significantly improved, and the overall MRE is reduced from 27.4% to 10.3%. Compared with the original model, the optimized model is superior both in terms of verification accuracy and image detail. In the future, with the combination of advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), long, gapless, all-weather, and high-resolution snow water equivalent inversion can be achieved, which is conducive to the realization of all-weather monitoring of the regional snow water equivalent.

TI  - Water Quality Retrieval from ZY1-02D Hyperspectral Imagery in Urban Water Bodies and Comparison with Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-optically active water quality parameters in water bodies are important evaluation indicators in monitoring urban water quality. Over the past years, satellite remote sensing techniques have increasingly been used to assess different types of substances in urban water bodies. However, it is challenging to retrieve accurate data for some of the non-optically active water quality parameters from satellite images due to weak spectral characteristics. This study aims to examine the potential of ZY1-02D hyperspectral images in retrieving non-optical active water quality parameters, including dissolved oxygen (DO), permanganate index (CODMn), and total phosphorus (TP) in urban rivers and lakes. We first simulated the in situ measured reflectance to the satellite equivalent reflectance using the ZY1-02D and Sentinel-2 spectral response function. Further, we used four machine learning models to compare the retrieval performance of these two sensors with different bandwidths. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) are 24.28%, 18.44%, and 37.04% for DO, CODMn, and TP, respectively, and the root mean square errors (RMSE) are 1.67, 0.96, and 0.07 mg/L, respectively. Finally, we validated the accuracy and consistency of aquatic products retrieved from ZY1-02D and Sentinel-2 images. The remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) products of ZY1-02D are slightly overestimated compared to Sentinel-2 R-rs. ZY1-02D has high accuracy and consistency in mapping CODMn products in urban water. The results show the potential of ZY1-02D hyperspectral images in mapping non-optically active water quality parameters.

TI  - Pilot Influenza Syndromic Surveillance System Based on Absenteeism and Temperature in China: Development and Usability Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Shortcomings of the current school-based infectious disease syndromic surveillance system (SSS) in China include relying on school physicians to collect data manually and ignoring the health information of students in attendance.Objective: This study aimed to design and implement an influenza SSS based on the absenteeism (collected by face recognition) and temperature of attending students (measured by thermal imaging). Methods: An SSS was implemented by extending the functionality of an existing application. The system was implemented in 2 primary schools and 1 junior high school in the Yangtze River Delta, with a total of 3535 students. The examination period was from March 1, 2021, to January 14, 2022, with 174 effective days. The daily and weekly absenteeism and fever rates reported by the system (DAR1 and DFR; WAR1 and WFR) were calculated. The daily and weekly absenteeism rates reported by school physicians (DAR2 and WAR2) and the weekly positive rate of influenza virus (WPRIV, released by the Chinese National Influenza Center) were used as standards to evaluate the quality of the data reported by the system.Results: Absenteeism reported by school physicians (completeness 86.7%) was 36.5% of that reported by this system (completeness 100%), and a significant positive correlation between them was detected (r=0.372, P=.002). When the influenza activity level was moderate, DAR1s were significantly positively correlated among schools (rab=0.508, P=.004; rbc=0.427, P=.02; rac=0.447, P=.01). During the influenza breakout, the gap of DAR1s widened. WAR1 peaked 2 weeks earlier in schools A and B than in school C. Variables significantly positively correlated with the WPRIV were the WAR1 and WAR2 of school A, WAR1 of school C, and WFR of school B. The correlation between the WAR1 and WPRIV was greater than that between the WAR2 and WPRIV in school A. Addition of the WFR to the WAR1 of school B increased the correlation between the WAR1 and WPRIV.Conclusions: Data demonstrated that absenteeism calculation based on face recognition was reliable, but the accuracy of the temperature recorded by the infrared thermometer should be enhanced. Compared with similar SSSs, this system has superior simplicity, cost-effectiveness, data quality, sensitivity, and timeliness.

TI  - A Cooperative Routing Scheme Using Inter-Satellite Links to Assist Data Downloading for LEO Satellite Networks
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks can provide Internet service to users in areas where cellular networks are difficult to deploy. One critical function of satellites is to transfer data from satellite networks to ground core network through earth stations (ESs). The Ka-band multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) can be used to establish feeder links with larger bandwidth between satellites and ESs. However, propagation at the Ka band is subjected to rain attenuation and various atmospheric fading mechanisms, which severely reduce the maximum link capacity. As a result, the insufficient capacity of feed link becomes the throughput bottleneck of satellite networks. In order to increase network throughput, it is important to fully use feeder link resources. In this paper, we propose a cooperation scheme to route packets to ESs through a well-resourced feeder link, such that the bandwidth of the feeder links can be fully utilized and the throughput of data downloading at the ESs is maximized. Firstly, we model the satellite network system and the feeder link based on MIMO technology. Then, a Maximum-Flow-Minimum-Cost (MCMF) routing algorithm consisting of two Linear Programs (LPs) is presented to compute maximum-flow routings for data download. Eventually, a variety of simulations are conducted to assess the proposed scheme, which shows that the cooperative routing scheme outperforms the existing SiRRS method in terms of throughput and delay.

TI  - Landslide Detection and Mapping Based on SBAS-InSAR and PS-InSAR: A Case Study in Gongjue County, Tibet, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rock mass along the Jinsha River is relatively broken under complex geological action. Many ancient landslides were distributed along the Jinsha River in Gongjue County, which is very dangerous under the action of gravity, tectonic stress and river erosion. Efficient and accurate identification and monitoring of landslides is important for disaster monitoring and early warning. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology has been proved to be an effective technology for landslide hazard identification and mapping. However, great uncertainty inevitably exists due to the single deformation observation method, resulting in wrong judgment during the process of landslide detection. Therefore, to address the uncertainties arising from single observations, a cross-comparison method is put forward using SBAS-InSAR (small baseline subset InSAR) and PS-InSAR (permanent scatterers InSAR) technology. Comparative analysis of the spatial complementarity of interference points and temporal deformation refined the deformation characteristics and verified the reliability of the InSAR results, aiding in the comprehensive identification and further mapping of landslides. Landslides along the Jinsha River in Gongjue County were studied in this paper. Firstly, 14 landslides with a total area of 20 km(2) were identified by using two time-series InSAR methods. Then, the deformation characteristics of these landslides were validated by UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) images, multiresource remote sensing data and field investigation. Further, the precipitation data were introduced to analyze the temporal deformation characteristics of two large landslides. Lastly, the influence of fault activity on landslide formation is further discussed. Our results demonstrate that the cross-comparison of the time-series InSAR method can effectively verify the accuracy of landslide identification.

TI  - Glacier Mass Loss Simulation Based on Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study of the Yala Glacier and the Qiyi Glacier in the Third Pole
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate warming over the Third Pole is twice as large as that in other regions and glacier mass loss is considered to be more intensive in the region. However, due to the vast geographical differences, the characteristics of glacier mass loss might be very different between different parts of the Third Pole, such as between the southern and northern Third Pole. It is, therefore, very important to clarify the characteristics of glacier mass loss between different parts of the Third Pole, particularly between the southern and northern Third Pole. We selected the Yala Glacier in the Central Himalayas and the Qiyi Glacier in the Qilian Mountains to study the different characteristics of glacier mass loss between the southern and northern Third Pole using remote sensing data and in situ data. Based on the results, we found that the Yala Glacier has not only been in a status of mass loss but also in a status of intensive and accelerating mass loss. Our analysis showed that the average multi-year mass loss of the Yala Glacier is -736 mm w.e.a(-1), with a maximum of -1815 mm w.e.a(-1). At the same time, the Qiyi Glacier has experienced a mild glacier mass loss process compared with the Yala Glacier. The Qiyi Glacier's mass loss is -567 mm w.e.a(-1) with a maximum of -1516 mm w.e.a(-1). Our results indicate that the mass loss of the Yala Glacier is much stronger than that of the Qiyi Glacier. The major cause of the stronger mass loss of the Yala Glacier is from the decrease of glacier accumulation associated with precipitation decrease under the weakening Indian monsoon. Other factors have also contributed to the more intensive mass loss of the Yala Glacier.

TI  - Detection of Ships Cruising in the Azimuth Direction Using Spotlight SAR Images with a Deep Learning Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spotlight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) achieves a high azimuth resolution with long integration times. Meanwhile, the long integration times also cause defocused and smeared images of moving objects such as cruising ships This is a typical imaging mechanism for moving objects in Spotlight SAR images. Conversely, ships can be classified as stationary or moving from the amount of smearing, and this classification method is, in general, based on manual observation. This paper proposes an automatic method for detecting cruising ships using deep learning known as the "You Only Look Once (YOLO) v5 model", which is one of the frameworks of the YOLO family. In this study, ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 L-band Spotlight SAR images over the waters around the Miura Peninsula, Japan, were analyzed using the YOLO v5 model with a total of 53 ships' images and compared with Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The results showed a precision of approximately 0.85 and a recall rate of approximately 0.89 with an F-measure of 0.87. Thus, sufficiently high values were achieved in the automatic detection of moving ships using the deep learning method with the YOLO v5 model. As for false detections, images of breakwaters were classified as ships cruising in the azimuth direction. Further, range moving ships were found to be difficult to detect. From the present preliminary study, it was found that the YOLO v5 model is limited to ships cruising predominantly in the azimuth direction.

TI  - Extinction Effect of Foliar Dust Retention on Urban Vegetation as Estimated by Atmospheric PM10 Concentration in Shenzhen, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Foliar dust retention is a crucial source of uncertainty when monitoring the vegetation index using satellite remote sensing. As ground sampling conditions are limited by vegetation dust retention, separating the extinction effect of foliar dust retention from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) poses a significant challenge. In this study, we conducted a correlation test between the relative change in NDVI (delta NDVI, an indicator of extinction effect) retrieved by the Gaofen-4 satellite and the atmospheric PM10 concentration in different meteorological periods (before, during, and after rainfall) across 14 stations in Shenzhen City, China. The results showed a significant correlation between delta NDVI and atmospheric PM10 concentration during the before-rainfall period and weaker correlations for the other periods (R = 0.680, p < 0.001, n = 63 when excluding the during- and after-rainfall data). The correlation was more significant for the stations with low NDVI values, and a coastal station had a distinct regression slope of delta NDVI versus PM10 from the other stations, indicating that the extinction effect of foliar dust retention in high-NDVI and coastal areas may not be well predicted by the general delta NDVI-PM10 relationship. This provides a new quantitative basis for estimating the extinction effect of foliar dust retention using PM10 data for future improvement of the accuracy of vegetation monitoring by remote sensing.

TI  - A Tunable Dual-Circularly Polarized Antenna With Broadband Triple-Branched Feed Structure
T2  - IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel reconfigurable circularly polarized (CP) patch antenna with tunable operation band and switchable polarization states is proposed. Four varactors are placed symmetrically across the cross-shaped slot on the upper square patch so that the operation band of the proposed antenna can be continuously controlled through the specially designed bias. Meanwhile, a triplebranched broadband switchable feed structure loaded with p-i-n diodes is specially designed to achieve polarization reconfigurability (LHCP, RHCP). The structure novelly integrated a 180 degrees broadband phase shifter with a 90 degrees one by a shared reference branch. Simulation results of the feed structure exhibit stable phase-shift in a wide bandwidth of 58.7% under +/- 5 degrees phase imbalance. A prototype of the antenna is fabricated while both measured and simulated results agree well. The antenna achieves good impedance matching from 2 to 2.7 GHz and the axial ratios at both polarization states are smaller than 3 dB. The frequency and polarization reconfigurabilitymake the antenna potentially suitable for satellite applications, such as multifrequency satellite data link transceiver.

TI  - The Temporal-Spatial Characteristics of Column NO<sub>2</sub> Concentration and Influence Factors in Xinjiang of Northwestern Arid Region in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the temporal-spatial characteristics of column NO2 concentration and influence factors in Xinjiang based on the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the EU/ESA Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite. The findings indicate that there is a high linear correlation between TROPOMI NO2 data and ground-based data, with Yining having the highest correlation (R-2 = 0.8132) and Aksu having the lowest correlation (R-2 = 0.7307). The TROPOMI NO2 data can be used to approximate the characteristics of near-surface atmospheric NO2 concentration. NO2 VCD in the troposphere varies greatly geographically, with a noticeable 'island' pattern. The high-value zones are mostly found on the northern slope of Tianshan Mountain, in the capital cities of several prefectures, and occasionally in the industrial parks. Urumqi has the highest annual average NO2 VCD of 553.9 x 10(-6) mol center dot m(-2). The NO2 VCD is characterized by seasonal shifts and cyclical swings of "low in spring, high in winter, and transition in summer and autumn". The monthly mean value is highest in December (27.14 x 10(-6) mol m(-2)) and lowest in March (12.66 x 10(-6) mol m(-2)). Meteorological factors can influence the temporal and spatial distribution of NO2 VCD. The GRA in Urumqi is 0.774 between the monthly mean of NO2 VCD and relative humidity. The main causes of the increase in NO2 VCD are man-made emissions. The annual GDP of the secondary industry and its annual average NO2 VCD in fifteen key cities in Xinjiang have a correlation coefficient of 0.78. TROPOMI NO2 data can provide strong support for the fine control of air pollution and air quality in early warning forecast in Xinjiang.

TI  - Multi-Modal Feature Fusion Network with Adaptive Center Point Detector for Building Instance Extraction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Building information extraction utilizing remote sensing technology has vital applications in many domains, such as urban planning, cadastral mapping, geographic information censuses, and land-cover change analysis. In recent years, deep learning algorithms with strong feature construction ability have been widely used in automatic building extraction. However, most methods using semantic segmentation networks cannot obtain object-level building information. Some instance segmentation networks rely on predefined detectors and have weak detection ability for buildings with complex shapes and multiple scales. In addition, the advantages of multi-modal remote sensing data have not been effectively exploited to improve model performance with limited training samples. To address the above problems, we proposed a CNN framework with an adaptive center point detector for the object-level extraction of buildings. The proposed framework combines object detection and semantic segmentation with multi-modal data, including high-resolution aerial images and LiDAR data, as inputs. Meanwhile, we developed novel modules to optimize and fuse multi-modal features. Specifically, the local spatial-spectral perceptron can mutually compensate for semantic information and spatial features. The cross-level global context module can enhance long-range feature dependence. The adaptive center point detector explicitly models deformable convolution to improve detection accuracy, especially for buildings with complex shapes. Furthermore, we constructed a building instance segmentation dataset using multi-modal data for model training and evaluation. Quantitative analysis and visualized results verified that the proposed network can improve the accuracy and efficiency of building instance segmentation.

TI  - Characteristics of Snow Depth and Snow Phenology in the High Latitudes and High Altitudes of the Northern Hemisphere from 1988 to 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is an important part of the Earth's surface and its changes affect local and even global climates due to the high albedo and heat insulation. However, it is difficult to directly compare the results of previous studies on changes in snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere mainland (NH) due to the use of different datasets, research methods, or study periods, and a lack comparison in terms of the differences and similarities at high latitudes and high altitudes. By using snow depth datasets, we analyzed the spatio-temporal distributions and variations in snow depth (SD) and snow phenology (SP) in the NH and nine typical areas. This study revealed that SD in the NH generally decreased significantly (p < 0.01) from 1988 to 2018, with a rate of -0.55 cm/decade. Changes in SD were insignificant at high altitudes, but significant decreases were found at high latitudes. With regard to SP, the snow cover onset day (SCOD) advanced in 31.57% of the NH and was delayed in 21.10% of the NH. In typical areas such as the Rocky Mountains, the West Siberian Plain, and the Central Siberian Plateau, the SCOD presented significant advancing trends, while a significant delay was the trend observed in the Eastern European Plain. The snow cover end day (SCED) advanced in 37.29% of the NH and was delayed in 14.77% of the NH. Negative SCED trends were found in most typical areas. The snow cover duration (SCD) and snow season length (SSL) showed significant positive trends in the Rocky Mountains, while significant negative trends were found in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results of this comprehensive comparison showed that most typical areas were characterized by decreased SD, advanced SCOD and SCED, and insignificantly increasing SCD and SSL trends. The SCD and SSL values were similar at high latitudes, while the SSL value was larger than the SCD value at high altitudes. The SD exhibited similar interannual fluctuation characteristics as the SCD and SSL in each typical area. The SCD and SSL increased (decreased) with advanced (delayed) SCODs.

TI  - The Bureya Landslide Recent Evolution According to Spaceborne SAR Interferometry Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study presents the results of interferometric processing and analysis of ALOS-1/2 and Sentinel-1 SAR data acquired over the landslide territory of the Bureya river bank in 2006-2018. The novelty of the study is that, for the first time, the joint analysis of interferometric measurements of the landslide movement with meteorological information and time series of SRTM-X, ALOS-1, and TanDEM-X digital elevation models were performed. The results allowed us to make a conclusion that the Bureya landslide was evolving within the frame of the depression formed by a relict landslide which was stable at least at the beginning of the 21st century. The Bureya reservoir filling in 2003-2009 with a 60 m rise of the water and subsequent seasonal water level oscillations supposedly triggered the landslide activity. The landslide movement in the first decade may be characterized by a stable rate of movement all year around. A steady increase in precipitation level in the second decade, with heavy rainfalls in 2013, 2016, and 2018 led to a prominent acceleration of the landslide rate of movement, especially in warm seasons, with a final landslide in December 2018.

TI  - A Dual Attention Encoding Network Using Gradient Profile Loss for Oil Spill Detection Based on SAR Images
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine oil spills due to ship collisions or operational errors have caused tremendous damage to the marine environment. In order to better monitor the marine environment on a daily basis and reduce the damage and harm caused by oil pollution, we use marine image information acquired by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and combine it with image segmentation techniques in deep learning to monitor oil spills. However, it is a significant challenge to accurately distinguish oil spill areas in original SAR images, which are characterized by high noise, blurred boundaries, and uneven intensity. Hence, we propose a dual attention encoding network (DAENet) using an encoder-decoder U-shaped architecture for identifying oil spill areas. In the encoding phase, we use the dual attention module to adaptively integrate local features with their global dependencies, thus improving the fusion feature maps of different scales. Moreover, a gradient profile (GP) loss function is used to improve the recognition accuracy of the oil spill areas' boundary lines in the DAENet. We used the Deep-SAR oil spill (SOS) dataset with manual annotation for training, testing, and evaluation of the network, and we established a dataset containing original data from GaoFen-3 for network testing and performance evaluation. The results show that DAENet has the highest mIoU of 86.1% and the highest F1-score of 90.2% in the SOS dataset, and it has the highest mIoU of 92.3% and the highest F1-score of 95.1% in the GaoFen-3 dataset. The method proposed in this paper not only improves the detection and identification accuracy of the original SOS dataset, but also provides a more feasible and effective method for marine oil spill monitoring.

TI  - Three-Stream and Double Attention-Based DenseNet-BiLSTM for Fine Land Cover Classification of Complex Mining Landscapes
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The fine classification of land cover around complex mining areas is important for environmental protection and sustainable development. Although some advances have been made in the utilization of high-resolution remote sensing imagery and classification algorithms, the following issues still remain: (1) how the multimodal spectral-spatial and topographic features can be learned for complex mining areas; (2) how the key features can be extracted; and (3) how the contextual information can be captured among different features. In this study, we proposed a novel model comprising the following three main strategies: (1) design comprising a three-stream multimodal feature learning and post-fusion method; (2) integration of deep separable asymmetric convolution blocks and parallel channel and spatial attention mechanisms into the DenseNet architecture; and (3) use of a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to further learn cross-channel context features. The experiments were carried out in Wuhan City, China using ZiYuan-3 imagery. The proposed model was found to exhibit a better performance than other models, with an overall accuracy of 98.65% +/- 0.05% and an improvement of 4.03% over the basic model. In addition, the proposed model yielded an obviously better visual prediction map for the entire study area. Overall, the proposed model is beneficial for multimodal feature learning and complex landscape applications.

TI  - Feature-Ensemble-Based Crop Mapping for Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Data Using Oversampling Algorithms and Gray Wolf Optimizer Support Vector Machine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatial distribution and area of crops are important basic data for assessing agricultural productivity and ensuring food security. Traditional classification methods tend to fit most categories, which will cause the classification accuracy of major crops and minor crops to be too low. Therefore, we proposed an improved Gray Wolf Optimizer support vector machine (GWO-SVM) method with oversampling algorithm to solve the imbalance-class problem in the classification process and improve the classification accuracy of complex crops. Fifteen feature bands were selected based on feature importance evaluation and correlation analysis. Five different smote methods were used to detect samples imbalanced with respect to major and minor crops. In addition, the classification results were compared with support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifier. In order to improve the classification accuracy, we proposed a combined improved GWO-SVM algorithm, using an oversampling algorithm(smote) to extract major crops and minor crops and use SVM and RF as classification comparison methods. The experimental results showed that band 2 (B2), band 4 (B4), band 6 (B6), band 11 (B11), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) had higher feature importance. The classification results oversampling- based of smote, smote-enn, borderline-smote1, borderline-smote2, and distance-smote were significantly improved, with accuracy 2.84%, 2.66%, 3.94%, 4.18%, 6.96% higher than that those without 26 oversampling, respectively. At the same time, compared with SVM and RF, the overall accuracy of improved GWO-SVM was improved by 0.8% and 1.1%, respectively. Therefore, the GWO-SVM model in this study not only effectively solves the problem of equilibrium of complex crop samples in the classification process, but also effectively improves the overall classification accuracy of crops in complex farming areas, thus providing a feasible alternative for large-scale and complex crop mapping.

TI  - Comparison of Lake Ice Extraction Methods Based on MODIS Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important part of the cryosphere, lake ice is a sensitive indicator of climate change. Remote sensing technology can quickly and accurately monitor the process of its formation and decay, among which Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images are the most widely used data in the remote sensing monitoring of lake ice. The reasonable selection of monitoring methods is of great significance to grasp the dynamic process and response to climate change of lake ice. In this study, five commonly used remote sensing monitoring methods of lake ice based on MODIS MOD09GA data, including the single band threshold method (SBT), reflectance difference threshold method (RDT), normalized difference snow index method (NDSI), modified normalized difference snow index method (MNDSI) and lake ice index method (LII), were selected to compare their accuracies in extracting lake ice extent by combining them with four evaluation metrics of accuracy, precision, recall and mean intersection over union (MIoU). In addition, the ability of the high-precision LII method for extracting long time series lake ice phenology and its applicability to multiple types of lakes were verified. The results showed that compared with the NDSI method, the other four methods more easily distinguished between lake ice and lake water by setting thresholds. The SBT method and the RDT method had better extraction effects in the freezing process and the melting process, respectively. Compared with the NDSI and MNDSI methods, the LII method showed a significant improvement in lake ice extraction over the entire freeze-thaw cycle, with the smallest mean monitoring error of 1.53% for the percentage of lake ice area in different periods. Meanwhile, the LII method can be used to determine long term lake ice phenology dates and had good performance in extracting lake ice for different types of lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau with the optimal threshold interval of 0.05 similar to 0.07, which can be used for lake ice monitoring and long-term phenological studies in this region.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction Model for Water-Land Boundary Adjacency Effects in Landsat-8 Multispectral Images and Its Impact on Bathymetric Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction (AC) is the basis for quantitative water remote sensing, and adjacency effects form an important part of AC for medium- and high-spatial-resolution optical satellite images. The 6S radiative transfer model is widely used, but its background reflectance function does not take the radiance changes at water-land boundaries into account. If the observed land possesses bright features, the radiance of the adjacent water will be affected, leading to deviations in the AC results and increasing the uncertainty of water depth-based optical quantitative remote sensing. In this paper, we propose a model named WL-AE (a correction model for water-land boundary adjacency effects), which is based on the obvious radiance differences at water-land boundaries. This model overcomes the problem by which the background reflectance calculation is not terminated due to the highlighting pixel. We consider the influences of different R-ns (neighborhood space) on the target pixel. The effective calculation of the equivalent background reflectance of the target pixel is realized, and the influence of the land area anomaly highlighting the pixel on the adjacent water is avoided. The results show that WL-AE can effectively improve the entropy and contrast of the input image and that the water-land boundary is greatly affected by adjacency effects, especially in the green and near-infrared bands, where the M-rc (mean rate of change) are as high as 14.2% and 20.1%, respectively. In the visible wavelength, the Sd of R-rc (the relative rate of change) is positively correlated with R-ns, and the Sd reaches 16.9%. Although the adjacency effect is affected by ground object types, its influence area remains within 3 km offshore. Based on the WL-AE and 6S results, the comparative test regarding bathymetric inversion shows that the influence is significant in the 0-5 m depth section. In Penang, the MRE of the 0-4 m inversion results is 31.4%, which is 10.5% lower than that of the 6S model.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop tools to monitor the environmental quality in the LP quickly and accurately. To reveal the spatio-temporal changes in environmental quality in the LP from 2000 to 2020, we used the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products on the Google Earth Engine platform and constructed the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) through principal component analysis (PCA). Then, Sen-Mann-Kendall methods were applied to determine the changing trend of the environmental quality of the LP. Finally, natural and anthropogenic factors affecting the environmental quality were probed using a geographical detector model. The results showed that: (1) the average RSEI values in 2000, 2010 and 2020 were 0.396, 0.468 and 0.511, respectively, displaying an upward trend from 2000 to 2020, with a growth rate of 0.005 year(-1). The overall environment quality was moderate (0.4-0.6). (2) In terms of spatial distribution, the environmental quality was excellent in the southeast and poor in the northwest of the LP. The areas with improved environmental quality (84.51%) were located in all the counties, whereas the areas with degraded environmental quality (8.11%) occurred in the north and southeast of the study area. (3) Greenness, heat, wetness, dryness and land use types were prominent factors affecting RSEI throughout the study period; additionally, the total industrial gross domestic product showed a growing influence. The contribution of multi-factor interaction was stronger than that of single factors. The results will provide a reference and a new research perspective for local environmental protection and regional planning.

TI  - Mechanical Properties Study of Miniature Steel Specimens Based on the Small Punch Test and Simulation Methods
T2  - MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The small punch test (SPT) can be very convenient to obtain mechanical properties due to its unique advantages from small-volume samples, and has gained wide popularity and appreciation among researchers. In this paper, the SPT test and finite element (FE) simulations were performed for three alloys, and the yield stresses (sigma(YS)) and ultimate tensile strengths (sigma(UTS)) from the uniaxial tensile test (UTT) were correlated with the yield force (F-y) and maximum force (F-m) of the small punch test (SPT) before and after compliance calibration. Finally, the effect of specimen size on the SPT curves was discussed. The results showed that the deviation between SPT test and FE simulation was due to the loading system stiffness, which was confirmed by the loading system compliance calibration test. The SPT curves before and after calibration have less influence on the empirical correlation results for sigma(UTS), while the correlation results for sigma(YS) depend on the method used to determine F-y in the SPT curve. Finally, the simulation results indicated that the effect of specimen size on the force-displacement curve in the SPT is slight. This work also provides a reference for subsequent researchers to conduct empirical correlation studies using different specimen sizes.

TI  - Detecting Pest-Infested Forest Damage through Multispectral Satellite Imagery and Improved UNet plus
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant pests are the primary biological threats to agricultural and forestry production as well as forest ecosystem. Monitoring forest-pest damage via satellite images is crucial for the development of prevention and control strategies. Previous studies utilizing deep learning to monitor pest-infested damage in satellite imagery adopted RGB images, while multispectral imagery and vegetation indices were not used. Multispectral images and vegetation indices contain a wealth of useful information for detecting plant health, which can improve the precision of pest damage detection. The aim of the study is to further improve forest-pest infestation area segmentation by combining multispectral, vegetation indices and RGB information into deep learning. We also propose a new image segmentation method based on UNet++ with attention mechanism module for detecting forest damage induced by bark beetle and aspen leaf miner in Sentinel-2 images. The ResNeSt101 is used as the feature extraction backbone, and the attention mechanism scSE module is introduced in the decoding phase for improving the image segmentation results. We used Sentinel-2 imagery to produce a dataset based on forest health damage data gathered by the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development (FLNRORD) in British Columbia (BC), Canada, during aerial overview surveys (AOS) in 2020. The dataset contains the 11 original Sentinel-2 bands and 13 vegetation indices. The experimental results confirmed that the significance of vegetation indices and multispectral data in enhancing the segmentation effect. The results demonstrated that the proposed method exhibits better segmentation quality and more accurate quantitative indices with overall accuracy of 85.11%, in comparison with the state-of-the-art pest area segmentation methods.

TI  - A Multitemporal Mountain Rice Identification and Extraction Method Based on the Optimal Feature Combination and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quick and precise assessment of rice distribution by remote sensing technology is important for agricultural development. However, mountain rice is limited by the complex terrain, and its distribution is fragmented. Therefore, it is necessary to fully use the abundant spatial, temporal, and spectral information of remote sensing imagery. This study extracted 22 classification features from Sentinel-2 imagery (spectral features, texture features, terrain features, and a custom spectral-spatial feature). A feature selection method based on the optimal extraction period of features (OPFSM) was constructed, and a multitemporal feature combination (MC) was generated based on the separability of different vegetation types in different periods. Finally, the extraction accuracy of MC for mountain rice was explored using Random Forest (RF), CatBoost, and ExtraTrees (ET) machine learning algorithms. The results show that MC improved the overall accuracy (OA) by 3-6% when compared to the feature combinations in each rice growth stage, and by 7-14% when compared to the original images. MC based on the ET classifier (MC-ET) performed the best for rice extraction, with the OA of 86%, Kappa coefficient of 0.81, and F1 score of 0.95 for rice. The study demonstrated that OPFSM could be used as a reference for selecting multitemporal features, and the MC-ET classification scheme has high application potential for mountain rice extraction.

TI  - Unraveling the hierarchical genetic structure of tea green leafhopper, <i>Matsumurasca onukii</i>, in East Asia based on SSRs and SNPs
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Matsumurasca onukii (Matsuda, R. (1952). Oyo-Kontyu Tokyo, 8(1): 19-21), one of the dominant pests in major tea production areas in Asia, currently is known to occur in Japan, Vietnam, and China, and severely threatens tea production, quality, and international trade. To elucidate the population genetic structure of this species, 1633 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 18 microsatellite markers (SSRs) were used to genotype samples from 27 sites representing 18 geographical populations distributed throughout the known range of the species in East Asia. Analyses of both SNPs and SSRs showed that M. onukii populations in Yunnan exhibit high-genetic differentiation and structure compared with the other populations. The Kagoshima (JJ) and Shizuoka (JS) populations from Japan were separated from populations from China by SNPs, but clustered with populations from Jinhua (JH), Yingde (YD), Guilin (GL), Fuzhou (FZ), Hainan (HQ), Leshan (CT), Chongqing (CY), and Zunyi (ZY) tea plantations in China and the Vietnamese Vinh Phuc (VN) population based on the SSR data. In contrast, CT, CY, ZY, and Shaanxi (SX) populations clustered together based on SNPs, but were separated by SSRs. Both marker datasets identified significant geographic differentiation among the 18 populations. Various environmental and anthropogenic factors, including geographical barriers to migration, human transport of hosts (Camellia sinesis [L.] O. Kuntze) and adaptation of M. onukii to various local climatic zones possibly account for the rapid spread of this pest in Asia. The results demonstrate that SNPs from high-throughput genotyping data can be used to reveal subtle genetic substructure at broad scales in r-strategist insects.

TI  - A Multi-Modal Fusion Network Guided by Feature Co-Occurrence for Urban Region Function Recognition
T2  - IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, multi-modal fusion methods based on remote sensing data and social sensing data have been widely used in the field of urban region function recognition. However, due to the high complexity of noise problem, most of the existing methods are not robust enough when applied in real-world scenes, which seriously affect their application value in urban planning and management. In addition, how to extract valuable periodic feature from social sensing data still needs to be further study. To this end, we propose a multi-modal fusion network guided by feature co-occurrence for urban region function recognition, which leverages the co-occurrence relationship between multi-modal features to identify abnormal noise feature, so as to guide the fusion network to suppress noise feature and focus on clean feature. Furthermore, we employ a graph convolutional network that incorporates node weighting layer and interactive update layer to effectively extract valuable periodic feature from social sensing data. Lastly, experimental results on public available datasets indicate that our proposed method yeilds promising improvements of both accuracy and robustness over several state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Complex Mountain Road Extraction in High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images via a Light Roadformer and a New Benchmark
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain roads are of great significance to traffic navigation and military road planning. Extracting mountain roads based on high-resolution remote sensing images (HRSIs) is a hot spot in current road extraction research. However, massive terrain objects, blurred road edges, and sand coverage in complex environments make it challenging to extract mountain roads from HRSIs. Complex environments result in weak research results on targeted extraction models and a lack of corresponding datasets. To solve the above problems, first, we propose a new dataset: Road Datasets in Complex Mountain Environments (RDCME). RDCME comes from the QuickBird satellite, which is at an elevation between 1264 m and 1502 m with a resolution of 0.61 m; it contains 775 image samples, including red, green, and blue channels. Then, we propose the Light Roadformer model, which uses a transformer module and self-attention module to focus on extracting more accurate road edge information. A post-process module is further used to remove incorrectly predicted road segments. Compared with previous related models, the Light Roadformer proposed in this study has higher accuracy. Light Roadformer achieved the highest IoU of 89.5% for roads on the validation set and 88.8% for roads on the test set. The test on RDCME using Light Roadformer shows that the results of this study have broad application prospects in the extraction of mountain roads with similar backgrounds.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variation of Land Surface Temperature and Its Spatially Heterogeneous Response in the Urban Agglomeration on the Northern Slopes of the Tianshan Mountains, Northwest China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - An in-depth study of the influence mechanism of oasis land surface temperature (LST) in arid regions is essential to promote the stable development of the ecological environment in dry areas. Based on MODIS, MYD11A2 long time series data from 2003 to 2020, the Mann-Kendall nonparametric test, the Sen slope, combined with the Hurst index, were used to analyze and predict the trend of LST changes in the urban agglomeration on the northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains. This paper selected nine influencing factors of the slope, aspect, air temperature, normalized vegetation index (NDVI), precipitation (P), nighttime light index (NTL), patch density (PD), mean patch area (AREA_MN), and aggregation index (AI) to analyze the spatial heterogeneity of LST from global and local perspectives using the geodetector (GD) model and multi-scale geo-weighted regression (MGWR) model. The results showed that the average LSTs of the urban agglomeration on the northern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains in spring, summer, autumn, and winter were 31.53 degrees C, 47.29 degrees C, 22.38 degrees C, and -5.20 degrees C in the four seasons from 2003 to 2020, respectively. Except for autumn, the LST of all seasons showed an increasing trend, bare soil and grass land had a warming effect, and agricultural land had a cooling effect. The results of factor detection showed that air temperature, P, and NDVI were the dominant factors affecting the spatial variation of LST. The interaction detection results showed that the interaction between air temperature and NDVI was the most significant, and the two-factor interaction was more effective than the single-factor effect on LST. The MGWR model results showed that the effects of PD on LST were positively correlated, and the impact of AREA_MN and AI on LST were negatively correlated, indicating that the dense landscape of patches has a cooling effect on LST. Overall, this study provides information for managers to carry out more targeted ecological stability regulations in arid zone oases and facilitates the development of regulatory measures to maintain the cold island effect and improve the environment.

TI  - Impacts of FY-4A AGRI Radiance Data Assimilation on the Forecast of the Super Typhoon "In-Fa" (2021)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the impact of assimilating the Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) observations on the Super Typhoon "In-Fa" event based on the Weather Research and Forecasting Data Assimilation (WRFDA) system of the three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR) method. It was found that the two water vapor channels 9-10 from the full-disk AGRI datasets yield relatively stable results in terms of the track forecast of In-Fa. A new cloud-detection method using a Particle Filter (PF) was firstly employed to remove the cloud-affected observations by identifying the channel's weighting function. Compared to the other cloud-detection schemes based on the AGRI "Cloud_Binary_Mask" (CLM) products, the PF method is conducive to reducing the track error of typhoon prediction after improving the utilization of observations under clear-sky conditions. Furthermore, the proposed cycling assimilation scheme has a potential positive effect on the intensity forecast of In-Fa. It seems that assimilating the FY-4A AGRI radiance data improves the predictability of Typhoon In-Fa by adjusting the atmospheric environment.

TI  - Decision surface optimization in mapping exotic mangrove species<i> (Sonneratia</i><i> apetala)</i> across latitudinal coastal areas of China
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The exotic Sonneratia apetala is widely planted in mangrove afforestation in China due to its high adaptability and fast growth rates. This species has triggered intense debate on its ecological invasion risk during the past decades because of its natural reproduction, dispersal, and spread. However, national plans for the management and control of this exotic species are unclear, partly due to the lack of an accurate distribution map of the species for broad latitudinal areas. Mangrove species with subtle spectral differences and varied growth phases require plenty of samples to describe their spectrum; however, the scarcity of samples resulting from the low accessibility of their habitats hinders the mapping of the species across the national coastal zone. To overcome this problem, we derived S. apetala samples from existing discrete localized studies and then iteratively optimized the trained binary model by incorporating new negative samples until a threshold converged. Negative samples were more easily acquired in areas where the absence of S. apetala had been confirmed. This approach avoids the prereq-uisite that S. apetala can be distinguished by visual inspections, which is commonly used in routine classification procedures or active learning classifiers. The approach was applied to derive classification results with the help of a Random Forest classifier using both Sentinel-1 and-2 imagery hosted on Google Earth Engine, considering that S. apetala differs from native mangrove species in terms of the large crown, drooping branches, and biochemical properties. The generated S. apetala map was evaluated using three prepared datasets and achieved overall accuracies of 98.1 % and 96.4 % using the test dataset and independent evaluation dataset, respectively, as well as an accuracy of 91.7 % using 145 field samples provided by mangrove specialists. The total area of exotic S. apetala in China reached 2,968 ha in 2020, accounting for 11.0 % of the total mangrove area in China. This study is the first attempt to delineate the detailed national-scale distribution of S. apetala in coastal China. The information provided in this study can support the management and control of S. apetala. The developed approach can be generalized to other vegetation species in broad latitudinal areas, and can be further improved by probing the internal details of the trained classifier.

TI  - Gully Erosion Monitoring Based on Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Boundary-Guided Pseudo-Label Generation Strategy and Adaptive Loss Function
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gully erosion is a major threat to ecosystems, potentially leading to desertification, land degradation, and crop loss. Developing viable gully erosion prevention and remediation strategies requires regular monitoring of the gullies. Nevertheless, it is highly challenging to automatically access the monitoring results of the gullies from the latest monitoring data by training historical data acquired by different sensors at different times. To this end, this paper presents a novel semi-supervised semantic segmentation with boundary-guided pseudo-label generation strategy and adaptive loss function method. This method takes full advantage of the historical data with labels and the latest monitoring data without labels to obtain the latest monitoring results of the gullies. The boundary-guided pseudo-label generation strategy (BPGS), guided by the inherent boundary maps of real geographic objects, fuses multiple evidence data to generate reliable pseudo-labels. Additionally, we propose an adaptive loss function based on centroid similarity (CSIM) to further alleviate the impact of pseudo-label noise. To verify the proposed method, two datasets for gully erosion monitoring are constructed according to the satellite data acquired in northeastern China. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is more appropriate for automatic gully erosion monitoring than four state-of-the-art methods, including supervised methods and semi-supervised methods.

TI  - Integration of Sentinel-1A, ALOS-2 and GF-1 Datasets for Identifying Landslides in the Three Parallel Rivers Region, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the process of using InSAR technology to identify active landslides, phenomena such as steep terrain, dense vegetation, and complex clouds may lead to the missed identification of some landslides. In this paper, an active landslide identification method combining InSAR technology and optical satellite remote sensing technology is proposed, and the method is successfully applied to the Three Parallel Rivers Region (TPRR) in the northwest of Yunnan Province, China. The results show that there are 442 landslides identified in the TPRR, and the fault zone is one of the important factors affecting the distribution of landslides in this region. In addition, 70% of the active landslides are distributed within 1 km on both sides of the fault zone. The larger the scale of the landslide, the closer the relationship between landslides and the fault zone. In this identification method, the overall landslide identification rate based on InSAR technology is 51.36%. The combination of Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 data is beneficial to improve the active landslide identification rate of InSAR. In the northern region with large undulating terrain, shadows and overlaps occur easily. The southern area with gentle terrain is prone to the phenomenon where the scale of landslides is too small. Both phenomena are not conducive to the application of InSAR. Thus, in the central region, with moderate terrain and slope, the identification rate of active landslides based on InSAR is highest. The active landslide identification method proposed in this paper, which combines InSAR and optical satellite remote sensing technology, can integrate the respective advantages of the two technical methods, complement each other's limitations and deficiencies, reduce the missed identification of landslides, and improve the accuracy of active landslide inventory maps.

TI  - Monitoring Marine Oil Spills in Hyperspectral and Multispectral Remote Sensing Data by the Spectral Gene Extraction (SGE) Method
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spill incidents threaten the marine ecological environment. Detecting sea surface oil slicks by remote sensing images provides support for the efficient treatment of oil spills. This is important for sustainable marine development. However, traditional methods based on field analysis are time-consuming. Spectral indices lack applicability. In addition, traditional machine learning methods strictly rely on training and testing samples which are in short supply in oil spill images. Inspired by the spectral DNA encoding method, a spectral gene extraction (SGE) method was proposed to detect oil spills in hyperspectral images (HSI) and multispectral images (MSI). The SGE method contained a parameter and two strategies. The parameter of elimination was designed based on the population genetic frequency. It was used to control the number of spectral genes. The spectral gene extraction strategies, named largest in-class similarity (LIS) strategy and largest inter-class difference (LID) strategy, were proposed to mine the spectral genes by oil spill samples. The oil spills would be determined by calculating the similarity of the extracted spectral genes to the DNA encoded images. In this research, the SGE method was validated by two AVIRIS images of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, one MODIS image of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and one Landsat 8 image of a Persian Gulf oil spill. The oil spills in different remote sensing images could be detected accurately by the proposed method in a small set of samples. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method was suitable for detecting marine oil spills in AVIRIS, MODIS, and Landsat 8 images. In addition, the SGE method with the LIS strategy was more suitable for detecting oil spills in HSI. Its proper elimination rates were 0.8 similar to 1.0. The SGE method with the LID strategy was more suitable for detecting oil spills in MSI. Its proper elimination rates were 0.5 similar to 0.7.

M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding past and future vegetation dynamics is important for assessing the effectiveness of ecological engineering, designing policies for adaptive ecological management, and improving the ecological environment. Here, inter-annual changes in vegetation dynamics during 2000-2020, contributions of climate change (CC) and human activities (HA) to vegetation dynamics, and sustainability of vegetation dynamics in the future were determined in Gannan Prefecture (a typical alpine region in the Tibetan Plateau), China. MODIS-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), air temperature, precipitation, and land cover data were used, and trend analysis, multiple regression residuals analysis, and Hurst exponent analysis were employed. NDVI increased at a rate of 2.4 x 10(-3)center dot a(-1) during the growing season, and vegetation improved in most parts of the study area and some sporadically degraded areas also existed. The increasing rate was the highest in the Grain to Green Project (GTGP) areas. The vegetation in the southern and northern regions was mainly affected by CC and HA, respectively, with CC and HA contributions to vegetation change being 52.32% and 47.68%, respectively. The GTGP area (59.89%) was most evidently affected by HA. Moreover, a Hurst exponent analysis indicated that, in the future, the vegetation in Gannan Prefecture would continuously improve. The study can assist in formulating ecological protection and restoration projects and ensuring sustainable development.

TI  - Synergistic Retrieval of Temperature and Humidity Profiles from Space-Based and Ground-Based Infrared Sounders Using an Optimal Estimation Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles of the troposphere are generally measured by radiosondes and satellites, which are essential for analyzing and predicting weather. Nevertheless, the insufficient observation frequencies and low detection accuracy of the boundary layer restricts the description of atmospheric state changes by the temperature and humidity profiles. Therefore, this work focus on retrieving the temperature and humidity profiles using observations of the FengYun-4 (FY-4) Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) combined with ground-based infrared spectral observations from the Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI), which are more accurate than space-based individual retrieval results and have a wider effective retrieval range than ground-based individual retrieval results. Based on the synergistic observations, which are made by matching the space-based and ground-based data with those of different spatial and temporal resolutions, a synergistic retrieval process is proposed to obtain the temperature and humidity profiles at a high frequency under clear-sky conditions based on the optimal estimation method. In this research, using the line-by-line radiative transfer model (LBLRTM) as the forward model for observing simulations, a retrieval experiment was carried out in Qingdao, China, where an AERI is situated. Taking radiosonde data as a reference for comparing the retrieval results of the temperature and humidity profiles of the troposphere, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the synergistic retrieval algorithm below 400 hPa is within 2 K for temperature and within 12% for relative humidity. Compared with the GIIRS individual retrieval, the RMSE of temperature and relative humidity for the synergistic method is reduced by 0.13-1.5 K and 2.7-4.4% at 500 hPa, and 0.13-2.1 K and 2.5-7.2% at 900 hPa. Moreover, the forecast index (FI) calculated from the retrieval results shows reasonable consistency with the FIs calculated from the ERA5 reanalysis and from radiosonde data. The synergistic retrieval results have higher temporal resolution than space-based retrieval results and can reflect the changes in the atmospheric state more accurately. Overall, the results demonstrated the promising potential of the synergistic retrieval of temperature and humidity profiles at high accuracy and high temporal resolution under clear-sky conditions from FY-4/GIIRS and AERI.

TI  - Retrieval of Farmland Surface Soil Moisture Based on Feature Optimization and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important parameter affecting environmental processes such as hydrology, ecology, and climate. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) microwave remote sensing is an important means of farmland surface soil moisture (SSM) measurement. The inversion of farmland SSM by microwave remote sensing is greatly affected by vegetation cover. To address this problem, a multisource remote sensing inversion method of farmland SSM based on feature optimization and machine learning is proposed in this paper. Six typical machine learning algorithms suitable for small sample training, including random forest, radial basis function neural network, generalized regression neural network, support vector regression, genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network, and extreme learning machine, were selected in this paper. The features extracted from Sentinel-1/2 and Radarsat-2 remote sensing data were analyzed by Pearson correlation, and those with high correlation coefficients were selected to form the optimal feature subset as the input for the subsequent machine learning models. Then, the SSM collaborative inversion models under different machine learning algorithms were constructed, and comparative experiments were set up to select the optimal prediction model. The models' accuracy under different feature parameters were studied, and the difference in the performance between the dual-polarization SAR data and the quad-polarization SAR data in SSM inversion was explored. The experimental results showed that among the six models, the random forest model had a higher inversion accuracy, with a coefficient of determination of 0.6395 and a root mean square error of 0.0264 cm(3)/cm(3). Meanwhile, the inversion accuracy could be greatly improved after feature optimization, and the inversion accuracy of the quad-polarization SAR data combined with optical remote sensing data, was better than that of the dual-polarization SAR data combined with optical remote sensing data.

TI  - Varying Responses of Vegetation Greenness to the Diurnal Warming across the Global
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of global warming has been varying both diurnally and seasonally. Little is known about the spatiotemporal variations in the relationships between vegetation greenness and day- and night-time warming during the last decades. We investigated the global inter- and intra-annual responses of vegetation greenness to the diurnal asymmetric warming during the period of 1982-2015, using the normalized different vegetation index (NDVI, a robust proxy for vegetation greenness) obtained from the NOAA/AVHRR NDVI GIMMS3g dataset and the monthly average daily maximum (T-max) and minimum temperature (T-min) obtained from the gridded Climate Research Unit, University of East Anglia. Several findings were obtained: (1) The strength of the relationship between vegetation greenness and the diurnal temperature varied on inter-annual and seasonal timescales, indicating generally weakening warming effects on the vegetation activity across the global. (2) The decline in vegetation response to T-max occurred mainly in the mid-latitudes of the world and in the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere, whereas the decline in the vegetation response to T-min primarily concentrated in low latitudes. The percentage of areas with a significantly negative trend in the partial correlation coefficient between vegetation greenness and diurnal temperature was greater than that of the areas showing the significant positive trend. (3) The trends in the correlation between vegetation greenness and diurnal warming showed a complex spatial pattern: the majority of the study areas had undergone a significant declining strength in the vegetation greenness response to T-max in all seasons and to T-min in seasons except autumn. These findings are expected to have important implications for studying the diurnal asymmetry warming and its effect on the terrestrial ecosystem.

TI  - Deep Learning Classification by ResNet-18 Based on the Real Spectral Dataset from Multispectral Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the limitation of spatial resolution and spectral resolution, deep learning methods are rarely used for the classification of multispectral remote sensing images based on the real spectral dataset from multispectral remote sensing images. This study explores the application of a deep learning model to the spectral classification of multispectral remote sensing images. To address the problem of the large workload with respect to selecting training samples during classification by deep learning, first, linear spectral mixture analysis and the spectral index method were applied to extract the pixels of impervious surfaces, soil, vegetation, and water. Second, through the Euclidean distance threshold method, a spectral dataset of multispectral image pixels was established. Third, a deep learning classification model, ResNet-18, was constructed to classify Landsat 8 OLI images based on pixels' real spectral information. According to the accuracy assessment, the results show that the overall accuracy of the classification results can reach 0.9436, and the kappa coefficient can reach 0.8808. This study proposes a method that allows for the more optimized establishment of the actual spectral dataset of ground objects, addresses the limitations of difficult sample selection in deep learning classification and of spectral similarity in traditional classification methods, and applies the deep learning method to the classification of multispectral remote sensing images based on a real spectral dataset.

TI  - Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Aided LEO Satellite Communication: Cooperative Passive Beamforming and Distributed Channel Estimation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication plays an important role in assisting/complementing terrestrial communications by providing worldwide coverage, especially in harsh environments such as high seas, mountains, and deserts which are uncovered by terrestrial networks. Traditionally, the passive reflect-array with fixed phase shifts has been applied in satellite communications to compensate for the high path loss due to long propagation distance with low-cost directional beamforming; however, it is unable to flexibly adapt the beamforming direction to dynamic channel conditions. In view of this, we consider in this paper a new intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided LEO satellite communication system, by utilizing the controllable phase shifts of massive passive reflecting elements to achieve flexible beamforming, which copes with the time-varying channel between the high-mobility satellite (SAT) and ground node (GN) cost-effectively. In particular, we propose a new architecture for IRS-aided LEO satellite communication where IRSs are deployed at both sides of the SAT and GN, and study their cooperative passive beamforming (CPB) design over line-of-sight (LoS)-dominant single-reflection and double-reflection channels. Specifically, we jointly optimize the active transmit/receive beamforming at the SAT/GN as well as the CPB at two-sided IRSs to maximize the overall channel gain from the SAT to each GN. Interestingly, we show that under LoS channel conditions, the high-dimensional SAT-GN channel can be decomposed into the outer product of two low-dimensional vectors. By exploiting the decomposed SAT-GN channel, we decouple the original beamforming optimization problem into two simpler subproblems corresponding to the SAT and GN sides, respectively, which are both solved in closed-form. Furthermore, we propose an efficient transmission protocol to conduct channel estimation and beam tracking, which only requires independent processing of the SAT and GN in a distributed manner, thus substantially reducing the implementation complexity. Simulation results validate the performance advantages of the proposed IRS-aided LEO satellite communication system with two-sided cooperative IRSs, as compared to various baseline schemes such as the conventional reflect-array and one-sided IRS.

TI  - Prediction of independent sea ice motion in Arctic channel based on Multiloss-SAM-ConvLSTM
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate prediction of independent sea ice motion in arctic shipping lanes is of great guiding significance for ensuring navigation safety,assessing navigation navigability and dynamically correcting shipping lanes. However,the traditional optical flow method cannot meet the requirement of "spatio-temporal prediction + semantic segmentation". In this paper,the sea ice motion data set SeaiceMoving was made based on MERSI-. image and a sea ice motion prediction algorithm based on Multiloss-SAM-ConvLSTM was proposed,introducing weighted FDWloss based on SAMConvLSTM to enhance the acquisition of spatial semantics of each node. Aiming at the imbalanced sample distribution,we discussed the offset effect of back-end segmentation threshold. The optimal segmentation threshold is determined by grid search method,which improves the overall prediction result of sea ice motion. The experimental results indicate that the Kappa coefficient,IOU coefficient and Dice coefficient of the proposed method are 0. 75,0. 61 and 0. 76 respectively. Compared with SAM-ConvLSTM,they are improved by 0. 1,0. 12 and 0. 1 respectively. Furthermore,the proposed method can improve the position prediction and shape recovery ability of sea ice after motion and reduce the "adhesion" of sea ice. In addition,the algorithm can still effectively predict the sea ice motion under the interference of thin clouds,which can provide more accurate technical support for the dynamic planning and route correction of the Arctic route.

TI  - A Novel Nomogram for Predicting Breast Cancer-specific Survival in Male Patients
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY-CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To compare breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) of nonmetastatic invasive breast cancer between male (MBC) and female (FBC) patients, define clinicopathologic variables related to BCSS in nonmetastatic invasive MBC patients, and establish a nomogram for individual risk prediction. Materials and Methods: On the basis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, 2094 MBC and 48,104 FBC cases underwent propensity score matching (PSM). We compared the prognosis of patients before and after PSM and developed a nomogram for BCSS of nonmetastatic invasive MBC patients. Internal validation was performed using the consistency index, calibration curves, and receiver operating characteristic curves. Simultaneously, data from 49 nonmetastatic invasive MBC patients diagnosed between January 2012 and May 2016 were collected for external validation. Results: Before PSM, overall survival and BCSS were significantly shorter in MBC than those in FBC patients. After PSM, MBC patients continued to have a shorter overall survival, but not BCSS, than FBC patients. Marital status, age, histologic grade, estrogen/progesterone receptor status, Tumor Lymph Node stage, and surgery were included in the prediction model. Conclusions: The nomogram developed in this study seems to be more accurate than conventional Tumor-nodal-metastasis staging staging to predict BCSS and may serve as an effective tool for assessing the prognosis of nonmetastatic invasive MBC.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study aims to determine the regularity of sentinel lymph nodes of peripheral lung parenchyma and the lymphatic drainage between adjacent pulmonary segments in experimental animals.Methods: Thoracotomy was performed on 12 experimental Guizhou miniature pigs, and 1 mL methylene blue was injected into the superior segment of the lower lobe (S6) and the anterior segment of the upper lobe (S3), successively, to observe lymphatic drainage, in sentinel lymph nodes and the lymphatic drainage between adjacent segments.Results: A total of 161 lymphatic vessels were observed in 48 pulmonary segments, with an average of 3.4 lymphatic vessels per segment: RS6 (superficial 1.0 +/- 0.61, deep 2.5 +/- 1.00), RS3 (superficial 1.0 +/- 0.51, deep 2.0 +/- 1.07), LS6 (superficial 3.0 +/- 0.42, deep 1.0 +/- 0.38), LS3 (superficial 1.0 +/- 0.43, deep 2.0 +/- 0.62). There were significantly more lymphatic vessels in deep plexus than in superficial (p<0.01). As for sentinel lymph nodes, LS6 drained to the hilar, subcarinal and 4L lymph nodes; RS6 drained to the hilar and subcarinal lymph nodes; LS3 drained to the hilar and 4L lymph nodes; and RS3 drained to the hilar and 4R lymph nodes. In addition, methylene blue could drain from peripheral lung tissue of S3 and S6 directly to mediastinal lymph nodes through superficial plexuses. Lymphatic drainage regularity of S3 and S6 to adjacent pulmonary segments were also observed. The R6 rarely drained to the basal segment, while R3 could possibly drain to the posterior segment.Conclusion: The regularity of peripheral pulmonary parenchymal lymphatic drainage in experimental animals can provide a basis for the management of lymph nodes in pulmonary segmentectomy in humans, to a certain extent.

TI  - Crop Classification and Representative Crop Rotation Identifying Using Statistical Features of Time-Series Sentinel-1 GRD Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Compared with a monoculture planting mode, the practice of crop rotations improves fertilizer efficiency and increases crop yield. Large-scale crop rotation monitoring relies on the results of crop classification using remote sensing technology. However, the limited crop classification accuracy cannot satisfy the accurate identification of crop rotation patterns. In this paper, a crop classification and rotation mapping scheme combining the random forest (RF) algorithm and new statistical features extracted from time-series ground range direction (GRD) Sentinel-1 images. First, the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time-series stacks are established, including VH, VV, and VH/VV channels. Then, new statistical features named the objected generalized gamma distribution (OGGD) features are introduced to compare with other object-based features for each polarization. The results showed that the OGGD sigma(VH) achieved 96.66% of the overall accuracy (OA) and 95.34% of the Kappa, improving around 4% and 6% compared with the object-based backscatter in VH polarization, respectively. Finally, annual crop-type maps for five consecutive years (2017-2021) are generated using the OGGD sigma(VH) and the RF. By analyzing the five-year crop sequences, the soybean-corn (corn-soybean) is the most representative rotation in the study region, and the soybean-corn-soybean-corn-soybean (together with corn-soybean-corn-soybean-corn) has the highest count with 100 occurrences (25.20% of the total area). This study offers new insights into crop rotation monitoring, giving the basic data for government food planning decision-making.

TI  - Exploring the Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Frigate Tuna (<i>Auxis thazard</i>) Habitat in the South China Sea in Spring and Summer during 2015-2019 Using Fishery and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - FISHES
M3  - Article
AB  - Frigate tuna Auxis thazard fishery is considered a potential marine resource in the open South China Sea (SCS). However, little is known about the spatial and temporal distribution of its habitat, and how this may respond to environmental changes. Using fish survey and remote sensing data from 2015-2019, we applied generalized additive models to identify relationships between environmental factors and the distribution of A. thazard in the SCS. To examine seasonal patterns in the habitat of A. thazard in the SCS, we generated a habitat suitability index model using environmental factors screened by generalized additive models. Results showed that A. thazard migrates from south to north in the SCS, and its suitable habitat is patchily distributed. Significant environmental factors affecting the habitat of A. thazard distribution were different in different seasons; we demonstrated A. thazard to be sensitive to Chl-a in spring (optimum 0.155, optimal range similar to 0.1252-0.1840), and in summer to be sensitive to SST (optimum 30.405, optimal range similar to 29.789-31.021) and SSH (optimum 0.741, optimal range similar to 0.618-0.864). Suitable habitat in spring occurs mainly in northeastern areas, while in summer it occurs mainly around the southeastern Nansha Islands. Compared with that in spring, the area of suitable habitat increases in summer, as does the habitat suitability index of the entire sea area. These results improve our understanding of environmental factors that affect the distribution of A. thazard habitat in the SCS, and provide a scientific basis for the development and management of A. thazard resources.

TI  - Research on Dynamic Monitoring of Grain Filling Process of Winter Wheat from Time-Series Planet Imageries
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has been used as an important means of monitoring crop growth, especially for the monitoring of the formation of crop yield in the middle and late growth period. The information acquisition on the yield formation period of winter wheat is of great significance for winter wheat growth monitoring, yield estimation and scientific management. Hence, the main goal of this study was to verify the possibility of monitoring the grain-filling process of winter wheat and its in-field variability using an alternative non-destructive method based on orbital remote sensing. High-resolution satellite imageries (3 m) were obtained from the PlanetScope platform for three commercial winter wheat fields in Jiangsu Province, China during the reproductive stage of the winter wheat (185-215/193-223/194-224 days after sowing (DAS)). Based on the quantitative analysis of vegetation indices (VIs) obtained from high-resolution satellite imageries and three indicators of the winter wheat grain-filling process, linear, polynomial and logistic growth models were used to establish the relationship between VIs and the three indicators. The research showed a high Pearson correlation (p < 0.001) between winter wheat maturity and most VIs. In the overall model, the remote sensing inversion of the dry thousand-grain weight has the highest accuracy and its R-2 reaches more than 0.8, which is followed by fresh thousand-grain weight and water content, the accuracies of which are also considerable. The results indicated a great potential to use high-resolution satellite imageries to monitor winter wheat maturity variability in fields and subfields. In addition, the proposed method contributes to monitoring the dynamic spatio-temporality of the grain-filling progression, allowing for more accurate management strategies in regard to winter wheat.

TI  - Increasing Negative Impacts of Climatic Change and Anthropogenic Activities on Vegetation Variation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau during 1982-2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change, combined with ever-increasing anthropogenic activities, has had significant impacts on the vegetation of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). This study quantitatively analyzed the impacts of climate change and human activities on vegetation variation on the QTP from 1982 to 2019 based on AVHRR NDVI data and the residual trend method. The main results were as follows: (1) From 1982 to 2000, the vegetation of the QTP had an obvious restoration process, whereby 67.8% of vegetation coverage areas experienced an increasing trend, while it had a large range of degradation during 2001-2019, especially in the central QTP. (2) The positive effect of climate change on the vegetation of the QTP decreased, and the negative impact increased. The area of positive impact decreased from 68.54% in 1982-2000 to 47.13% in 2001-2019, while the negative-impact area increased from 31.46% to 52.87%. (3) The area negatively affected by human activities increased from 57.68% in 1982-2000 to 79.46% in 2001-2019 and was mainly concentrated in the grassland of the central QTP. The findings of this study provide a scientific basis for vegetation restoration and management in the QTP region.

TI  - A Comparative Analysis of Farmland Occupation by Urban Sprawl and Rural Settlement Expansion in China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The farmland loss caused by urban-rural land development has exacerbated China's challenges of using limited farmland to feed more than 1.4 billion people. Earlier studies shed light on the impacts of urban sprawl and rural settlement expansion, separately. However, there is little quantitative understanding of which one has more severe impacts on farmland and its net primary productivity (NPP). Thus, this study used spatially explicit satellite data including land-use maps and estimated NPP data, as well as spatiotemporal analysis methods to conduct a comparative analysis of farmland loss due to urban sprawl and rural settlement expansion at different scales from 2000 to 2020 in China. The results show that during the study period, urban sprawl resulted in a loss of 49,086.6 km(2) of farmland area and 8.34 TgC of farmland NPP, while the loss of farmland area and farmland NPP due to rural settlement expansion reached 18,006.8 km(2) and 3.88 TgC. The largest gap between the total area of farmland loss due to urban sprawl and the total loss area due to rural settlement expansion was 12,983.3 km(2) in Eastern China, while the smallest gap was 1291.1 km(2) in Northeastern China. The largest gap between the loss of farmland NPP due to urban sprawl and the total loss due to rural settlement expansion occurred in Eastern China at 1.97 TgC. Spatially, the total loss of farmland and its NPP due to urban sprawl and rural settlement expansion occurred mainly in the eastern and central regions of China; the areas of farmland loss by urban sprawl were more concentrated than that by rural settlement expansion. The negative impacts of urban sprawl on farmland area and its NPP were greater in southern China than that of rural settlement expansion. Noticeably, the loss of NPP per unit of farmland due to rural settlement expansion was higher than that by urban sprawl, especially in the Yangtze River Delta and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The results highlight the non-negligible impacts of rural settlement expansion on farmland in China. It is necessary to improve farmland protection policies by optimizing the spatial allocation of urban and rural construction land.

TI  - Two-Dimensional InSAR Monitoring of the Co- and Post-Seismic Ground Deformation of the 2021 Mw 5.9 Arkalochori (Greece) Earthquake and Its Impact on the Deformations of the Heraklion City Wall Relic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Contributing to the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within Target 11.4 "Strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world's cultural and natural heritage", it is critical to monitor the spatial and temporal stabilities of cultural heritages. The study of the interactive relationship between earthquakes and the protection of cultural heritages needs to be strengthened. On 27 September 2021, the destructive Mw 5.9 Arkalochori earthquake occurred similar to 25 km away from the city of Heraklion (Greece) where the Heraklion City Wall (HCW), a representative cultural heritage of Greece and Europe, was located. This offered a proper case to investigate the shortcomings aforementioned. Here, we intend to set up and answer the following three questions (Whether, Where and What, 3Ws): Whether there were impacts on the HCW caused by the Arkalochori earthquake? Where did the maximum deformation occur? What was the relationship between seismic deformation between the epicenter and the HCW over time? We performed two-dimensional (2D) InSAR measurements for both co-seismic and post-seismic deformations using the ascending and descending Sentinel-1A SAR images. The spatial-temporal characteristics of Up-Down (UD) and East-West (EW) were revealed. The 2D co-seismic deformation field showed that the near-filed deformations were dominating compared with the deformations at the HCW, the UD deformation was mainly featured with subsidence with a maximum value of similar to 21 cm, the EW deformation was similar to 9 cm westward and similar to 10 cm eastward. The time-series measurements showed that: (1) temporally, the HCW responded quickly to the Arkalochori earthquake, and the accumulative deformations at the seven different bastions of the HCW showed the same trend as the near-field area over time. (2) Spatially, the closer to the Mw 5.9 epicenter, the larger the deformations that occurred. (3) The EW and UD deformation trends of the HCW that were consistent with the Mw 5.9 epicenter were interrupted at the middle time spot (22 January 2022), indicating the influence of another earthquake sequence consisting of eight earthquakes with magnitudes larger than 3.5 that happened on 16-18 January 2022. Respectively, to summarize and address the aforementioned 3Ws based on the post-seismic analysis accomplished by the MSBAS method, the Arkalochori earthquake did affect the HCW; besides, the influences of the similar to 13 km earthquake sequence were also detected; the nearest part to the epicenter suffered the most; the deformation trends of the HCW were approximately the same with the epicenter area of the Arkalochori earthquake both in the UD and EW directions.

TI  - Machine Learning Fusion Multi-Source Data Features for Classification Prediction of Lunar Surface Geological Units
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking the Chang'e-4 and Chang'e-5 landing areas as the study areas, this study extracts the geological unit information from the regional USGS geological map, as well as the feature information such as topography and geomorphology, material composition and mineral abundance from Chang'e-2 DOM and DEM, wide angle camera (WAC) and Kaguya multi-band imager data. By applying methods including the statistical-based estimation of mutual information of data and the integrated-algorithmic-model-based evaluation of feature importance to this extracted information, we screen the significant features and construct a high-precision classification model by combining machine learning algorithm with important features of sample data. The practical application of the multi-classification prediction on the complex geological units in the two study areas achieves 97.9% and 95.1% accuracy. At the same time, the significant characteristics of the study area are mined, and the rules and knowledge associated with the geological evolution of the study area are obtained. In this study, we carry out research on quantitative prediction and identification of lunar surface geological units based on large samples and construct a high-precision multi-classification model to achieve automatic classification and prediction on large sample geological units with high accuracy. This method provides a new idea for the predicted mapping of geological units of lunar global digital mapping. In addition, it helps to fully exploit the useful information in the data and enrich the knowledge regarding the formation and evolution of the Moon.

TI  - Benign osseous metaplasia of the breast infiltrated by invasive pleomorphic lobular carcinoma: A case report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and importance: Benign osseous metaplasia (BOM) is a rare entity, with only few cases reported in the breast. Here we present an unusual case of pleomorphic lobular carcinoma of the breast infiltrating BOM, discuss potential mimics and review the literature.Case presentation: An 86 year-old female presented with right breast lump for two weeks. Clinical examination revealed a palpable mass, associated with skin tethering and nipple inversion. Mammography and ultrasound showed a densely calcified lesion associated with parenchymal distortion. Core biopsy confirmed malignancy and the patient underwent mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Histological assessment showed a 45 mm mass of benign bone trabecula infiltrated by invasive grade 2 lobular carcinoma of classic and pleomorphic types with nodal positivity (2/2). The patient received adjuvant radiotherapy to chest wall and axilla for 3 months. She remains well on aromatase inhibitors after 9 months of follow up.Clinical discussion: Few cases of breast BOM have been reported in the literature commonly in association with benign lesions such as fibroadenomas. So far, only two cases associated with invasive classic lobular carcinoma have been reported in the literature. The main differential is metaplastic (mesenchymal/ matrix producing) carcinoma, in which the osseous component is malignant and the cancer if often of a high grade, basal phenotype.Conclusion: We present the first case of BOM of the breast associated with invasive pleomorphic lobular carcinoma. Awareness of the entity and distinction from metaplastic carcinoma and malignant phyllodes with heterologous element are important to ensure appropriate patient management.

TI  - The Influence of Data Length on the Performance of Artificial Intelligence Models in Predicting Air Pollution
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is one of humanity's most critical environmental issues and is considered contentious in several countries worldwide. As a result, accurate prediction is critical in human health management and government decision-making for environmental management. In this study, three artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, namely group method of data handling neural network (GMDHNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), and gradient boosting regression (GBR) tree, are used to predict the hourly concentration of PM2.5 over a Dorset station located in Canada. The investigation has been performed to quantify the effect of data length on the AI modeling performance. Accordingly, nine different ratios (50/50, 55/45, 60/40, 65/35, 70/30, 75/25, 80/20, 85/15, and 90/10) are employed to split the data into training and testing datasets for assessing the performance of applied models. The results showed that the data division significantly impacted the model's capacity, and the 60/40 ratio was found more suitable for developing predictive models. Furthermore, the results showed that the ELM model provides more precise predictions of PM2.5 concentrations than the other models. Also, a vital feature of the ELM model is its ability to adapt to the potential changes in training and testing data ratio. To summarize, the results reported in this study demonstrated an efficient method for selecting the optimal dataset ratios and the best AI model to predict properly which would be helpful in the design of an accurate model for solving different environmental issues.

TI  - Use of remote sensing and bio-geochemical models to estimate the net carbon fluxes of managed mountain grasslands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current paper presents a methodology which can simulate the net carbon fluxes of semi-natural grasslands based on the combination of a parametric and a bio-geochemical model. The first model (modified C-Fix) esti-mates grassland gross primary production (GPP) by driving the light use efficiency approach with remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. The latter model (BIOME-BGC) simulates all main ecosystem processes based on meteorological and ancillary data. The outputs of the two models are finally combined and corrected for the effects of human-induced biomass changes (i.e. mowing, grazing, etc.). The modelling strategy, fed with ancillary and MODIS NDVI data, is tested in two semi-natural grasslands, the first (Amplero) on the Apennines and the second (Monte Bondone) on the Alps (Central and Northern Italy, respectively). The two sites, which show diversified eco-climatic conditions and are managed differently (i.e. Amplero by spring mowing plus cattle grazing and Monte Bondone by summer mowing), were selected for the availability of eddy covariance observations of GPP and net ecosystem production (NEP) collected during several years (from 2003 to 2012). These observations were used to assess the estimates of the modelling strategy, obtaining promising results for both study sites. The greatest estimation errors are found in the Alpine site and are mostly induced by the inaccurate detection of local grassland NDVI values, which is due to the insufficient spatial and temporal resolutions of the used MODIS NDVI imagery. The results of the study highlight the importance of information on the local management practices applied, which is decisive for quantifying medium -term changes in net carbon fluxes.

TI  - Fruit of the Earth and Work of Human Hands: Connecting the Eucharist and Regenerative Agriculture
T2  - IRISH THEOLOGICAL QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Engaging the writings of Bernard Lonergan, Charles Massy, and Pope Francis, this article offers a systematic exposition of the relationship between the Eucharist and regenerative agriculture. First, it surveys the overlapping cultural malaises identified by Massy, Francis, and Lonergan at the root of modern industrial agriculture. Second, in response to this form of decline, it shows how the regenerative agricultural practices called for by Massy instantiate the integral ecology called for by Pope Francis; at the same time, it substantiates Massy's calls through the emergently probable worldview of Lonergan. Third, in a way that Massy does not show, such a worldview can elevate these agricultural concerns to a supernatural, redemptive plane. Not only does an emergently probable worldview show that right agricultural practices restore creation's capacity to praise, so too does it show that Christian praise-as made especially apparent in the Eucharist-depends upon just agricultural practices.

TI  - Survey of Trichogramma (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) Natural Populations in Quebec Cranberry Bogs and Identification Using rDNA ITS-2 Sequence Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The province of Quebec, Canada is the most important organic cranberry growing region worldwide. However, insect pest management methods are limited, and growers face significant yield loss each year, mostly caused by lepidopteran pests. Egg parasitoids of the genus Trichogramma (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) are effective biocontrol agents of lepidopteran pests in many forests and agricultural systems. Herein, a two-year, large-scale population survey of Trichogramma spp. was performed using Ephestia kuehniella Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) as sentinel eggs in Quebec organic cranberry bogs. Collected specimens were identified by sequencing ribosomal DNA of the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS-2) region and subjected to resemblance analysis with reference specimens for identification. Our results confirm that at least four Trichogramma species naturally occur in the studied agroecosystem. Those species are T. brassicae Bezdenko, T. minutum Riley, T. ostriniae (Pang et Chen), and T. pretiosum Riley. While some species have already been reported in cranberry bogs, this represents the first mention of T. brassicae and T. ostriniae as well as the first mention of T. minutum in Quebec cranberry bogs. All species collected are native from Eastern Canada except T. ostriniae. These species can be considered as biocontrol agent candidates for cranberry lepidopteran pests, but further efficacy trials are needed to identify the best species for each pest.

TI  - COVID-19 Pandemic and Hospital Efficiency in Iran: Insight from an Interrupted Time Series Analysis and Pabon Lasso Model.
T2  - Journal of lifestyle medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Limited evidence exists on the impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on hospital efficiency worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public hospitals in Iran.Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, monthly data on the average length of stay (ALoS), bed occupancy rate (BOR), bed turnover rate (BTR) and bed turnover interval (BTI) were collected for 58 months (36 months before and 22 months after the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran) from the health information systems of all 18 public hospitals affiliated with Kermanshah University of Medical Sciences in Kermanshah province, Iran. We used interrupted time series analysis and the Pabon Lasso model to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital efficiency.Results: The monthly average ALoS, BOR, BTR and BTI before (after) the COVID-19 pandemic was 3.30 (3.48) days, 70.14% (49.37), 6.78 (4.81) patients per bed and 1.15 (2.88) days, respectively. The study indicated that a statistically significant decrease in ALoS of 0.29 and BOR of 25.09 in the first month following the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with the before pandemic period, we observed a significant increase in the monthly trend of ALoS (coefficient = 0.021; p = 0.015), BOR (coefficient = 1.30; p = 0.002), and BTR (coefficient = 0.08, p = 0.012). We found a significant decrease in the monthly trend in BTI (coefficient = -0.11, p = 0.009) after the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with before the pandemic. Based on the Pabon Lasso model, before (after) the pandemic, 29.4% (29.4%) of the hospitals were located in zone 1 as an inefficient area, and 17.6% (35.3%) of hospitals were located in zone 3 as an efficient area.Conclusion: The study demonstrated that the BOR and BTR decreased substantially after the outbreak of COVID-19. In contrast, the ALoS and BTI have significantly increased following the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found that hospitals' performance in both periods was poor, and only 30% of hospitals were located in the efficient zone (zone three) based on the Pabon Lasso model. Further studies aimed at identifying the main factors affecting lower efficiency among hospitals in Iran are recommended.

TI  - The Evangelical Puzzle Partially Explained: Privileged Prejudice and the Development of Appreciative Attitudes Toward Evangelical Christianity
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Evangelical Christian college students simultaneously experience the privileges that accompany dominant religious identities and feel a need to conceal their identity and perspectives on college campuses. Consistently and empirically, the college campus has been studied for its potential to help students develop appreciative attitudes toward religious, secular, and spiritual worldviews. Yet, few studies have investigated evangelical Christian appreciation longitudinally over 4 years of college, and even fewer through the additional use of a mixed-methods design.Purpose: This inquiry examined if and how college students developed an appreciation of evangelical Christianity over 4 years of college.Methods: This paper used data gathered through the Interfaith Diversity Experiences and Attitudes Longitudinal Survey (IDEALS), a nationally-representative, mixed-methods study that included survey data collection from 9,470 students at 122 colleges and universities over 3 time points, and 18 qualitative case studies conducted across institutions of various sizes, locations, and affiliations.Results: Using latent growth modeling, we demonstrated that overall appreciation for evangelical Christianity developed during college and was related to institutional cultures that invited and embraced worldview diversity as well as religiously-inclusive campus climates and practices. Related qualitative insights storied change in evangelical appreciation that centered on personal relationships with evangelicals, efforts to understand evangelical viewpoints, and a recognition that Christian students often have the privilege of operating from unexamined beliefs.Conclusion and Implications: Study results provide recommendations for educational practices that support student growth from tolerance to appreciation for evangelical Christianity.

AB  - For more than 40 years education decisions leading the direction and resourcing of curriculum development, teaching and learning practices, as well as assessment practices in Aotearoa (New Zealand) have been decided, primarily, based on what is happening in the dominant English medium education space. The impact on the advancement of the Maori language, knowledge, and the education of children through Maori medium education pathways has been far reaching. This paper advocates for a more inclusive national curriculum for Maori medium education that stems from a Maori worldview and prioritises Maori knowledge, ways of knowing, thinking, and doing. The Te Tirewa Marautanga framework [Ministry of Education. 2020. 'He tamaiti hei raukura.' https://www.kauwhatareo.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/689950af53/He-Tamaiti-Hei-Raukura_Paper_.pdf] provides for the next evolution in Maori medium curriculum development by giving greater prominence to Maori knowledge, the intrinsic links between all aspects of human growth and wellbeing, the aspirations of whanau, hapu and iwi, Maori language and culture as well as the skills and attribute required for future success in a global world.

TI  - Albedo, a little-known climate change mitigation lever: what mitigation potential for grasslands?
T2  - FOURRAGES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ruminant livestock farming exacerbates climate change (CC) through land use and its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Grassland management and livestock husbandry (with grazing or not) also affect the climate by modifying the albedo (alpha) of the land surface. Thus, albedo management via the adaptation of livestock management could become a lever for CC mitigation, similar to carbon (C) storage in the soil. The results presented here are derived from daily alpha measurements of 7 French grasslands. The albedo evolves according to variable time steps depending on the meteorological conditions: the presence of frost in autumn - winter generates intra and interday variability of alpha. In spring and summer, it is the rainfall after periods without precipitation, which decreases the alpha for a few days (6.9 %). In the same way, agricultural practices have a more or less important effect on the alpha: mowing of refusals has the least impact: -3.5 % for a few days. This is less than grazing, -3.9 % on average for 2 weeks, whose effect depends on the instantaneous livestock load. Mowing has a more marked effect: -13.7 % for one month. Taking as reference a bare soil, the radiative forcing (RF) of grasslands, calculated from albedo dynamics is negative, which means a cooling effect on the climate. This value is on average more negative in summer (-11.1 W/m(2)) than in winter (-3.1W/m(2)) due to higher alpha levels because of the increased presentation of vegetation combined with higher solar radiation. A farm-scale albedo simulation shows that the average alpha of the crop rotation increases with the proportion of grass areas and suggests that systems relying more on grass would have a favorable RF for CC mitigation. This effect could be enhanced via adaptation of practices on grasslands to preserve and improve surface albedo.

AB  - The objective of the study is to determine the impact of land use and land cover (LULC) change on land surface temperature (LST) and thermal stress at Jorhat from 2009 to 2021. The experiment used Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) for 2009 and OLI (Operational Land Imager)/TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) for 2021 from earth.explorer.usgs.gov. Landsat data were employed to calculate the LST and LULC changes. Utilizing UTFVI (urban thermal field variance index), thermal stress over the ground surface has been computed. Thermal discomfort is computed simultaneously using the relative strain index (RSI) and net effective temperature (NET) index. Jorhat evidenced significant rise in built-up land to 281.25 hectares with reduced vegetation cover of 480.96 hectares from 2009 to 2021. These modifications caused significant rises in LST of 4.28 degrees C, 2.33 degrees C and 3.01 degrees C in September, October and December from 2009 to 2021. According to UTFVI from 2009 to 2021, Jorhat experienced declining ecologically excellent area with a rising proportion of ecologically worse land. In September and October 2009, the Jorhat city had just 10 days of bioclimatic discomfort and 19 days of bioclimatic comfort, as opposed to 24 and 10 days in 2021, respectively. Similarly, NET estimated 21 very hot days in October 2021, as opposed to just 9 days in 2009. Compared to 2009, there are now 6 and 4 days in December 2021 that are classified as warm or slightly hot, respectively. This leads to the conclusion that Jorhat's thermal condition is significantly impacted by changes in land use and land cover.

TI  - The Role of Fundamentalization of Education in Improving the Future Specialists Professional Training with Usage of Multimedia Technologies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the fundamentalization of education in improving the future specialists professional training with usage of multimedia technologies by various scientists. Various points of view and approaches to defining the concepts of fundamentalization of education and multimedia technologies are identified. The concept of fundamentalization of professional training of a future specialist is based on the goals and functions of fundamentalization and - on the ways and means of achieving it, etc. Most authors agree only in their views that the fundamentalization of education is aimed at improving the quality of education and the education of the individual. Others involve the formation of a culture and worldview, increasing the creative and intellectual potential, forming the professional competence of a specialist and the potential for further education, and so on. The term multimedia refers to interactive systems that provide processing of moving and still video images, animated graphics, high-quality audio and speech. It is found out that professional training of a specialist by means of multimedia technologies includes not only the activities of the teacher and student, which form the learning process, but also the independent activity of the subject, self-development, assimilation of experience by the subject through analysis, comprehension and transformation of the field of activity in which he is included. It is revealed through the implementation of which approaches to the fundamentalization of higher professional education, it becomes possible to fully present theoretical training courses and effectively pass practical training by students, which contributes to improving the quality of training of future specialists in higher education institutions. Theoretical analysis of scientific views indicates a fairly serious attention of scientists to the problem of professional readiness of specialists and the possibility of higher educational institutions in preparing for it. At the same time, professional readiness is considered from different positions: as an active state of a person, which manifests itself in activity; as a result of activity; as goals of activity; as a quality that characterizes the attitude to solving professional problems and social situations; as a prerequisite for purposeful activity; as a form of activity of the subject; as an integral formation of personality; as a component of socio-professional culture; as a complex professionally significant neoplasm of the individual.

TI  - Monitoring built-up area expansion led by industrial transformation in Delhi using geospatial techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Historically, industrialization has been a catalyst for built-up expansion generated by economic growth that transforms a landscape. In India, there is a paucity of exploration into how the economic shift transforms the cityscape. Therefore, the objective of current research work was to monitor built-up growth induced by industrialization using Landsat datasets and registered industry data. The k-means clustering technique was applied for assessing land use/land cover, Shannon entropy for sprawl, and Pearson for correlation between industrial growth and built-up expansion. The results manifest exponential trend in industrialization with 102-year registered industry record along with increase in built-up density from 0.30 in 1989 to 0.69 by 2019 and in the entire Delhi; it rose from 0.16 to 0.39. Furthermore, Shannon entropy confirmed the sprawl and the strong positive correlation was found among built-up of industrial areas and built-up of Delhi and registered industries. The striking chorological change in industrial as well as city's landscape was observed co-occurring with the dynamics of economic reforms. The outcome of current research could be utilized for the sustainable planning of industrial landscape in Delhi and cities with alike geographical conditions.

TI  - An Inquiry into Model Validity When Addressing Complex Sustainability Challenges
T2  - COMPLEXITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Scientific modelling is a prime means to generate understanding and provide much-needed information to support public decision-making in the fluid area of sustainability. A growing, diverse sustainability modelling literature, however, does not readily lend itself to standard validation procedures, which are typically rooted in the positivist principles of empirical verification and predictive success. Yet, to be useful to decision-makers, models, including their outputs and the processes through which they are established must be, and must be seen to be "valid." This study explores what model validity means in a problem space with increasingly interlinked and fast-moving challenges. We examine validation perspectives through ontological, epistemic, and methodological lenses, for a range of modelling approaches that can be considered as "complexity-compatible." The worldview taken in complexity-compatible modelling departs from the more standard modelling assumptions of complete objectivity and full predictability. Drawing on different insights from complexity science, systems thinking, economics, and mathematics, we suggest a ten-dimensional framework for progressing on model validity when investigating sustainability concerns. As such, we develop a widened view of the meaning of model validity for sustainability. It includes (i) acknowledging that several facets of validation are critical for the successful modelling of the sustainability of complex systems; (ii) tackling the thorny issues of uncertainty, subjectivity, and unpredictability; (iii) exploring the realism of model assumptions and mechanisms; (iv) embracing the role of stakeholder engagement and scrutiny throughout the modelling process; and (v) considering model purpose when assessing model validity. We wish to widen the debate on the meaning of model validity in a constructive way. We conclude that consideration of all these elements is necessary to enable sustainability models to support, more effectively, decision-making for complex interdependent systems.

T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the results of an archaeological survey carried out in the Navkur Plain, Iraqi Kurdistan, as part of the 'Asingeran Archaeological Project'. The survey was prepared using remote sensing products accessed via Google Earth Engine(ⓒ), a large-scale cloud computing service freely available to the scientific community that allows processing remote sensing big data. Outputs generated with a multitemporal approach are particularly successful for archaeological research, because it is possible to maximize the visibility of archaeological sites, improving their detection. Multispectral imagery from Landsat 5, Landsat 7 and Sentinel-2 collections were used and processed, testing their utility for finding unknown ancient settlements in the densely studied area of Northern Mesopotamia. Seventeen new sites were discovered in an already surveyed area of limited size (<100 km(2)), showing the potentialities of this method. The advantages of cloud computing for Near Eastern Archaeology and the results of the survey are also presented and discussed.

TI  - Remote sensing of suspended sediment in high turbid estuary from sentinel-3A/OLCI: A case study of Hangzhou Bay
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The suspended sediment in water infers water quality, and directly reflects optical properties such as water transparency, turbidity, and water color. Thus, these physical properties provide a viable basis to rigorously retrieve for suspended sediment concentration (SSC) using satellite remote sensing water color measurements in estuaries. The contemporary Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) on Sentinel-3A, provides more waveband options for remote sensing of water color and an opportunity for retrieval of suspended sediment in estuarine coast. Yet, accurate retrieval of SSC in high turbid waters from OLCI is still challenging due primarily to the high uncertainty of atmospheric correction. Here, we use OLCI images to measure water quality in Hangzhou Bay, and construct a retrieval model of SSC, and cross-validated using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data. The study shows that: (1) the atmospheric correction algorithm based on ultraviolet wavelengths (UV-AC) can achieve better results for both OLCI and GOCI data, and the overall correction accuracy for OLCI is higher than that for GOCI data; (2) the multi-band index model constructed by using R-rs(Oa16)/R-rs(Oa5) of OLCI data has higher retrieval accuracy and model stability, with R-2 is 0.96, MRE is 17.52%, and RMSE is 69.10 mg/L; (3) the spatial distribution of SSC in the study area is complex, mainly showing that the SCC in the top of the bay is larger than the mouth of the bay, and the south shore is larger than the north shore; (4) whe distribution of SSC obtained from retrieving OLCI and GOCI data in general is consistent, with the OLCI SSC estimates with higher accuracy than GOCI data, and the numerical difference between the two retrieval results is more obvious in the ocean with high SSC; and (5) with appropriate atmospheric corrections and retrieval models, OLCI data can be used to estimate improved SSC observables in Hangzhou Bay. We conclude that the SSC retrieval models proposed here provide a good reference method for retrieval of water color observable in Hangzhou Bay coastal estuary.

TI  - Integrated geophysical, remote sensing and geochemical investigation to explore gold-mineralizations and mapping listvenites at Wadi Haimur, Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the continuity of gold mining work since Pharaonic times till today, Wadi Haimur is still promised source for gold. Wadi Haimur is located in west Allaqi-Heinai-Suture (AHS), south Eastern Desert of Egypt. Gold mineralization is mainly confined within quartz-carbonate and sulphide-bearing quartz veins within sheared, altered rocks, while listvenitization plays a significant role in gold concentration along the Haimur area. Therefore, critical analyses of remote sensing data were applied to map alteration zones and delineate listvenites. Spatially enhanced images were processed to trace lineaments and weakness zones which may represent pathways of mineralized, ascended hydrothermal fluids. Ground geophysical, magnetic and geoelectric surveys were performed to study the depth-extension of mineralized bodies in the vicinity of the historical mines within Wadi Haimur. Interpretation of land-magnetic data indicates the presence of mineralized veins associated with narrow shear zones. Derivatives and high-pass filters were utilized to map shallow mineralized sources and deduce their trends. Upward continuation and low-pass filters were used to detect the deep sources. Depths to magnetic bodies were estimated using Power-Spectrum, Euler and inversion of single anomalies. Geochemical sampling was performed to test the results. According to the remarkable variation in resistivity and chargeability values of resistivity and induced-polarization tomography profiles, the subsurface lithology was classified and probable mineralized zones within the subsurface were detected. Encouraging results from regolith, trenching, rock-chip sampling and Reverse-Circulation (RC) drilling indicated the extension of auriferous anomalies within the bedrock. Good correlation of RC-holes auriferous anomalies depths and deduced depths from magnetic interpretation was revealed.

TI  - Delineation of the subsurface boundary between the Central and Southern Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The shear zone characterization is a substantial task for understanding the influencing tectonic movements. In this study, an integrated approach of remote sensing and aeromagnetic data is introduced to imagine and trace the subsurface shear zone between the Central (CED) and Southern (SED) domains of the Egyptian Eastern Desert in comparison with the previously proposed approaches mainly using only surface criteria. To produce an enhanced geological map reflecting the different lithological units along both sides of the surficial shear zone, Landsat-8 images are processed and interpreted using False Color Composite (FCC), Color Ratio Composites (CRC). Moreover, the associated lineaments and their trends are extracted from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data using the lineaments extraction approaches. For delineating the subsurface structures pattern and tracking the probable subsurface CED/SED boundary, aeromagnetic datasets are reduced to magnetic pole (RTP) and, then, interpreted by applying significant techniques comprising upward continuation, Gaussian separation filter, horizontal gradient magnitude (HGM), and tilt derivative angle (TDR). The best path of the shear zone line at depths was imagined; this path agrees with some geologists' opinion regarding the superficial description of the CED/SED separating shear zone. On the other hand, trend analysis was applied on the subsurface and surface data, reflecting a positive matching between the resulting trends from the magnetic and remote sensing data. The NW direction represents both data's major trend and less common NNW NAS, NNE, and ENE trends. This relation reflects the extension and effect of the subsurface structures on the surface in the study area. (c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - A deep learning-based method for mapping alpine intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams of the Tibetan Plateau from Sentinel-1 time series and DEMs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Flow regime changes of Intermittent Rivers and Ephemeral Streams (IRES) can serve as an indicator under global warming, yet the distribution of IRES is rarely extracted at the alpine catchment scale due to their narrow water surface and the heavy cloud contamination on the Tibetan Plateau. Here, a new two-stage method using the deep learning model is proposed for Mapping alpine IRES from Sentinel-1 time series and Digital elevation models (MISD). Firstly, the median images of cross-orbits double-periods (i.e., the flowing period and the drying-up period of alpine IRES) Sentinel-1 time series are input to the deep learning model to synoptically extract alpine IRES in mixed pixels under the heavy cloud contamination. Secondly, the deep learning-based output is corrected by the critical drainage accumulation derived from digital elevation models to remove the disturbance of the non-channelized overland flow on upland. The MISD method was first applied to an alpine catchment, namely the Duodigou Catchment, and then was assessed in the whole Lhasa River Basin. The results showed that the application of cross-orbits double-periods Sentinel-1 time series in the deep learning model is helpful in handling the mixed-pixel problem. And the critical drainage accumulation correction further improves the deep learning-based output with F2 (the metric that measures precision and recall of model) and the median Euclidean distance error of 0.72 and 64.0 m, respectively. Subsequently, the newly proposed MISD method outperforms other river extraction methods in alpine IRES mapping with higher F2 (increased by 0.5) and lower median Euclidean distance error (decreased by 145.7 m). Moreover, the MISD method is characterized by the capability for detecting narrower or lower flow IRES with river width > 1.7 m and discharge >2 L/s, which is significantly ignored in the current global water products. Furthermore, the MISD method successfully recognizes most of the channelized IRES from permanent rivers in the whole Lhasa River Basin through essential training. Therefore, the MISD method is a powerful tool for monitoring the changes of IRES induced by the glacier retreats or the permafrost degradation, etc., on the warming Tibetan Plateau.

T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The improvement of Earth Observation (EO) sensors and modern computational efficiency in the form of cloud analytics platform has made monitoring and interpretation of floods much more efficient. In this study, we present the recently occurred floods in the north-central section of the Irrawaddy River, inundating the adjoining farmlands on the active floodplains along a stretch of 228 km. The amount of rainfall was observed to have gradually risen from early June 2022 captured through GPM data. Similarly, the water levels in the study stretch were observed to have increased from 98.08 m to 104.08 m (from Sentinel-3 altimetry) due to torrential rains on the northern hilly tracts of Myanmar. High-resolution Sentinel-1 SAR datasets have been used to estimate flood progression in the GEE platform. The total inundated area had risen from 196 to 989 sq. km. throughout June till the first week of July. Thus, EO data associated with accessible computing on cloud platforms help monitor flood progression, warn the community well in advance and support the development of crop insurance strategies, anticipatory actions and many more to strengthen evidence-based flood policy.

TI  - Phenological heterogeneities of invasive <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> salt marshes revealed by high-spatial-resolution satellite imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid expansion of invasive Spartina alternifiora in China's coastal wetlands has seriously threatened regional ecosystem health. Characterizing phenology of S. alternifiora salt marshes supports the studies on plant invasion mechanism and carbon fluxes in coastal wetlands. To date, little is known about the capacity of high-spatial-resolution imagery in revealing local scale heterogeneities and temporal variations in the phenology; in addition, the driving factors of such heterogeneities are not well understood. This study took Yellow River Estuary (YRE) as the study site where S. alternifiora area has expanded since 2008. We retrieved start of season (SOS), end of season (EOS), length of growing season (LOS), and maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVImax) from time series Sentinel-2 imagery (10-meter resolution) during 2017 - 2019 with assist of a rulebased data noise removal approach. Results showed that phenological metrics differ with invasion years. The differences in the median NDVImax reached 0.13, in the median SOS reached 26 days, and in the median LOS reached 51 days. S. alternifiora with 5-year invasion had the highest NDVImax, and younger S. alterniflora marshes had earlier SOS and longer LOS. Both SOS and EOS showed negative relationships with NDVImax, indicating the marshes with greater green vegetation cover had earlier SOS and EOS. More spatial details can be revealed from higher-resolution PlanetScope imagery (3-meter resolution), showing the influence of tidal creeks on phenology. The spatial heterogeneity in phenology was associated with environmental factors such as tidal inundation, elevation, micro-climate, nutrients, and canopy structure. S. alternifiora showed markedly higher NDVImax and earlier EOS in 2018 compared to 2017 and 2019, associated with larger river water discharge and sediment load brought by Water Sediment Regulation Scheme, greater precipitation in the wettest season and lower preseason temperature in 2018. Large phenological variations at both spatial and temporal scales suggest that S. alternifiora marshes are sensitive to the local environment and climate change. This study has the potential to provide references for the management of invasive plants threatening coastal wetlands in the world.

TI  - Mapping the presence and distribution of tree species in Canada?s forested ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of tree species is required to inform management, planning, and monitoring of forests as well as to characterize habitat and ecosystem function. Remotely sensed data and spatial modeling enable mapping of tree species presence and distribution. Following an assessment of tree species identified in the sample-based National Forest Inventory (NFI), we mapped 37 tree species over the 650-Mha, forest-dominated ecosystems of Canada representing 2019 conditions. Landsat imagery and related spectral indices, geographic and climate data, elevation derivatives, and remote sensing-derived phenology are used as predictor variables trained with cali-bration samples from Canada's NFI using the Random Forests machine learning algorithm. Based upon prior knowledge of tree species distributions, classification models were implemented on a regional basis, meaning only the tree species that are expected in a given mapping region were modeled using local calibration samples. Modeling resulted in class membership probabilities values for each regionally eligible tree species for all treed pixels as well as an indicator of attribution confidence derived from the distance in feature space between the two leading classes. Accuracy assessment was conducted using independent validation data also drawn from the NFI following the same selection rules and indicated an overall accuracy of 93.1% +/- 0.1% (95%-confidence interval). Predictor variables informing on geographic, climatic and topographic conditions had the largest importance on the classification models. Nationally, the most common leading tree species were black spruce (Picea mariana; 203 Mha or 57.3% of the treed area), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides; 34.7 Mha, 9.8%), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta; 21.1 Mha, 5.9%). Regionally, there was ecozone-level dominance of other tree species, including subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa; Montane Cordillera), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla; Pacific Maritime), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea; Atlantic Maritime). Based upon the per-pixel class membership probabilities, species assemblages akin to those in forest inventories can also be produced. Further, given the calibrated reflectance of Landsat imagery, the methods presented herein can be implemented over a time series of images. The approach uses open data as predictor variables, making the method portable to other areas given availability of tree species training data.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Snow cover plays an essential role in climate change and the hydrological cycle of the Tibetan Plateau. The widely used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow products have two major issues: massive data gaps due to frequent clouds and relatively low estimate accuracy of snow cover due to complex terrain in this region. Here we generate long-term daily gap-free snow cover products over the Tibetan Plateau at 500 m resolution by applying a hidden Markov random field (HMRF) technique to the original MODIS snow products over the past two decades. The data gaps of the original MODIS snow products were fully filled by optimally integrating spectral, spatiotemporal, and environmental information within HMRF framework. The snow cover estimate accuracy was greatly increased by incorporating the spatiotemporal variations of solar radiation due to surface topography and sun elevation angle as the environmental contextual information in HMRF-based snow cover estimation. We evaluated our snow products, and the accuracy is 98.29 % in comparison with in situ observations, and 91.36 % in comparison with high-resolution snow maps derived from Landsat images. Our evaluation also suggests that the incorporation of spatiotemporal solar radiation as the environmental contextual information in HMRF modeling, instead of the simple use of surface elevation as the environmental contextual information, results in the accuracy of the snow products increases by 2.71 % and the omission error decreases by 3.59 %. The accuracy of our snow products is especially improved during snow transitional period, and over complex terrains with high elevation and sunny slopes. The new products can provide long-term and spatiotemporally continuous information of snow cover distribution, which is critical for understanding the processes of snow accumulation and melting, analyzing its impact on climate change, and facilitating water resource management in Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Anticipating drought-related food security changes
T2  - NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Food insecurity early warning can provide time to mitigate unfolding crises; however, drought remains a large source of uncertainty. The challenge is to filter unclear or conflicting signals from various climatic and socio-economic variables and link them to food security outcomes. Integrating lag-1 autocorrelation diagnostics into remotely sensed observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission and food prices, we found dramatic improvement in anticipating the timing and intensity of food crises, except in conflict settings. We analysed drought-induced food crises globally in the SMAP record (since 2015; approximately five per year). The change in soil moisture autocorrelation, which we term the Soil Moisture Auto-Regressive Threshold (SMART), signalled an accurate food security transition for all cases studied here (P < 0.05; n = 212), including lead time of up to three to six months for every case. The SMART trigger anticipates the timing of the transition and the magnitude of the food security change among small to large transitions, both into and out of crises (R-2 = 0.80-0.83). While we do not evaluate out-of-sample forecast accuracy using our model, our findings suggest a significant advancement in the capabilities of food security early-warning diagnostics and could save lives and resources.Early warnings of impending food crises can provide valuable time to mitigate their worst impacts, but droughts have proven difficult to predict. Soil moisture autocorrelation measured by remote sensing satellites advances our ability to anticipate food security crises resulting from drought.

TI  - Dry season forage assessment across senegalese rangelands using earth observation data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Strengthening of feed security in the Sahel is urgently needed given the climate change and growing human population. A prerequisite to this is sustainable use of rangeland forage resources for livestock. Many studies have focused on the assessment of rangeland resources during the rainy season, while only a few have focused on the dry season which is the longest and most demanding period for livestock in Sahelian rangelands. The objective of this study is to develop remote sensing-based models for estimating dry season forage vegetation mass. To that end, 29 vegetation indices calculated from each of the MODIS-MCD43A4 (500 m), Landsat-8 (30 m), and Sentinel-2 (10 m) satellite products were used and tested against in situ data collected during three field-measurement campaigns in 2021 at eleven monitoring sites across Senegalese rangelands. Four statistical models were tested, namely, random forest, gradient boosting machines, and simple linear and multiple linear regressions. The two main vegetation mass variables modeled from remote sensing imagery were the standing herbaceous and litter dry mass (BH) and total forage dry mass (BT) with a dry mass of woody plant leaves added to BH. Overall, Sentinel-2 data provided the best performance for the assessment of BH with multiple linear regression (R-2 = 0.74; RMSE = 378 kg DM/ha) using NDI5 (Normalized Difference Index5), GRCI (Green Residue Cover Index), SRI (Simple Ratio Index), TCARI (Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index), and DFI (Dead Fuel Index) indices. For BT, the best model was also obtained from Sentinel-2 data, including RVI3 (Ratio Vegetation Index3) (R-2 = 0.78; RMSE = 496 kg DM/ha). Results showed the suitability of combining the red, green, blue, NIR, SWIR1, and SWIR2 bands in monitoring forage availability during the dry season. Our study revealed that the spectral richness of the optical sensor systems Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and MODIS-MCD43A4 allowed for accurate assessments of dry-season forage mass of semi-arid rangelands. Adding to this, the high spatial and temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery makes this a promising data source for timely monitoring. These findings can support the monitoring of the animal feed balance in Sahelian countries and contribute to enhancing the resilience of pastoralism toward feed shortage through early warning systems.

TI  - Epidemiology and pre-vaccine burden of rotavirus diarrhea in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC): Results of sentinel surveillance, 2009-2019
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Since August 2009, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has implemented sentinel site surveillance for rotavirus gastroenteritis. Limited hospital studies have been carried out, in DRC, describ-ing the epidemiology of rotavirus diarrhea before rotavirus vaccine introduction in October 2019. This analysis describes the epidemiology of rotavirus gastroenteritis and characteristics of circulating viral strains from 2009 to 2019.Materials and methods: We analyzed demographic and clinic data collected from children < 5 years old enrolled at three rotavirus sentinel surveillance sites in DRC during 2009-2019, prior to rotavirus vaccine introduction in 2019. Data have been described and presented as mean +/- standard deviation for quantita-tive variables with normal distribution, or as median with an interquartile range [Q1-Q3] for quantitative variables with non-normal distribution, or as absolute value with percentage for qualitative variables.Results: Between August 2009 and December 2019, 4,928 children < 5 years old were admitted to sentinel surveillance sites for gastroenteritis in the DRC; the rotavirus positivity rate was 60 %. There was a slight male gender predominance (56 %), and the majority of children (79 %) were 0-11 months of age. Every year, the incidence was highest between May and September corresponding to the dry and cool season. Genotyping was performed for 50 % of confirmed rotavirus cases. The most common G genotypes were G1 (39 %) and G2 (24 %) and most common P genotypes were P[6] (49 %) and P[8] (37 %). The most common G-P genotype combinations were G1P[8] (22 %), G2P[6] (16 %) and G1P[6] (14 %). Genotype distribution var-ied by site, age group, and year.Conclusion: From 2009 to 2019, rotavirus-associated gastroenteritis represented a significant burden among DRC children under 5 who were admitted to sentinel sites. G1P[8] was the most commonly identi-fied genotype. Continued monitoring after the introduction of rotavirus vaccine will be essential to monitor any changes in epidemiology.

TI  - Does the character of the hospital of primary management influence outcomes in patients treated for presumed early stage endometrial cancer and atypical endometrial hyperplasia: a comparison of outcomes from a cancer unit and cancer centre
T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A retrospective study from 2015 to 2020 comparing overall survival (OS) outcomes of a cancer unit and centre for presumed early stage endometrial cancers is presented. Cancer centres manage these presumed early endometrial cancer (EC) in situations of complex co-morbidities, surgical challenges as well as their own local unit patients. Our analysis compares 138 patients at KMH (unit) and 282 patients at RDH (centre) on OS, patient demographics, grading histology and final histology. Patients with presumed early stage EC can be reassured regarding no difference in OS between the cancer unit and centre management (p = .05). However, rates of minimal access surgery were higher at the cancer centre compared to the unit (93.2% versus 68.1%). The rates of upstaged disease were 4% and 8.8% at the cancer unit and centre respectively (p = .096). Sentinel node biopsy and genomic assessment may change future thresholds for centre-level management due to rates of upstaged disease.Impact Statement What is already known on this subject? Presumed lower risk endometrial cancers (endometrioid grades 1 and 2) have a rate of occult nodal involvement of only 1.4%. The BGCS does not recommend lymphadenectomy for low-risk endometrial cancers. These low-risk endometrial cancers should be managed with a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-ophrectomy via minimal access surgery. In view of the low rates of occult nodal involvement in low-risk endometrial cancer, surgery can be offered at a cancer unit. What do the results of this study add? Our study demonstrates there is no disadvantage in overall survival in the surgical management of presumed low-risk endometrial cancers at cancer units and centres. However, cancer centres have higher rates of minimal access to surgery despite managing a more elderly population. Our rates of upstaged disease of 4% and 8.8% at the cancer unit and centre indicate a potential benefit of pelvic lymph node assessment. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Sentinel lymph node biopsy does not have the surgical morbidity associated with systematic lymph node dissection. Therefore, when applied to presumed early stage endometrial cancer, there are potential changes in the threshold for centre-level management to improve overall survival.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INCLUSIVE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - There is limited research about inclusive education and indigenous people in Colombia. Therefore, there is a need to empirically explore this phenomenon in the country. Out of all the indigenous tribes and communities in Colombia, this study focused on exploring the practice of Buen Vivir (cosmovision (worldview) and the concept of what Good Living means) with the Misak community in Guambia, Colombia. It is one of the largest, solid indigenous groups in the country and the researchers have a strong affiliation with this community. For this research, we use qualitative research (interviews and a focus group), specifically, Participatory Video Research (PVR), to give the participants a voice and empower them to take more control over and benefit from the research for their own communities. This study demonstrated that the dimensions of solidarity, reciprocity, complementarity, and harmony with nature were important to achieve the Misak 'Buen Vivir' practice. The researchers identified a series of benefits that the PVR project had brought to the community. These benefits were technical skills for the community, self-confidence regarding the use of technologies, improvement in the relationship between the participants of each of the groups, and the possibility of using the video tool for educational and awareness-raising topics with the Misak community. The findings revealed that it was a positive experience for the community to have actively participated in the entire process.

TI  - Global deforestation revisited: The role of weak institutions
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Linking weak governance and forest degradation has received increasing attention in scientific and political spheres. Deforestation remains a global matter as a major agent of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, for endangering the lives of several plant and animal species, and for triggering political disputes involving land tenure and rural violence. Political factors are acknowledged to have a direct impact on forest resources man-agement. Corruption and weak governance are able to deflect policies to private interests, and encourage illegal logging and unlawful allowances to forest degradation even in protected areas. However, the effects of cor-ruption and weak institutions in forest management are still uncertain. This paper offers empirical-based evi-dence about the relationship between institutional factors and forest cover conversion. The role of weak institutions is explored by employing a logistic model of recent high-resolution global remote sensing data from the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (CCI-LC) from 1992 and 2015. We assess the cross-country associations of the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) and the World Bank Government Effectiveness (GE) index while controlling for physiographic and structural variables. Results are robust and show, as expected, that difficult access areas pose considerable barriers to forest conversion, and regions of high agricultural suitability are more likely to be converted from forests to agricultural fields. Furthermore, higher government effectiveness with stronger political enforcement, policy design, and lower corruption perception are significantly related to a lower probability of deforestation. Further elaborating governance and corruption in-dicators with emphasis on forest management/conservation can potentially improve the accuracy of local and cross-country quantitative land use studies. Our findings support the continuous understanding of weak in-stitutions in deforestation debates. The paper highlights the need to fight corruption and to build strong in-stitutions into effective policy strategies.

TI  - An investigation into urban heat mitigation by adopting local climate zones and land surface temperatures in the Tokyo prefecture
T2  - JAPAN ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to investigate urban forms susceptible to heightened heat intensities in the Tokyo Prefecture in Japan. Adopting Landsat 8 data at a pixel resolution of 100 m, local climate zones (LCZ) were identified. LCZs contain urban forms which are primarily defined by building compactness and height. Daytime spatial distribution of land surface temperatures (LST) was provided by MODIS 100 m resolution data from 2013 to 2021. Median LSTs for compact and super high-rise, high-rise, mid-rise, and low-rise LCZs were 34.4, 35.5, 37.3, and 38.1 degrees C, respectively. Additionally, LSTs for open and super high-rise, high-rise, and mid-rise LCZs were 37.4, 37.5, and 37.1 degrees C, respectively. Therefore, this suggests lower-rise and open LCZs are prone to increased urban heat intensities and higher-rise and compact LCZs are an urban heat mitigation strategy. Open mid-rise also offers heat reduction capabilities. Compact low-rise and open mid-rise spatial analysis also confirmed this trend with vegetation indices validating urban configuration as significantly influencing LSTs. Furthermore, due to LSTs constituting heat health risks, 11 municipalities comprised of predominantly compact low-rise LCZs were identified as a priority for urban heat mitigation. Among these, Nakano, Nerima, and Suginami posed the greatest heat risks.

TI  - Assessing the accuracy of Sentinel-2 instantaneous subpixel shorelines using synchronous UAV ground truth surveys
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to recent technological advancements in the field of cloud-based satellite remote sensing, the barriers to global analysis ready dataset access and processing have lowered drastically increasing the opportunity for large-scale long-term satellite-derived shoreline monitoring solutions. However, validation studies employing syn-chronous and independent in-situ instantaneous shorelines at scale are limited. Thanks to a unique dataset of 47 synchronous UAV photogrammetric surveys in 15 coastal locations in Victoria, Australia, over 3 years, we validated Sentinel-2 instantaneous subpixel shorelines extracted using the most common water indices, CoastSat and a tidal-balanced convolutional neural network (Unet+++). We assessed the accuracy of the water level estimation using 9 wave run-up models and wave data sourced from a nearshore wave buoy network, a regional hindcast model and a global altimeter wave dataset. This paper also presents the first validation of Deep Learning-derived shorelines using synchronous independent in-situ data. We found the best overall performance and least threshold-sensitive shoreline extraction approach to be the WI index, whilst NDWI had the poorest performances despite being the most utilized across the literature. We found that the thresholdless Unet+++ solution coupled with an ensemble wave run-up model and the altimeter wave data is an adequate trade-off in terms of accuracy, adaptability and wave data access for global scale shoreline studies.Moreover, we highlighted the very high spatial variability of beach-scale shoreline extraction performances and found that generally, the best SDS extractor only performs best along 30-40% of a coastline. Our results suggest that future satellite-derived shoreline approaches should investigate the relationships between scene -dependent variables and shoreline accuracies in order to better understand the causes of beach-scale perfor-mance variations and increase the accuracy of satellite-derived shorelines.

TI  - Water Quality Monitoring Using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 Satellite Data (2014-2020) in Timsah Lake, Ismailia, Suez Canal Region (Egypt)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to monitor the water quality in Timsah Lake by satellite data, the largest water body in Ismailia district, Egypt. To achieve this, multi-temporal space-born data of both Landsat-8 OLI- (L1 and L2) and Sentinel-2 (2A and 2B) were used during 2014-2020. The methodologies of Case 2 regional coast colour algorithm and aquatic reflectance were applied for monitoring the physical properties of different water characteristics encompassing chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter (TSM), and aquatic reflectance. Satellite data from dry and wet seasons (2014-2020) were selected to examine seasonal and temporal variation. Comparing water quality through the dry and wet seasons (2014-2020) is to avoid the difference in atmospheric conditions and detect seasonal variations. The present study results have shown that the Western Lagoon and its streams are considered the primary source of pollution. Specifically, lower values are observed during August 2015 for TSM (4-17 g m(-3)) and chlorophyll-a (2-11 g m(-3)), while the highest values of TSM (23-50 g m(-3)) appear during August 2018 and for chlorophyll-a during August 2016-2018 (20-40 g m(-3)). For the wet season for TSM, the lowest values are observed during 2016 (3-10 g m(-3)), and the maximum is noticed during 2019 (13-29 g m(-3)); for the chlorophyll-a, maximum values are observed during 2017 (10-23 g m(-3)).

TI  - Annual 30 m soybean yield mapping in Brazil using long-term satellite observations, climate data and machine learning
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term spatially explicit information on crop yield is essential for understanding food security in a changing climate. Here we present a study that combines twenty-years of Landsat and MODIS data, climate and weather records, municipality-level crop yield statistics, random forests and linear regression models for mapping crop yield in a multi-temporal, multi-scale modeling framework. The study was conducted for soybean in Brazil. Using a recently developed 30 m resolution, annual (2001-2019) soybean classification map product, we aggregated multi-temporal phenological metrics derived from Landsat and MODIS data over soybean pixels to the munic-ipality scale. We combined phenological metrics with topographic features, long-term climate data, in-season weather data and soil variables as inputs to machine learning models. We trained a multi-year random forests model using yield statistics as reference and subsequently applied linear regression to adjust the biases in the direct output of the random forests model. This model combination achieved the best performance with a root -mean-square-error (RMSE) of 344 kg/ha (12% relative to long-term mean yield) and an r2 of 0.69, on the basis of 20% withheld test data. The RMSE of the leave-one-year-out model assessment ranged from 259 kg/ha to 816 kg/ha. To eliminate the artifacts caused by the coarse-resolution climate and weather data, we developed multiple models with different categories of input variables. Employing the per-pixel uncertainty estimates of different models, the final soybean yield maps were produced through per-pixel model composition. We applied the models trained on 2001-2019 data to 2020 data and produced a soybean yield map for 2020, demonstrating the predictive capability of trained machine learning models for operational yield mapping in future years. Our research showed that combining satellite, climate and weather data and machine learning could effectively map crop yield at high resolution, providing critical information to understand yield growth, anomaly and food security.

TI  - Comparative assessment of satellite- and drone-based vegetation indices to predict arthropod biomass in shrub-steppes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Arthropod biomass is a key element in ecosystem functionality and a basic food item for many species. It must be estimated through traditional costly field sampling, normally at just a few sampling points. Arthropod biomass and plant productivity should be narrowly related because a large majority of arthropods are herbivorous, and others depend on these. Quantifying plant productivity with satellite or aerial vehicle imagery is an easy and fast procedure already tested and implemented in agriculture and field ecology. However, the capability of satellite or aerial vehicle imagery for quantifying arthropod biomass and its relationship with plant productivity has been scarcely addressed. Here, we used unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery to establish a relationship between plant productivity and arthropod biomass estimated through ground-truth field sampling in shrub steppes. We UAV-sampled seven plots of 47.6-72.3 ha at a 4-cm pixel resolution, subsequently downscaling spatial resolution to 50 cm resolution. In parallel, we used S2 imagery from the same and other dates and locations at 10-m spatial resolution. We related several vegetation indices (VIs) with arthropod biomass (epigeous, coprophagous, and four functional consumer groups: predatory, detritivore, phytophagous, and diverse) estimated at 41-48 sampling stations for UAV flying plots and in 67-79 sampling stations for S2. VIs derived from UAV were consistently and positively related to all arthropod biomass groups. Three out of seven and six out of seven S2-derived VIs were positively related to epigeous and coprophagous arthropod biomass, respectively. The blue normalized difference VI (BNDVI) and enhanced normalized difference VI (ENDVI) showed consistent and positive relationships with arthropod biomass, regardless of the arthropod group or spatial resolution. Our results showed that UAV and S2-VI imagery data may be viable and cost-efficient alternatives for quantifying arthropod biomass at large scales in shrub steppes. The relationship between VI and arthropod biomass is probably habitat-dependent, so future research should address this relationship and include several habitats to validate VIs as proxies of arthropod biomass.

TI  - CARNet: An effective method for SAR image interference suppression
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) routinely confronts the interference of radiofrequency devices in normal missions, causing ineffective imaging and seriously affecting Earth observation capability. In general, it is a great challenge to ensure interference suppression performance and image quality. To address this problem, we present an efficient method for SAR image interference suppression based on the Combined-Attention Restoration Network (CARNet). SAR image model is established, including target image, interference image, and background noise image. Specifically, we first propose a new feature extraction scheme to capture image model information over space and channels for enriching the context. Then encoder-decoder is employed to suppress interference and produce different-dimensional feature maps for target information exchange. Moreover, the image attention mechanism is introduced to calibrate the target features under the guidance of original images for essential information propagation. Besides, several attentional connections exist to prevent further loss of target details. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on simulated data and measured Sentinel-1 images. Compared with conventional and state-of-the-art algorithms, the results indicate that CARNet achieves better interference suppression performance and can generate high-resolution images closer to the ground truth.

TI  - Simulating the spatiotemporal variations of oasis rural settlements in the upper reaches of rivers of arid regions in Xinjiang, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rural settlements in oasis are primary habitations, and their changes are related to natural environment and anthropogenic activities. The spatiotemporal variations of rural settlements in an oasis are significant in arid regions. In this study, Qipan Township (QPT) and Yamansu Township (YMST) were chosen as a case study and validation case, respectively. Datasets, including Landsat images in 2002, 2010, and 2018, were collected. The cellular automata (CA)-agent-based model (ABM) and patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model were used to simulate the spatiotemporal dynamic variations of rural settlement and other land use types in the oasis in this study. Natural environmental, socioeconomic conditions, and human decision-making are the three driving factors that were used in the model. Human decision-making involves the actions of two types of agents: authority agent and resident agent. On the basis of land use data of 2002 and 2010, the rural settlement and other land use in 2018 were predicted using the CA-MAS and PLUS models. The following results were obtained: First, human decision-making behaviors were the leading factor in the changes of rural settlements in the CA-ABM model. Second, CA based on multiple random seed (CARS) of PLUS could better simulate the spatiotemporal variations of QPT rural settlements than CA-ABM and linear regression of PLUS. Similarly, CARS of PLUS also simulated the spatiotemporal evolution of rural settlements in YMST with high accuracy. Third, the areas of croplands, roads, and residential lands in QPT will expand to 20.7, 5.7, and 4.6 km(2), respectively, in 2026, but the unused land will shrink, as predicted by CARS of PLUS. This study provides a scientific basis for the environmental protection of rural settlements in the oasis and sustainable settlement planning in arid regions.

TI  - Characterizing the river migration process based on migration events of individual bends: a case study of the lower Yellow River, China
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent channel shifts in the Lower Yellow River easily leads to embankment collapse causing geomorphological processes necessary to characterize. This paper segmented the river centreline from its component unit-bends and established a migration event model to characterize the migration process of rivers. The inflection points on the river centreline can be used to segment individual bends. Three types of migration events, disappearance, lateral migration and decomposition, are defined for the first time to categorize river migration. Furthermore, these migration events can be rapidly detected using the Meander Migration Index. The four-tuple BMModel (Bend Migration Model), including events, spatial positions, bend types and migration attributes, systematically quantifies the river migration process. In addition, these results can be implemented with an integrated PyBend (Python-Bend migarition) package, providing promising technical support for the studies of river migration and evolution over long time series.

TI  - A surface water mapping framework combining optical and radar remote sensing and its application in China
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing provides an efficient pathway to map inland surface water extent across different spatial and temporal scales. However, how to monitor the surface water distribution and its spatiotemporal variability via combining optical and radar remote sensing datasets still faces substantial challenges. In this study, we propose a Seamless Surface Water Mapping Framework (SSWMF) which synergizes both optical (MODIS, Landsat 8, Sentinel-2) and SAR (Sentinel-1) imageries. The validity of SSWMF was first proved over the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River of China with abundant lake resources, showing an overall accuracy of 90.72%, and the results indicate that SSWMF can provide surface water map with higher spatial and temporal continuity compared to the Joint Research Centre Global Surface Water dataset. Multi-source validation showed that the SSWMF-derived surface water maps can well capture the temporal fluctuation and spatial heterogeneity of water resources over China, with an overall accuracy of 92.39%. Overall, our results suggest that the proposed water mapping framework is promising and is readily applicable to large-scale water resource management and drought/flood monitoring.

TI  - Analysis of CYGNSS coherent reflectivity over land for the characterization of pan-tropical inundation dynamics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of flood and wetland dynamics at global scale is hampered by several limitations, including a reduced data availability in tropical areas due to the presence of clouds affecting visible and infrared imagery, or low spatial and/or temporal resolutions affecting passive and active microwave Earth Observation (EO) data. As a consequence, surface water extent estimates and their temporal variations remain challenging especially in equatorial river basins. Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) L-band signals recorded onboard Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) mission, composed of 8 Low Elevation Orbit (LEO) satellites, provide infor-mation on surface properties at high temporal resolution from 2017 up to now. CYGNSS bistatic observations were analyzed for detecting permanent water and seasonal floodplains over the full coverage of the mission, from 40 degrees S to 40 degrees N. We computed CYGNSS reflectivity associated to the coherent component of the received power, that was gridded at 0.1 degrees spatial resolution with a 7-day time sampling afterwards. Several statistical metrics were derived from CYGNSS reflectivity, including the weighted mean and standard deviation, the median and the 90th percentile (respectively rmean, rstd, rmedian and r90%) in each pixel. These parameters were clustered using the K -means algorithm with an implementation of the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) similarity measure. They were compared to static inundation maps, and to dynamic estimations of surface water extent both at the global and regional scales, using the Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) and MODIS-based products. The difference between r90% and rmedian shows the best sensitivity to the presence of water. The river streams and lakes are correctly detected, and a strong seasonality is identified in CYGNSS reflectivity over the largest floodplains, with the exception of the Cuvette Centrale of Congo which is covered by dense vegetation. This seasonal reflectivity signal correlates well with inundation maps: Pearson's correlation coefficient between rmedian and surface water extent from both GIEMS and MODIS is over 0.8 in the largest floodplains. The spatial patterns of reflectivity are consistent with static inundation maps: at the time of maximum flooding extent, a spatial correlation coefficient around 0.75 with rmedian is obtained for several basins. We also evaluated the dependence of CYGNSS-derived clusters and reflectivity on the dominant land cover type and on the density of Above Groud Biomass (AGB) in the pixel. On the one hand, misclassifications of flooded pixels were observed over vegetated regions, probably due to uncertainties related to the attenuation by the vegetation in both CYGNSS and reference datasets. On the other hand, flooded pixels with a mean AGB up to similar to 300 Mg/ha were correctly detected with the clustering. High reflectivity values are also observed over rocky soils in arid regions and create false alarms. Finally, strong winds on large lakes cause surface roughness, and lower reflectivity values are observed in this case which weaken the detection of open water. While these constraints are to be taken in account and corrected in a future model, a pan-tropical mapping of surface water extent dynamics using CYGNSS can be envisaged.

TI  - <i>Daphnia</i> as a Sentinel Species for Environmental Health Protection: A Perspective on Biomonitoring and Bioremediation of Chemical Pollution
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite available technology and the knowledge that chemical pollution damages human and ecosystem health, chemical pollution remains rampant, ineffectively monitored, rarely prevented, and only occasionally mitigated. We present a framework that helps address current major challenges in the monitoring and assessment of chemical pollution by broadening the use of the sentinel species Daphnia as a diagnostic agent of water pollution. And where prevention has failed, we propose the application of Daphnia as a bioremediation agent to help reduce hazards from chemical mixtures in the environment. By applying "omics" technologies to Daphnia exposed to real-world ambient chemical mixtures, we show improvements at detecting bioactive components of chemical mixtures, determining the potential effects of untested chemicals within mixtures, and identifying targets of toxicity. We also show that using Daphnia strains that naturally adapted to chemical pollution as removal agents of ambient chemical mixtures can sustainably improve environmental health protection. Expanding the use of Daphnia beyond its current applications in regulatory toxicology has the potential to improve both the assessment and the remediation of environmental pollution.

TI  - The synergistic use of multi-scale remote sensing data for the identification of hydrothermal alteration patterns in Los Frailes, Spain
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data can be successfully applied in mineral resource prospecting and exploration. With the increasing number of remote sensing sensors and methods, the application of multi-scale remote sensing data has met a broad audience in the geological remote sensing community over the last few years. Multi-scale remote sensing data close the scale gap between distal (satellite) and proximal (laboratory) remote sensing data, offering both a general and detailed overview of the target and allowing a synergistic use. In this study, the volcanosedimentary hosted massive sulphide ore deposit Los Frailes in the east of the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) in Spain is investigated for the first time with multi-scale remote sensing techniques. A typical hydrothermal alteration zonation is associated to the massive sulphide ore body in Los Frailes, which is characterised by an inner chlorite-rich zonation showing a strong Fe-enrichment and a peripheral muscovite-rich zonation, which is moderately enriched in Fe. The characterisation of these zones support traditional mineral exploration techniques especially in the prospecting phase by detecting regions of interest, thereby reducing time and cost consumption. By evaluating the synergistic use of multi-scale remote sensing data for massive sulphide exploration, an enhanced application for the economic prospecting and exploration of mineral resources in Los Frailes is introduced. Optical data are used for the detection, identification and characterisation of chlorite and white mica occurrences and compositions. A drill core is analysed with the FieldSpec4 Hi-res hyperspectral point spectrometer. Rock samples are investigated in the laboratory using the SisuROCK hyperspectral core imaging station. AisaFENIX hyperspectral field-based and WorldView-3 multispectral satellite data of the open pit are analysed. The mineral(-group) identification and characterisation are performed with either spectral feature fitting methods (hyperspectral) or mineral indices (multispectral). Hyperspectral analyses show Mg-/Al-substitutions due to Fe-enrichment owing to wavelength shifts of the absorption maximum in chlorite and white mica, respectively. The identification and characterisation of the Fe-OH absorption feature of chlorite at around 2250 nm is more challenging compared to the Al-OH absorption feature of muscovite at around 2200 nm because the spectral signature is more subtle regarding the depth and width. However, the chloritic hydrothermal alteration zonation in the footwall is successfully detected in all scales. The hydrothermal muscovite-rich zonation in the footwall is barely outcropping in the pit and is not captured in the drill core. However, the muscovite-rich alteration zonation in the hanging wall is indicated in all scales. Discrepancies in the results arise mainly from different spectral and spatial resolutions of the sensors and differing data acquirement conditions, such as different surface exposures, viewing angles and illumination conditions. The results show that the multiscale method offers great opportunities to localise potential prospecting and exploration targets in the Iberian Pyrite Belt. The synergistic use of the different remote sensing scales offers a complete picture of the target by gaining macroscopic to regional spectral information collectively, which is superior to using only one scale. The method is relatively fast and cost-effective, which makes the identification of potential exploration targets more efficient.

TI  - Polarimetric information content of Sentinel-1 for land cover mapping: An experimental case study using quad-pol data synthesized from complementary repeat-pass acquisitions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents a technique to merge two Sentinel-1 image products of complementary polarimetric information (HH/HV and VH/VV) to derive pseudo-polarimetric features, such as polarimetric covariance, but also model-based and eigenvalue-based decompositions and an unsupervised Wishart classification of scattering types. The images were acquired within a 6-day period over Southern Germany and have been processed to mimic an actual quad-pol product. This was analyzed statistically, visually and within several classification processes to get an understanding of how well such a dataset depicts scattering mechanisms and other polarimetric features as inputs for land use and land cover mapping. A systematic comparison with the original dual-polarization product showed an increase in information content and largely feasible polarimetric features. Yet, especially the average Alpha angle was found to be biased and too high for some of the compared surfaces. Despite these inaccuracies, the polarimetric features turned out to improve potential land cover mapping as compared with backscatter intensities and dual-polarization features of the input products alone. Among the most significant variables related to land use and cover reported by an independent dataset, Entropy, the co-polarization ratio and the C22 element of the covariance matrix generated the strongest impact on the class separability, although misclassifications between physically related classes remain. Yet, the findings are encouraging concerning further investigation of the polarimetric potential to combine repeat-pass acquisitions of Sentinel-1 for a better description of more specific types of land cover.

TI  - Partisan bias in false memories for misinformation about the 2021 US Capitol riot
T2  - MEMORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Memory for events can be biased. For example, people tend to recall more events that support than oppose their current woridview. The present study examined partisan bias in memory for events related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot in the United States. Participants rated their memory for true and false events that were either favourable to their political party or the other major political party in the United States. For both true and false events, participants remembered more events that favoured their political party. Regression analyses showed that the number of false memories that participants reported was positively associated with their tendency to support conspiracy beliefs and with their self-reported engagement with the Capitol riot. These results suggest that Democrats and Republicans remember the Capitol Riot differently and that certain individual difference factors can predict the formation of false memories in this context. Misinformation played an influential role in the Capitol riot and understanding differences in memory for this event is beneficial to avoiding similar tragedies in the future.

TI  - Tropopause-Level NO<sub>x</sub> in the Asian Summer Monsoon
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep convection within the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) transports surface level air into the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS). This work aims to understand the distribution of NO2, NO, and NOx in the UTLS ASM anticyclone from satellite measurements. Observations of NO2 from the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imager System, the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment - Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS), and the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III on the International Space Station are considered. The PRATMO photochemical box model is used to quantify the NOx photochemistry, and to derive the NOx concentration using OSIRIS NO2 and O-3 observations. The satellite data show a relative minimum in NO2 over the ASM in the summer months, while the corresponding NO and NOx anomalies are elevated, mainly due to low O-3 and cold temperatures within the ASM. The observations within the ASM show reasonable agreement to simulations from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model.

TI  - Long-term variation of aerosol optical properties associated with aerosol types over East Asia using AERONET and satellite (VIIRS, OMI) data (2012-2019)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed annual and seasonal frequency in aerosol type over an 8-year period (2012-2019) to identify aerosol parameter trends over four ground sites and country regions in Korea, China, and Japan by using the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), and the satellite-based Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Decreasing trends are shown for aerosol optical depth (AOD), angstrom ng-stro center dot m exponent (AE), and fine mode fraction (FMF) in all countries. The decreasing trend in these data is considered to be due to a decrease in anthropogenic emissions. For the aerosol type frequency, decreases in the proportions of carbonaceous aerosols (CA) and non-absorbing aerosols (NA) were shown in the ground and satellite data, respectively. At most sites, the fractions of low AOD case (LOW) increased, whereas those of the Black and Brown Carbon (BC + BrC) category decreased. In Seoul, the fraction of LOW increased from 48.9% to 70.0%, and that of BC + BrC decreased continuously from 20.4% to 11.1% during 2012-2019. Beijing, on the other hand, showed decreasing LOW from 83.3% (2012) to 52.0% (2019), and that of BC + BrC increased significantly, from 2.4% to 26.2%. The satellite data showed that the percentage of LOW increased continuously, while that of NA aerosols decreased continuously in East Asia. A noticeable decrease in the fraction of CA was detected in China [21.5% (2013) to 11.2% (2019)]. In all countries, CA and NA aerosols had the greatest effect in winter and summer, respectively. We also detected significant differences between the fractions of NA and BC between the ground and satellite data. Changes in aerosol type and properties were observed concurrently in all ground and satellite data, and changes in aerosol type may explain the increasing and decreasing trends that we recorded for most parameters. Consistent results from both ground and satellite data suggest a steady decreasing in fine aerosol pollution in East Asia.

TI  - Predicting the risk of axillary lymph node metastasis in early breast cancer patients based on ultrasonographic-clinicopathologic features and the use of nomograms: a prospective single-center observational study
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to establish two preoperative nomograms to evaluate the risk for axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis in early breast cancer patients based on ultrasonographic-clinicopathologic features. Methods We prospectively evaluated 593 consecutive female participants who were diagnosed with cT(1-3)N(0-1)M(0) breast cancer between March 2018 and May 2019 at Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital. The participants were randomly classified into training and validation sets in a 4:1 ratio for the development and validation of the nomograms, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of ALN status. We developed Nomogram A and Nomogram B to predict ALN metastasis (presence vs. absence) and the number of metastatic ALNs (<= 2 vs. > 2), respectively. Results A total of 528 participants were evaluated in the final analyses. Multivariable analysis revealed that the number of suspicious lymph nodes, long axis, short-to-long axis ratio, cortical thickness, tumor location, and histological grade were independent predictors of ALN status. The AUCs of nomogram A in the training and validation groups were 0.83 and 0.78, respectively. The AUCs of nomogram B in the training and validation groups were 0.87 and 0.87, respectively. Both nomograms were well-calibrated. Conclusion We developed two preoperative nomograms that can be used to predict ALN metastasis (presence vs. absence) and the number of metastatic ALNs (<= 2 vs. > 2) in early breast cancer patients. Both nomograms are useful tools that will help clinicians predict the risk of ALN metastasis and facilitate therapy decision-making about axillary surgery.

TI  - Informing hydrogeological models with remotely sensed evapotranspiration
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed evapotranspiration (ET) rates can provide an additional constraint on the calibration of groundwater models beyond typically-used water table (WT) level observations. The value of this constraint, measured in terms of reductions in model error, however, is expected to vary with the method by which it is imposed and by how closely the ET flux is dependant to groundwater levels. To investigate this variability, four silvicultural sites with different access to groundwater were modeled under three different model-data configurations. A benchmark model that used only WT levels for calibration was compared to two alternatives: one in which satellite remotely sensed ET rates from MODIS-CMRSET were also included in model calibration, and one in which the satellite ET data were assimilated, through the Ensemble Kalman Filter, into the model. Large error reductions in ET flux outputs were achieved when CMRSET data were used to calibrate the model. Assimilation of CMRSET data further improved the model performance statistics where the WT was < 6.5 m deep. It is advantageous to use spatially distributed actual ET data to calibrate groundwater models where it is available. In situations where vegetation has direct access to groundwater, assimilation of ET observations is likely to improve model performance.

TI  - Land cover classification of the Alps from InSAR temporal coherence matrices
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover mapping is of great interest in the Alps region for monitoring the surface occupation changes (e.g. forestation, urbanization, etc). In this pilot study, we investigate how time series of radar satellite imaging (C-band single-polarized SENTINEL-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR), also acquired through clouds, could be an alternative to optical imaging for land cover segmentation. Concretely, we compute for every location (using SAR pixels over 45 x 45 m) the temporal coherence matrix of the Interferometric SAR (InSAR) phase over 1 year. This normalized matrix of size 60, x, 60 (60 acquisition dates over 1 year) summarizes the reflectivity changes of the land. Two machine learning models, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have been developed to estimate land cover classification performances of 6 main land cover classes (such as forests, urban areas, water bodies, or pastures). The training database was created by projecting to the radar geometry the reference labeled CORINE Land Cover (CLC) map on the mountainous area of Grenoble, France. Upon evaluation, both models demonstrated good performances with an overall accuracy of 78% (SVM) and of 81% (CNN) over Chambery area (France). We show how, even with a spatially coarse training database, our model is able to generalize well, as a large part of the misclassifications are due to a low precision of the ground truth map. Although some less computationally expensive approaches (using optical data) could be available, this land cover mapping based on very different information, i.e., patterns of land changes over a year, could be complementary and thus beneficial; especially in mountainous regions where optical imaging is not always available due to clouds. Moreover, we demonstrated that the InSAR temporal coherence matrix is very informative, which could lead in the future to other applications such as automatic detection of abrupt changes as snow fall or landslides.

TI  - Unstated impacts of the green energy industry on the habitat of a coastal delphinid: Turbid-turbulent wakes induced by offshore wind turbine foundations
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Offshore wind farms (OWFs) are a green energy solution to reducing CO2 emissions, but often encroach on major habitats of coastal delphinids. Clustered OWF construction in shallow waters may have cumulative negative impacts on coastal delphinids and marine ecosystems. Although the impacts of piling noise have been discussed extensively, the potential impacts of oceanographic alterations induced by wind turbine foundations are rarely discussed. Two OWFs were constructed near the core habitat of a critically endangered subspecies of humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis taiwanensis) in the eastern Taiwan Strait. Turbid-turbulent wakes induced by wind turbine foundations were inspected using Landsat images. Sighting rates of the humpback dolphin that were obtained from boat-based line-transect surveys near the northern OWF (OWFn) since the late 2000s were examined. Indicators of surface turbidity were used to highlight turbid-turbulent wakes extending in the direction of the main current. Sighting rates of the humpback dolphins near the OWFn have been declining since the 2000s, but decreased significantly after the OWFn was constructed and began operating. The long-term decline in sighting rates implies an alarming decline in the population size of humpback dolphins. Decreased sighting rates after the OWFn installation indicate the reduced utilization of a once-important habitat. Offshore wind farm construction may influence prey abundance and composition and cause acute stress from piling noise; operational noise may mask the chorus of prey fish and turbid-turbulent wakes may disturb the benthic ecosystem. Site selection committees for future OWFs should avoid the habitats of coastal delphinids and areas subject to strong ocean currents. Ecological impact assessments for OWF projects should examine the impacts of turbulent wakes on benthic ecosystems and of acoustic disturbance on marine mammals. Long-term environmental monitoring programmes are recommended, which can be funded by wind energy companies as a compensatory measure.

TI  - Spatio-temporal dynamics of urban sprawl in a rapidly urbanizing city using machine learning classification
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The world is urbanizing at an alarming pace, particularly in developing countries where exponential urban population growth leads to unplanned and uncontrolled urban expansion, resulting in urban sprawl. Mapping, monitoring, measuring urban sprawl, and identifying land cover transition contributors are of pivotal importance in formulating policies and management strategies for the sustainable growth of cities. The article presents an explorative study on the spatio-temporal dynamics of urban transition in Kochi Urban Agglomeration in Kerala, India, from 1988 to 2021, using the support vector machine (SVM) classification, Shannon's entropy, and landscape metrics. From 1988 to 2021, the built-up share in the study area increased from 6.23% to 32.34%. The increased demand for land resulted in converting 186.94 km(2) of cultivated land and 136.64 km(2) of vegetation into built-up land. The level of land-cover changes points to the sprawl on the outskirts and densification in the inner city.

TI  - Drivers of land-use and land-cover change in rural landscapes; a case in Eastern Sierra Leone
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study provides the first attempt at assessing the drivers of LULC change in eastern Sierra Leone where settlement expansion is as eminent as the proliferation of the primary industrial sector, notably agriculture and artisanal mining. For this purpose, using Landsat images at 1986, 2000 and 2020, LULC maps of the study area were obtained. The principal drivers of LULC change were identified based on field observations and interviews with local residents. Additionally, population and climate data were obtained to better understand LULC changes. Vast changes were observed in Shrub/Fallow, Grass/Cropland, Wetland and Built/Barren. Moderate changes were observed in Trees/Forest and Open Water. The drivers of LULC change are attributable to population growth as the main underlying driver and agricultural expansion and infrastructural development as the main proximate or direct drivers. Moreover, the declining rainfall in tandem with rising temperatures can be linked to the shrinking Wetland and Open Water.

TI  - Mapping African wetlands for 2020 using multiple spectral, geo-ecological features and Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands provide numerous ecosystem services essential for biodiversity conservation, climate change mitiga-tion, and human well-being. Nevertheless, there are still no complete and uniform wetland maps providing in-formation on the location, distribution, size, and changing status of wetlands in Africa. In this study, we used 130,000 Landsat satellite images and 270,000 sampling points evenly distributed across Africa to classify wet-lands with a random forest classifier based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. This resulted in the first systematic and comprehensive map of existing wetlands in Africa that quantified the area and distribution of these wetlands at a spatial resolution of 30 m, with an overall wetland producer accuracy of 90.22 % and user accuracy of 95.74 %. To address the seasonal variation in African wetlands, we used a dynamic threshold seg-mentation method based on the Otsu method, which can extract the extent of wetlands under different periods more accurately based on Landsat time series and African phenology data. Our results show that the total African existing wetlands extent from 2019 to 2021 (here in 2020), was approximately 1,341,500 km2, excluding shallow marine waters, comprises 3.98 % of Africa's total land area. Of these wetlands, inland wetlands account for 81 %, and coastal wetlands account for 19 %. The wetlands in Africa were symmetrically distributed around the equator and decreased with increasing latitude, accounting for 97 % of the total wetland area being within the 20 degrees N and 20 degrees S latitudes. African marshes were highly dynamic, expanding by 92.22 % from the dry to wet season. Our study demonstrates the substantial potential of large data samples, multiple wetland classification features (spectral-temporal, topographic, and hydrological features), and random forest classification in GEE for large-scale wetland mapping. The resulting wetland maps provide new baseline data for large-scale monitoring of seasonal dynamics and long-term trends in African wetlands.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of input data resolution on hydrological model performance was not considered in many studies despite its crucial importance, especially for over-parameterized hydrological models. Therefore, in the present study, three land cover sources with different resolutions (Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and CCI-LC, with 10 m, 30 m and 300 m, respectively) were used as input data for the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, to assess their impact on hydrological and erosion modeling. The SWAT model was performed over 19 years (2000-2018) in El Grou watershed (3504 km(2)) under a multi-site calibration approach (two stations). Statistical analysis showed good and satisfactory results for model calibration and validation. The values obtained are between 0.65 and 0.68 for R-2 and NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient), and 0.57-0.63 for RSR (ratio of the root mean square error). Comparing the three models' performance (before and after calibration) indicates a significant similarity whatever the used LULC. Also, the three LULC-based simulations show a predominance of evapotranspiration with 68% and a significant sediment loss of around 1 million tons. This highlights a significant deterioration of the soils and vegetation cover, which requires a sustainable intervention to limit the effects of this phenomenon and protect soils and dams against siltation. Finally, the findings of this study highlight that low-resolution LULC data are often suitable to obtain good results while reducing processing and calibration efforts, which saves time and resources; However, the choice remains open, depending on the study purpose and the expected results.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Human and climate induced land surface changes resulting from irrigation, snow cover decreases, and greening impact the surface albedo over High Mountain Asia (HMA). Here we use a partial information decomposition approach and remote sensing data to quantify the effects of the changes in leaf area index, soil moisture, and snow cover on the surface albedo in HMA, home to over a billion people, from 2003 to 2020. The study establishes strong evidence of anthropogenic agricultural water use over irrigated lands (e.g., Ganges-Brahmaputra) which causes the highest surface albedo decreases (<= 1%/year). Greening and decreased snow cover from warming also drive changes in visible and near-infrared surface albedo in different areas of HMA. The significant role of irrigation and greening in influencing albedo suggests the potential of a positive feedback cycle where albedo decreases lead to increased evaporative demand and increased stress on water resources.

TI  - Deep learning models for river classification at sub-meter resolutions from multispectral and panchromatic commercial satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of the Earth's surface water is critical in a wide range of environmental studies, from evaluating the societal impacts of seasonal droughts and floods to the large-scale implications of climate change. Consequently, a large literature exists on the classification of water from satellite imagery. Yet, previous methods have been limited by (1) the > 10 m spatial resolution of public satellite imagery, (2) classification schemes that operate at the pixel level, and (3) the need for multiple spectral bands. We advance the state-of-the-art by (1) using commercial satellite imagery with panchromatic and multispectral resolutions of similar to 30 cm and similar to 1.2 m, respectively, (2) developing multiple fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) that can learn the morphological features of water bodies in addition to their spectral properties, and (3) FCN that can classify water even from panchromatic imagery. This study focuses on rivers in the Arctic, using images from the Quickbird-2, WorldView-1, WorldView-2, WorldView-3, and GeoEye satellites. Because no training data are available at such high resolutions, we construct those manually. First, we use the red, green, blue, and near-infrared bands of the 8-band multispectral sensors. Those trained models all achieve excellent precision and recall over 90% on validation data, aided by on-the-fly preprocessing of the training data specific to satellite imagery. In a novel approach, we then use results from the multispectral model to generate training data for FCN that only require panchromatic imagery, of which considerably more is available. Despite the smaller feature space, these models still achieve a precision and recall of over 85%. We provide our open-source codes and trained model parameters to the remote sensing community, which paves the way to a wide range of environmental hydrology applications at vastly superior accuracies and 1-2 orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution than previously possible.

TI  - Development and validation of a pre- and intra-operative scoring system that distinguishes between non-advanced and advanced axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer with positive sentinel lymph nodes: a retrospective study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background There are currently no scoring-type predictive models using only easily available pre- and intraoperative data developed for assessment of the risk of advanced axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) in patients with breast cancer with metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). We aimed to develop and validate a scoring system using only pre- and intraoperative data to distinguish between non-advanced (<= 3 lymph nodes) and advanced (> 3 lymph nodes) ALNM in patients with breast cancer with metastatic SLNs. Methods We retrospectively identified 804 patients with breast cancer (cT1-3cN0) who had metastatic SLNs and had undergone axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). We evaluated the risk factors for advanced ALNM using logistic regression analysis and developed and validated a scoring system for the prediction of ALNM using training (n = 501) and validation (n = 303) cohorts, respectively. The predictive performance was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC), and calibration plots. Results Ultrasound findings of multiple suspicious lymph nodes, SLN macrometastasis, the ratio of metastatic SLNs to the total number of SLNs removed, and the number of metastatic SLNs were significant risk factors for advanced ALNM. Clinical tumor size and invasive lobular carcinoma were of borderline significance. The scoring system based on these six variables yielded high AUCs (0.90 [training] and 0.89 [validation]). The calibration plots of frequency compared to the predicted probability showed slopes of 1.00 (training) and 0.85 (validation), with goodness-of-fit for the model. When the cutoff score was set at 4, the negative predictive values (NPVs) of excluding patients with advanced ALNM were 96.8% (training) and 96.9% (validation). The AUC for predicting advanced ALNM using our scoring system was significantly higher than that predicted by a single independent predictor, such as the number of positive SLNs or the proportion of positive SLNs. Similarly, our scoring system also showed good discrimination and calibration ability when the analysis was restricted to patients with one or two SLN metastases. Conclusion Our easy-to-use scoring system can exclude advanced ALNM with high NPVs. It may contribute to reducing the risk of undertreatment with adjuvant therapies in patients with metastatic SLNs, even if ALND is omitted.

TI  - A Scalable Framework for Post Fire Debris Flow Hazard Assessment Using satellite Precipitation Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire is a global phenomenon that has dramatic effects on erosion and flood potential. On steep slopes, burned areas are more likely to experience significant overland flow during heavy rainfall leading to post fire debris flows (PFDFs). Previous work establishes methods for PFDF hazard assessment, often relying on regional-scale parameterizations with in-situ rainfall measurements to categorize hazard as a function of meteorological and surface properties. We present a globally scalable approach to extend the benefit these models provide to new areas. Our new model relies on publicly available satellite-based inputs with a global extent to provide first order hazard assessments of recently burned areas. Our results show it is possible to identify the conditions relevant for PFDF-initiation processes across a variety of physiographic settings. Improvements to satellite-borne rainfall intensity data and increased availability of PFDF occurrence data worldwide are expected to enhance model skill and applicability further.Plain Language Summary Wildfires are destructive hazards whose subsequent effects can be long lasting. This includes the increased risk of flooding and post fire debris flows (PFDFs). We present a framework that uses freely available satellite-based data to inform where PFDF activity may be elevated. We use a standardized set of resources available globally such that it is easier to make direct comparisons between regions. This work lays the groundwork to more thoroughly investigate why PFDFs are more common in some regions over others, as well as demonstrate the use of satellite data for timely assessments of the hazards that follow wildfire.

TI  - Distribution patterns of macrophytes in shallow lakes of the lower Parana River floodplain: Associations with environmental conditions
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Macrophytes play key functional and structural roles in floodplain shallow lakes (SL), determining the maintenance of ecosystem functions and sustaining several productive activities. We assessed the relationship between macrophyte community structure (composition, species abundance, and plant diversity) and environmental features (SL dynamics, connectivity, morphometry, flood frequency, and water and sediment physical and chemical variables) in the Lower Parana River floodplain. Our main hypothesis was that SL macrophyte distribution depends on direct and indirect environmental controls operating at multiple scales. The SL dynamics during the April-November 2017 Parana River pulse were described according to their coverage changes (vegetation, and turbid or clear open water), which were assessed with supervised classifications on Landsat 8-OLI scenes. Twenty-five SL of the Lower Parana River floodplain were selected to represent all the SL dynamics identified. Ten SL were permanently connected and 15 were disconnected from watercourses. Water and sediment physical and chemical characteristics, macrophyte assemblage composition, and plant species abundance were surveyed at each site in the 2018 summer. Also, SL morphometric parameters and flood frequency were estimated from ancillary geographic data. The direct controlling factors of macrophyte assemblages were water ammonium and water nitrate concentrations, turbidity, and flood frequency. No clear effects of environmental conditions on macrophyte diversity were found. The connectivity of SL with watercourses affected their water and sediment physical and chemical features. Also, SL dynamics during the 2017 pulse were related to flood frequency. As connectivity to watercourses affects SL chemical and physical variables, and SL dynamics were associated with flood frequency, connectivity and SL dynamics indirectly influenced macrophyte assemblage composition. This study improved our understanding of macrophyte distribution patterns in the study area, which was related to several environmental variables operating at different scales. Our results highlight the importance of the variability of hydrological connectivity in promoting environmental heterogeneity in river floodplain systems, which is central to their functioning, and the high biodiversity that characterises these environments.

TI  - Observational study of the clinical performance of a public-private partnership national referral hospital network in Lesotho: Do improvements last over time?
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Public-private partnerships (PPP) may increase healthcare quality but lack longitudinal evidence for success. The Queen 'Mamohato Memorial Hospital (QMMH) in Lesotho is one of Africa's first healthcare PPPs. We compare data from 2012 and 2018 on capacity, utilization, quality, and outcomes to understand if early documented successes have been sustained using the same measures over time. In this observational study using administrative and clinical data, we assessed beds, admissions, average length of stay (ALOS), outpatient visits, and patient outcomes. We measured triage time and crash cart stock through direct observation in 2013 and 2020. Operational hospital beds increased from 390 to 410. Admissions decreased (-5.3%) while outpatient visits increased (3.8%). ALOS increased from 5.1 to 6.5 days. Occupancy increased from 82% to 99%; half of the wards had occupancy rates >= 90%, and Neonatal ward occupancy was 209%. The proportion of crash cart stock present (82.9% to 73.8%) and timely triage (84.0% to 27.6%) decreased. While overall mortality decreased (8.0% to 6.5%) and neonatal mortality overall decreased (18.0% to 16.3%), mortality among very low birth weight neonates increased (30.2% to 36.8%). Declines in overall hospital mortality are promising. Yet, continued high occupancy could compromise infection control and impede response to infections, such as COVID-19. High occupancy in the Neonatal ward suggests that the population need for neonatal care outpaces QMMH capacity; improvements should be addressed at the hospital and systemic levels. The increase in ALOS is acceptable for a hospital meant to take the most critical cases. The decline in crash cart stock completeness and timely triage may affect access to emergency treatment. While the partnership itself ended earlier than anticipated, our evaluation suggests that generally the hospital under the PPP was operational, providing high-level, critically needed services, and continued to improve patient outcomes. Quality at QMMH remained substantially higher than at the former Queen Elizabeth II hospital.

TI  - A clinical diagnostic test on the detection of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast neoplasms using a 1-step RT-PCR
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: Currently, assessment of sentinel lymph node (SLN) requires cytology, hematoxylin-eosin (HE), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, routine pathological slides still suffer from certain sampling errors and have time limitations. This study sought to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of SLN detection by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which quantifies the expression of mammaglobin and cytokeratin-19 genes to determine SLN status.Methods: The RT-PCR detection of cycles threshold (CT) values has a direct relationship with the lymph node metastasis. This study prospectively collected 256 sentinel lymph nodes from 150 patients diagnosed with breast cancer between August and November 2017. In the detection of metastases in lymph nodes, molecular markers can be verified at the cell-level and tissue-level of tumor cells. In this study, IHC results were used as the gold standard for judging sentinel lymph node status.Results: (I) According to the established cell models, as the lymph nodes in tumor cells increase, RT-PCR CT values decrease. (II) 83 lymph nodes were first collected, and the interpretation criteria for the molecular detection results were determined based on the immunohistochemistry (IHC) results. (III) The statistical analysis showed that the sensitivity of the RT-PCR was 80.49% and the specificity was 91.55%. The positive predictive and negative predictive values were 64.71% and 96.06%, respectively. There was no significant difference between RT-PCR detection and IHC detection (P=0.076). Statistical chi-square analysis also showed that the difference between intraoperative freezing and immunohistochemistry was statistically significant (P=0.000). There was a statistically significant difference between intraoperative freezing and RTPCR detection (P=0.000). RT-PCR detection is more sensitive than intraoperative frozen detection, and is closer to the results of immunohistochemistry.Conclusions: RT-PCR had objective and rapid output advantages, and was proven to be true and reliable. RT-PCR detection can not only rapidly assess sentinel lymph node status in breast cancer patients during surgery, but its accuracy is also close to that of IHC. Correctly determine whether to perform axillary lymph node dissection and improve the survival rate of patients.

TI  - Yield estimation of<i> Lycium</i><i> barbarum</i> L. based on the WOFOST model
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research about crop growth simulation and yield prediction mainly focused on annual crops with very few such studies relating to perennial fruit tree crops. In this study, field experiments were conducted in different growth periods of Lycium barbarum L. in Gansu province, China to determine and improve the initial WOFOST model parameters with combination of the time-series leaf area index (LAI) obtained from Sentinel-2 satellite and predict yields for L. barbarum shrubs at a field scale for summer fruit (SF) and autumn fruit (AF). The results showed that the performance of initial parameters established by previous research and partial measured data was relatively poor, with a relative error (RE) of 20.95% for annual yield. The simulation after model parameter calibration significantly improved model prediction accuracy. The predicted SF was 2588 kg/ha and AF was 601 kg/ha with a RE of-5.51%. This study provided a strategy to improve modelled yield for fruit tree crops through utilization of remote sensed and field measured data in model parameter calibration, which on the other hand provides useful information for regional development planning and crops marketing.

TI  - Estimating Time of Urbanization with Moderate-Resolution Sensors
T2  - PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous recording of images of the Earth's surface through Earth observation satellites has enabled the study of large-scale dynamical process, such as urbanization. Mapping the urban land cover at a given time is a first-order problem that has been largely addressed, and for which several acceptable solutions exist. A second-order problem is the analysis of change through time, which has been generally addressed through change vector or change matrix analyses, but they tend to neglect the spatial dimensions in favor of the temporal one. In this study, we propose the estimation of the time of urbanization across space as a useful indicator of the spatiotemporal structure of the urbanization process. A map of the time of urbanization can be considered a third-order product, as it compresses time series of urban land cover in one image that can effectively help identify areas of accelerated development and the time when they occurred. We apply linear spectral unmixing to quarterly composites of Landsat 8 imagery over the metropolitan corridor in central Mexico, from which a time series of urban percentage coverage is generated for the period between 2013 and 2021. Time filters were then applied to the time series and the time of urbanization was detected as the time when an increase of 25 percent of urbanization or larger first occurred. The accuracy assessment of the urbanization time showed a good correspondence with reference points that were randomly selected in the area of study.

TI  - Widespread changes in 21st century vegetation cover in Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - South America has been an epicenter of land cover and land use change (LCLUC) for over five decades due to rapid agricultural expansion along forest frontiers, the establishment of plantations in savannas, and desertifi-cation in drylands. Most attention has focused on LCLUC in tropical forests, and so information regarding the magnitude, geography, and rate of LCLUC across sub-tropical and temperate ecosystems in Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay (APU) is incomplete. To address this, we used Landsat to map changes in the fractional cover of bare ground, woody cover, and herbaceous vegetation at annual time steps from 1999 to 2019 over APU. Using field observations and Landsat imagery, we created a spectral library representative of these three cover types. We trained a machine learning model to map annual fractional cover at 30 m spatial resolution, and used a Bayesian change point algorithm to characterize spatial and temporal trajectories of LCLUC. Our results reveal that 11.6% of the study domain experienced changes in land cover composition over APU between 1999 and 2019. The most substantial changes were herbaceous cover gain (87,507 symbolscript 2730 km2), woody cover loss (101,528 symbolscript 2843 km2), and bare ground gain (31,354 symbolscript 934 km2). Herbaceous cover in Paraguay increased by 51%, mostly because of deforestation for cattle ranching in the Dry Chaco and commodity crop agriculture in the Atlantic Forest. Uruguay showed a 62% increase in woody cover arising from the emergence and growth of pine and eucalyptus plantations. Argentina, the largest and most heterogeneous of the three countries, experienced a 38% increase in bare ground in the Patagonian Steppe due to climate and anthropogenic drivers, including reduced precipitation. Quantification of these abrupt and gradual LCLUC processes can be used to improve models of the carbon and energy budgets in southern South America, especially in arid and semi-arid ecoregions because they are increasingly understood to be important drivers of the interannual variability of the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy with a handheld cordless magnetic probe following preoperative MR lymphography using superparamagnetic iron oxide for clinically N0 early oral cancer: A feasibility study
T2  - JOURNAL OF STOMATOLOGY ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Radioisotope (RI) tracers are generally used for preoperative mapping of sentinel lymph node (SLN) and intraoperative detection with a portable g probe. However, the use of RI has several limitations. Therefore, a method without RI is required for the widespread application of SLN biopsy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of SLN biopsy with a handheld cordless magnetic probe following magnetic resonance lymphography (MRL) using superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) and for clinically N0 early oral cancer.Materials and methods: MRL using SPIO and SLNB with the handheld cordless magnetic probe were performed for 27 patients with clinically N0 early oral cancer.Results: In all 27 patients (100%), SLNs were detected by MRL, and the total and mean number of SLNs were 73 and 2.7, respectively. All SLNs identified by MRL were detectable using the magnetic probe in all patients.Conclusions: SLNB with handheld cordless magnetic probe following preoperative SLN mapping by MRL using SPIO is feasible, without RI use, for neck management in cases of clinically N0 early oral cancer.

TI  - Is Living Heritage Ignored? Revisiting Heritage Conservation at Cham Living-Heritage Sites in Vietnam
T2  - HERITAGE AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the heritage conservation of the Cham living heritage sites and perceptions of the Cham community in Vietnam. Data were collected using various methods, including participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and documentation, from a "living" sacred site of the Cham community in Ninh Thuan, Vietnam. This research demonstrates that the conservation of heritage in Vietnam has focused primarily on tangible forms of heritage, while local cultural meanings related to tangible aspects of the Cham temples have not been a central concern in heritage conservation practices. The construction of a new pathway is considered a significant offense to the Cham worldview with respect to cardinality and spiritual practice. Despite this addition's intention to facilitate access for visitors to this site, the Cham people believe that it contributes to a denigration of the sacred character of their temple and has negative effects on religious views and understandings among members of the community. The findings suggest that Indigenous living heritage and its role in local communities need to be recognized in safeguarding heritage.

TI  - Trend of snow cover under the influence of climate change using Google Earth Engine platform: A case study of Astore (Western Himalayas) and Shigar (Karakoram region)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater resources present in the Upper Indus Basin (UIB) supply water to Pakistan's irrigation. Half of the annual water discharge in the UIB is contributed from the glacier and snow-fed basins in the Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and Himalaya (HKH) region, and it is currently under the threat of climate change. Therefore, it is very necessary to study and monitor the spatiotemporal changes in the snow cover area (SCA) and its response to climate variables to efficiently manage water reservoirs. Thus, keeping this problem in mind, we conducted this study using the Google Earth Engine Application Programming Interface (GEE API) for Astore and Shigar. We used mean annual Landsat data between 1991 and 2021 to derive the SCA using the normalized difference snow index (NDSI). ASTER GDEM data was used to extract the elevation and analyze the distribution of SCA on different elevation zones. Eventually, we used the climate research unit (CRU) data (rainfall and temperature) to analyze them with SCA. The results revealed that SCA in Astore and Shigar has an increasing trend with a rate of 11.16 km(2)/year and 4.27 km(2)/year, respectively. Mean annual precipitation and temperature also confirmed the increasing trend of SCA because mean annual precipitation is increasing and temperature is decreasing in both regions. SCA and elevation analysis revealed that SCA is decreasing on foothills while increasing at the valley top. This is because temperature is increasing and precipitation is decreasing from zone 1 to zone 3 and vice versa for zone 4. It is found that Astore and Shigar in UIB have an increasing trend of SCA and are not affected by global warming. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct studies on large scale to efficiently evaluate the impact of climate change on SCA.

A1  - GROINSS-V I II Participants
TI  - Unilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy in patients with early-stage vulvar squamous cell carcinoma and a unilateral metastatic sentinel lymph node is safe
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Optimal management of the contralateral groin in patients with early-stage vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC) and a metastatic unilateral inguinal sentinel lymph node (SN) is unclear. We analyzed patients who participated in GROINSS-V I or II to determine whether treatment of the contralateral groin can safely be omitted in patients with a unilateral metastatic SN.Methods. We selected the patients with a unilateral metastatic SN from the GROINSS-V I and II databases. We determined the incidence of contralateral additional non-SN metastases in patients with unilateral SN-metastasis who underwent bilateral inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL). In those who underwent only ipsilateral groin treatment or no further treatment, we determined the incidence of contralateral groin recurrences during follow-up.Results. Of 1912 patients with early-stage VSCC, 366 had a unilateral metastatic SN. Subsequently, 244 had an IFL or no treatment of the contralateral groin. In seven patients (7/244; 2.9% [95% CI: 1.4%-5.8%]) disease was di-agnosed in the contralateral groin: five had contralateral non-SN metastasis at IFL and two developed an isolated contralateral groin recurrence after no further treatment. Five of them had a primary tumor >= 30 mm. Bilateral ra-diotherapy was administered in 122 patients, of whom one (1/122; 0.8% [95% CI: 0.1%-4.5%]) had a contralateral groin recurrence.Conclusion. The risk of contralateral lymph node metastases in patients with early-stage VSCC and a unilateral metastatic SN is low. It appears safe to limit groin treatment to unilateral IFL or inguinofemoral radiotherapy in these cases.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics and anthropologically dominated drivers of chlorophyll-a, TN and TP concentrations in the Pearl River Estuary based on retrieval algorithm and random forest regression
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of large-scale and high-precision water quality parameters is critical in explaining the spatiotemporal dynamics and the driving factors of water quality variability, especially in areas with environmental complexity (e.g., crisscrossing waterways, high flood risk in rainy season and seawater invasion). Thus, in this study, a retrieval algorithm was developed to predict chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) based on a large amount of in situ measurements and Landsat 8 remote sensing images. Random Forest (RF) machine learning was conducted to identify the relationship between environmental indicators (pH, turbidity, conductivity, total dissolved solids and water temperature), Chla, TN and TP. The results showed that the NIR/R Binomial algorithm for Chl-a estimation presented appreciable reliability with R2 of 0.7429, root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.2089 and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 15.33%. The water quality variation in the PRE showed a characteristic of overall improvement and regional deterioration with average concentrations of 7.28 mu g/L, 1.15 mg/L and 0.12 mg/L for Chl-a, TN, and TP respectively. Turbidity and pH were identified as the most important indicators to explain Chl-a (52.86%, 39.91%), TN (52.38%, 40.57%) and TP (55.23%, 40.03%) variation. Agricultural pollution was the main pollution source due to the intensive application of fertilizer and increased field size. Besides, land use patterns (e.g., increasing farmland but decreasing forest) greatly influenced water quality from 2010 to 2020. Moreover, light limitation caused by high turbidity reduced the algae productivity and further lowered the Chl-a concentration. The driving factors for regional water quality variations were anthropologically dominated and supplemented by climate change. This study improved the monitoring accuracy of regional water environment and provided quantitative early warning of water pollution events for environmental practitioners, so as to achieve long-term monitoring, precise pollution management and efficient water resources management.

TI  - MICROBUBBLE-ASSISTED ULTRASOUND FOR IMAGING AND THERAPY OF MELANOMA SKIN CANCER: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
T2  - ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - technological developments in ultrasound (US) imaging and ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) have improved diagnostic confidence in echography. In the clinical management of melanoma, contrast -enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging complements conventional US imaging (i.e., high-resolution US and Dopp-ler imaging) for clinical examination and therapeutic follow-up. These developments have set into motion the combined use of ultrasound and UCAs as a new modality for drug delivery. This modality, called sonoporation, has emerged as a non-invasive, targeted and safe method for the delivery of therapeutic drugs into melanoma. This review focuses on the results and prospects of using US and UCAs as dual modalities for CEUS imaging and melanoma treatment.

TI  - Rejuvenation of ancient palaeochannel through groundwater recharge in Thar Desert of Rajasthan, India: investigations through remote sensing and HERT survey
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater investigation in Thar Desert is a challenging task due to low rainfall pattern and limited recharge. In search of an alternate source of drinking water, satellite remote sensing technique has been used in delineation of palaeochannel (PC) in parts of Rajasthan. Analysis of temporal satellite images (1995-2016) show the signature of PC with increasing vegetation anomaly in an elevated terrain. Validation of the PC and its groundwater potential were demonstrated using land use land cover statistics, High-resolution Electrical Resistivity Tomography (HERT) and drilling data. 2D resistivity tomograms show that the PC aquifer is a low resistivity zone (7.98-53.6 ohm m), characterized by thick alluvium at 26 m depth. Based on the integrated analysis of satellite data and geospatial maps it has been inferred that this ancient fluvial channel (PC) has been rejuvenated due to groundwater recharge from the canal water from the north, after commissioning of IGNP canal in 1992.

TI  - Enhancing the Applicability of Satellite Remote Sensing for PM2.5 Estimation Using Machine Learning Models in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies and monitoring data indicate that fine particle (PM2.5) pollution in China is still comparatively severe. Given the sparse and uneven distribution of air quality monitoring base stations established in China and the limitation of geographical conditions, inversion of aerosol optical depth by satellite remote sensing can achieve low-cost air quality monitoring in global areas. In this study, we use the machine learning algorithm XGBoost to build a prediction model to achieve nationwide average PM2.5 concentration prediction. Meanwhile, we used aerosol data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in a specific band, combined with a land use regression (LUR) model as predictors of surface PM2.5 concentrations in China, for the period Dec. 2019-Nov. 2021. In order to provide more accurate PM2.5 concentration prediction, the correspondence between PM2.5 and aerosol optical depth (AOD) under different seasons was studied. The coefficients of determination (R2) for different seasons are 0.86 (spring), 0.80 (summer), 0.90 (autumn), and 0.88 (winter), indicating that the fit is best for autumn and worse for summer. The study shows the potential usefulness of using the LUR model with the XGBoost algorithm for predictive assessment of PM2.5 spatial distribution.

TI  - Spatiotemporal land use and cover changes across agroecologies and slope gradients using geospatial technologies in Zoa watershed, Southwest Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental phenomena are always changing elsewhere in various scales depending on both natural phenomenon and human interference. Land use/over change (LULC) is related to site specific factors such as inappropriate land use planning and the expansion of traditional agricultural practices in steep gradients have led to soil erosion and consequent ecological changes. Thus, it is crucial to determine the trend, pattern, and drivers of land use/land cover dynamics for sustainable natural resource management in Ethiopia. Therefore, we evaluated the spatio-temporal LULC dynamics in different agroeclogies and slope gradients, and their drivers between 1985 and 2021 in the Zoa watershed of Omo-Gibe basin, Southwest Ethiopia. Landsat imageries, focus group discussants, key informants, and field observations were used as source of data to analyze the spatio-temporal LULC trajectories and their drivers. With total accuracies ranging from 87.55% to 91.14%, supervised image classification using the Maximum Likelihood classifier technique was used to categorize five key LULC classes: bareland, farmland, forestland, grassland, and shrubland. The results revealed that shrubland (41.87%) had the largest share in 1985, but later declined to 23.98% in 2000, and 12.6% in 2021. Grassland has declined as well, from 17.15% in 1985 to 2.09% in 2021. In contrast, farmland increased at the fastest rate, from 29.09% in 1985 to 71.12% in 2021. The proportion of farmland exhibited an increasing trend in all agro-ecologies, while forestland has increased only in highland agro-ecologies. Between 1985 and 2021, an extensive area of shrubland and grassland were converted into farmland with a conversation rate of 1.05% and 0.58% per annum, respectively. The expansion of farmland was observed towards moderately and steep rolling slopes which might exacerbate soil degradation. This is due to rapid population increase and ongoing demand for agricultural land. The result of key informant interviews and focus group discussions also revealed that expansion of farmland and settlement are the major drivers of LULC dynamics due to rapid human population growth. Therefore, the regional government and various stakeholders should work on redesigning effective management strategies through appropriate land use planning to address the adverse effects of LULC dynamics.

TI  - The role of topography, climate, soil and the surrounding matrix in the distribution of <i>Veredas</i> wetlands in central Brazil
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are among the most important ecosystems in the world in terms of endemic biodiversity, carbon storage and hydrological process. Veredas wetlands are distributed across the Brazilian savanna (i.e. Cerrado biome) and are permanently protected areas. Veredas wetlands have a hydromorphic soil, providing water to the main rivers of central Brazil and allowing the occurrence of several endemic species of plants and animals. Although recent studies on biotic and abiotic characteristics have been conducted in several areas of Veredas, the studies are local and there is a lack of information about large-scale patterns. Here we used remote sensing data to explore the role of climate, soil, topography and surrounding matrix explaining Veredas occurrence in the Tridngulo Mineiro and Alto Paranaiba (TMAP), a mesoregion of the State of Minas Gerais, Southeastern Brazil. Veredas were more frequent in the western region of TMAP, in areas with lower altitudes, temperature and precipitation seasonality, soil cation exchange capacity, silt and sand content, and slope. Moreover, farming was the most frequent land use in areas surrounding Veredas. Veredas are associated with recharging of the water table and water flow that maintains rivers in the Upper Parana River water basin. We trust the present assessment will be of help for the development of conservation strategies and biodiversity studies.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Identification and functional analysis of dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSP) genes in Japanese flounder<i> (Paralichthys</i><i> olivaceus)</i> against temperature and<i> Edwardsiella</i><i> tarda</i> stress
T2  - FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dual-specificity Phosphatases (DUSPs) are not only the key regulators of dephosphorylating and inactivating mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), but play a crucial role in the immune response. However, the role of DUSP genes in Japanese flounder (PoDUSPs) is still unclear. In this study, 28 DUSP genes in Japanese flounder were identified and classified based on the whole genome database. Phylogenetic analysis and protein structure analysis revealed that DUSPs had highly conserved domains in teleosts. Molecular evolution analysis indicated that the PoDUSP genes were conservative during evolution and were functional-constrained. Meanwhile, PoDUSP genes were found to express in different embryonic and larval stages which might play the role of sentinel in healthy organisms. Furthermore, PoDUSP genes' expression profiles after temperature stress and Edwardsiella tarda (E. tarda) infection were determined in Japanese flounder without precedent, and the results demonstrated that Podusp1, Podusp2 and Podusp16 were more respective to temperature variation whereas Podusp1 and Podusp6 were more respective to E. tarda infection. In summary, our results provide useful resources for understanding the immune responsibilities of DUSP genes in flatfish.

TI  - Molecular response of keloids to ionizing radiation: targeting FOXO1 radiosensitizes keloids
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Keloids are benign dermal tumors that arise from abnormal wound healing processes following skin lesions. Surgical excision followed by radiotherapy plays an important role in the treatment of keloids. Nevertheless, radioresistance remains a serious impediment to treatment efficacy. Investigation of the molecular response of keloids to radiation may contribute to radiosensitizing strategies. Materials and methods Primary keloid fibroblasts from human keloids were isolated and irradiated with X-ray. The expression profiles of messenger RNA (mRNA) in nonradiated and irradiated primary keloid fibroblasts were measured by mRNA sequencing analysis. Then, we identified common motifs and corresponding transcription factors of dysregulated mRNAs by using bioinformatic analysis of the proximal promoters. Whereafter, GO and KEGG were used to analyze the functional enrichment of the differentially expressed genes. Results We found that radiation not only suppressed proliferation but also increased cell senescence of primary keloid fibroblasts. There were 184 mRNAs and 204 mRNAs that showed significant changes in 4 and 8 Gy irradiated primary keloid fibroblasts, respectively. Among them, 8 upregulated and 30 downregulated mRNAs showed consistent alterations in 4 and 8 Gy irradiated primary keloid fibroblasts. More importantly, the xForkhead box O1 (FOXO1) signaling pathway was involved in the irradiation response. Pretreatment with the FOXO1 signaling inhibitor AS1842856 significantly promoted LDH release, apoptosis and senescence of primary keloid fibroblasts following irradiation. Conclusion Our findings illustrated the molecular changes in human keloid fibroblasts in response to radiation, and FOXO1 pathway inhibition is expected to provide a novel strategy for the radiosensitization of keloids.

TI  - Accuracy and Utility of Preoperative Ultrasound-Guided Axillary Lymph Node Biopsy for Invasive Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background. With the acceleration of the pace of life and work, the incidence rate of invasive breast cancer is getting higher and higher, and early diagnosis is very important. This study screened and analyzed the published literature on ultrasound-guided biopsy of invasive breast cancer and obtained the accuracy and practicality of preoperative biopsy. Method. The four databases were screened for the literature. There was no requirement for the start date of retrieval, and the deadline was July 2, 2022. Two researchers screened the literature, respectively, and included the literature on preoperative ultrasound-guided biopsy and intraoperative and postoperative pathological diagnosis of invasive breast cancer. The diagnostic data included in the literature were extracted and meta-analyzed with RevMan 5.4 software, and the bias risk map, forest map, and summary receiver operating characteristic curves (SROC) were drawn. Results. The included 19 studies involved about 18668 patients with invasive breast cancer. The degree of bias of the included literature is low. The distribution range of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative in the forest map is large, which may be related to the large difference in the number of patients in each study. Most studies in the SROC curve are at the upper left, indicating that the accuracy of ultrasound-guided axillary biopsy is very high. Conclusion. For invasive breast cancer, preoperative ultrasound-guided biopsy can accurately predict staging and grading of breast cancer, which has important reference value for surgery and follow-up treatment.

TI  - A new machine-learning-based analysis for improving satellite-retrieved atmospheric composition data: OMI SO<sub>2</sub> as an example
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite recent progress, satellite retrievals of anthropogenic SO2 still suffer from relatively low signal-to-noise ratios. In this study, we demonstrate a new machine learning data analysis method to improve the quality of satellite SO2 products. In the absence of large ground-truth datasets for SO2, we start from SO2 slant column densities (SCDs) retrieved from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) using a data-driven, physically based algorithm and calculate the ratio between the SCD and the root mean square (rms) of the fitting residuals for each pixel. To build the training data, we select presumably clean pixels with small SCD / rms ratios (SRRs) and set their target SCDs to zero. For polluted pixels with relatively large SRRs, we set the target to the original retrieved SCDs. We then train neural networks (NNs) to reproduce the target SCDs using predictors including SRRs for individual pixels, solar zenith, viewing zenith and phase angles, scene reflectivity, and O-3 column amounts, as well as the monthly mean SRRs. For data analysis, we employ two NNs: (1) one trained daily to produce analyzed SO2 SCDs for polluted pixels each day and (2) the other trained once every month to produce analyzed SCDs for less polluted pixels for the entire month. Test results for 2005 show that our method can significantly reduce noise and artifacts over background regions. Over polluted areas, the monthly mean NN-analyzed and original SCDs generally agree to within +/- 15 %, indicating that our method can retain SO2 signals in the original retrievals except for large volcanic eruptions. This is further confirmed by run-ning both the NN-analyzed and original SCDs through a topdown emission algorithm to estimate the annual SO2 emissions for similar to 500 anthropogenic sources, with the two datasets yielding similar results. We also explore two alternative approaches to the NN-based analysis method. In one, we employ a simple linear interpolation model to analyze the original SCD retrievals. In the other, we develop a PCA-NN algorithm that uses OMI measured radiances, transformed and dimension-reduced with a principal component analysis (PCA) technique, as inputs to NNs for SO2 SCD retrievals. While the linear model and the PCA-NN algorithm can reduce retrieval noise, they both underestimate SO2 over polluted areas. Overall, the results presented here demonstrate that our new data analysis method can significantly improve the quality of existing OMI SO2 retrievals. The method can potentially be adapted for other sensors and/or species and enhance the value of satellite data in air quality research and applications.

TI  - How can UAV contribute in satellite-based<i> Phragmites</i><i> australis</i> aboveground biomass estimating?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Phragmites australis (common reed) is a widely distributed emergent aquatic vegetation species in many wetland ecosystems, and its aboveground biomass (AGB) is an important parameter for evaluating the carbon-nitrogen cycle in wetlands. Satellite remote sensing (RS) is a powerful tool used to monitor the spatio-temporal distri-bution of AGB within reedbeds over a large area. However, when building AGB models based on satellite data, especially medium resolution satellites, it is difficult to obtain ample and properly measured AGB samples which can be matched with image pixels due to the inaccessibility of the wetlands. In this study, we proposed a solution based on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Sentinel-2 data, which allowed us to estimate and successfully map the AGB of Phragmites australis in the Nan Da Gang Wetland Reserve (NDG) in China's Hebei Province close to the Bohai sea. First, in an experimental area (EA) of NDG, an AGB model (R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 174 g/m2) was built based on NDVI(534, 734) and canopy height derived from UAV data, and an AGB map was obtained of the EA. Second, the AGB map was resampled to the pixel of the Sentinel-2 image, and an AGB sample set was matched with the acquired spatial resolution of the Sentinel-2 image. Finally, based on the sample set, an AGB model (R2 = 0.59, RMSE = 194 g/m2) was built using RVI derived from the Sentinel-2 image, which allowed us to map the Phragmites australis AGB in the NDG wetland reedbed. The study illustrated well that a UAV can be proficient in obtaining enough AGB samples matched with satellite pixels to build satellite-based AGB estimation models.

TI  - Understanding the drivers of woody plant diversity in urban parks in a snow climate city of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban parks are an important part of urban ecosystems and play an important role in biodiversity conservation. However, it is still unclear how park characteristics affect plant diversity which could hinder the conservation of urban biodiversity due to the ineffective design of urban parks. The diversity of woody plants in 33 parks of Changchun, China, was measured with plot measurements and linked with urban park characteristics (e.g., size and age of the park) to uncover the relationship between them. The results show that urban woody plant species were abundant, with 98 species belonging to 51 genera and 26 families in the snow climate city of Changchun. The variation in woody plant diversity was largely explained by internal patch characteristics (e.g., size, age, shape), and external factors surrounding the park (e.g., land use type and socioeconomic level) accounted for only 16.0% in our study. For internal patch characteristics, older urban parks with larger areas demonstrated a richer level of plant diversity and increased nonlinearly with increasing park area. The threshold size significantly affecting plant diversity variation was approximately 30 ha. Plant diversity had positive linear relationships with the ages of urban parks, supporting the legacy effect. In addition, woody plant diversity nonlinearly decreased with increasing park shape index, which suggested that the plant diversity could also be increased by optimizing the park shape. Regarding the external factors surrounding parks, the spatial distribution of woody plant diversity varied greatly from the urban center to the suburbs. House prices around the park had positive linear relationships with woody plant diversity in parks, supporting the luxury effect. However, building and road proportions, and green space proportion had no relationship with plant diversity in parks. This study can provide a robust reference for enriching plant diversity in urban parks, thus improving the development of urban sustainable cities.

TI  - Bioregionalization of the coastal and open oceans of British Columbia and Southeast Alaska based on Sentinel-3A satellite-derived phytoplankton seasonality
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Classifying the ocean into regions with distinct biogeochemical or physical properties may enhance our interpretation of ocean processes. High-resolution satellite-derived products provide valuable data to address this task. Notwithstanding, no regionalization at a regional scale has been attempted for the coastal and open oceans of British Columbia (BC) and Southeast Alaska (SEA), which host essential habitats for several ecologically, culturally, and commercially important species. Across this heterogeneous marine domain, phytoplankton are subject to dynamic ocean circulation patterns and atmosphere-ocean-land interactions, and their variability, in turn, influences marine food web structure and function. Regionalization based on phytoplankton biomass patterns along BC and SEA's coastal and open oceans can be valuable in identifying pelagic habitats and representing a baseline for assessing future changes. We developed a two-step classification procedure, i.e., a Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) analysis followed by the affinity propagation clustering method, to define ten bioregions based on the seasonal climatology of high-resolution (300 m) Sentinel-3 surface chlorophyll-a data (a proxy for phytoplankton biomass), for the period 2016-2020. The classification procedure allowed high precision delineation of the ten bioregions, revealing separation between off-shelf bioregions and those in neritic waters. Consistent with the high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll regime, relatively low values of phytoplankton biomass (< 1 mg/m(3)) distinguished off-shelf bioregions, which also displayed, on average, more prominent autumn biomass peaks. In sharp contrast, neritic bioregions were highly productive (>> 1 mg/m(3)) and characterized by different phytoplankton dynamics. The spring phytoplankton bloom onset varied spatially and inter-annually, with substantial differences among bioregions. The proposed high-spatial-resolution regionalization constitutes a reference point for practical and more extensive implementation in understanding the spatial dynamics of the regional ecology, data-driven ocean observing systems, and objective regional management.

TI  - A methodology for mapping annual flood extent using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel automated approach for mapping nonurban flood extents using satellite-based Sentinel-1C-band SAR data is presented and applied in the Republic of Ireland. The methodology mapped the maximum flood extent of over 25,000 detected water bodies across Ireland over a five-year period (2016-2021). Flood extents were classified using a semi-automatic tile-based histogram thresholding approach and refined using a series of post processing filters. These included multi-temporal filters which exploited the timing and orbit position of the Sentinel-1 satellite to identify likely false positives, and contextual information based filters which used external information such as topography and land use to estimate the likelihood of flooding and constrain its extent. A topographic correction algorithm was also applied to hydrologically-correct flood bodies. The methodology produced a user accuracy of above 0.95 for each annual map when compared to observed flood level data, overall accuracy values above 0.97 and kp values above 0.7 when compared to mapping process based on Sentinel-2 validation imagery, and the capacity to detect over 90% of recorded permanent water bodies larger than 2 ha. As an additional step, confidence information was provided for each flood polygon based on the quantity of consistently flooded pixels used in its definition. The mapping process represents a stable and systematic nonurban flood mapping methodology that enables inter-annual comparison of flood extent at gauged and ungauged sites.

T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - 4-n-Nonylphenol (NP) is one of the most toxic alkylphenols found in the environment. To evaluate the tran-scriptional effects of NP in the viviparous fish Poecilia vivipara, a hepatic transcriptome and qPCR analysis of genes were carried out. Guppies separated by sex were injected with two doses of NP (15 mu g/g and 150 mu g/g) or peanut oil (control). After 24 h, analysis of transcriptional level of Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR), Estrogen Nuclear Receptor Alpha (ESR1), Pregnane X Receptor (PXR), Cytochromes P450 (CYP1A, CYP2K1 and CYP3A30), Glutathione S-transferase A3 and Mu 3 (GSTa3 and GSTMu3), SRY-Box Transcription Factor 9 (SOX9), Vitellogenin-1 (VIT), ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily C Member 1 (ABCC1), Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2 (MRP2) and UDP Glucuronosyltransferase Family 1 Member A1 (UGT1A1) was evaluated. 205,046 transcripts were assembled and protein prediction resulted in 203,147 predicted peptides. In females, no significant changes were detected in the transcription of some phase I biotransformation and ABC transporter genes. AhR, PXR, GSTa3 and SOX9 genes where higher in the lower dose group (15 mu g/g) compared to control. In male fish, no changes were observed in the transcript levels of the nuclear receptors, in endocrine disruption and phase I biotransformation genes. GSTa3 showed lower transcription in fish treated with both doses. ABCC1 was higher in guppies treated with the lower dose while MRP2 showed less transcripts. This short-term and low-dose exposure to NP caused changes that could serve as early indicators of deleterious processes. These results indicate P. vivipara as a good sentinel in biomonitoring programs.

TI  - Exotic Carbonate Mineralization Recovered from a Deep Basalt Carbon Storage Demonstration
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mitigating climate change requires transformational advances for carbon dioxide removal, including geologic carbon sequestration in reactive subsurface environments. The Wallula Basalt Carbon Storage Pilot Project demonstrated that CO2 injected into >800 m deep Columbia River Basalt Group flow top reservoirs mineralizes on month-year timescales. Herein, we present new optical petrography, micro-computed X-ray tomography, and electron microscopy results obtained from sidewall cores collected two years after CO2 injection. As no other anthropogenic carbonates from geologic carbon storage field studies have been recovered, this world-unique sample suite provides unparalleled insight for subsurface carbon mineralization products and paragenesis. Chemically zoned nodules with Ca/ Mn-rich cores and Fe-dominant outer rims are prominent examples of the neoformed carbonate assemblages with ankerite-siderite compositions and exotic divalent cation correlations. Paragenetic insights for the timing of aragonite, silica, and fibrous zeolites are clarified based on mineral texture and spatial relationships, along with time-resolved downhole fluid sampling. Collectively, these results clarify the mineralogy, chemistry, and paragenesis of carbon mineralization, providing insight into the ultimate fate and transport of CO2 in reactive mafic-ultramafic reservoirs.

TI  - Optimal selection of wavelet transform parameters for spatio-temporal analysis based on non-stationary NDVI MODIS time series in Mediterranean region
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The multi-resolution analysis based on wavelet transform (WT) has widely proved its effectiveness for the analysis of non-stationary time series (TS) in the remote sensing field. However, there are three essential parameters affecting wavelet-aided data in vegetation dynamics detection. This study proposes a new methodology that serves for the proper selection of the most critical parameters to carry out an optimal analysis for vegetation seasonal and long-term dynamics, specifically adapted to NDVI TS. The specific objectives are: (1) to simulate a TS dataset to understand the best WT parameter performance for trend and seasonal changes detection, and (2) to assess the impact of those WT parameters using NDVI MODIS TS in the Mediterranean area along the period 2001-2019. Different types of trends and WT were considered (i.e., Discrete WT (DWT) and Maximal Overlap DWT (MODWT)) in the simulated dataset. The best WT parameters were calculated based on an iterative algorithm that computes the trend and seasonal components using the optimal level of decomposition for each TS and mother wavelet (MW). Then, the findings obtained from the simulated data were exploited using Earth observation data. In the step, the Theil-Sen's slope (Q) derived for the best MWs was calculated to provide the trend magnitude and direction. The z-score and energy to Shannon entropy ratio (R(S)) were computed to select the most adequate MW based on pixel characterization. On one hand, the simulated results proved the Multi-resolution analysis DWT (MRA-DWT) as the most optimal wavelet type. Level 5 of decomposition was obtained in 99% and 72% of simulated TS according to the trend and seasonal analysis, respectively. Symlet family gave the optimal results in 92% (trend) and 64% (seasonal) of simulated TS. On the other hand, based on R(S), sym12 MW from Symlet family showed the most dominant wavelet for forest, savanna and mosaic land covers, followed by db14 MW from Daubechies family which was dominated in cropland. From more practical adaptation, sym12 was revealed as an effective solution for all the pixels in the Mediterranean area with a relative error lower than 15%. The vegetation change analysis in the Mediterranean area showed a relationship between Q(NDVI) and precipitation in almost 37% of the area, being Turkey, Greece and North Africa the regions with a high correspondence with precipitation. Around 5% of the study area showed to be possibly affected by land degradation processes.

TI  - Stratifying sudden death risk in adults with drug-resistant focal epilepsy: The SUDEP-CARE score
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and purpose A clinical risk score for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy could help improve prevention. Methods A case-control study was conducted including (i) definite or probable SUDEP cases collected by the French National Sentinel Mortality Epilepsy Network and (ii) control patients from the French national research database of epilepsy monitoring units. Patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy were eligible. Multiple logistic regressions were performed. After sensitivity analysis and internal validation, a simplified risk score was developed from the selected variables. Results Sixty-two SUDEP cases and 620 controls were included. Of 21 potential predictors explored, seven were ultimately selected, including generalized seizure frequency (>1/month vs. <1/year: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-5.41), nocturnal or sleep-related seizures (AOR 4.49, 95% CI 2.68-7.53), current or past depression (AOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.19-3.34) or the ability to alert someone of an oncoming seizure (AOR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33-0.98). After internal validation, a clinically usable score ranging from -1 to 8 was developed, with high discrimination capabilities (area under the receiver operating curve 0.85, 95% CI 0.80-0.90). The threshold of 3 has good sensitivity (82.3%, 95% CI 72.7-91.8), whilst keeping a good specificity (82.7%, 95% CI 79.8-85.7). Conclusions These results outline the importance of generalized and nocturnal seizures on the occurrence of SUDEP, and show a protective role in the ability to alert someone of an oncoming seizure. The SUDEP-CARE score is promising and will need external validation. Further work, including paraclinical explorations, could improve this risk score.

TI  - An exploratory transmission mode of HIV/AIDS among older people based on data from multiple sources in China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The HIV/AIDS cases and proportion in older people are continuously and rapidly increasing in China, especially in males. However, the transmission mechanism is not well understood. This study aims to explore the transmission mechanism of HIV/AIDS and potential ways to prevent or control HIV/AIDS transmission in a city in southwestern China. Data from multiple sources, including HIV/AIDS case reports in 2010-2020, a survey of HIV/AIDS cases in 2020, and sentinel surveillance data of female sex workers (FSWs) in 2016-2020 were analyzed. We explored the transmission mechanism of HIV/AIDS cases aged 50 years and older. In this city, the number of newly reported HIV/AIDS cases aged 50 years and older increased from 2010 to 2019, and decreased in 2020. The number of male and female cases aged 50 years and older both increased rapidly in 2017-2019, though the number of male cases was larger than that of female. The survey data showed that 84.7% of older male cases reported commercial sexual behavior, among whom 87.7% reported never using condom and 37.6% reported more than 10 times of commercial sexual behaviors in 1 year. In terms of price of sexual behavior, 68.3% of older male cases sought low-tier FSWs among whom the HIV/AIDS positive rate was 5.4% from the sentinel surveillance data. These results suggested HIV transmission between older men and low-tier FSWs through commercial sexual behavior. Among female cases aged 50 years and older, most reported non-marital and non-commercial heterosexual (60.5%) or regular sexual partner (31.4%) transmission, suggesting that they were infected by their spouse/regular sexual partner. Data of matched couples showed that most male cases had both marital sexual behavior and commercial sexual behavior, or acquired HIV through commercial sexual behavior, while most female cases had only marital sexual behavior. Based on these findings, we proposed a transmission mode of that local older male people and FSWs are transmitting bilaterally through commercial sexual behavior, and local older male people are spreading to local older female people through spouse or regular sexual partner route. By studying data from multiple sources, we explored the HIV transmission mode among older people. In the meantime, we found that marital status had a different impact on male and female old people in their sex behaviors.

TI  - Monitoring and Assessing Gross Primary Productivity of Paddy Rice (<i>Oryza sativa </i>L.) Cropland in Southern China Between 2000 and 2015
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Paddy rice is an important grain production in the world. Southern China experienced substantial losses in paddy rice area over the last three decades in traditionally cropping area. As gross primary production (GPP) is a proxy of land productivity, study on its spatial-temporal dynamics is helpful to understand effect of cropping practices on variation of rice grain production. In our study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and meteorological data were combined to drive Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) for estimating GPP in paddy rice fields of southern China (Hubei province) during 2000-2015 at 1 km spatial resolution. Paddy fields area was varied by the influence of industrialization and urbanization of the region as well as changes in aquaculture area during the 16 years. Annual GPP showed significant increasing trends during 2000-2004 and 2009-2015, and sharply decreasing trend from 2004 to 2009. The assessment of relationship between annual GPP and grain production of paddy rice at municipal-scale and provincial-scale during 2000-2015 demonstrated the potential of annual GPP derived from satellite-based GPP model as a tool to estimate annual rice grain production in the region. The analysis of spatial-temporal pattern of rice GPP demonstrated a high correlation between cropping frequency of paddy rice and mean annual GPP of paddy rice along the main rivers of Hubei province, which provided positive suggestions for promote the production of paddy rice cultivation in sustainable development.

TI  - A two-stage personalized feedback mechanism considering dynamic interactive behavior under social network in large-group emergency task scheduling schemes selection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Emergencies such as natural disasters frequently occur around the world. Large-group emergency evaluation (LGEE) based on Earth observation satellite data is a new model that can potentially reduce the negative impacts of such emergencies. However, in real situations, the different interest preferences and diverse educational backgrounds of evaluators in the evaluation group may cause conflictive preferences, leading to low confidence in the results, which will affect the effect of LGEE. Therefore, this paper aims to devise a two-stage personalized feedback mechanism driven by the dynamic interactive behavior under a social trust relationship to coordinate evaluators' opinions with conflicting opinions in the LGEE. Firstly, we introduce a family of probabilistic linguistic trust-propagation operators to obtain the complete trust relationship among the group using Archimedean t-norms and then determine the weights of evaluators and the weights associated with each pair of evaluators. Secondly, a Louvain method is used to divide the entire group into several subgroups to reduce computational complexity. Next, a two-stage personalized feedback mechanism is built to manage the consensus levels of intra and inter subgroups by describing the dynamic interactive behavior during the evaluation process. The first stage is to assist evaluators in achieving the consensus within the subgroup. The second stage is devoted to reaching an agreement of each subgroup to the global group. Finally, a case study of the selection problem in emergency task scheduling schemes is undertaken to verify the practicality and validity of the proposed method, followed by some comparative analysis and discussion.

TI  - Cross-phenological-region crop mapping framework using Sentinel-2 time series Imagery: A new perspective for winter crops in China
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise large-area crop mapping products are the foundation for cropland monitoring, market policy decision-making, and subsequent agricultural applications. However, owing to sharp discrepancies among the temporal-spectral attributes of crops from different areas, crop mapping across phenological regions faces significant challenges. Given the inadequacy of generalizing mapping frameworks from the source to target regions, research areas are often limited, and trained models cannot be reused beyond a particular study area. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called the Phenology Alignment Network (PAN) to address the cross-phenological-region (CPR) crop-mapping problem using deep recurrent networks and unsupervised domain adaptation. Our PAN adopts a Siamese structure consisting of two identical deep models called the Temporal Spectral Network (TSNet), which serves as an adaptive multilevel phenological feature extractor for crops under various planting conditions. Specifically, the two branches of PAN accept crop samples from the source and target regions, and aim to encode them into similar deep phenological features. By constraining the distribution of hidden states from the two branches, the deep temporal-spectral features are aligned, and regional discrepancies between the source and target regions are alleviated. Consequently, the PAN adapts the deep model pretrained on the source region to the target area, improving the mapping accuracy without using additional target label information. To verify the effectiveness of our model, crop samples were collected from three plains of China, and a winter crop dataset based on Sentinel-2 time-series imagery containing over two million pixels was annotated. Experiments conducted on this dataset indicate that PAN serves as a practical CPR crop mapping framework and achieves significant improvement in the overall accuracy as well as the macro-average F1 score compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Further visual interpretation illustrates the capability of PAN to correct inaccurate predictions ascribed to phenological diversity and suggests the potential of PAN for large-area crop mapping applications.

TI  - Blue-Green Space Changes of Baiyangdian Wetland in Xiong'an New Area, China
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As a regulator of ecological environment, Baiyangdian Wetland is in a pivotal position in constructing the blue-green space (BGS) of Xiong'an New Area in China. This study aims to reveal the spatiotemporal changes of the BGS in Baiyangdian Wetland from 2016 to 2021. It uses Google Earth Engine (GEE) to calculate NDVI and NDWI based on Sentinel-2 Satellite remote sensing data and extracts the blue-green space by a classification model driven by NDVI and NDWI. Moreover, the land-use transfer matrix and landscape pattern indices are applied for evaluating the BGS changes in the wetland. According to the results, vegetation in the wetland shows no obvious spatial transfer. From 2016 to 2020, the BGS proportion in the wetland showed a stable increase, with the blue space getting larger by 10.8%. The indicators of the Number of Patches (NP), Patch Density (PD), Largest Patch Index (LPI), Contagion, and Landscape Shape Index (LSI) of the wetland decreased, suggesting a better ecological environment since the establishment of Xiong'an New Area in 2017. Based on the results, the author makes the following conclusion: the construction of BGS in Baiyangdian Wetland results in a well-organized ecological environment. The study provides a reference for building Xiong'an New Area and monitoring BGS changes in other regions.

TI  - Reliably mapping low-intensity forest disturbance using satellite radar data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decades tropical forests have experienced increased fragmentation due to a global growing demand for agricultural and forest commodities. Satellite remote sensing offers a valuable tool for monitoring forest loss, thanks to the global coverage and the temporal consistency of the acquisitions. In tropical regions, C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from the Sentinel-1 mission provides cloud-free and open imagery on a 6- or 12-day repeat cycle, offering the unique opportunity to monitor forest disturbances in a timely and continuous manner. Despite recent advances, mapping subtle forest losses, such as those due to small-scale and irregular selective logging, remains problematic. A Cumulative Sum (CuSum) approach has been recently proposed for forest monitoring applications, with preliminary studies showing promising results. Unfortunately, the lack of accurate in-situ measurements of tropical forest loss has prevented a full validation of this approach, especially in the case of low-intensity logging. In this study, we used high-quality field measurements from the tropical Forest Degradation Experiment (FODEX), combining unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR, Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS), and field-inventoried data of forest structural change collected in two logging concessions in Gabon and Peru. The CuSum algorithm was applied to VV-polarized Sentinel-1 ground range detected (GRD) time series to monitor a range of canopy loss events, from individual tree extraction to forest clear cuts. We developed a single change metric using the maximum of the CuSum distribution, retrieving location, time, and magnitude of the disturbance events. A comparison of the CuSum algorithm with the LiDAR reference map resulted in a 78% success rate for the test site in Gabon and 65% success rate for the test site in Peru, for disturbances as small as 0.01 ha in size and for canopy height losses as fine as 10 m. A correlation between the change metric and above ground biomass (AGB) change was found with R-2 = 0.95, and R-2 = 0.83 for canopy height loss. From the regression model we directly estimated local AGB loss maps for the year 2020, at 1 ha scale and in percentages of AGB loss. Comparison with the Global Forest Watch (GFW) Tree Cover Loss (TCL) product showed a 61% overlap between the two maps when considering only deforested pixels, with 504 ha of deforestation detected by CuSum vs. 348 ha detected by GFW. Low intensity disturbances captured by the CuSum method were largely undetected by GFW and by the SAR-based Radar for Detecting Deforestation (RADD) Alert System. The results of this study confirm this approach as a simple and reproducible change detection method for monitoring and quantifying fine-scale to high intensity forest disturbances, even in the case of multi-storied and high biomass forests.

TI  - Geological mapping by thermal inertia derived from long-term maximum and minimum temperatures of ASTER data
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal inertia is a geophysical quantity used to characterize geological features. Apparent Thermal Inertia (ATI) is an alternative quantity to be derived from remotely sensed data. Calculation of the conventional ATI requires acquisition of a pair of daytime and night-time images taken within a short time interval that is often difficult to fulfill by satellite remote sensing due to orbit constraints. In this study, we proposed Long-term ATI (LATI) as a new alternative ATI by taking advantage of the large ASTER data archive. Using the Cuprite area, Nevada, U.S., as a test site, ATI was calculated using an ASTER data pair obtained within 2 days. LATI was also calculated using a much further separated ASTER data pair; daytime on 5 August 2000 and night-time on 12 January 2012. These dates were chosen to represent the maximum and minimum yearly surface temperatures. There was a strong positive correlation between ATI and LATI. We can conclude that LATI is useful and superior to the conventional ATI, because the maximum and minimum land surface temperatures tend to converge on certain values and can be used to characterize surface geological features with minimal effects from temporal atmospheric and environmental conditions.

TI  - Determining Groundwater Recharge Rate with a Distributed Model and Remote Sensing Techniques
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater balance estimation techniques, as important tools for dealing with many hydrological problems, are one of the main issues in water resources management. One of the critical challenges in estimating the groundwater balance components is the uncertainty in the proposed inflow and outflow rates. Groundwater recharge rate varies both spatially and temporally, making direct measurement difficult. In order to reliably estimate the groundwater recharge rate in the groundwater balance equations, the uncertainties in estimation of the other components such as evapotranspiration (ET) should be reduced by estimating them using more accurate techniques such as remote sensing-based methods. The present study applies the WetSpass-M distributed model to the Rafsanjan aquifer in Kerman, Iran. This model has been run for eight years (2009-2016) with monthly time steps. The recorded monthly surface flow data of the hydrometric station is used as the observed data for calibration and validation. ET is also calculated with satellite images of Landsat8 by using SSEB and SEBAL algorithms on a monthly scale in order to evaluate the reliability of the estimated ET by the model. The average rainfall rate during the simulation period is 297.1 MCM/year. The obtained results showed that the average ET and groundwater recharge from rainfall is 185.1 and 102.1 MCM/year, respectively. Although, considering the rainfall rate and irrigation, these numbers are estimated to be 552.3 and 417.2 MCM/year, respectively. Two components of recharge rate and ET constitute large portions of the groundwater balance.

TI  - Quantitative Cell Proteomic Atlas: Pathway-Scale Targeted Mass Spectrometry for High-Resolution Functional Profiling of Cell Signaling
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In spite of extensive studies of cellular signaling, many fundamental processes such as pathway integration, cross-talk, and feedback remain poorly understood. To enable integrated and quantitative measurements of cellular biochemical activities, we have developed the Quantitative Cell Proteomics Atlas (QCPA). QCPA consists of panels of targeted mass spectrometry assays to determine the abundance and stoichiometry of regulatory post-translational modifications of sentinel proteins from most known physiologic and pathogenic signaling pathways in human cells. QCPA currently profiles 1913 peptides from 469 effectors of cell surface signaling, apoptosis, stress response, gene expression, quiescence, and proliferation. For each protein, QCPA includes triplets of isotopically labeled peptides covering known post-translational regulatory sites to determine their stoichiometries and unmodified protein regions to measure total protein abundance. The QCPA framework incorporates analytes to control for technical variability of sample preparation and mass spectrometric analysis, including TrypQuant, a synthetic substrate for accurate quantification of proteolysis efficiency for proteins containing chemically modified residues. The ability to precisely and accurately quantify most known signaling pathways should enable improved chemoproteomic approaches for the comprehensive analysis of cell signaling and clinical proteomics of diagnostic specimens. QCPA is openly available at https://qcpa.mskcc.org.

TI  - Hydrogen isotope measurements of bone and dental tissues from archaeological human and animal samples and their use as climatic and diet proxies
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Stable hydrogen isotope measurement of body tissues faces analytical and interpretative challenges such as hydrogen exchange with atmosphere or competitive influence of drinking water and food intake. Samples from the Gallic site of The ' zy-Glimont, France, have already been investigated isotopically for climate reconstruction and diet investigation of the buried individuals. This allows comparison with the hydrogen isotope composition (82H) of bone collagen, tooth enamel and of bulk bone measured for 8 humans and 11 animals. Three of the best -preserved human skeletons were incrementally sampled and show acceptable homogeneity of 82H values of bone collagen (<5%o) and of bulk bone (<10%o) despite various turnover rates of these tissues. Human tooth enamel records breastfeeding as attested by 82H values of pre-weaning teeth which are 2H-enriched by +20 to +30%o. We observe that the 82H of bone collagen and bulk bone are strongly correlated. The 82H signatures of bone collagen, tooth enamel and bulk bone record both climate conditions and dietary practices, as attested by linear re-lationships with traditional isotopic proxies (818O, 813C, 815N) which were previously measured on the same samples, although interpretations depend on the sampling strategy of each study. Measurements of 82H in bulk bone and dental tissues are more readily achievable than collagen which requires extraction and purification and could become crucial in studies where bone tissue is scarce or when the only available remains are tooth material.

TI  - Hot spots and anomalies of CO2 over eastern Amazonia, Brazil: A time series from 2015 to 2018
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The easternmost Amazon, located in the Maranha similar to o State, in Brazil, has suffered massive deforestation in recent years, which has devastated almost 80% of the original vegetation. We aim to characterize hot spots, hot mo-ments, atmospheric carbon dioxide anomalies (Xco2, ppm), and their interactions with climate and vegetation indices in eastern Amazon, using data from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). The study covered the period from January 2015 to December 2018. The data were subjected to regression, correlation, and temporal analysis, identifying the spatial distribution of hot/cold moments and hot/cold spots. In addition, anomalies were calculated to identify potential CO2 sources and sinks. Temporal changes indicate atmospheric Xco2 in the range from 362.2 to 403.4 ppm. Higher Xco2 values (hot moments) were concentrated between May and September, with some peaks in December. The lowest values (cold moments) were concentrated from November to April. SIF 771 W m- 2 sr- 1 mu m- 1 explained the temporal changes of Xco2 in 58% (R2 adj = 0.58; p < 0.001) and precipitation in 27% (R2 adj = 0.27; p <= 0.001). Spatial hot spots with 90% confidence were more representative in 2016. The maximum and minimum Xco2 (ppm) anomalies were 6.19 ppm (source) and-6.29 ppm (sink), respectively. We conclude that the hot moments of Xco2 in the eastern Amazon rainforest are concentrated in the dry season of the year. Xco2 spatial hot spots and anomalies are concentrated in the southern region and close to protected areas of the Amazon rainforest.

TI  - A regional hydrological model for arid and semi-arid river basins with consideration of irrigation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - We develop a regional hydrological model that applies to arid and semi-arid regions, by explicitly considering the effect of irrigation on the hydrological processes. A new irrigation module is here integrated into the recently introduced Atmospheric and Hydrological Modelling System (AHMS) for the quantitative assessment of basinscale hydrological response to climate change and the impact of anthropogenic activities on water resources. The land surface, channel routing and groundwater modules of the AHMS are extended here to incorporate the new module. We then apply the model to simulating the hydrological processes in the Yellow River Basin, an arid and semi-arid region where irrigation constitutes the most important source of water use. The model is calibrated and validated using in-situ and remote sensing observations. This study demonstrates the capability of the AHMS for regional hydrological modelling in arid and semi-arid basins where irrigation profoundly influences the water balance.

TI  - An automatic rice mapping method based on constrained feature matching exploiting Sentinel-1 data for arbitrary length time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is one of the staple food crops worldwide, and timely and accurate paddy rice mapping (PRM) is essential to coordinate agricultural production and assure grain security. In cloudy and foggy regions, there are low exploitation rates of optical images, and accurate PRM is a commonly occurring difficulty. To achieve a precise and timely PRM in these regions, an automatic PRM method based on constrained feature matching (Auto-CFM) for arbitrary length time series was proposed using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, which takes into account the local shape differences of the time-series sigma 0 VH curves of different land cover types and the overall deviation of the curves due to the discrepancy in rice planting time. Moreover, it solved the problem of high precision extraction of rice when the Sentinel-1 data might suffer from partial missing images. In this study, the PRM was conducted in Hunan Province and validated in Hubei, Guangdong, and Heilongjiang Provinces, which featured different planting times, climates, and topographies. The results showed that the Auto-CFM improved the accuracy by 3%-9% compared to current competing methods and the PRM accuracy exceeded 92% in different validation areas, proving the effectiveness and robustness of the method. To obtain cultivation areas as early as possible, the PRM was performed by reducing the number of images one by one to eventually acquired the rice maps in mid to late August with an overall accuracy of no less than 90%, achieving the goal of access to the spatial distribution of rice with high accuracy before harvest.

TI  - Observation-based Sea surface temperature trends in Atlantic large marine ecosystems
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - Variations in Sea Surface Temperature (SST) are an important driver of marine species abundance in Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs). Studies concerned with climate change induced SST trends within these LMEs have so far been relying on satellite data and reanalysis products, with the disadvantages of only having short time -periods available and having to rely on the ability of the models to correctly simulate SST-dynamics, respectively. Here, we provide for the first time a long-term trend analysis of SST for 17 LMEs of the Atlantic Ocean over two different time-periods (1957-2020 and 1980-2020) based on in-situ data gathered from three data collections. We sort our results according to warming categories that were established in an earlier study, i.e., "cooling" (below 0 degrees C/dec), "slow" (0-0.07 degrees C/dec), "moderate" (0.07-0.14 degrees C/dec), "fast" (0.14-0.21 degrees C/dec) and "su-perfast" (above 0.21 degrees C/dec). Our results show a persistent "slow" to "superfast" warming in all considered LMEs. However, the sparse data coverage induces large uncertainties, so that many LMEs cannot uniquely be assigned to one warming category only. We detect no systematic changes in the seasonal SST amplitude of the considered LMEs. We find that the LMEs of the North Atlantic warm faster than those of the South Atlantic and that this difference is increasing with time. Out of the North Atlantic LMEs, the Norwegian Sea, North Sea, Celtic-Biscay Shelf, Gulf of Mexico and the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf belong exclusively to the superfast warming category for the period 1980-2020.

TI  - Does the definition of preventable emergency department visit matter? An empirical analysis using 20 million visits in Ontario and Alberta
T2  - ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives This study had two objectives: (1) to estimate the prevalence of preventable emergency department (ED) visits during the 2016-2020 time period among those living in 19 large urban centers in Alberta and Ontario, Canada, and (2) to assess if the definition of preventable ED visits matters in estimating the prevalence. Methods A retrospective, population-based study of ED visits that were reported to the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System from April 1, 2016, to March 31, 2020, was conducted. Preventable ED visits were operationalized based on the following approaches: (1) Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS), (2) ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (ACSC), (3) family practice-sensitive conditions (FPSC), and (4) sentinel nonurgent conditions (SNC). The overall proportion of ED visits that were preventable was estimated. We also estimated the adjusted relative risks of preventable ED visits by patients' sex and age, fiscal year, province of residence, and census metropolitan area (CMA) of residence. Results There were 20,171,319 ED visits made by 8,919,618 patients ages 1 to 74 who resided in one of the 19 CMAs in Alberta or Ontario. On average, there were 2.26 visits per patient over the period of 4 fiscal years; most patients made one (44.22%) or two ED visits (20.72%). The overall unadjusted prevalence of preventable ED visits varied by definition; 35.33% of ED visits were defined as preventable based on CTAS, 12.88% based on FPSC, 3.41% based on SNC, and 2.33% based on ACSC. Conclusions There is a substantial level of variation in prevalence estimates across definitions of preventable ED visits, and care should be taken when interpreting these estimates as each has a different meaning and may lead to different conclusions. The conceptualization and measurement of preventable ED visits is complex and multifaceted and may not be adequately captured by a single definition.

TI  - Detecting changes in mixed-sampling rate data sequences
T2  - ENVIRONMETRICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Different environmental variables are often monitored using different sampling rates; examples include half-hourly weather station measurements, daily CO2$$ {\mathrm{CO}}_2 $$ data, and six-day satellite data. Further when researchers want to combine the data into a single analysis this often requires data aggregation or down-scaling. When one is seeking to identify changes within multivariate data, the aggregation and/or down-scaling processes obscure the changes we seek. In this article, we propose a novel changepoint detection algorithm which can analyze multiple time series for co-occurring changepoints with potentially different sampling rates, without requiring preprocessing to a standard sampling scale. We demonstrate the algorithm on synthetic data before providing an example identifying simultaneous changes in multiple variables at a location on the Greenland ice sheet using synthetic aperture radar and weather station data.

TI  - Challenges and benefits of quantifying irrigation through the assimilation of Sentinel-1 backscatter observations into Noah-MP
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the amount of water used for agricultural purposes has been rising due to an increase in food demand. However, anthropogenic water usage, such as for irrigation, is still not or poorly parameterized in regional- and larger-scale land surface models (LSMs). By contrast, satellite observations are directly affected by, and hence potentially able to detect, irrigation as they sense the entire integrated soil-vegetation system. By integrating satellite observations and fine-scale modelling it could thus be possible to improve estimation of irrigation amounts at the desired spatial-temporal scale. In this study we tested the potential information offered by Sentinel-1 backscatter observations to improve irrigation estimates, in the framework of a data assimilation (DA) system composed of the Noah-MP LSM, equipped with a sprinkler irrigation scheme, and a backscatter operator represented by a water cloud model (WCM), as part of the NASA Land Information System (LIS). The calibrated WCM was used as an observation operator in the DA system to map model surface soil moisture and leaf area index (LAI) into backscatter predictions and, conversely, map observation-minus-forecast backscatter residuals back to updates in soil moisture and LAI through an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The benefits of Sentinel-1 backscatter observations in two different polarizations (VV and VH) were tested in two separate DA experiments, performed over two irrigated sites, the first one located in the Po Valley (Italy) and the second one located in northern Germany. The results confirm that VV backscatter has a stronger link with soil moisture than VH backscatter, whereas VH backscatter observations introduce larger updates in the vegetation state variables. The backscatter DA introduced both improvements and degradations in soil moisture, evapotranspiration and irrigation estimates. The spatial and temporal scale had a large impact on the analysis, with more contradicting results obtained for the evaluation at the fine agriculture scale (i.e. field scale). Above all, this study sheds light on the limitations resulting from a poorly parameterized sprinkler irrigation scheme, which prevents improvements in the irrigation simulation due to DA and points to future developments needed to improve the system.

TI  - Effect of scale, landscape heterogeneity and terrain complexity on agriculture mapping accuracy from time-series NDVI in the Western-Himalaya region
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Accurate mapping of mountain agriculture is important for both a food-security and an environmental degradation perspective. Remote sensing provides a large and diverse data source for these complex regions and enables large-scale mapping of mountain agriculture. However, obtaining good mapping accuracy is challenging in mountain terrain. Objectives The main objective is to analyse the effect of mapping scale or resolution, landscape heterogeneity and terrain complexity on the accuracy of agriculture extraction in the Western-Himalayan region. Methods A similarity-based technique was applied on time-series MODIS NDVI for extracting agriculture area at 250 m, 500 m and 1000 m resolution. Further, Pareto boundary-based accuracy was estimated from reference high-resolution agriculture data. The agriculture area extracted at multiple scales was utilized to compute landscape heterogeneity indicators, and ASTER DEM was used to estimate the terrain complexity indicators. Finally, the dependency of mapping accuracy on landscape heterogeneity and terrain complexity were analyzed through linear regression. Results Mapping accuracy gradually decreases with coarseness of scale mainly due to higher omission error. Spatial visualization of landscape heterogeneity and mapping accuracy reveals that higher patch fragmentation increases omission error causing lower accuracy. Regression analysis revealed that heterogeneity has a negative relationship with mapping accuracy such that higher fragmentation lowers the accuracy. Terrain complexity significantly (p < 0.05) influences the mapping accuracy only at 250 m resolution. Conclusion Analysis explains that the effect of scale on mapping accuracy for mountain agriculture mapping is mainly controlled by landscape heterogeneity such that patch fragmentation is the cause for introducing negative bias towards mapping accuracy with the coarseness of resolution.

TI  - Breast Sentinel Lymph Node Cancer Detection from Mammographic Images Based on Quantum Wavelet Transform and an Atrous Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes an optimal approach to reduce noise in mammographic images and to identify salt-and-pepper, Gaussian, Poisson, and impact noises to determine the exact mass detection operation after these noise reductions. It therefore offers a method for noise reduction operations called quantum wavelet transform filtering and a method for precision mass segmentation called the image morphological operations in mammographic images based on the classification with an atrous pyramid convolutional neural network (APCNN) as a deep learning model. The hybrid approach called a QWT-APCNN is evaluated in terms of criteria compared with previous methods such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean-squared error (MSE) in noise reduction and accuracy of detection for mass area recognition. The proposed method presents more performance of noise reduction and segmentation in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. In this paper, we used the APCNN based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) as a new deep learning method, which is able to extract features and perform classification simultaneously, but it is intended as far as possible, empirically for the purpose of this research to be able to determine breast cancer and then identify the exact area of the masses and then classify them according to benign, malignant, and suspicious classes. The obtained results presented that the proposed approach has better performance than others based on some evaluation criteria such as accuracy with 98.57%, sensitivity with 90%, specificity with 85%, and also ROC and AUC with a rate of 86.77.

TI  - Use of TanDEM-X PolInSAR for canopy height retrieval over tropical forests in the Western Ghats, India
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy height is a critical parameter in quantifying the vertical structure of forests. Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (PolInSAR) is a radar remote sensing technique that makes use of polarimetric separation of scattering phase centers obtained from interferometry to estimate height. This article discusses the potential of the X-band PolInSAR pair for forest height retrieval over tropical forests in the Western ghats. A total of 19 fully polarimetric datasets with various spatial baselines acquired from November 2015 to February 2016 in bistatic mode are utilized in this study. After compensating for all possible non-volumetric decorrelations in the data-sets, the remaining volume decorrelation is modeled using a Random Volume Over Ground (RVoG) model to invert height from PolInSAR data. A modified three-stage algorithm developed by Cloude and Papathanassiou (2003) is adopted for height inversion. PolInSAR derived heights were cross-validated against reference height data measured during a field survey conducted in March 2019. RMSE values of all TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X PolInSAR heights with respect to field measured heights range from 3.3 to 13.8 m and the correlation coefficient r(2) varies between 0.16 and 0.79. The results suggest that the use of a dataset with optimal wavenumber can improve the tree height estimation process. The best performance was achieved for the dataset acquired on 11 December 2015 with RMSE = 3.4 m and r(2) = 0.79. Furthermore, the effects of parameters such as angle of incidence, precipitation, and forest biomass on height inversion accuracy are assessed. A large-scale Shimoga Forest height map was generated using multiple TanDEM-X acquisitions with the best correlation results. To improve the accuracy of the height estimation, a merged height approach is explored. The best height estimates among all PolInSAR estimates for a given field plot are chosen in this regard. The merged height approach gave rise to an improved inversion accuracy with RMSE = 1.9 m and r(2) = 0.92. The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate the ability of spaceborne X-band data to estimate height with maximum accuracy over natural forests in India, in which height retrieval research has seldom been done.

AB  - Dust aerosols can sometimes extend thousands of kilometers continuously in the atmosphere. In this study, we refer to these dust streams, as Atmospheric Dust Corridors (ADCs). This study aims to identify ADCs by an automated algorithm and investigate their temporal and spatial characteristics in the Middle East. In order to do this, the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Angstrom Exponent (AE) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Aqua) were obtained on a daily scale at a resolution of 1*1 degrees between 2003 and 2020. In this study, observations with AOD above 0.3 and AE below 0.75 were considered as dust aerosols. After determining a set of conditions, an algorithm was developed to identify the ADCs automatically. In the first step, the dust masses were identified using the connected components labeling method, and the largest dust mass was selected from each day. Then, a set of conditions were examined such as geometric shape and motion of the dust mass (based on wind data). As a result, we identified 281 ADCs and classified them according to their direction of movement. We found 33% cases of ADCs that flow toward the west, 19% cases that flow toward the east, 36% cases that flow toward the south, and 12% cases that flow toward the north. All the directions had the highest frequency in September, April, and March, whereas February, November and December had the lowest fre-quency. Spatially, the highest frequency can be seen around 45 degrees E over Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Syria. Western and southern ADCs are primarily found in the Arabian Peninsula and in Iraq, Syria, southern Iran, southern Afghanistan, and northern Pakistan, while northern and eastern ADCs are primarily found in northern Africa (Sudan and Chad, Niger, and Libya). May is important for western ADCs, September for southern ADCs, and April for eastern and northern ADCs. According to the Mann-Kendal test, no significant trends were observed on a monthly or annual basis during the studied period.

TI  - Towards spatially continuous mapping of soil organic carbon in croplands using multitemporal Sentinel-2 remote sensing
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensified human activities can augment soil organic carbon (SOC) losses from the world's croplands, making SOC a highly dynamic parameter both in space and time. Sentinel-2 spectral imagery is well placed to capture the spatiotemporal variability of SOC, but its capability has only been demonstrated for agricultural regions mostly located in Europe. Furthermore, most studies so far only used single-date images that resulted in spatially non-continuous SOC maps, hampering their ability to aid multiscale SOC assessments. Here, we aim to achieve spatially continuous mapping of SOC in croplands, by creating multitemporal bare soil composites that maximize cropland coverage in two regions of varying agroecosystems and landscape structure in the Northeast China Chernozem region and the Belgian Loam Belt. Bare soil pixels were extracted via spectral index thresholding that excluded contaminated pixels from external perturbance. Multitemporal soil composites were then obtained by averaging over multiple single-date bare soil images that were selected within pre-determined optimal time-windows, corresponding to the region-specific crop sowing periods when best possible surface conditions were expected. Results show that the optimal time-window filter ensured selective inclusion of single-date images that themselves yielded stable and robust SOC predictions across multiple years. Spectral-based models developed from multitemporal composites consistently produced better or similar prediction accuracies than single-date images for both study regions (R-2: 0.52-0.62; RMSE: 0.17-0.21 g 100 g(-1)), while also achieved maximum cropland coverage (>82 %). Bootstrap modelling demonstrated that SOC mapping via multitemporal Sentinel-2 data was associated with small uncertainties. Investigations into the significant spectral bands that contributed to the prediction of SOC suggested that, regardless of the study regions, the physical relationship between spectral bands and SOC that predominantly exists for laboratory spectra is largely translated into Sentinel-2 platforms. This study highlights the widespread applicability of multitemporal Sentinel-2 remote sensing for effective and high-resolution SOC mapping, in order to detect localized soil degradation as well as to inform regional cropland management in diverse agroecosystems.

TI  - Quantifying ocean surface green tides using high-spatial resolution thermal images
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of thermal remote sensing for marine green tide monitoring has not been clearly demonstrated due to the lack of high-resolution spaceborne thermal observation data. This problem has been effectively solved using high-spatial resolution thermal and optical images collected from the sensors onboard the Ziyuan-1 02E (ZY01-02E) satellite of China. The characteristics and principles of spaceborne thermal remote sensing of green tides were investigated in this study. Spaceborne thermal cameras can capture marine green tides depending on the brightness temperature difference (BTD) between green tides and background seawater, which shows a positive or negative BTD contrast between them in the daytime or nighttime. There is a significant difference between thermal and optical remote sensing in the ability to detect green tides; compared with optical remote sensing, pixels containing less algae are not easily distinguishable in thermal images. However, there is a good linear statistical relationship between the BTD and the optical parameter (scaled algae index of virtual baseline height of floating macroalgae, SAI(VB)) of green tides, which indicates that the BTD can be used to quantify the green tide coverage area in a pixel or biomass per area. Then, the uncertainty in thermal quantitative remote sensing of green tides was clarified according to the pixel-to-pixel relationship between optical and thermal images. In a mixed pixel, green tide coverage and algal thickness have different thermal signal responses, which results in this uncertainty. In future research, more thermally remotely sensed images with high spatial resolution are needed to increase the observation frequency in the daytime and nighttime for the dynamic monitoring of green tides.

TI  - Oil spills: Detection and concentration estimation in satellite imagery, a machine learning approach
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The method's development to detect oil-spills, and concentration monitoring of marine environments, are essential in emergency response. To develop a classification model, this work was based on the spectral response of surfaces using reflectance data, and machine learning (ML) techniques, with the objective of detecting oil in Landsat imagery. Additionally, different concentration oil data were used to obtain a concentration-estimation model. In the classification, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) obtained the best approximations in oil detection using Blue (0.453-0.520 mu m), NIR (0.790-0.891 mu m), SWIR1 (1.557-1.717 mu m), and SWIR2 (1.960-2.162 mu m) bands for 2010 spill images. In the concentration model, the mean absolute error (MAE) was 1.41 and 3.34, for training and validation data. When testing the concentration-estimation model in images where oil was detected, the concentration-estimation obtained was between 40 and 60 %. This demonstrates the potential use of ML techniques and spectral response data to detect and estimate the concentration of oil-spills.

TI  - Ecological Civilization in the making: the 'construction' of China's climate-forestry nexus
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Anthropocene, debates about global climate risks have taken carbon as a measure of policy success, with land-based mitigation strategies like afforestation receiving particular scrutiny. While scientists and policymakers discuss forestry as a potential climate solution, China has been implementing massive forestry projects for decades, drastically transforming environments under the Ecological Civilization framework. This article showcases China's globally emerging paradigm of Eco-Civilization and its implications for the climate-forestry nexus. Drawing parallels with Ulrich Beck's concept of 'metamorphosis' and Bruno Latour's concept of 'mutation,' we argue that China's Eco-Civilization aspires to a fundamental transformation in worldview - but one that is promoted as distinctly non-Western. We use the case of forestry to illuminate the potentially unique features of Chinese environmentalism as encapsulated in Eco-Civilization. We find that Eco-Civilization affords a strong role for the central state in actively building and constructing an ecological future in which the natural and the socio-political are not considered separate. This is in contrast to certain Western visions of preserving nature from human encroachment through grassroots environmental movements. We conclude by highlighting the theoretical contributions more pluralized debates about China's environmental rise could bring to environmental sociology.

TI  - Hepatic AMPK signaling dynamic activation in response to REDOX balance are sentinel biomarkers of exercise and antioxidant intervention to improve blood glucose control
T2  - ELIFE
M3  - Article
AB  - Antioxidant intervention is considered to inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alleviate hyperglycemia. Paradoxically, moderate exercise can produce ROS to improve diabetes. The exact redox mechanism of these two different approaches remains largely unclear. Here, by comparing exercise and antioxidant intervention on type 2 diabetic rats, we found moderate exercise upregulated compensatory antioxidant capability and reached a higher level of redox balance in the liver. In contrast, antioxidant intervention achieved a low-level redox balance by inhibiting oxidative stress. Both of these two interventions could promote glucose catabolism and inhibit gluconeogenesis through activation of hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling; therefore, ameliorating diabetes. During exercise, different levels of ROS generated by exercise have differential regulations on the activity and expression of hepatic AMPK. Moderate exercise-derived ROS promoted hepatic AMPK glutathionylation activation. However, excessive exercise increased oxidative damage and inhibited the activity and expression of AMPK. Overall, our results illustrate that both exercise and antioxidant intervention improve blood glucose control in diabetes by promoting redox balance, despite different levels of redox state(s). These results indicate that the AMPK signaling activation, combined with oxidative damage markers, could act as sentinel biomarkers, reflecting the threshold of redox balance that is linked to effective glucose control in diabetes. These findings provide theoretical evidence for the precise management of diabetes by antioxidants and exercise.

TI  - Estimating fractional snow cover in vegetated environments using MODIS surface reflectance data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in snow-cover mapping techniques have resulted in more accurate estimation of fractional snow cover (FSC) in areas with no vegetation; however, vegetation interference limits the accuracy of available snow cover information from satellite observations. The aim of this study was to develop a robust and enhanced FSC-retrieval algorithm using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data for vegetated areas. The experiments were conducted in North America, where vegetation cover is complex and heterogeneous, using 28 Landsat-8 - MODIS image pairs acquired for the entire snow cover season (September 2015-May 2016). The FSC retrieval models were established from 20 sub-models based on the Extremely Randomized Trees method incorporating input information from multiple sources, such as commonly used variables, vegetationand snow-related variables, location and geometry related variables, and other auxiliary variables. The FSC retrieval models were divided into forest- and non-forest types. We further investigated a canopy correction method to mitigate vegetation interference effects caused by the viewing geometry of satellite observations. The results show that the integration of 20 sub-models largely decreased model dependence on the training sample quality and improved the robustness of the model predictions. In the validation of the independent dataset, there was a noticeable improvement in FSC estimation for different land-cover and vegetation-cover types, with rootmean-square errors (RMSEs) reduced by an average of 11% compared to the Trimmed-Model. The application of canopy correction under the "Recommend" conditions (i.e., viewing zenith angle in [45 degrees , 70 degrees] and fraction of forest cover in [0, 0.3]) improved the FSC prediction accuracy. Moreover, based on a comparison with the MOD10A1-based FSC map, our FSC estimation showed improved consistency across various vegetation coverages based on the Landsat reference FSC values, with 40% lower RMSEs and 8% increase in overall accuracy.

TI  - Dynamic monitoring of the largest reservoir in North China based on multi-source satellite remote sensing from 2013 to 2022: Water area, water level, water storage and water quality
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Miyun Reservoir, located in the Miyun District of Beijing, China, is the largest comprehensive water conservancy project in northern China and an important ecological protection area. The combined effects of many factors produce ecosystem changes in the basin; thus, it is important to analyze the spatial and temporal changes that occur here. Based on multi-source satellite remote sensing data, we analyzed changes in water body area, water level height, and water storage in the Miyun Reservoir from 2013 to 2022 and determined whether these changes were natural or caused by human activity. As traditional water body area extraction methods can misidentify buildings and mountainous areas as water bodies, we fused multiple deep learning models (U-Net and SegNet) using the adboost method, which combined the advantages of the basic models and achieved an overall recognition accuracy of > 90 %. Using annual variations in water storage at the reservoir, we determined that the water body area increased to 157.58 km2 between 2013 and 2022, nearly doubling in size, which corresponded to decreases in cultivated land and vegetated areas. Cultivated land is the main land use type affected by water body erosion. The overall water level height exhibited an upward trend (cumulative increase of 14.8 %), eventually reaching 146.11 m. The water storage volume also increased over time, with a cumulative increase of approximately 436 million m3. On this basis, the influences of temperature, precipitation, and human activity on the spatial and temporal variability of the Miyun Reservoir basin were analyzed. The findings have important implications for global change research within and outside the ecosystem.

TI  - An ensemble machine learning model for water quality estimation in coastal area based on remote sensing imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of coastal water quality parameters (WQPs) is crucial for decision-makers to manage water resources. Although various machine learning (ML) models have been developed for coastal water quality estimation using remote sensing data, the performance of these models has significant uncertainties when applied to regional scales. To address this issue, an ensemble ML-based model was developed in this study. The ensemble ML model was applied to estimate chlorophyll-a (Chla), turbidity, and dissolved oxygen (DO) based on Sentinel-2 satellite images in Shenzhen Bay, China. The optimal input features for each WQP were selected from eight spectral bands and seven spectral indices. A local explanation strategy termed Shapley Additive Expla-nations (SHAP) was employed to quantify contributions of each feature to model outputs. In addition, the im-pacts of three climate factors on the variation of each WQP were analyzed. The results suggested that the ensemble ML models have satisfied performance for Chla (errors = 1.7%), turbidity (errors = 1.5%) and DO estimation (errors = 0.02%). Band 3 (B3) has the highest positive contribution to Chla estimation, while Band Ration Index2 (BR2) has the highest negative contribution to turbidity estimation, and Band 7 (B7) has the highest positive contribution to DO estimation. The spatial patterns of the three WQPs revealed that the water quality deterioration in Shenzhen Bay was mainly influenced by input of terrestrial pollutants from the estuary. Correlation analysis demonstrated that air temperature (Temp) and average air pressure (AAP) exhibited the closest relationship with Chla. DO showed the strongest negative correlation with Temp, while turbidity was not sensitive to Temp, average wind speed (AWS), and AAP. Overall, the ensemble ML model proposed in this study provides an accurate and practical method for long-term Chla, turbidity, and DO estimation in coastal waters.

T2  - GEOSCIENCE DATA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Islands are special bodies of land surrounded by seawater. Many islands are facing water shortages as the demand for groundwater increases, thus, highlighting the importance and urgency of the assessment, planning, and management of island groundwater resources. To facilitate the same, the groundwater potential of the Penghu Islands in China was assessed for the first time using remote sensing (RS), geographic information system (GIS), and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Long-term series remote sensing studies were also conducted to monitor the dynamic change in groundwater potential and to identify groundwater potential areas. In this study, the geological environment factors were normalized, and their weight was allocated based on the AHP of RS and GIS. The groundwater potential assessment (GPA) index, established using the weighted comprehensive algorithm, was used to analyse groundwater potential and demarcate groundwater potential zones. Finally, the trend in the spatio-temporal variation of groundwater potential was analysed using long-term series remote sensing data. The results from 2015 to 2021 showed that the Penghu Islands can be divided into five groundwater potential zones of different grades, such as 6.3%-8.1% of grade I, 22.2%-24.2% of grade II, 23%-24.4% of grade III, 19.6%-21% of grade IV, and 25.1%-25.5% of grade V. The results of the GPA were verified by comparing them with the abundance of water-content rock formation in hydrogeologic maps, which yielded correlation coefficients of 78.3%-88.9%. Overall, the groundwater potential zones of different grades in the study area tended to be stable all year-round, including the zones of grades I and II. The results of this study highlighted the reliability of predicting groundwater potential based on long-term series remote sensing data and its usability to local personnel in appropriate groundwater resource planning and management.

AB  - We analyzed national, population-based, surveillance data for Australian children aged <= 14 years with Influenza-Associated Neurological Disease (IAND). IAND accounted for a quarter of all severe influenza, is associated with intensive care unit admission, and accounted for half of all influenza deaths.Background Influenza-associated neurological disease (IAND) is uncommon but can result in death or neurological morbidity in children. We aimed to describe the incidence, risk factors, and outcome of children with IAND from seasonal influenza in Australia. Methods We analyzed national, population-based, surveillance data for children aged <= 14 years with severe influenza and neurological involvement, over 11 Australian influenza seasons, 2008-2018, by the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit. Results There were 633 laboratory-confirmed cases of severe influenza reported. Of these, 165 (26%) had IAND. The average annual incidence for IAND was 3.39 per million children aged <= 14 years. Compared to cases without neurological complications, those with IAND were more likely to have a pre-existing neurological disease (odds ratio [OR] 3.03, P < .001), but most children with IAND did not (n = 135, 82%). Children with IAND were more likely to receive antivirals (OR 1.80, P = .002), require intensive care (OR 1.79, P = .001), require ventilation (OR 1.99; P = .001), and die (OR 2.83, P = .004). Conclusions IAND is a preventable cause of mortality, predominantly in otherwise well children. Incidence estimates validate previous sentinel site estimates from Australia. IAND accounted for a quarter of all severe influenza, is associated with intensive care unit admission, and accounted for half of all influenza deaths.

TI  - 3D hydrogeological modeling and visualization of the aquifer system based on borehole data for selecting the optimal well site: a case study in El-Oweinat, Egypt
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Visualizing and understanding the aquifer system based on reliable borehole data is increasingly essential in groundwater management and sustainable development. With the possibility of breaking down the wells, decision-makers got extremely concerned about finding the best location for drilling new groundwater wells. Therefore, three-dimensional hydrogeological modeling and visualization of the aquifer system can be used as a decision-aiding tool for selecting the optimum site for drilling new groundwater wells. To build an accurate and reliable 3D model based on geophysical and hydrogeological data, it is essential to develop a workflow methodology that considers the variety of these available borehole data. This method has been developed by a combination of well-logging data (Gamma-ray, SP, and Resistivity) and analyzing step-drawdown pumping tests for 79 groundwater wells, in addition to remote sensing data such as a digital elevation model (DEM) with a high spatial resolution and Landsat images to visualize the surface and subsurface of the study area. Several aquifer properties and characteristics are discussed in this study to help in selecting the optimal well location. Moreover, the 3D hydrogeological model is introduced to visualize the lateral and vertical distribution of the lithostratigraphic layers and to understand the effect of basement rocks on drilling new wells. Three specific suggestions are proposed to enhance the application and efficiency of this 3D modeling and to provide a reference for future applications and developments.

TI  - A method to detect abrupt shifts in river channel position using a Landsat-derived water occurrence record
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The lateral migration of river channels is an important control on the evolution of alluvial fans, deltas, and floodplains. Lateral migration consists of both gradual riverbank migration and abrupt shifts in location due to avulsions or cutoffs. Methods exist to measure bank migration, but abrupt shifts in position are rarely considered or are not emphasized. Here we describe a new method using Landsat-derived water occurrence images that primarily focuses on detecting when a channel has abruptly shifted position, either from avulsion or cutoff. The method does not assume any a priori model of channel geometry or evolution. Within a given area of interest, binary channel images created from the fluvial water occurrence record are stacked through time. Then a channel shift intensity, Ai$$ {A}_i $$, is created by estimating the number of possible ending times for fluvial water voxels (a point in three-dimensional space) in the stacked occurrence record. The number of possible end-times for fluvial water voxels within a given region of the occurrence record reveals the likelihood that a reach of a river underwent an abrupt channel shift during the observation period. We present the results of this analysis for a 194 481 km(2) region of the Amazonian basin. Follow-up validation found three avulsions and 270 cutoffs within regions identified by this method. We show that areas above a threshold Ai$$ {A}_i $$ contain an avulsion or cutoff with high probability. This highlights the method's potential to detect and quantify abrupt channel shifts at the basin scale. The method also successfully distinguishes between abrupt channel movement and complex braiding behaviour. As this method is applicable to any binary water-masked time series images, future applications of this method have the potential to provide insight into the controls and spatial variance of avulsions and cutoffs across a variety of scales.

TI  - Continental-scale hyperspectral tree species classification in the United States National Ecological Observatory Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in remote sensing imagery and machine learning applications unlock the potential for developing algorithms for species classification at the level of individual tree crowns at unprecedented scales. However, most approaches to date focus on site-specific applications and a small number of taxonomic groups. Little is known about how well these approaches generalize across broader geographic areas and ecosystems. Leveraging field surveys and hyperspectral remote sensing data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), we developed a continental-extent model for tree species classification that can be applied to the network, including a wide range of US terrestrial ecosystems. We compared the performance of a model trained with data from 27 NEON sites to models trained with data from each individual site, evaluating advantages and challenges posed by training species classifiers at the US scale. We evaluated the effect of geographic location, topography, and ecological conditions on the accuracy and precision of species predictions (72 out of 77 species).On average, the general model resulted in good overall classification accuracy (micro-F1 score), with better accuracy than site-specific classifiers (average individual tree level accuracy of 0.77 for the general model and 0.70 for site-specific models). Aggregating species to the genus-level increased accuracy to 0.83. Regions with more species exhibited lower classification accuracy. Predicted species were more likely to be confused with congeneric and co-occurring species and confusion was highest for trees with structural damage and in complex closed-canopy forests. The model produced accurate estimates of uncertainty, correctly identifying trees where confusion was likely. Using only data from NEON, this single integrated classifier can make predictions for 20% of all tree species found in forest ecosystems across the entire US, which make up to roughly 90% of the upper canopy of the studied ecosystems. This suggests the potential for integrating information from multiple datasets and locations to develop broad scale general models for species classification from hyperspectral imaging.

TI  - Predicting Potential Change in Land Cover and Its Effect on the Temperature of the Land Surface: A Case Study of Khulna City Corporation, Bangladesh
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION ASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Khulna City Corporation (KCC) has undergone rapid urban development and expansion in recent times. These changes, including the change in land surface temperature (LST) throughout the area, have significant long-term effects. This research analysed the effects of land cover changes on KCC's LST. By using the maximum likelihood classification method, Landsat imagery investigation identified the land cover chart and determined the LST for the years 1999, 2009 and 2019. It was modelled for the simulation of land cover for the year 2029 by using the classification results and applying the multi-layer perceptron Markov (MLPM) models together. It then also modelled the LST for the year 2029 by using three thematic indices and multiple regression analysis. As a result, the KCC urban area grew by 49% between 1999 and 2019. Simulation results have shown that the KCC could possibly experience a temperature range of more than or equal to 26 degrees C in 2029 if the recent pattern persists. For KCC, the average LST for the urban area is projected to be 27 degrees C in 2029. The scenario shown in this article will assist urban planners in quantifying the impact of various LST change-related issues and, thus, in preparing proper strategic measures.

TI  - Fine resolution remote sensing spectra improves estimates of gross primary production of croplands
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary production (GPP) is a fundamental measure of the terrestrial carbon cycle critical to our under-standing of ecosystem function under the changing climate and land use. Remote sensing enables access to continuous spatial coverage, but remains challenged in heterogeneous croplands. Coarse resolution products, like MOD17A (500 m), may aggregate fragmented land cover types commonly found in heavily managed landscapes and misrepresent their respective contribution to carbon production. Consequently, this study demonstrates the capability of fine-resolution imagery (20-30 m) and available red-edge vegetation indices to characterize GPP across seven Midwest cropping systems. Four sites were established on a 22-year-old USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); and the other three on land conventionally farmed with corn-soybean-wheat rotation (AGR). We compare in situ GPP estimates from eddy-covariance towers with ten satellite models: eight variants of the vegetation photosynthesis models (VPM), of which five include a red-edge vegetation index, as well as con-ventional products Landsat CONUS GPP (30 m) and MOD17A2H V6 (500 m). Daily and cumulative fine -resolution imagery integrated within VPM generally agreed with tower-based GPP in heterogeneous land-scapes more than those from MODIS 500 m VPM or conventional GPP products from MOD17AH V6 or Landsat 8 CONUS. Replacing EVI2 with red-edge indices NDRE2, NDRE1, and MTCI in Sentinel 2 VPMs notably improved explanation of variance and estimation of cumulative GPP. While existing methods using MODIS-and Landsat -derived GPP are important baselines for regional and global studies, future research may benefit from the higher spatial, temporal, and radiometric resolution.

TI  - The radiometric accuracy of the 8-band multi-spectral surface reflectance from the planet SuperDove constellation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in the capabilities of commercial CubeSat constellations have enabled the retrieval of multi-spectral surface reflectance data over the Earth's terrestrial surfaces on an almost daily basis. For example, while the earliest versions of Planet's CubeSats provided tri-band and then quad-band optical image data, the most recent iterations deliver imaging capabilities with eight unique spectral bands for Earth system monitoring. To determine the utility of these rich geospatial data collections for a range of applications, it is necessary to characterise their radiometric accuracy. Leveraging on-ground spectroradiometer measurements of radiometrically pseudoinvariant features, we assess the absolute accuracy of an annual sequence of Planet SuperDove surface reflectance data. Date-coincident and spectrally overlapping Sentinel-2 image data were also used to assess the relative radiometric accuracy of the CubeSat reflectance data. Additionally, confidence levels for acquiring consistent SuperDove surface reflectance data were calculated, and the multi-temporal patterns of surface reflectance between the SuperDove and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance products were evaluated by examining their rank correlation. Our findings demonstrate that (1) the average accuracy of the Coastal-Blue, Blue, Green I, and Green II SuperDove surface reflectance bands was 5% higher than for the Yellow, Red, Red-Edge, and Near-Infrared bands; (2) the SuperDove surface reflectance data was on average almost identical to the surface reflectance derived from the coincident Sentinel-2 data; and (3) the radiometric accuracies (i.e., mean errors) can be improved by using band combinations (e.g. normalised difference vegetation index). However, due to the different radiometric performance between the spectral bands, some vegetation indices (e.g. the Yellowness Index) did not provide a linear relationship between the SuperDove and reference data. The probability of acquiring surface reflectance data with less than 5% reflectance variation was approximately 90% for the annual multi-satellite dataset. On average, 68% of the data derived from a single satellite had at least 95% probability of acquiring surface reflectance with less than 5% variation. The time series patterns of the SuperDove reflectance data had an average rank correlation coefficient of 0.67 for all types of surface units and 0.77 for vegetated surfaces when compared with the spectrally overlapping bands of the Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data. In addition to providing confidence levels for users to directly assess the radiometric accuracies of SuperDove surface reflectance products, we also provide suggestions to improve the data quality from an end-user's perspective.

TI  - The value of sentinel lymph-node biopsy in women with node-positive breast cancer at diagnosis and node-negative tumour after neoadjuvant therapy: a systematic review
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose To conduct a systematic review to analyse the performance of the sentinel lymph-node biopsy (SLNB) in women with node-positive breast cancer at diagnosis and node-negative tumour after neoadjuvant therapy, compared to axillary lymph-node dissection. Methods The more relevant databases were searched. Main outcomes were false-negative rate (FNR), sentinel lymph-node identification rate (SLNIR), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy. We conducted meta-analyses when appropriate. Results Twenty studies were included. The pooled FNR was 0.14 (95% CI 0.11-0.17), the pooled SLNIR was 0.89 (95% CI 0.86-0.92), NPV was 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87), and summary accuracy was 0.92 (95% CI 0.90-0.94). SLNB performed better when more than one node was removed and double mapping was used. Conclusions SLNB can be performed in women with a node-negative tumour after neoadjuvant therapy. It has a better performance when used with previous marking of the affected node and with double tracer.

TI  - Estimating glacier mass balance in High Mountain Asia based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer retrieved surface albedo from 2000 to 2020
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier surface albedo is a key parameter of the glacier mass and energy balance process. Many scholars have used the albedo method to study mass balance for an individual glacier, but less attention has been given to large-area glaciers. Based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrieved glacier surface albedo and in situ mass balance, the correlations between albedo and mass balance are reported. The minimum/mean method (the whole glacier albedo is calculated by averaging the minimum/mean albedo of each grid cell), the MODIS snow albedo products (MxD10A1) and the MCD43A3 shortwave albedo were tested during the melt season (June-August) for four glaciers in the High Mountain Asia (HMA). Results reveal that albedo is well correlated with mass balance, the correlation (r) ranging from 0.41 to 0.90. Overall, the minimum method is better than the mean method, and MxD10A1 is better than MCD43A3. The albedo changes were calculated based on the MxD10A1 and the mean method, and a linear relationship is established between albedo changes and digital elevation models (DEMs) calculated mass balance from 2000 to 2016. A strong linear correlation (r = .9) is found between albedo changes and mass balance while excluding some areas that have insignificant seasonal variation in albedo, and the reconstructed albedo-mass balance relationship can be used to retrieve mass balance in large-scale glaciers. Furthermore, the average loss of mass from 2000 to 2020 is calculated as -0.225 +/- 0.040 m w.e.a(-1). The greatest glacier mass loss is concentrated in the southeastern part of HMA, the mass loss in the north and west is less than that in the southeast, and the glacier mass is in a state of aggravated loss in recent years. Our study also offers a new method for estimating the large-scale glacier mass balance.

TI  - Quantifying mangrove canopy regrowth and recovery after Hurricane Irma with large-scale repeat airborne lidar in the Florida Everglades
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Hurricane Irma caused significant damages to mangrove forested wetlands in south Florida, including defoliation, tree snapping, and uprooting. Previous studies have used optical satellite imagery to estimate large-scale forest disturbance and resilience patterns. However, satellite images alone cannot provide measurements of vertical mangrove structure. In this study, we used dense point cloud data collected by NASA Goddard's LiDAR, Hyperspectral, and Thermal (G-LiHT) airborne imager before (March 2017) and after (December 2017 and March 2020) Hurricane Irma to quantify the recovery, or lack thereof, of the three-dimensional (3D) mangrove forest structure. Recent resilience and vulnerability models developed from Landsat time series following the storm were used to group the lidar data into distinct disturbance-recovery classes. We then analyzed lidar-based forest canopy within each of the recovery classes to test a suite of forest structural characteristics. Our results indicate that 77.0 % of the survey area experienced canopy height loss three months after Hurricane Irma, whereby the majority of canopy height loss occurred in areas with the tallest mangrove forests (i.e., 15-25 m tall). Our analysis shows that the mangrove canopy height in South Florida increased by an average 0.26 m from December 2017 to March 2020, with most of the forest (84.7 % of the survey area) experiencing canopy height regrowth. However, only 38.1 % of the survey area has recovered to pre-storm canopy height. The distribution of canopy height was significantly altered by Hurricane Irma in the low and intermediate resilience classes, but were not significantly different 2.5 years later. Indeed, in areas of low resilience, little to no vertical change has occurred suggesting the absence of canopy regrowth and natural regeneration. Conversely, mangroves in high resilience class, which are dominated by shorter canopies (<5 m), were not heavily damaged by the storm and have maintained the same structural attributes as those before Hurricane Irma. Our findings highlight that hurricane disturbances significantly alter mangrove forest canopy structure, but recovery of vertical structure varies by resilience classes, species composition, and canopy height.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective This study aimed to determine incidences of potentially life-threatening conditions (PLTC), maternal near misses (MNM), and maternal deaths (MD) in women who gave birth in participating facilities, and to determine the probability that a pregnancy involving a PLTC would evolve into an MNM and/or an MD. Methods This was a multicentric observational study implemented on a maternal network from August 2018 to May 2019 in five Latin-American countries. We summarized categorical variables as frequencies and continuous variables with median, interquartile range, and standard deviations. Positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated and multivariate predictive models were built. Results There were 33 901 deliveries and miscarriages, of which 8.0% had at least one PLTC and 0.6% had an MNM. Hypertensive disorder was the most frequent condition to evolve into a severe maternal outcome. Conclusion Identifying PLTC can help to prevent MNM and MD. The inclusion of these predictors in a real-time data registration system like the Perinatal Informatic System could work as a surveillance tool for early detection, leading to a reduction in the rate of worsening conditions.

TI  - Phosphorylcholine-conjugated gold-molecular clusters improve signal for Lymph Node NIR-II fluorescence imaging in pre-clinical cancer models
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node imaging and biopsy is important to clinical assessment of cancer metastasis, and novel non-radioactive lymphographic tracers have been actively pursued over the years. Here, we develop gold molecular clusters (Au-25) functionalized by phosphorylcholine (PC) ligands for NIR-II (1000-3000 nm) fluorescence imaging of draining lymph nodes in 4T1 murine breast cancer and CT26 colon cancer tumor mouse models. The Au-phosphorylcholine (Au-PC) probes exhibit 'super-stealth' behavior with little interactions with serum proteins, cells and tissues in vivo, which differs from the indocyanine green (ICG) dye. Subcutaneous injection of Au-PC allows lymph node mapping by NIR-II fluorescence imaging at an optimal time of similar to 0.5 - 1 hour postinjection followed by rapid renal clearance. Preclinical NIR-II fluorescence LN imaging with Au-PC affords high signal to background ratios and high safety and biocompatibility, promising for future clinical translation.

TI  - Evaluation of a Linear Inversion Method for retrieval of directional wave spectra from SAR look cross spectra
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The feasibility of a Linear Inversion Method applied to Synthetic Aperture Radar cross spectra to retrieve wave directional spectra is investigated. The proposed method is computationally efficient and does not require any a priori information from wave or atmospheric models, as is usually the case with other approaches. It is also comparatively less sensitive to low signal-to-noise ratio image spectra, which in general hinders the disambig-uation of the retrieved directional wave spectrum. Several test cases were computed employing a simulator of complex SAR image spectra considering a broad range of values of steepness for the Envisat and Sentinel-1 satellite configurations. The results of the simulated cases were employed as lookup tables to correct biases while retrieving directional wave spectra from Level 1 cross spectra. As the nonlinearities, not accounted for when applying a linear inversion, are dependent on satellite configuration and on the relative position of the peak wave spectrum in relation to the azimuth cut-off, it is possible to quantify them through numerical sim-ulations. The SAR wave spectra retrieved with the Linear Inversion Method from an Envisat ground track were evaluated against the ECMWF reanalysis ERA5 and compared to the results of ESA Level 2 WVW wave mode spectra. The SAR-inverted wave spectra, retrieved with both methods, presented similar results in terms of root -mean-square error (RMSE) and scatter index (SI) for significant wave height, peak wavelength and peak prop-agation direction. Specifically for significant wave height, the Linear Inversion Method yielded a bias of-0.14 m, a SI of 0.34 and a RMSE of 0.44 m for a segment of ground track over the Pacific Ocean employed in our val-idations. The directional wave spectra retrieved with the Linear Inversion Method presented better similarity with the ERA5 spectra, in comparison with the WVW spectra. Moreover, in around one third of the cases, the ESA method did not resolve the directional ambiguity. The preliminary results employing the Linear Inversion Method are encouraging, specially considering its simplicity and performance against the ESA distributed wave spectra.

TI  - Does city-water layout matter? Comparing the cooling effects of water bodies across 34 Chinese megacities
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As most cities are located around or near waterbodies, it is essential to assess the thermal effect of these waterbodies. This research focuses on 34 Chinese megacities as case studies to examine the spatial relationship between city-water layout and the thermal effect of waterbodies. Landsat-8 remote-sensing images acquired around noontime in summer were used to retrieve land surface temperatures (LST) and classify land cover. The results show that there are three types of city-water layout. For most cities, waterbodies have a cooling effect, and their mean cooling distance (Delta Lmax) ranges from 431 m to 1350 m, with the maximum temperature dif-ference (Delta Tmax) ranging from -2.21 degrees C to 7.83 degrees C. The cooling effect of waterbodies is also influenced by their spatial distribution, size, location, and background climate regions. The larger the percentage or area of waterbodies in a city, the shorter Delta Lmax and the bigger Delta Tmax. Waterbodies have the longest Delta Lmax and the smallest Delta Tmax when they are dispersed within the city, whereas they have the shortest Delta Lmax and the largest Delta Tmax when they are flowing through the city. The results suggest that the thermal effects of waterbodies should be seriously considered by urban planners to improve the urban microclimate.

TI  - Efficient agricultural disaster financing using satellite data and artificial intelligence*
T2  - COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating the consequences of smallholder economic growth amid the agricultural emergency is essential. In this paper, we evaluate the agricultural promotion of inclusive financing during the disaster using satellite data. We use inclusive finance to improve the income of small farmers during agricultural disasters, improve satellite remote sensing data analysis algorithms through neural networks, and combine satellite data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to process data during agricultural disasters. Additionally, we construct an application system for inclusive finance of small farmers in agricultural disasters based on satellite data and AI. The proposed study verifies the effect of the application system for inclusive finance of small farmers based on satellite data and AI in agricultural disasters. The study's findings indicate that an inclusive finance system for small farmers in agricultural disasters based on satellite data and AI has a role in boosting smallholder economic development during the crisis.

TI  - Estimating canopy-scale chlorophyll content in apple orchards using a 3D radiative transfer model and UAV multispectral imagery
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll content is a key trait for understanding the functioning of agroforestry ecosystems and has important implications for leaf and canopy photosynthesis. However, fine-scale monitoring of canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) of individual fruit trees is rather challenging. This study aims to use a 3D radiative transfer model (RTM) and proposes a joint inversion model based on prior knowledge to estimate the CCC of individual tree crowns (ITCs) in apple orchards. The widely recognized 3D RTM LESS (large-scale remote sensing data and image simulation framework over heterogeneous 3D scenes) was adopted for large-scale apple orchard 3D scenes radiative transfer computing and image simulation. LESS was first evaluated with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery and the results showed that it reasonably characterized the reflectance of apple tree canopies (RMSE=0.02). An original look-up table (LUT) with reflectance was then produced using LESS, and the final vegetation indices LUT (VI LUT) including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Chlo- rophyll Index (CIgreen), Red edge Chlorophyll Index (CIred edge) and Green NDVI (GNDVI) was generated from the original LUT form VI interpolation. A physically-based joint inversion model coupling prior knowledge of leaf pigments and leaf area index (LAI) was developed to estimate the CCC of ITCs from high-resolution UAV images. The solution first used linear interpolation to produce a weighted VI LUT corresponding to the sample based on estimated LAI. Linear interpolation was then adopted to screen multiple combinations of leaf chlorophylla+b (Cab) and leaf carotenoids (Cxc) contents from the VI LUT. A prior relationship between Cab and Cxc was finally used to regularize the constraints on multiple VI combinations and determine the estimation of Cab and CCC. The joint inversion model demonstrated an accurate estimation of CCC of ITCs. The model driven by GNDVI yielded the highest result for CCC estimation (R2=0.84, RMSE=24.12 mu g/cm2). In addition, CIgreen (R2=0.82, RMSE=32.22 mu g/cm2) and CIred edge (R2=0.81, RMSE=34.05 mu g/cm2) also achieved satisfactory results. The proposed model facilitates CCC estimation of ITCs from high-resolution imagery in heterogeneous orchard canopies, which is important for advancing the precise nutrition management of fruit trees.

TI  - Mapping snow depth and spatial variability using SFM photogrammetry of UAV images over rugged mountainous regions of the Western Himalaya
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate snow depth observations are one of the most important inputs in the process of avalanche hazard estimation, forecasting, and mitigation. This study presents the high-resolution snow depth mapping of avalanche-prone regions of the Manali-Dhundi area, Himachal Pradesh (HP), India, using, repeated UAV Photogrammetric surveys. The images captured by an RGB camera mounted on a fixed-wing UAV (e-Bee X) were used to generate the high-resolution Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Orthophotos of the study area. Mapping of snow depth of the study area is crucial for avalanche hazard assessment and safe movement of the personnel and vehicles passing through the highways in this area during winters. A total of 12 km(2) area covering six major avalanche sites was surveyed. A snow depth map was generated by differencing co-registered snow-covered DSM and bare surface DSM. UAV-derived snow depth values have been validated with the point snow depth measurements of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), manual observation station, and snow depth around a structure of known height in the survey area. The UAV-retrieved snow depth values were found in good correlation with field-measured snow depth (R = 0.95). The maximum and minimum observed snow depth values at different locations on open slopes and flat areas were 1.62 m and 0.79 m. The estimated Mean Error (ME) and RMSE based on these measured values were found 0.15 and 0.21 m, respectively. The study reveals that the snow depth map generated from the UAV survey provides reliable estimates of snow depth values for flat areas and open slopes but the method is not suitable for forested areas. The study also infers that the statistical measures (i.e., mu, sigma, RMSE, etc.) derived from the complete survey dataset without considering topographic factors and features of the region will not provide realistic estimates of snow depth and its accuracy. The study suggests that regular monitoring (before and after every snow storm) of the snow depth using a UAV-based method is quick, cost-effective, and provides accurate snow conditions for operational use and planning in snow-bound regions.

TI  - PRISI: A novel piecewise radar impervious surface index for urban monitoring using Sentinel-1 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The impervious surface (IS) is an important symbol of the urban ecological environment and urbanization process. An accurate, simple, and effective IS extraction method is crucial to environmental and social-economic research. The widely used optical data are frequently disturbed by cloud cover in low latitude and humid areas, bringing great difficulties to remote sensing monitoring of IS. Thus, it is necessary to fully explore the capability of IS extraction relying on SAR data sources alone. However, due to the diversity of IS materials and low spectral consistency, IS extraction in an accurate manner using the backscatter characteristics remains to be challenging. Therefore, we innovatively analyze the complementary effect between backscatter and interferometric coherence from the perspective of IS heterogeneity. Further, we propose a Sentinel-1-based Piecewise Radar Impervious Surface Index (PRISI) that takes into account both the high scattering characteristics and the physical stability of IS. We demonstrate that the proposed adaptive index PRISI-A based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), LogGaussian mixture model (LGMM) and Expectation maximum (EM) algorithm leads to superior performance. Moreover, we provide a non-adaptive index PRISI-D, which adopts empirical parameter settings from trial and error. The computational-friendly PRISI-D yields comparable results compared to PRISI-A. The experimental results show that the IS extraction overall accuracy of PRISI-D and PRISI-A achieve 87.50 % and 88.11 %, which consistently outperform the previous optical indexes by 6.2-11.7 % and the existing radar indexes by 5.2-21.4 % on average. The results reveal that PRISI owns robust regional universality and seasonal suitability, which significantly improves the capability of IS extraction relying on SAR data sources alone.

TI  - An existential perspective on interpersonal closeness and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY & HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Objective The terror management health model proposes that COVID-19's association with death should increase a desire for closeness, which could undermine social distancing intentions. Alternatively, social distancing intentions may increase if it has become culturally valued. The present research assessed these claims. Design We conducted three pre-registered online experiments (N = 409) where we manipulated COVID-19 thoughts, and examined either proximal (i.e. immediate) or distal (i.e. delayed) reactions. Main outcome measures Death-thought accessibility, desire for closeness, social distancing intentions, and measures concerning the perceived cultural value of social distancing. Results COVID-19 thoughts increased death-thought accessibility (Study 1). COVID-19-induced death thoughts increased a distal desire for closeness, particularly in securely attached individuals, but also increased the perceived value of, and intentions to engage in, social distancing (Studies 2 and 3). Conclusion Our findings demonstrate how proximal strategies may progress to distal strategies when they become embedded within cultural worldviews. These findings can aid in sustained efforts to encourage social distancing behavior.

TI  - Determination of foliar traits in an ecologically distinct conifer species in Maine using Sentinel-2 imagery and site variables: Assessing the effect of leaf trait expression and upscaling approach on prediction accuracy
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf traits are expressed either as area-based content (g m-2) or mass-based concentration (mg/g or %) and subsequently scaled to canopy level using leaf area index (LAI) and foliage biomass, respectively. Despite their wide use, it remains unclear whether the two trait expressions and scaling options (by LAI or foliage biomass) yield the same prediction accuracy using multispectral remote sensing data and additional site variables. In this study, we used LAI (m2 m-2) and foliage biomass (kg) to upscale area-based content [leaf mass per area (LMA), equivalent water thickness (EWT), nitrogen (Narea) and potassium (Karea)] and mass-based concentration [leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf water content (LWC), Nmass, and Kmass)], respectively in two contrasting study sites (coastal vs inland) for an ecologically important yet distinct regional species (red spruce, Picea rubens Sarg.) in Maine, USA. We used partial least squares regression (PLSR) and random forest (RF) to examine the effect of these metrics on model performance and prediction accuracy at both leaf-and canopy-scales using Sentinel-2 satellite bands, vegetation indices, as well as several topographical variables and depth to water table (DWT). The best-performing models (based on cross-validated normalized root mean square error: nRMSE) were used to generate high-resolution canopy trait maps. Results demonstrated that prediction accuracies of area-based leaf traits were generally higher (R2 = 0.41-0.65, nRMSE = 0.14-0.20) than the mass-based concentration (R2 = 0.42-0.65, nRMSE = 0.15-0.25) for both sites and modelling techniques. We also observed that canopy traits upscaled by LAI yield better prediction accuracies (R2 = 0.44-0.70, nRMSE = 0.17-0.20) compared to a foliage biomass upscaling approach (R2 = 0.41-0.57, nRMSE = 0.19-0.24). Among site variables, DWT was a significant variable in modeling canopy traits and showed robust behavior across the contrasting study sites. Overall, our study highlights the importance of trait expression and how it affects foliar trait retrieval accuracy at both leaf -and canopy-scale using satellite multispectral data and site variables. These findings have implications on leaf trait modelling especially in the context of monitoring dynamics in forest health and productivity from space.

TI  - A 10 m resolution urban green space map for major Latin American cities from Sentinel-2 remote sensing images and OpenStreetMap
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Mapping is fundamental to studies on urban green space (UGS). Despite a growing archive of land cover maps (where UGS is included) at global and regional scales, mapping efforts dedicated to UGS are still limited. As UGS is often a part of the heterogenous urban landscape, low-resolution land cover maps from remote sensing images tend to confuse UGS with other land covers. Here we produced the first 10 m resolution UGS map for the main urban clusters across 371 major Latin American cities as of 2017. Our approach applied a supervised classification of Sentinel-2 satellite images and UGS samples derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM). The overall accuracy of this UGS map in 11 randomly selected cities was 0.87. We further improved mapping quality through a visual inspection and additional quality control of the samples. The resulting UGS map enables studies to measure area, spatial configuration, and human exposures to UGS, facilitating studies on the relationship between UGS and human exposures to environmental hazards, public health outcomes, urban ecology, and urban planning.

TI  - Contrast-enhanced lymphatic US can improve the preoperative diagnostic performance for sentinel lymph nodes in early breast cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To evaluate the preoperative diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced lymphatic ultrasound (CEUS) for the sentinel lymph node (SLN) status in early breast cancer. Materials and methods We prospectively recruited 102 consecutive patients with clinically node-negative early breast cancer from July 2021 to October 2021. All patients underwent conventional US and percutaneous CEUS examinations. The CEUS of SLNs were classified into four enhancement patterns: homogeneous (I), featured inhomogeneous (II), focal defect (III), and no enhancement (IV). The diagnostic performance of conventional US and CEUS for SLN metastasis was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and decision curves. Results A total of 78 women were enrolled in this study, including 55, 18, and 5 patients with negative axilla, 1-2, and >= 3 metastastic SLNs pathologically, respectively. The identification rate of SLNs by CEUS was 100%. Patterns I and II can select 91.7% (44/48) of patients with disease-free axilla, while patterns III and IV had higher percentages of metastasis (65.2%, p < 0.001 and 57.1%, p < 0.002, respectively). For the SLN metastatic burden, 100% (48/48) of patients with pattern I/II had <= 2 metastatic SLNs. Compared with conventional US, the CEUS enhancement patterns showed significant improvement in diagnosing metastatic SLNs (0.813 vs 0.601, p < 0.001). CEUS had greater clinical benefits and correctly reclassified 48% of metastatic SLNs (p < 0.001) without sacrificing the classification accuracy of negative SLNs (p = 0.25), and could improve prediction accuracy by 0.42 (p < 0.001). Conclusions CEUS demonstrated better diagnostic performance and greater clinical benefits than conventional US for the preoperative diagnosis of SLNs, showing its potential to select candidates for precluding axillary surgery in early breast cancer.

TI  - Factors predicting upstaging from clinical N0 to pN2a/N3a in breast cancer patients
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND With sentinel node metastasis in breast cancer (BC) patients, axillary lymph node (ALN) dissection is often omitted from cases with breast-conserving surgery. Omission of lymph node dissection reduces the invasiveness of surgery to the patient, but it also obscures the number of metastases to non-sentinel nodes. The possibility of finding >= 4 lymph nodes (pN2a/pN3a) preoperatively is important given the ramifications for postoperative treatment. AIM To search for clinicopathological factors that predicts upstaging from N0 to pN2a/pN3a. METHODS Patients who were sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive and underwent ALN dissection between September 2007 and August 2018 were selected by retrospective chart review. All patients had BC diagnosed preoperatively as N0 with axillary evaluation by fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography and ultrasound (US) examination. When suspicious FDG accumulation was found in ALN, the presence of metastasis was reevaluated by second US. We examined predictors of upstaging from N0 to pN2a/pN3a. RESULTS Among 135 patients, we identified 1-3 ALNs (pN1) in 113 patients and (3)4 ALNs (pN2a/pN3a) in 22 patients. Multivariate analysis identified the total number of SLN metastasis, the maximal diameter of metastasis in the SLN (SLNDmax), and FDG accumulation of ALN as predictors of upstaging to pN2a/pN3a. CONCLUSION We identified factors involved in upstaging from N0 to pN2a/pN3a. The SLNDmax and number of SLN metastasis are predictors of >= 4 ALNs (pN2a/pN3a) and predictors of metastasis to non-sentinel nodes, which have been reported in the past. Attention should be given to axillary accumulations of FDG, even when faint.

TI  - Monitoring Crops Using Compact Polarimetry and the RADARSAT Constellation Mission
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) can acquire imagery in Compact Polarimetric (CP) mode. With this new mode, and the increased revisit with three satellites, RCM can contribute to operational crop monitoring at national scales. The four Stokes (S-0, S-1, S-2 and S-3) and three m-chi decomposition (surface, double bounce, volume) parameters were used to identify crops (pasture/forage, barley, wheat, canola, flaxseed, peas, lentils) with a Random Forest classifier. The Stokes and m-chi parameters delivered maps of similar accuracies (95% overall accuracy) and were only slightly less accurate than a classification using optical satellite imagery (97%). To understand why Stokes parameters worked well in classifying crops, scattering responses for wheat, canola, lentils and peas were plotted on the Poincare sphere. These responses were interpreted in the context of the degree of polarization and were related to crop phenology. These plots revealed that early and late in the season the polarized component of the scattered wave remained circular. However, in the active season when crop structure was changing, scattered waves became more elliptically polarized. Although the amount of polarized scattering was lower mid-season, the change in ellipticity was helpful in separating crop types.

TI  - Calibrating MERRA-2 PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations with aerosol diagnostics: testing different machine learning approaches in the Eastern Mediterranean
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating ground-level PM2.5 concentrations by satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) does not provide spatially and temporally continuous estimations due to the gaps in the AOD data. In this study, without using satellite-based AOD, spatiotemporally continuous aerosol diagnostic products such as surface mass concentrations of dust, sea salt, black carbon, organic carbon, and sulfate from the Version 2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) were used to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations at 94 air quality monitoring stations for 2016-2019 in the Eastern Mediterranean. The results indicated that the calculated PM2.5 concentrations from the MERRA-2 aerosol diagnostics could not sufficiently capture the spatiotemporal variation of the PM2.5 observations and nearly consistently underestimated the PM2.5 concentrations. Therefore, the non-linear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) was used to estimate the PM2.5 concentrations with the support of the aerosol diagnostics, Angstrom exponent, and meteorological parameters from the MERRA-2 reanalysis. The NARX model provided robust and accurately estimated PM2.5 concentrations by taking advantage of the neural network approach with an R-squared of 0.73, the root means squared error of 10.6 mu g/m(3), the mean absolute error of 6.4 mu g/m(3), and the mean relative error of 15.5%. The seasonal and site-scale performances of the model were also discussed. Autumn had the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.72), whereas spring had the lower accuracy (R-2 = 0.53). Finally, the overall performance of the developed NARX model was also compared with the other two ensemble tree-based models, such as random forest and XGBoost. The NARX model performed better than all the models with reduced estimation errors and gave the best performance with better statistical indicators and minor uncertainties overall. This study proposes a new understanding of the relationship between MERRA-2 aerosol diagnostics and meteorology. This work will also provide more accurate MERRA-2 PM2.5 data with the artificial neural network (ANN)-based calibration over the region for further studies.

TI  - Impact of environmental micropollutants and diet composition on the gut microbiota of wild european eels <i>(Anguilla anguilla)</i>
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In fish, the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in homeostasis and health and is affected by several organic and inorganic environmental contaminants. Amphidromous fish are sentinel species, particularly exposed to these stressors. We used whole metagenome sequencing to characterize the gut microbiome of wild European eels (Anguilla anguilla) at a juvenile stage captured from three sites with contrasted pollution levels in term of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants. The objectives were to identify what parameters could alter the gut microbiome of this catadromous fish and to explore the potential use of microbiota as bioindicators of environment quality.We identified a total of 1079 microbial genera. Overall, gut microbiome was dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Alpha and beta diversity were different amongst sites and could be explained by a reduced number of environmental and biological factors, specifically the relative abundance of fish preys in eels' diet, PCB101, gamma HCH (lindane), transnonachlor and arsenic. Furthermore, we identified a series of indicator taxa with differential abundance between the three sites. Changes in the microbial communities in the gut caused by environmental pollutants were previously undocumented in European eels. Our results indicate that microbiota might represent another route by which pollutants affect the health of these aquatic sentinel organisms.

T2  - MISSIOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - In his plenary talk "The Conversion of the Missionary: A Journey of the Heart," Frank J. Caggiano, Bishop of Bridgeport, identifies ways by which the church can engage in missionary outreach that will help transform the lives of those whom it serves. In a cogent analysis of our post-Christian secularized culture, Caggiano teaches that the worldview characterized by relativism about truth and morality often leads to the pursuit of power, possessions, and pleasure that do not bring fulfillment. In this context, the word "missionary" refers to every baptized disciple of Jesus Christ proclaiming the offer of salvation in Jesus Christ in a spirit of accompaniment. Faith is a lifetime journey of the heart toward Christ as defined by Saint Augustine, in his autobiography: "for Thou hast formed us for Thyself, and our hearts are restless till they find rest in Thee." Caggiano cautions that we cannot be a transformative presence in the world until we ourselves are transformed in Christ, which demands more than an intellectual assent, but a conversion of mind, heart, and will. He identifies the three spiritual qualities for ongoing personal conversion as a willingness to surrender to the Lord and his will each day, to be humble of heart, and to strive to be a joyful person and herald of the good news of the salvation that comes only in Jesus Christ.

TI  - The status of arboreta in South Africa and the taxa they contain
T2  - SOUTHERN FORESTS-A JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Collections of living trees (hereafter arboreta) are important for conservation, research on species selection for forestry, and as sentinel sites for monitoring pests and diseases. Arboreta can also be the source of propagules for biological invasions. Between 2012 and 2022 a survey was undertaken to assess the status of arboreta in South Africa and the taxa present in such sites, the first such assessment since 1986. At least 172 arboreta have existed in South Africa, but 51 of these are no longer present. with the total number of arboreta peaking around 1980 and declining thereafter. Arboreta have been lost mostly because of conversion of sites to other land-uses, but in some cases because the specimens were felled or burnt down and not replaced. Most of the remaining 121 arboreta are on municipal or forestry land. The biggest challenge facing the extant arboreta is the financial burden of maintaining the collections. The extant arboreta house 2 309 taxa from 158 plant families; of these. 128 taxa (occurring variously in 88 arboreta) are listed as Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered or Extinct in the Wild under the 2020 IUCN Red List, and 400 taxa (occurring variously in 113 arboreta) have been listed as invasive somewhere in the world. Biogeographic regions that are relatively well represented include the East African Steppe, Sino-Japanese Region, West African Rainforest, North-Eastern Australia, and the Caribbean, making the arboreta valuable sources of germplasm for taxa from these regions. Arboreta are an important resource for South Africa, but a resource that appears to be shrinking. If the value of current arboreta for conservation, education, and research is to be fulfilled, they need to be formally catalogued, their species lists regularly updated, and measures put in place to ensure their sustainability.

TI  - Spatiotemporal mechanism of urban heat island effects on human health-Evidence from Tianjin city of China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasingly intensifying global warming and urban heat island (UHIs) are seriously damaging the physical and mental health of urban residents. However, the spatiotemporal evolution of how high temperatures affect human health in megacities remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, with Tianjin during 2006-2020 as an example, and based on data from meteorological stations, Landsat remote sensing images, and point of interest big data, this study applied hot- and cold-spot statistics and remote sensing retrieval in numerical modeling and established an appraisal system to assess how and to what extent UHIs affect resident health. The results showed that the overall influence of UHIs on respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and mental health increased to 373 km(2) in area and two levels in intensity; the influence was mainly concentrated in the downtown area, with a rising influence level. Owing to the dual-core structure of the city, the influence was distributed along the main traffic lines in Binhai New District, having a strong influence in the area mainly concentrated in the southeastern part. Many cold spots clustered in the central urban area to cool the thermal environment: the cooled area was 6.5 times larger than the area of intense cooling influence. Our study provides a method for identifying health risks in urban spaces, lays a theoretical foundation to improve the planning of urban green space systems, and offers some decision-making guidance for the planning of healthy cities.

TI  - Beyond pastures, look at plastic: Using Sentinel-2 imagery to map silage bags to improve understanding of cattle intensity
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cattle ranching has increased globally in the last decades, and although pasture expansion is well documented across different regions, there is little understanding of the intensity at which cattle operate in these areas. With freely available Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, we mapped for the first time polyethylene silage bags used for forage conservation in a year with the Random Forest algorithm, and proposed them as a spatial indicator of cattle intensity. For this, we combined monthly silage area with land cover and climatic variables in a regression framework to understand cattle intensity metrics at regional and farm scales throughout 20 million hectares in the Dry Chaco. In addition, we explored the impact of using maize silage supplementation on productive and environmental metrics at the farm scale in a precipitation gradient. We validated our models using a spatially explicit database of cattle distribution. Our results highlight that silage bags are accurate mappable objects with Sentinel-2, which can contribute to the understanding of cattle density, and heifer and steer density in pasture contexts at farm and regional scales. Finally, our whole-farm simulations support the idea that incorporating silage supplementation in cattle ranching regional analyses conducts to significant differences on environmental or productive estimations, which should be considered. The amount of stored forage that is used in supplementation has strong implications for the performance of cattle ranching, but remains difficult to quantify at the regional level with remote sensing. Silage bag mapping is thus an opportunity to improve the overall understanding of livestock intensification and its productive and environmental impacts, particularly in highly seasonal rangelands. Following this metric could be a valuable indicator of the cattle ranching performance in terms of it resilience, production increase and impacts over natural ecosystems (related to Sustainable Development Goal 2-zero hunger and also in the 15-life on land).

TI  - Improving above ground biomass estimates of Southern Africa dryland forests by combining Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Having the ability to make accurate assessments of above ground biomass (AGB) at high spatial resolution is invaluable for the management of dryland forest resources in areas at risk from deforestation, forest degradation pressure and climate change impacts. This study reports on the use of satellite-based synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral imagery for estimating AGB by correlating satellite observations with ground truth data collected on forest plots from dryland forests in the Chobe National Park, Botswana. We undertook nineteen quantitative experiments with Sentinel-1 (S1), and Sentinel-2 (S2) and tested simple and multivariate regression including parametric (linear) and non-parametric (random forests) algorithms, to explore the optimal approaches for AGB estimation. The largest AGB value of 145 Mg/ha was found in northern Chobe while a large part of the study area (85%) is characterized by low AGB values (< 80 Mg/ha), with an average estimated at 51 Mg/ha. The results show that the AGB estimated using SAR backscatter values from vertical transmit receive (VV) polari-zation is more accurate than that based on horizontal receive (VH) polarization, accounting for 58% of the variance compared to 32%. Nevertheless, the combination of S1 SAR and S2 multispectral image data produced the best fit to the ground observations for dryland forests explaining 83% of the variance with an accuracy of 89%. Furthermore, the optimal AGB model performance was achieved with a random forest (RF) regression trees algorithm using S1 (SAR) and S2 (multispectral) image data (R2 = 0.95; RMSE = 0.25 Mg/ha). From the 11 vegetation indices tested, GNDVI, Normalized Difference Red Edge (NDRE1), and NDVI obtained the highest linear relationship with AGB (R2 = 0.71 and R2 = 0.56, p < 0.001), however, GNDVI and NDRE1 improved the AGB estimation at medium to high-density forests compared to NDVI. The GRVI and EVI were the least correlated with AGB (R2 = 0.09 and R2 = 0.31) at a significance level of p < 0.001, respectively. We show that NDVI saturates in areas with >80 Mg/ha AGB, whereas the inclusion of SAR backscatter and optical red edge bands (B5) significantly reduces saturation effects in areas of high biomass. GNDVI and red edge (B5) derived vege-tation indices have more potential for estimating AGB in dryland forests than NDVI. Our results demonstrate that dryland AGB can be estimated with a reasonable level of precision from open access Earth observation data using multivariate random forest regression.

TI  - Remote sensing and field information aid in predicting the presence of the terrestrial orchid <i>Cyclopogon luteo-albus</i>
T2  - NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical montane cloud forest is one of the most threatened ecosystems, in central Veracruz, Mexico. Within this ecosystem, terrestrial orchids are strongly dependent on forest conditions and may be sensitive to environmental change. We applied field surveys of abiotic and biotic factors associated with the presence of the terrestrial orchid Cyclopogon luteo-albus and combined this with correlative niche modeling approaches to evaluate its potential distribution under two different environmental sets and two different extents. Layers of environmental information were obtained from Landsat imagery and interpolated bioclimatic and soil property layers. Existing species records were used as training data by sampling five forest fragments in central Veracruz, utilizing herbarium and global biodiversity information facility databases. The resulting predictions were tested by sampling at 15 sites of potential distribution. The model predicted the presence of C. luteo-albus with a reliability of 80%. The most important variables of models derived from interpolated layers coincide with site-relevant parameters suggesting the utility of these tools to further explore species suitabilities at larger geographic extents. Potential distribution mapping is an important tool to identify key areas for conservation and priority areas for future studies of species and partially resolves the lack of records of many orchid species.

TI  - Disseminated cancer cells detected by immunocytology in lymph nodes of NSCLC patients are highly prognostic and undergo parallel molecular evolution
T2  - JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In melanoma, immunocytology (IC) after sentinel lymph node disaggregation not only enables better quantification of disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) than routine histopathology (HP) but also provides a unique opportunity to detect, isolate, and analyse these earliest harbingers of metachronous metastasis. Here, we explored lymph node IC in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For 122 NSCLC patients, 220 lymph nodes (LNs) were split in half and prepared for IC and HP. When both methods were compared, IC identified 22% positive patients as opposed to 4.5% by HP, revealing a much higher sensitivity of IC (p < 0.001). Assessment of all available 2,952 LNs of the same patients by HP uncovered additional patients escaping detection of lymphatic tumour spread by IC alone, consistent with the concept of skip metastasis. A combined lymph node status of IC and complete HP on a larger cohort of patients outperformed all risk factors in multivariable analysis for prognosis (p < 0.001; RR = 2.290; CI 1.407-3.728). Moreover, isolation of DCCs and single-cell molecular characterization revealed that (1) LN-DCCs differ from primary tumours in terms of copy number alterations and selected mutations and (2) critical alterations are acquired during colony formation within LNs. We conclude that LN-IC in NSCLC patients when combined with HP improves diagnostic precision, has the potential to reduce total workload, and facilitates molecular characterization of lymphatically spread cancer cells, which may become key for the selection and development of novel systemic therapies.

TI  - Water and productivity accounting using WA plus framework for sustainable water resources management: Case study of northwestern Iran
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - An exhaustive evaluation of water resources is a prerequisite for evidence-informed planning and implementing sustainable management strategies. However, the lack of sufficient information on water supply and consump-tion, alongside the technical limitations on comprehensive accounting for inter-relations and interactions be-tween the subsystems, has resulted in decisions with often long-lasting outcomes and undesirable consequences. Water accounting is a tool for systematic acquisition, analysis, and reporting of water-related information to fill the existing knowledge gap on water flows and fluxes. In this study, Water Accounting Plus (WA+) framework is applied to the western region of Lake Urmia, a dying hyper-saline lake, to assess water use and crop water productivity (CWP) from 2010 to 2016. Remotely sensed information along with a distributed hydrological model (SPHY) is used to fill the information gap on water resources and inform effective policy actions. Our analysis reveals that the agricultural sector is neither productive nor efficient while there is a considerable scope to ameliorate water productivity and beneficial water use by adopting proper water management practices. Average CWP values for wheat, sugarbeet, vineyard, and apple vary between 0.38 and 0.55, 5.1-5.6, 1.5-1.7 and 1.9-2.3 (kg/m3), respectively while storage changes show consistent depletion, especially during dry year, up to 117 MCM. The results indicate that a 40% reduction in blue water use is achievable to supply additional water to revive Lake Urmia. This study highlights the importance of water accounting and information flow for decision -makers, practitioners, and farming communities to define practical targets and enhance productivity in water -scarce regions.

TI  - Characterizing floods and reviewing flood management strategies for better community resilience in a tropical river basin, India
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present work intends to assess the nature of floods, trigger factors, impacts, and management in the Bhagirathi River Basin (BRB) using mainly secondary data (Survey of India toposheets, Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Sentinel 2 images, Google Earth Imageries, district gazetteers, and annual floods reports) and techniques of normalized difference water index (NDWI), river network change index (RNCI), sinuosity index (SI), and analysis of the previous documents and reports. The results portray that flood frequency in the BRB was found to be increasing during the last century (1901-2020). However, the nature of the floods spatially varies from the rarh (western part of the Bhagirathi River) to the bagri (eastern part). The floods in the rarh region are mainly controlled by dams and barrages constructed on the western tributaries of the Bhagirathi River, while the Farakka barrage and ill-drained decaying distributaries are responsible for the floods in the bagri region. Moreover, two types of the flood were observed in the study area: (1) monsoon flood induced by heavy monsoon rainfall during June-September and (2) lean period inundation caused by the controlled discharge from the Farakka Barrage Project during January-May as per the Indo-Bangladesh water-sharing treaty (1977). Though the monsoon floods wreak havoc on the agricultural and household resources almost every year, the lean period inundation only affects the agricultural lands along the banks of the Bhagirathi River, especially in the community development (CD) blocks Raghunathganj II, Lalgola, and its adjacent areas. During the last century (1900-2020), the year 2000 recorded a colossal flood when 11 CD blocks in Murshidabad and 16 CD blocks in Nadia districts became inundated. To manage the floods, a few structural measures like embankments along the banks of the Bhagirathi River and storage of water in dam reservoirs have been implemented. However, due to the loss of the live capacity of reservoirs caused by the entrapping of suspended sediments, flood management faced challenges. Thus, 'controlling flood' becomes difficult in this region, and 'living with flood' may be an alternative approach.

TI  - Performance of Sentinel-1 and 2 imagery in detecting aquaculture waterbodies in Bangladesh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral data to detect aquaculture waterbodies in Southern Bangladesh to quantify fish production on a national scale. For this purpose, we developed an object-based framework comprised of three sequential stages: 1) water detection, 2) feature seg-mentation, and 3) feature classification. Techniques such as Edge-Otsu for binary thresholding, edge detection with convolution filters, and various supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods were used as part of a workflow. We found that ensemble products combining individual subproducts resulted in higher overall ac-curacy for water detection (overall detection rate around 60%) and waterbodies classification (overall accuracies up to 79%). Moreover, we showed that SAR data and shape indices played important roles in better -discriminating waterbodies. However, limitations in edge detection outcomes affected the identification of small and isolated aquaculture waterbodies, especially those integrated into rice fields, or in areas with trees.

TI  - The evolution of predator avoidance in cephalopods: A case of brain over brawn?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Predation is a major evolutionary driver of animal adaptation. However, understanding of anti-predator evolution is biased toward vertebrate taxa. Cephalopoda, a class in the invertebrate phylum Mollusca, are known for their diverse anti-predator strategies, characterised by their behavioural flexibility. While ancestral cephalopods were protected by a hard outer shell, extant cephalopods have greatly reduced their reliance on physical defences. Instead, cephalopods have evolved highly developed senses to identify potential threats, cryptic skin patterns to avoid detection, startle responses to deter attack, and elaborate means of escape. While cephalopod anti-predator repertoires are relatively well described, their evolution, and the selective pressures that shaped them, have received much less attention. This is despite their potential relevance, in turn, to elucidate evolution of the remarkable cognitive abilities of cephalopods. Here, we review cephalopod anti-predator evolution, considering four key aspects: (i) shell reduction and loss; (ii) the skin patterning system; (iii) the ecological context accompanying the evolution of advanced cognitive abilities; (iv) why the evolutionary trajectory taken by cephalopods is so unique among invertebrates. In doing so, we consider the unique physiology of cephalopods and discuss how this may have constrained or aided the development of their anti-predator repertoire. In particular, cephalopods are poorly equipped to defend themselves physically and escape predation by fish, due to a lack of comparable weaponry or musculature. We argue that this may have selected for alternative forms of defence, driving an evolutionary trajectory favouring crypsis and complex behaviours, and the promotion of sensory and cognitive adaptations. Unravelling the complexities of cephalopod anti-predator evolution remains challenging. However, recent technological developments available for cephalopod field and laboratory studies, coupled with new genomic data and analysis approaches, offer great scope to generate novel insights.

TI  - Identification of active deformation zone associated with the 28th April 2021 Assam earthquake (Mw 6.4) using the PSInSAR time series
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The co-seismic deformation of the 28th April 2021 Assam earthquake with a magnitude of 6.4 has been investigated using the Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR). The results obtained from the PSInSAR are validated with the results of the Global Positioning System (GPS). It is observed that the coseismic deformation of the earthquake is not visible because of the atmospheric noise. Therefore, we used the Sentinel-1 time-series data of the area to minimize the atmospheric noise effect the data using the Atmospheric Phase Screening (APS) processing of Sentinel-1 time series data. The time-series analysis shows minor changes that occurred during the earthquake. Firstly, the detection of coherence-based changes was carried out to identify the most affected areas, caused by the earthquake. The results of time series analysis suggest that the region located to the north of the Brahmaputra River is subsiding at a much faster rate (-25 to -75 mm/y) than its southern counterpart, where the southern part is subsiding with an average velocity of -0.1 to -15 mm/y. The subsided locations identified using the PSInSAR are further confirmed by the presence of liquefaction features, ground cracks, and tilted buildings related to post-liquefaction ground settlement. To see the deformation along the Bomdila Fault (BF), re-analysis of the available GPS results has been carried out and the derived results reveal a significant amount of deformation (similar to 4 mm/y) associated with BF and Jorhat Fault (JF); whereas the deformation associated with Kopili Fault (KF) is 3.14 mm/y. Further, our results suggest the presence of compressional strain in the BF zone, while extensional strain in the KF zone. The earthquake focal mechanism analysis suggests that the event of the April 2021 was primarily associated with the BF rather than the KF.

M3  - Article
AB  - Bacterial antibiotic resistance (AMR) is a significant threat to public health, with the sentinel 'ESKAPEE' pathogens, being of particular concern. A cohort study spanning 5.5 years (2016-2021) was conducted at a provincial general hospital in Crete, Greece, to describe the epidemiology of ESKAPEE-associated bacteraemia regarding levels of AMR and their impact on patient outcomes. In total, 239 bloodstream isolates were examined from 226 patients (0.7% of 32 996 admissions) with a median age of 75 years, 28% of whom had severe comorbidity and 46% with prior stay in ICU. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was lowest for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30%) and Escherichia coli (33%), and highest among Acinetobacter baumannii (97%); the latter included 8 (22%) with extensive drug-resistance (XDR), half of which were resistant to all antibiotics tested. MDR bacteraemia was more likely to be healthcare-associated than community-onset (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.04-2.65). Inpatient mortality was 22%, 35% and 63% for non-MDR, MDR and XDR episodes, respectively (P = 0.004). Competing risks survival analysis revealed increasing mortality linked to longer hospitalisation with increasing AMR levels, as well as differential pathogen-specific effects. A. baumannii bacteraemia was the most fatal (14-day death hazard ratio 3.39, 95% CI 1.74-6.63). Differences in microbiology, AMR profile and associated mortality compared to national and international data emphasise the importance of similar investigations of local epidemiology.

TI  - Case report: Evaluation of myocardial microcirculation in patients with breast cancer after anthracycline chemotherapy by using intravoxel incoherent motion imaging
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionAnthracycline chemotherapy drugs can produce cardiotoxicity in patients with breast cancer, leading to myocardial cell death and fibrosis, further developing into cardiac failure. However, the condition of myocardial microcirculation was unknown in breast cancer after anthracycline chemotherapy. As a result, intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging was used to non-invasively observe the condition of myocardial microcirculation in a patient with breast cancer after anthracycline chemotherapy. Case reportA 43-year-old female patient with a right breast lump was reported. Preoperative ultrasound-guided needle biopsy showed invasive carcinoma of the right breast with fibroadenoma. Sentinel lymph node biopsy combined with simplified radical surgery for right breast cancer was performed. Postoperative pathological findings reported breast cancer (pT2N2M0 IIIA). The patient underwent eight sessions of the EC-TH chemotherapy scheme, and the EC and the TH schemes were adopted for the first four sessions and the last four sessions, respectively. During chemotherapy, during which there was the occurrence of Grade II myelosuppression, chest CT and abdomen CT showed no metastasis, and ECG and cardiac ultrasound reports returned to normal. Cardiac cine magnetic resonance and IVIM imaging were performed at the beginning of the first chemotherapy session (baseline) and after the third, fifth, and eighth chemotherapy sessions, respectively. We found that the fast apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC(fast)) and f parameters appeared to show a downward trend from the baseline to the fifth chemotherapy session, where the IVIMfast values declined from 163 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s to 148 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s and finally to 134 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s and f values declined from 45% to 36% and then to 30%, respectively. ADC(fast) and f values showed an inclination from the fifth and eighth chemotherapy sessions. ConclusionOur case report showed that IVIM technology can likely detect non-invasive myocardial microcirculation early and quantitatively after anthracycline chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. That is, IVIM technology seems to be helpful for cardiovascular risk monitoring and prognosis assessment of myocardial microcirculation in patients with breast cancer after anthracycline chemotherapy.

TI  - Mapping Mediterranean maquis formations using Sentinel-2 time-series
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Maquis, which provides numerous ecosystem services and constitutes an integral part of the Mediterranean ecosystem, is highly heterogeneous. However, despite its importance and heterogeneity, maquis is generally mapped as a single class, while forests are mapped for management purposes. Detailed mapping of the maquis formations is necessary to understand their ecology and manage them sustainably. This study presents a method that generates alliance-level maps of the maquis ecosystems through satellite images using various machine learning techniques with different feature combinations and evaluates the proposed approach in the Mediter-ranean region of Southern Turkey, which has an area of 95,000 km2. Multi-temporal images extract information from vegetation phenology, while topographic and meteorological data are used to improve the classification. Cross-validation is performed using a ground-truth data set of approximately 7500 polygons. Results show that cost-effective and accurate maquis classification at the alliance level is possible using a combination of envi-ronmental features, multi-spectral, and multi-temporal satellite images. Adding environmental features to remotely sensed classification has improved the accuracy by 18%. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm improves classification accuracy by 7.3% and 14.6% relative to Support Vector Machine and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis algorithms, respectively. With the help of newly introduced features, we have succeeded in mapping 11 alliances with 64.2-82.7% overall accuracy. We believe the proposed classification approach will help improve the mapping of the shrubland ecosystems, which will significantly affect natural resource management, con-servation, and adaptation to climate change.

TI  - Evaluating the land cover dynamics in the protected areas using GIS and remote sensing techniques: the case of Nyerere National Park, Tanzania
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding land cover dynamics of protected areas is one area of active research and several studies have been done in this direction. However, such studies are limited with few parameters and lack a long-range spatial-temporal analysis to effectively understand land cover dynamics and thereby helping countries manage their protected areas sustainably. This research used Nyerere National Park (NNP) to explore its land cover dynamics from 1991 to 2021 and projected to 2050, vegetation health from 2000 to 2021 and surrounding human population from 1988 to 2021. The park's land cover of 1991 and 2021 was explored using a smileCart classifier after training 897 samples of water, bareland, grassland, bushland and forest from the Landsat imagery. Its 2050 land cover was simulated using CA-Markov model. The park's vegetation health was studied using NDVI and EVI from the Landsat and MODIS imagery. Land cover classes with significant changes are forest and grassland. The forest areas showed a decreasing trend from 62%-to-52%-to-41% from 1991-to-2021-to-2050, while the grassland areas showed an increasing trend from 9%-to-17%-to-24%. The maximum NDVI values from the Landsat imagery showed a minimal decrease from 0.76 in 1991 to 0.75 in 2021. Many park's areas have weak vegetation based on the overall NDVI and EVI results. The study also identified rapid increase in human population around the park, and agricultural activities taking place in some of its areas. The results of this study provide a new reference to NNP and other studies in all other protected areas.

TI  - Digital and Geographical Feature Detection by Machine Learning Techniques Using Google Earth Engine for CPEC Traffic Management
T2  - WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The center of human settlements is in the cities, which must have high-quality habitats for their inhabitants. Many megachallenges of urbanization, population development, global advancement, environmental destruction, traffic management, and climate change must be addressed. This study is aimed at understanding how to maintain balanced land development in rapidly urbanizing towns to solve this challenge and mobility issues. Climate and weather forecasts, land cover, environmental indices, nonoptical and optical wavelengths, water history, and air quality are only some of the datasets available on Google Earth Engine, a publicly usable data repository. Machine learning techniques, i.e., random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and classification and regression tree (CART), are used to monitor spatial-temporal change regarding water, vegetation, and urbanization for Pakistan from 2013 to 2021 using Landsat 8. The detection of urban land suitability concerning multiple metrics such as ecological response variables, environmental tension, socio-economic development potential, and natural resource potential is also found. Dataset features were classified as bands in the Google Earth Engine. Moreover, for 2020 and 2021, classification results showing the change in water, vegetation, and urbanization are also represented concerning China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) highway and the railway track to monitor and control traffic and its management.

TI  - Basic Income and Anishinaabe Worldview: Exploring Tensions and Compatibilities
T2  - BASIC INCOME STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Jurgen De Wispelaere and Lindsay Stirton point out that basic income must be designed in light of the features of the society in which the policy is to be implemented. Yet, in Canada, scholars and politicians have neglected one crucial aspect of the context in which basic income stands to be implemented - namely, a settler-colonial one. In a settler-colonial context, we must consider the compatibility of such a policy proposal with the worldviews of Indigenous peoples who continue to assert, apply, and revitalize their laws on this land. As such, in this paper, I consider the compatibility of a basic income with Anishinaabe worldview and legality. Ultimately, I find that while dominant justifications for basic income are not compatible with Anishinaabe worldview, the implementation of the policy may nonetheless support the urgent imperative of Indigenous law revitalization.

TI  - A regional model to predict the occurrence of natural events: Application to phytoplankton blooms in continental waterbodies
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - There are significant social, economic and environmental costs related to phytoplankton blooms, particularly when they are dominated by cyanobacteria. However, the climatic, physiographic and morphological drivers involved in bloom phenology create complex spatiotemporal patterns in biomass and taxonomic composition, making monitoring and forecasting challenging. This complexity also limits the ability of process-based algorithms to model bloom phenology. Stochastic approaches and predictive modelling are valuable risk management tools for natural events. This paper presents a novel model to estimate the conditional density of phytoplankton blooms based on environmental covariates, namely the physiography and climate descriptors of lake watersheds. The goal was to provide a tool to project future scenarios of bloom phenology in response to climate change and anthropogenic developments, and to test the efficiency of mitigating approaches. Specifically, we developed a non-stationary regional model to estimate the probability of bloom occurrence in 580 lakes in Quebec, Canada, and to study the impact of physiographic or climate changes over our reference period and future horizons. Results show that the regional model is more precise and accurate than local models, which are usually used in frequency analyses of extreme values. Simulations conducted for different climatic and physiographic scenarios on the watershed of Lake Brome indicate a 65% increase in bloom frequency on the horizon of years 2080-2100. The model also evaluates the effects of different environmental disturbances on bloom phenology, such as agriculture or settlement increase in the watershed. Disturbance case studies were carried out on lakes with different trophic levels, physiographic and climatic characteristics. Simulations indicate that bloom frequency in a highly urbanized meso-eutrophic lake (Lake Brome) and a eutrophic lake with a watershed dominated by agriculture (Missisquoi Bay) would be more responsive to changes in climate rather than land cover, although physiographic disturbances would still generate considerable effects. A meso-eutrophic lake with a watershed dominated by forest (Lake Aylmer) would neither respond to increases in agriculture nor settlement but would be most affected by increases in degree days. Another scenario focused on a highly forested oligo-mesotrophic lake (Lake St. Jean). Bloom phenology in this lake was most affected by disturbances in agriculture or settlement land use. Overall, these results suggest that lakes with a high level of eutrophication are the least responsive to the pressures resulting from land cover changes.

TI  - Automated Extraction of Energy Systems Information from Remotely Sensed Data: A Review and Analysis
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - High quality energy systems information is a crucial input to energy systems research, modeling, and decision-making. Unfortunately, actionable information about energy systems is often of limited availability, incomplete, or only accessible for a substantial fee or through a non-disclosure agreement. Recently, remotely sensed data (e.g., satellite imagery, aerial photography) have emerged as a potentially rich source of energy systems information. However, the use of these data is frequently challenged by its sheer volume and complexity, precluding manual analysis. Recent breakthroughs in machine learning have enabled automated and rapid extraction of useful information from remotely sensed data, facilitating large-scale acquisition of critical energy system variables. Here we present a systematic review of the literature on this emerging topic, providing an in-depth survey and review of papers published within the past two decades. We first taxonomize the existing literature into ten major areas, spanning the energy value chain. Within each research area, we distill and critically discuss major features that are relevant to energy researchers, including, for example, key challenges regarding the accessibility and reliability of the methods. We then synthesize our findings to identify limitations and trends in the literature as a whole, and discuss opportunities for innovation. These include the opportunity to extend the methods beyond electricity to broader energy systems and wider geographic areas; and the ability to expand the use of these methods in research and decision making as satellite data become cheaper and easier to access. We also find that there are persistent challenges: limited standardization and rigor of performance assessments; limited sharing of code, which would improve replicability; and a limited consideration of the ethics and privacy of data.

TI  - Patient characteristics, pain treatment patterns, and incidence of total joint replacement in a US population with osteoarthritis
T2  - BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Currently available medications for chronic osteoarthritis pain are only moderately effective, and their use is limited in many patients because of serious adverse effects and contraindications. The primary surgical option for osteoarthritis is total joint replacement (TJR). The objectives of this study were to describe the treatment history of patients with osteoarthritis receiving prescription pain medications and/or intra-articular corticosteroid injections, and to estimate the incidence of TJR in these patients. Methods This retrospective, multicenter, cohort study utilized health plan administrative claims data (January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2019) of adult patients with osteoarthritis in the Innovation in Medical Evidence Development and Surveillance Distributed Database, a subset of the US FDA Sentinel Distributed Database. Patients were analyzed in two cohorts: those with prevalent use of "any pain medication" (prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], opioids, and/or intra-articular corticosteroid injections) using only the first qualifying dispensing (index date); and those with prevalent use of "each specific pain medication class" with all qualifying treatment episodes identified. Results Among 1 992 670 prevalent users of "any pain medication", pain medications prescribed on the index date were NSAIDs (596 624 [29.9%] patients), opioids (1 161 806 [58.3%]), and intra-articular corticosteroids (323 459 [16.2%]). Further, 92 026 patients received multiple pain medications on the index date, including 71 632 (3.6%) receiving both NSAIDs and opioids. Altogether, 20.6% of patients used an NSAID at any time following an opioid index dispensing and 17.2% used an opioid following an NSAID index dispensing. The TJR incidence rates per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI]) were 3.21 (95% CI: 3.20-3.23) in the "any pain medication" user cohort, and among those receiving "each specific pain medication class" were NSAIDs, 4.63 (95% CI: 4.58-4.67); opioids, 7.45 (95% CI: 7.40-7.49); and intra-articular corticosteroids, 8.05 (95% CI: 7.97-8.13). Conclusions In patients treated with prescription medications for osteoarthritis pain, opioids were more commonly prescribed at index than NSAIDs and intra-articular corticosteroid injections. Of the pain medication classes examined, the incidence of TJR was highest in patients receiving intra-articular corticosteroids and lowest in patients receiving NSAIDs.

TI  - Satellite observed spatiotemporal variability of snow cover and snow phenology over high mountain Asia from 2002 to 2021
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate understanding the spatiotemporal variability of snow cover and snow phenology over High Mountain Asia (HMA) is of great interest because of their vital impacts on the hydrological processes, global climate system and regional water resource management. This study investigates the spatiotemporal variability of snow-covered extent (SCE), snow-covered days (SCD), snow onset date (SOD), snow end date (SED) and snow duration days (SDD) of HMA using the daily cloud-free Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products from the hydrological year 2002 to 2020. The vertical difference of the effect of elevation on snow phenology and the response of snow phenology to climate change are explored. The results indicate that the monthly SCE over the whole HMA exhibited a slight decreasing in most months over the study period. The variability of snow cover and snow phenology over the whole HMA generally showed decreased SCD (significant decrease accounts for 15.73%), delayed SOD (significant delay accounts for 14.35%), advanced SED (significant advance accounts for 15.46%) and shortened SDD (significant shorten accounts for 16.01%). It is worth noting that the snow cover in the West Himalaya was enhancing with its increased SCE, increased SCD and lengthened SDD. There is an elevation dependence of snow phenology changes over HMA with the high-altitude mountain ranges generally having a higher SCD, earlier SOD, later SED and longer SDD than low altitude areas. The air temperature of snow accumulation period is the dominant factor affecting the interannual variation of SOD, and the air temperature of snow melt period is the dominant factor affecting the interannual variation of SED. The increase of air temperature leads to the delayed SOD, advanced SED and shortened SDD.

TI  - Estimation of eggplant yield with machine learning methods using spectral vegetation indices
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of crop yields included in the planning is an essential condition for accurate and timely agricultural planning. Remotely sensed products, such as the spectral vegetation index (VI), are widely used in estimation of crop yields. The integration of remotely sensed data into machine learning methods will have the potential to develop a real-time management system specific to the area of interest. The main aim of the study was to determine the eggplant yield in field conditions, based on VIs obtained from a handheld spectroradiometer, using five different machine learning methods (artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVR), k nearest neighbor (kNN), random forests (RF), and Adaptive boosting (AB)), and compare the performances of the methods. The data used in the study were obtained in field experiments focusing on determining the most suitable irrigation program for eggplant production in a semi-humid climate region in northern Turkey during 2015, 2016 and 2017 growing seasons. Irrigation treatments consisted of a total of five applications, which were full water application (I1:100 %) and different deficit ration of full water application (I2:I1x 75 %, I3: I1x50%, I4: I1x25% and I5: rainfed based). Input variables used in yield estimation models were determined by correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA). The inputs in the models were different combinations of 10 different VIs, the number of days after planting (DAP) and water application coefficients. In addition, an alternative approach was proposed, in which PCA components were used as input for yield estimation. All machine learning models using PCA-based inputs were estimated with higher accuracy than other input combinations. The best results were obtained with the ANN model based on PCA-based inputs; therefore, this model was chosen for eggplant yield estimation (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.973, mean absolute error (MAE) = 274.816 kg ha(-1), root mean square error (RMSE) = 352.787 kg ha(-1) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.951). The lowest accuracy for yield estimation was recorded in RF model. The prediction accuracy of the models using a single VI as input was low. Green index (GI) and green vegetation index (GVI) had the highest impact on eggplant yield, and eggplant yield was estimated with higher accuracy with these indices, which are sensitive to chlorophyll absorption. The findings of the current study demonstrate the benefits of using remotely sensed data and PCA together in machine learning models to more reliably and accurately estimate eggplant yield at regional scale.

TI  - Temporal and spatial effects of large airport construction and operation on the local thermal environment
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - New construction has resulted in impervious surfaces increasingly replacing natural landscapes, altering surface radiation, thermal properties, and humidity in urban areas. Based on Landsat-8 data, the temporal and spatial impacts of the construction of Dalian Jinzhouwan Airport and Beijing Daxing Airport on the thermal environment were studied. The local thermal gradient (LTG) of the airport before and after construction is compared. The results showed that after the completion of the airport, the LTG value of Daxing Airport increased by 0.033 and that of Jinzhou Bay Airport increased by 0.009. After the airport operation, LTG values increase again. Daxing Airport added another 0.053, and Jinzhou Bay Airport added another 0.127. Two land classification models (land use type, LUT; local climate zone, LCZ) were used to explore the relationship between land use type and LTG. The results show that the increase of alloy buildings after the completion of the airport has a great influence on the thermal environment of the two study areas. The operation of airports will further enhance this effect. Our study can provide a reference for the influence of large-scale traffic construction on the urban thermal environment.

T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral indices based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral images combined with machine learning algorithms can more effectively assess chlorophyll content in plants, which plays a crucial role in plant nutrition diagnosis, yield estimation and a better understanding of plant and environment interactions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to use UAV-based spectral indices deriving from UAV-based multispectral images as inputs in different machine learning models to predict canopy chlorophyll content of potato crops. The relative chlorophyll content was obtained using a SPAD chlorophyll meter. Random Forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), partial least squares regression (PLSR) and ridge regression (RR) were employed to predict the chlorophyll content. The results showed that RF model was the best performing algorithm with an R-2 of 0.76, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.97. Both RF and SVR models showed much better accuracy than PLSR and RR models. This study suggests that the best models, RF model, allow to map the spatial variation in chlorophyll content of plant canopy using the UAV multispectral images at different growth stages.

TI  - Exploring coordinated development between urbanization and ecosystem services value of sustainable demonstration area in China- take Guizhou Province as an example
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the first ecological civilization demonstration areas in China, Guizhou Province, an underdeveloped region, experienced rapid economic development. The resulting human activities at an accelerated rate in Guizhou Province put great pressure on its environmental carrying capacity, especially the Karst landscape in the region. Understanding the relationship between urbanization and ecosystem services in Guizhou Province is indispensable for the sustainable development of the region in the future. Based on remote sensing data from 1990 to 2020, this study explores the spatiotemporal dynamics of ecosystem services value (ESV) and urbani-zation, as well as the degree of coupling and coordination (CCD) between them. The result suggested that be-tween 1990 and 2020, the ESV of Guizhou Province showed a two-step decline due to the conversion of forest land for agricultural and urban usage. In addition, the ESV of the western region is lower than its eastern counterpart. The CCD level between ESV and urbanization has increased over time, but most areas are still in an unbalanced state of development. Most areas are mainly urbanization lagging, but the central and north-central research areas are mainly ESV lagging. Identifying the regional differences of coupling coordination types has shed light on the degree of contradiction between local urbanization and ESV, and helped find the balance between ecological sustainability and urbanization.

TI  - Identification of tree species based on the fusion of UAV hyperspectral image and LiDAR data in a coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest in Northeast China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate identification of tree species via remote sensing technology has become one of the important means for forest inventory. This paper is to develop an accurate tree species identification framework that integrates unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV)-based hyperspectral image and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data under the complex condition of natural coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests. First, the UAV-based hyperspectral image and LiDAR data were obtained from a natural coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest in the Maoer Mountain area of Northeast China. The preprocessed LiDAR data was segmented using a distance-based point cloud clustering algorithm to obtain the point cloud of individual trees; the hyperspectral image was segmented using the projection outlines of individual tree point clouds to obtain the hyperspectral data of individual trees. Then, different hyperspectral and LiDAR features were extracted, respectively, and the importance of the features was analyzed by a random forest (RF) algorithm in order to select appropriate features for the single-source and multi-source data. Finally, tree species identification in the study area were conducted by using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm together with hyperspectral features, LiDAR features and fused features, respectively. Results showed that the total accuracy for individual tree segmentation was 84.62%, and the fused features achieved the best accuracy for identification of the tree species (total accuracy = 89.20%), followed by the hyperspectral features (total accuracy = 86.08%) and LiDAR features (total accuracy = 76.42%). The optimal features for tree species identification based on fusion of the hyperspectral and LiDAR data included the vegetation indices that were sensitive to the chlorophyll, anthocyanin and carotene contents in the leaves, the partial components of the transformed independent component analysis (ICA), minimum noise fraction (MNF) and principal component analysis (PCA), and the intensity features of the LiDAR echo, respectively. It was concluded that the framework developed in this study was effective in tree species identification under the complex conditions of natural coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest and the fusion of UAV-based hyperspectral image and LiDAR data can achieve enhanced accuracy compared the single-source UAV-based remote sensing data.

TI  - Evidence of environmental transfer of tebuconazole to the eggs in the house sparrow (<i>Passer domesticus</i>): An experimental study
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Triazole compounds are among the most widely used fungicides in agroecosystems to protect crops from potential fungal diseases. Many farmland birds spend a significant part of their life cycle in agroecosystems, which may chronically expose them to pesticides. We experimentally tested whether exposure to environmental concentrations of tebuconazole could induce a contamination of the eggs in an agroecosystem sentinel species, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus). Wild-caught adult sparrows were maintained in captivity and exposed (exposed group) or not (control group) for seven months to tebuconazole through drinking water. Eggs were opportunistically collected for the determination of tebuconazole concentration by Liquid Chromatography coupled to tandem Mass Spectrometry in eggs. We found that eggs from exposed parents all contained tebuconazole with a mean concentration of 1.52 ng g(-1) dry weight. In eggs from control parents, the tebuconazole concentration was below the limit of quantification (0.23 ng g(-1) dry weight) for 11 out of 13 eggs. Thus, our study demonstrates for the first time that environmental exposure of female birds to tebuconazole can translate into egg contamination by this fungicide.

TI  - Mapping artisanal and small-scale mines at large scale from space with deep learning
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Artisanal and small-scale mines (Asm) are on the rise. They represent a crucial source of wealth for numerous communities but are rarely monitored or regulated. The main reason being the unavailability of reliable information on the precise location of the ASM which are mostly operated informally or illegally. We address this issue by developing a strategy to map the ASM locations using a convolutional neural network for image segmentation, aiming to detect surface mining with satellite data. Our novel dataset is the first comprehensive measure of ASM activity over a vast area: we cover 1.75 million km(2) across 13 countries in Sub-Tropical West Africa. The detected ASM activities range from 0.1 ha to around 2, 000 ha and present a great diversity, yet we succeed in hitting acceptable compromises of performance, as achieving 70% precision while maintaining simultaneously 42% recall. Ultimately, the remarkable robustness of our procedure makes us confident that our method can be applied to other parts of Africa or the world, thus facilitating research and policy opportunities in this sector.

TI  - Investigation of the main reservoir of the Tulehu geothermal system (Indonesia) using 3-D inversion of MT data
T2  - GEOTHERMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tulehu geothermal prospect area is located in Maluku Province, Indonesia. The existence of the geothermal system in this area is recognized by the appearance of hot springs on the western side of Mt Eriwakang and the northern side of Mt. Huwe. Most of these hot springs occur along inferred geological structures. The geological conditions of this area are dominated by Quaternary volcanic rocks, limestone, alluvium, and metamorphic rocks. Several authors have conducted several studies to propose various geothermal conceptual models, from structurally controlled to volcanic-hosted geothermal systems. However, the geoscientific data supporting the hypotheses are not comprehensive yet. There are still gaps in the data coverage as well as in the interpretation of geological, geochemical, and geophysical data, so a comprehensive study should be done before deciding on further stages. Therefore, this paper proposes a new conceptual model of the Tulehu geothermal area by reducing the existing data gap. Interpretation of remote sensing data, geological field observations, age dating analysis, reanalysis of geochemical data, and additional MT data covering Mt. Eriwakang are conducted to reconstruct the conceptual model. Graben-like structures are identified based on the geological data where the product of Mt. Eriwakang is in the middle. Based on the age dating data, the product of Mt. Eriwakang erupted in the Qua-ternary time (413 & PLUSMN;6 kA), so it is still quite potential as a heat source. This indication is also supported by the trend of Cl, HCO3, and SiO2, which describe the possible flow from Mt. Eriwakang to the surrounding hot springs. Based on the Na-K-Mg and Silica geothermometers, the reservoir temperature is estimated at 210-240 C. A three-dimensional (3-D) MT inversion was applied to all the existing and new MT data to obtain a 3-D subsurface resistivity model. The oceanic bathymetry data was also incorporated to mitigate the possible coastal effect from the surrounding seawater to the MT data. The new 3-D MT inversion results show a good agreement with the geological and geochemical indications. The updome-shaped pattern of the subsurface resistivity distribution beneath Mt. Eriwakang supports the geological and geochemical data analysis results concerning the indications of the prospects area around Mt. Eriwakang. These interpretations can strengthen the recommendation to focus on the area around Mt. Eriwakang for further development.

TI  - A Python toolkit to monitor sandy shoreline change using high-resolution PlanetScope cubesats
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates an emerging capability to monitor high spatial (pixel size = 3.7 m) and temporal (daily to sub-daily imagery) resolution coastal change using PlanetScope cubesats. A new toolkit (CoastSat.PlanetScope) is presented that enables users to map shorelines from PlanetScope imagery, using a workflow of image coregistration, segmentation, thresholding, shoreline detection and elevation correction. The toolkit is subsequently tested at Narrabeen-Collaroy Beach (SE Australia), evaluating combinations of shoreline detection indices, thresholding approaches and elevation correction. An optimal shoreline accuracy of 3.5 m (RMSE) is found for this coastline using the difference between the near-infrared and blue bands and a weighted peaks thresholding approach. A generic elevation correction model that considers tidal variability and wave setup at the shoreline is then proposed. With a growing archive of high-resolution imagery, PlanetScope presents enormous potential for enhanced coastline mapping of the coast and complements existing approaches using Landsat/ Sentinel-2 imagery.

TI  - 'Tidy' and 'messy' management alters natural enemy communities and pest control in urban agroecosystems.
T2  - PLoS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agroecosystem management influences ecological interactions that underpin ecosystem services. In human-centered systems, people's values and preferences influence management decisions. For example, aesthetic preferences for 'tidy' agroecosystems may remove vegetation complexity with potential negative impacts on beneficial associated biodiversity and ecosystem function. This may produce trade-offs in aesthetic- versus production-based management for ecosystem service provision. Yet, it is unclear how such preferences influence the ecology of small-scale urban agroecosystems, where aesthetic preferences for 'tidiness' are prominent among some gardener demographics. We used urban community gardens as a model system to experimentally test how aesthetic preferences for a 'tidy garden' versus a 'messy garden' influence insect pests, natural enemies, and pest control services. We manipulated gardens by mimicking a popular 'tidy' management practice-woodchip mulching-on the one hand, and simulating 'messy' gardens by adding 'weedy' plants to pathways on the other hand. Then, we measured for differences in natural enemy biodiversity (abundance, richness, community composition), and sentinel pest removal as a result of the tidy/messy manipulation. In addition, we measured vegetation and ground cover features of the garden system as measures of practices already in place. The tidy/messy manipulation did not significantly alter natural enemy or herbivore abundance within garden plots. The manipulation did, however, produce different compositions of natural enemy communities before and after the manipulation. Furthermore, the manipulation did affect short term gains and losses in predation services: the messy manipulation immediately lowered aphid pest removal compared to the tidy manipulation, while mulch already present in the system lowered Lepidoptera egg removal. Aesthetic preferences for 'tidy' green spaces often dominate urban landscapes. Yet, in urban food production systems, such aesthetic values and management preferences may create a fundamental tension in the provision of ecosystem services that support sustainable urban agriculture. Though human preferences may be hard to change, we suggest that gardeners allow some 'messiness' in their garden plots as a "lazy gardener" approach may promote particular natural enemy assemblages and may have no downsides to natural predation services.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistant <i>Escherichia coli </i>in Scottish wild deer: Prevalence and risk factors
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a recognised threat to global health. Obtaining data on the prevalence of AMR in environmental bacteria is key to understanding drivers and routes of transmission. Here, 325 Shiga toxin negative deer faecal samples-gathered from across the Scottish mainland-were screened for the presence of AMR Escherichia coli and investigated for potential risk factors associated with AMR occurrence. E. coli with resistance to antimicrobials of clinical health concern, including carbapenems and 3rd generation cephalospo-rins, were targeted. Ninety-nine percent of samples yielded E. coli, and the prevalence of resistant E. coli at the level of faecal samples was 21.8% (n = 71) for tetracycline, 6.5% (n = 21) for cefpodoxime, 0.3% for cipro-floxacin (n = 1), with no recorded resistance to meropenem. Potential risk factors for tetracycline and cefpo-doxime resistance were investigated. The presence of broadleaved woodlands was significantly associated with both AMR phenotypes, which may relate to land use within or around such woodlands. Associated risk factors varied across resistance phenotype and deer species, with proximity or density of horses an indicator of significantly decreased and increased risk, respectively, or tetracycline and cefpodoxime resistance in E. coli from roe deer, but not from red deer. Distance from wastewater treatment plants was a significant risk factor for tetracycline resistance in E. coli from red deer but not from roe deer. Data indicated that AMR E. coli can occur in wild deer populations that are not directly exposed to the selective pressure exerted by antimicrobial treatment. Overall, resistance to critically important antimicrobials was found to be low in the studied population, sug-gesting no immediate cause for concern regarding human health. Utilising existing culling frameworks, wild deer in Scotland could function well as a sentinel species for the surveillance of AMR in the Scottish environment.

TI  - Beyond Deep Disagreement: A Path Towards Achieving Understanding Across a Cultural Divide
T2  - SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Achieving genuine engagement and understanding between communities with radically divergent worldviews is challenging. If there is no common ground on which to stand and have a discussion, the likely outcomes of an apparent intercultural disagreement are a stalemate, the (sometimes colonialist) imposition of a single worldview, or a kind of relativistic tolerance that falls short of genuine engagement. In this paper, we suggest a way forward that takes as its starting point the philosophical discussion of deep disagreement, using the example of taniwha - in te ao Maori (the Maori world/worldview), powerful water beings that must be treated with respect - to outline a strategy for building intercultural understanding and enabling constructive intercultural dialogue.

TI  - <i>In</i><i> situ</i> observation of holopelagic<i> Sargassum</i> distribution and aggregation state across the entire North Atlantic from 2011 to 2020
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Between 2011 and 2020, 6,790 visual observations of holopelagic Sargassum were recorded across the North Atlantic Ocean to describe regional distribution, presence, and aggregation state at hourly and 10 km scales. Influences of oceanographic region and wind/sea conditions as well as temporal trends were considered; marine megafauna associates documented the ecological value of aggregations. Holopelagic Sargassum was present in 64% of observations from the western North Atlantic. Dispersed holopelagic Sargassum fragments and clumps were found in 97% of positive observations whereas aggregated windrows (37%) and mats (1%) were less common. Most field observations noted holopelagic Sargassum in quantities below the AFAI algorithm detection limit for the MODIS sensor. Aggregation state patterns were similar across regions; windrow proportion increased with higher wind speeds. In 8 of 10 years in the Sargasso Sea holopelagic Sargassum was found in over 65% of observations. In contrast, the Tropical Atlantic and Caribbean Sea exhibited greater inter-annual variability (1-88% and 11-78% presence, respectively) that did not align with extremes in central Atlantic holopelagic Sargassum areal coverage determined from satellite observations. Megafauna association patterns varied by taxonomic group. While some study regions were impacted by holopelagic Sargassum dynamics in the equatorial Atlantic, the Sargasso Sea had consistently high presence and operated independently. Field observations capture important dynamics occurring at fine spatiotemporal scales, including transient aggregation processes and ecological value for megafauna associates, and therefore remain essential to future studies of holopelagic Sargassum.

TI  - Electronic, magneto-optic and thermoelectric properties of KCaN<sub>2</sub> Heuslerenes: A DFT study
T2  - PRAMANA-JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the density functional theory (DFT), the structural, electronic, optical, magneto-optical and thermoelectric properties of KCaN2-K, KCaN2-Ca, KCaN2-N Heuslerenes have been discussed. Energy changes in the volume of these compounds indicate the presence of their ground-state points. These three structures, KCaN2-K, KCaN2-Ca and KCaN2-N have magnetic moments 3.0, 3.0 and 1.0 mu(B). The electronic results indicated that the KCaN2-K Heuslerene is a magnetic semiconductor and the other two are half-metallic with 100% spin polarisation. Optical studies showed that in both directions of the incident light (along the x- and z-axes), these compounds have semiconductor behaviour. The highest light response occurs in KCaN2-K Heuslerene at the visible edge. KCaN2-Ca and KCaN2-N Heuslerenes have the lowest optical energy loss function in the IR and visible regions. Also, magnetic behaviour of the KCaN2-K, KCaN2-Ca and KCaN2-N Heuslerenes causes a magnetic response to light in the UV edge region and at higher energies to control the Kerr angle rotation and magnetic polarisation of light.

TI  - Baltic Sea transparency from ships and satellites: centennial trends
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water transparency can be measured with optical instruments and estimated with satellite sensors, but such measurements have been widely available for only a few decades. Estimates of water transparency using a white disk called a Secchi disk have been made for over a century and can be used to estimate long-term trends. However, historic in situ measurements of the Secchi depth (ZSd) were irregular in space and time and are difficult to interpret in regular time series due to biases introduced by changing locations and the timing of measurements. Satellite data time series, on the other hand, have consistent resolution in both space and time but cover too short a time to resolve climate-scale trends. We normalized historic ZSd measurements in the Baltic Sea with a satellite-derived mean climatology at 5 d temporal and 4 km spatial resolutions and created a merged time series of ZSd for the last century. The mean ZSd in the Baltic Sea from 1927-2020 decreased by 4.2 +/- 0.6 m at a rate of 0.045 +/- 0.06 m yr-1. Most of the change happened before 1987, and a further decrease was evident primarily in the satellite data during the 1998-2008 period. After 2008, no significant trend in ZSd and or the coefficient of diffuse light attenuation was detected in the Baltic Sea. However, in some sub-basins of the Baltic Sea, the decrease in ZSd continued even after that. The decrease in spectral water transparency in recent decades was highest in the 412 nm band, indicating an increase in the concentration of chromophoric dissolved organic matter.

TI  - Effects of Warm-up Focused on the Mind-Body on Choral Performance.
T2  - Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In choral performance, a wide variety of musical expression is required to deliver the worldview of the work to the audience. Singers need to regulate their mind-body to be in the optimal state, which includes relaxed concentration and flexible kinesthetic controllability in sensation, expression, and vocalization, for the chorus. Therefore, a choral warm-up focused on the mind-body could be crucial for various musical expressions. However, what kind of warm-up helps the singer achieve the optimal condition for the chorus remains unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of a warm-up method focusing on breathing, physical movement, imagery, and the combination of those factors on singing performance.METHOD: Twenty-five choral singers were randomly assigned to five groups, and then singers for each group online conducted one of five warm-up conditions (breathing / stretching / imagery work / all works / control) and performed singing tasks to evaluate singing performance, including sensation, expression, and vocalization, both subjectively and objectively. Changes in mood were also measured using the second edition of the Profile of Mood States.RESULTS: The results showed that the warm-up with imagery work or all works could objectively and subjectively enhance singing performance. By contrast, the warm-up with breathing or stretching did not significantly improve performance, but did enhance subjective evaluations in general. In addition, no significant correlations were found between the objective performance evaluations and changes in individual mood.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a warm-up focusing on mind-body interventions, especially imagery work, may enhance choral performance, thereby providing new insight for the establishment of more effective choral warm-up methods.

M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza virus circulation virtually ceased in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic, re- emerging with the relaxation of restrictions in spring 2022. Using a testnegative design, the Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network reports 2021/22 vaccine effectiveness of 36% ( 95% CI: -38 to 71) against late-season illness due to influenza A(H3N2) clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2 viruses, considered antigenically distinct from the 3C.2a1b.2a.1 vaccine strain. Findings reinforce the World Health Organization's decision to update the 2022/23 northern hemisphere vaccine to a more representative A(H3N2) clade 3C.2a1b. 2a. 2 strain.

TI  - Ecological impacts of forest fire on composition and structure of tropical deciduous forests of central India
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study highlights the forest fire hotspots based on daily forest fire occurrence during 2000-2020 and its subsequent long-term impacts on different vegetation types in Central India. The MODIS (MCD14DL) based study exhibited the recurrence of fire incidences in central and southern parts of forests and affected substantial parts of the deciduous broadleaf forest (31.56% of select forest type) and deciduous needleleaf forest (30.23%), shrubland (7.52%), mixed forest (9.80%), with the major forest fire peaks during March and April, while negligible fire incidences were observed in plantation and grassland. 72% of field transects (157 out of the 218 field transects) were observed under high anthropogenic influences as evidenced by a large number of cut stumps. Six species (out of 106 studies tree species) including Tectona grandis L.f. (occurrence in 98% of fire hotspots), Butea monosperma (Lam.) Taubert (66%), were observed to be highly fire-resistant, recorded in >50% of the forest fire hotspots regions. The major forest fires hotspots (p < 0.01) were observed in the Malwa plateau, Vindhyan ranges, and Satpura range during 2000-2020, as observed with high fire intensity. While the forest in the northern parts attributed a cold spot with reference to forest fires (p < 0.01). The study elucidated the high susceptibility of forest fire in deciduous forests in Central India and necessitated proper management of forest fires by encouraging fire-resistant species, and prioritization of regions under fire hazards through the adoption of preparedness and response strategies to minimize the forest fire impacts.

TI  - Continuous monitoring of nighttime light changes based on daily NASA's Black Marble product suite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring nighttime light (NTL) change enables us to quantitatively analyze the dynamic patterns of human activity and socioeconomic features. NASA's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) atmospheric-and Lunar-BRDF-corrected Black Marble product (VNP46A2) provides daily global night-time radiances with high temporal consistency. However, timely and continuous monitoring of NTL changes based on the dense daily DNB time series is still lacking. In this study, we proposed a novel Viewing Zenith Angle (VZA) stratified COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD) algorithm (VZA-COLD) to detect NTL change at 15 arc-second spatial resolution with daily updating capability based on NASA's Black Marble prod-ucts. Specifically, we divided the clear observations into four VZA intervals (0-20 degrees, 20 degrees-40 degrees, 40 degrees-60 degrees, and 0-60 degrees) to mitigate the temporal variation of the NTL data caused by the combined angular effects of viewing geometry and the complex surface conditions (e.g., building heights, vegetation canopy covers, etc.). Single-term harmonic models were continuously estimated for new observations from each VZA interval, and by comparing the model predictions with the actual DNB observations, a unified set of NTL changes can be captured continuously among the different VZA intervals. The final NTL change maps were generated after excluding the consistent dark pixels. Results showed that the VZA-COLD algorithm reduced the DNB data temporal variations caused by disparities among different viewing angles and surface conditions, and successfully detected NTL changes for six globally distributed test sites with an overall accuracy of 99.71%, a user's accuracy of 87.18%, and a producer's accuracy of 68.88% for the NTL change category.

TI  - Prediction of apple first flowering date using daily land surface temperature spatio-temporal reconstruction and machine learning
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The first flowering date (FFD) is a critical phenological parameter closely related to the apple yield, so the ac-curate prediction of the FFD is important for precise orchard production management. Existing methods to predict the FFD are mostly based on air temperature (Ta) measured at meteorological stations, but to great differences in meteorological variations and the ecological conditions, these methods cannot present the dif-ferences of FFD under complex meteorological conditions and provide spatially continuous FFD information at the level of a region. Therefore, we propose a method to predict spatially continuous apple FFD from remote sensing land surface temperature (LST) based on flowering prediction model. Firstly, the missing LST data were reconstructed by using spatio-temporal reconstruction (STR) approach developed. Next, new air temperature (NAT) data were generated by using the daily Ta estimation (DTE) model and the reconstructed LST. Finally, apple FFD was predicted by the NAT data and the apple flowering prediction model established based on random forest (RF) algorithm and the phenology sequential model, and the prediction accuracy was verified by com-parison with the independently measured apple FFD. The LST reconstructed by using the STR approach has mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 0.51 to 0.68 degrees C, and root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 1.07 to 1.21 degrees C. The MAE between the NAT data and the High-Resolution Land Surface Data Assimilation System (HR-CLDAS) meteorological data ranges from 2.15 to 3.23 degrees C, and the RMSE ranges from 2.81 to 4.27 degrees C. In addition, the determination coefficient (R2) and RMSE between the predicted and measured FFD is 0.72 and 2.96 days, respectively. These results demonstrate that the developed method maximizes the potential of MODIS LST in predicting spatially continuous apple FFD, which is valuable for flower and fruit thinning, to defend against frost disasters, and in general for refined orchard production management.

TI  - The role of pre-operative axillary ultrasound in assessment of axillary tumor burden in breast cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Recent studies have suggested that a significant proportion of patients with axillary nodal metastases diagnosed by pre-operative axillary ultrasound (AUS)-guided needle biopsy were over-treated with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The role of routine AUS and needle biopsy in early breast cancer was questioned. This review aims to determine if pre-operative AUS could predict the extent of axillary tumor burden and need of ALND. Methods PubMed and Embase literature databases were searched systematically for abnormal AUS characteristics and axillary nodal burden. Studies were eligible if they correlated the sonographic abnormalities in AUS with the resultant axillary nodal burden in ALND according to the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria. Results Eleven retrospective studies and one prospective study with 1658 patients were included. Sixty-five percent of patients with one abnormal lymph node in AUS and 56% of those with two had low axillary nodal burden. Using one abnormal lymph node as the cut-off, the pooled sensitivity and specificity in prediction of axillary nodal burden were 66% (95%CI 63-69%) and 73% (95% CI 70-76%), respectively. Across the six studies that evaluated suspicious nodal characteristics, increased nodal cortical thickness may be associated with high axillary nodal burden. Conclusion More than half of the patients with pre-operative positive AUS and biopsy proven axillary nodal metastases were over-treated by ALND. Quantification of suspicious nodes and extent of cortical morphological changes in AUS may help identify suitable patients for sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Aerosol-cloud interaction in water clouds observed using ground-based, in-situ, and satellite-based observations over an Indian continental region
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of atmospheric aerosols on climate by acting as cloud condensation nuclei is very complex and unable to capture completely by climate models. In this study, an observational approach to estimate the aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) in water clouds is presented using a combination of ground-based, in-situ balloon-borne, and satellite-based measurements of nearly 7 years over an Indian region. Aerosol and cloud optical depths (AOD and COD retrieved from lidar) are the aerosol and cloud proxies, respectively, used for estimating ACI by constraining liquid water path (LWP retrieved from radiosonde) and background meteorological conditions. Seasonal variations of the occurrence of water clouds detected from backscattered lidar signals using the wavelet covariance transform method are identical to those obtained from radiosonde observations. The ACI analysis shows that the correlation between AOD and COD is highest near the cloud base and it decreases as the height above the cloud base increases for all the LWP values ranging from 30 to 150 g/m2. The calculated ACI tau parameter is within the theoretical limit. The highest correlation value near the cloud base are observed at the LWP bin of 60 to 90 g/m2. ACI at the cloud base shows a decreasing pattern as the cloud base temperature decreases for LWP values of 30 to 60 g/m2 whereas different patterns for all other LWPs. High ACI is observed when the wind direction at the cloud base is northeasterly and low ACI when it is southeasterly and southwesterly. This result supports the observation of the high occurrence of water clouds during winter followed by the post-monsoon season and low occurrence during monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons over the observational site. Thus, the estimated ACI is in accordance with the theoretical concept of aerosol indirect effect i.e. the polluted atmospheric condition leads to clouds with more cloud fraction and cloud optical depth.

TI  - Tracking changes in SARS-CoV-2 transmission with a novel outpatient sentinel surveillance system in Chicago, USA
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the authors develop a method for estimation of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission rates based on a sentinel population of people seeking outpatient testing with recent symptom onset. This method has fewer operational delays than methods based on hospital data, and may be subject to fewer biases.Public health indicators typically used for COVID-19 surveillance can be biased or lag changing community transmission patterns. In this study, we investigate whether sentinel surveillance of recently symptomatic individuals receiving outpatient diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 could accurately assess the instantaneous reproductive number R(t) and provide early warning of changes in transmission. We use data from community-based diagnostic testing sites in the United States city of Chicago. Patients tested at community-based diagnostic testing sites between September 2020 and June 2021, and reporting symptom onset within four days preceding their test, formed the sentinel population. R(t) calculated from sentinel cases agreed well with R(t) from other indicators. Retrospectively, trends in sentinel cases did not precede trends in COVID-19 hospital admissions by any identifiable lead time. In deployment, sentinel surveillance held an operational recency advantage of nine days over hospital admissions. The promising performance of opportunistic sentinel surveillance suggests that deliberately designed outpatient sentinel surveillance would provide robust early warning of increasing transmission.

TI  - Modelling microscale impacts assessment of urban expansion on seasonal surface urban heat island intensity using neural network algorithms
T2  - ENERGY AND BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigation of surface urban heat island (SUHI) results from rapid urbanization and upsurge of land surface temperature (LST) has substantial socioeconomic and environmental impacts. This study investigates and simulates the impacts of rapid urbanization on LST and SUHI patterns in Sylhet City, Bangladesh, from 1995 to 2030. Landsat images and machine learning algorithms have been used to identify the urban growth, LST and UHI distribution patterns in several city directions. In addition, correlation analysis has been conducted between LST, SUHI and spectral indices (NDBI, NDBSI, NDVI, NDWI). Results suggested that urban expansion increased LST by 7 ? in summer and 6 ? in winter from 1995 to 2020. Increment has also occurred in summer high SUHI from 0.25 km2 to 2.65 km(2). Pearson correlation demonstrated that built-up areas have a strong positive relationship with LST (0.96) and SUHI (0.911). Future simulation of urban expansion for 2025 and 2030 shows a 9 % increase, leading to a significant increase in moderate to high SUHI intensity. The study's findings can act as an effective guideline for sustainable infrastructural development and ensure environmental stability by increasing the thermal com-fort level of the city.

TI  - Linking remote sensing analysis and reservoir operation optimization for improving water quality management of reservoirs
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study proposes and evaluates an integrated framework in which water quality distribution model of the lake and reservoir operation optimization are linked for improving the environmental management of the reservoir. Coupled remote sensing data processing-machine learning model was utilized to simulate water quality distribution in the reservoir in which one machine-learning model was used for converting the spectral images to the total dissolved solids (TDS) distribution in the reservoir. Then, another machine-learning model was developed based on the generated data by the first model for predicting water quality distribution map for unseens reservoir inflow/outflow scenarios. This machine-learning model was applied in the structure of reservoir operation optimization. Particle swarm optimization was utilized in the optimization process. Based on the results in the case study, the proposed method is able to minimize environmental impacts in the reservoir while the benefits from the reservoir such as water supply are maximized. However, its performance is not perfect that seems logical. In fact, the proposed model is able to balance the environmental requirements and losses of the reservoir. According to the generated water quality distribution map in a critical month of the simulated period, TDS concentration alters in range of 258 mg/L to 1091 mg/L in the lake that demonstrates using water quality distribution model in the optimal reservoir operation is necessary. The proposed method highlights the importance of using the remote sensing-based models in the structure of water resources opti-mization systems.

TI  - Intensivists' perceptions of what is missing in their compassionate care during interactions in the intensive care unit
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We proposed that the behaviors that demonstrate compassionate care in the intensive care unit (ICU) can be self-assessed and improved among ICU clinicians. Literature showing views of intensivists about their own compassionate care attitudes is missing. Methods This was an observational, prospective, cross-sectional study. We surveyed clinicians who are members of professional societies of intensive care using the modified Schwartz Center Compassionate Care Scale (R) (SCCCS) about their self-reported compassionate care. A modified SCCCS instrument was disseminated via an email sent to the members of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine between March and June 2021. Results Three hundred twenty-three clinicians completed the survey from a cohort of 1000 members who responded (32.3% response rate). The majority (54%) of respondents were male physicians of 49 (+ - 10 SD) years of age and 19 (12 + - SD) years in practice. The mean SCCCS was 88.5 (out of 100) with an average score of 8 for each question (out of 10), showing a high self-assessed physician rating of their compassionate care in the ICU. There was a positive association with age and years in practice with a higher score, especially for women ages 30-50 years (P = 0.03). Years in practice was also independently associated with greater compassion scores (p < 0.001). Lower scores were given to behaviors that reflect understanding perspectives of families and patients and showing caring and sensitivity. In contrast, the top scores were given to behaviors that included conducting family discussions and showing respect. Conclusion Physicians in the ICU self-score high in compassionate care, especially if they are more experienced, female, and older. Self-identified areas that need improvement are the humanistic qualities requiring sensitivity, such as cognitive empathy, which involves perspective-taking, reflective listening, asking open-ended questions, and understanding the patient's context and worldview. These can be addressed in further clinical and ICU quality improvement initiatives.

TI  - Changes of Remote Sensing Data in Urban Buildings Based on Neural Network Algorithm
T2  - MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data refer to remote sensing data sets with typical big data characteristics obtained by various remote sensing technologies. Based on this understanding, massive remote sensing datasets are the main method, and auxiliary data from other sources are integrated. The DN value (digital number) is the brightness value of the remote sensing image pixel and the gray value of the recorded ground objects. Unitless is an integer value. The value is related to the sensor's radiation resolution, ground object emissivity, atmospheric transmittance, and scattering rate. This study aims to study the neural network algorithm for remote sensing data changes in urban buildings. This study deliberately goes to Tianjin Binhai New Area, taking this as an example to analyze and study the change of construction land. It uses satellite remote sensing data as a basis to analyze the trend of its building land. This study proposes which factors lead to the decline of urban construction land in Tianjin Binhai New Area. Finally, through experimental research and analysis, it is found that from 1996 to 2016, the registered population of Tianjin Binhai New Area has increased a lot, accounting for 26.49% of the total population. The number of urban employees increased by 956,500. This is also the leading factor in the direction of the city for the building.

TI  - A novel approach on the delineation of a multipurpose energy-greenbelt to produce biofuel and combat desertification in arid regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) is one of the most prominent energy crops due to its superior agronomical traits, where it can grow in non-arable lands and harsh climates with minimal water requirements. A significant number of studies were published on the utilisation of JCL for biofuel production, whereas there are no studies on its use in greenbelt (GB) or windbreak technologies reported thus far. Meanwhile, a few approaches on the delineation of greenbelts to fight desertification in the arid regions exist in literature. This study presents a novel approach to delineate a multipurpose energy-greenbelt using JCL crop for biofuel production, as well as to preserve the soil and enhance air quality, thereby helping to combat desertification and sand-dust storms (SDS). The methodology is demonstrated using a case study in the state of Qatar for the diversification of its renewable energy resources. Moreover, Qatar is also suffering from land degradation due to erosion factors and desert creep. A multi-dimensional approach is proposed for this purpose using satellite and meteorological data to initially select the optimal plantation sites that potentially contribute to the highest possible biofuel yield. The spatial analysis was carried out using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) technique for multi-criteria decision making in the geographic information system (ArcGIS). In addition, the Landsat and MODIS satellite imagery were utilised in combination with historical records from the weather stations to evaluate the patterns of SDS, land degradation and urban expansion, to best define optimal GB pathway. COMSOL Multiphysics software was subsequently employed to evaluate the performance of Jatropha-GB and determine its optimal density. The different solutions for GB delineation spans 166.6-227.8 km length and (6 x 6 m) of field density. It is expected that the economic and environmental benefits from the derived GB configuration include: (a) protection of up to 87% of Qatar farms against further deterioration; (b) yield of up to 36 M gallon of green liquid fuels; (c) capture of 0.33 M tonnes of CO2 per 1 km GB-depth annually; and (d) provide a better air quality for around 95% of the Qatar population.

TI  - Characterizing forest disturbance and recovery with thermal trajectories derived from Landsat time series data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing frequency of forest disturbances caused by climate change has highlighted the importance of understanding the entire process of disturbance, from its onset to forest recovery. Many previous studies have used multispectral Landsat time-series data describing forest dynamics. However, there is a lack of studies using thermal imagery, which may provide information about bio-climatic changes and energy balance during the forest disturbance and recovery. Our objective in this research was to detect the main features of insect forest disturbance and subsequent forest recovery (disturbance duration, disturbance severity, recovery duration) using thermal Landsat imagery. We also aimed to determine the relationship between the identified thermal features and topography. The study area was a Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) dominated forest located in a Central European border region between the Czech Republic (Sumava Mountains) and Germany (Bavarian Forest). For more than three decades, forests in this area have experienced widespread defoliation due to the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.). We determined the forest's surface temperature (ST) between 1985 and 2015 from thermal Landsat time-series data and then normalized it (STn) to be comparable across the years in question. We plotted thermal trajectories for this period and then clustered them based on their variances. The resulting thermal trajectories well described both disturbance and recovery, showing a rise in the STn during the onset of the disturbance, the severity, and a decrease during recovery. The mean disturbance duration was 8.44 years (SD = +/- 3.775), with a maximum severity as indicated by the STn of 4.92 (SD = +/- 1.5) and a duration of 12.84 years (SD = +/- 3.38) until 50% recovery and 17.85 years (SD = +/- 1.74) until 80% recovery. Clustering of the thermal trajectories revealed clusters with similar year-groups of bark beetle attack and a spatially aggregated pattern closely related to topography. Severity showed a positive correlation with altitude, whereas the spatially aggregated patterns of disturbance and recovery duration can be attributed to more complex topographical characteristics. Our study demonstrates the ability of thermal infrared imagery to provide highly relevant data for assessing not only the main features of forest disturbance and recovery, but also bio-climatic canopy functions in terms of topography and other environmental variables.

TI  - Reading the Margins as Central: Representations of domestic servants in Nazir Ahmed and Ismat Chughtai's literary works
T2  - SOUTH ASIAN HISTORY AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper revisits the Urdu literary works of Deputy Nazir Ahmed and Ismat Chughtai to unravel the changing ways in which they depicted the servants and servant-like characters in their description of the north Indian middle-class urban Muslim household in the late 19th and first half of the twentieth century. It argues that fiction writers like Ahmed had a conception of the respectable household that envisaged a strict control over the conduct of the servants with a view to curb their 'corrupting influence' on the women and children of the family. Nazir Ahmed's preoccupation with the reform of the Muslim sharif household in the light of their declining economic and political status shaped his attitude towards domestic servants and lower classes in general. In contrast, writing in the early and mid-twentieth century, Ismat Chughtai and other 'daughters of reform' began questioning the politics of the sharif household, much of which was accepted by the previous generation of writers, mostly reformists, as unproblematic. Chughtai used her writing as a site of criticism against a social and political system that she viewed as unjust and exploitative. In her works, domestic servants are essentially presented as an exploited class with a voice of its own. In her stories, domestic servants express their opinions, and by doing so, expose the narrowly conceived worldview of the sharif middle class. Taken together, the two authors separated by nearly three decades, represented contrasting views through the decades of the late nineteenth to the early twentieth century. The paper addresses a neglected field of social-literary history: the presence and place of domestic servants in the politics of constructing new norms for the household and for the nation.

M3  - Review
AB  - The French Armed Forces Biomedical Research Institute (IRBA) deeply involved in research on SARS-COV-2, participated in the creation of the Obepine sentinel network in charge of detecting, qualifying and quantifying the virus genome in wastewater in France. During this pandemic, wastewater-based epidemiology has proven to be a first class public health tool for assessing viral dynamics in populations and environment. Obepine has also conducted research demonstrating the low infectivity of faeces and wastewater and allowed for early detection of epidemic waves linked to new variants. The IRBA has adapted this powerful tool to the monitoring of viral infections on board the aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle in order to get an operational system for anticipation after the first local outbreak in 2020. The presence of this surveillance and anticipation tool has allowed a better management of SARS-CoV-2 contingent introductions on board during stopovers or crewmembers entries. The combination of a man-datory vaccination protocol and the surveillance of viral circulation in black waters has made it possible to identify and locate cases, and thus to continue the operational mission in the COVID-19 environment while limiting the spread and preserving the health of the crew. This innovative tool can easily be redirected to the search for any other pathogens in blackwater or even, in the long term, to ensure health surveillance of any military establishment, at sea or on land, in France or on overseas bases.(c) 2022 l'Academie nationale de medecine.

TI  - E-government performance in democracies versus autocracies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Purpose - This study aims to examine the relationship between political regimes and e-government performance, with a focus on governments' perspectives of e-government. First, the authors use United Nations (UN) E-government Development Index (EGDI) to establish the current patterns of e-government performance across different regime types, and then develop their own typology of the various perspectives of different political regime types to e-government adopted in the literature. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between e-government performance and regime types.Design/methodology/approach- This study adopts a mixed-method research approach that involves quantitative (statistical databases) as well as qualitative (interviews) methods to go beyond the statistics and obtain interpretations of explored patterns of e-government performance and regime types. The research instruments for this study include the Jupyter open-source software used for drawing the relevant correlations, and validating the results using expert interviews.Findings- The results of the analysis support the research hypothesis that democracies have better e-government implementation than autocracies. The findings suggest that the type of a political regime has an influence on the conceptualization of e-government, the implementation of its practices and subsequently the assessment of its performance.Research limitations/implications- This study relies on the UN EGDI and data from previous literature. the UN Index only measures the supply side of government outputs without taking into consideration their impact on citizens, which does not provide a holistic view of the whole picture. Therefore, the UN EGDI rankings do not necessarily imply citizen satisfaction or improved e-government.Practical implications-From a practice point of view, this study gives information to government leaders as well as technical experts on how the political regime influences the government's performance in e-government. In fact, this paper bridges the gap between theory and practice by calling policymakers to take different regime worldviews and motivations into consideration before setting e-government strategies or even assessing e-government performance. Considering the current global digital transformation, it should be ensured that practitioners take these regime specifications into consideration. In the long term, the results of this research will prove that setting up e-government or e-participation platforms is not enough as technology alone is not enough to strengthen democracy or let alone stimulate citizen engagement. When dealing with e-government initiatives, the focus should be broadened beyond the technological aspect and take the social and political motivations of governments into consideration.Social implications -From a theoretical standpoint, this study calls for a more holistic e-government performance indicator that could take the regime perspectives into consideration and integrate them into its evaluation process. An indicator that can accommodate the different objectives pursued by different regime types. This could also be achieved by setting two indicators with each one matching the perspective of the specific regime type, which takes us to Ashby's "Law of Requisite Variety" (1991). The Law of Requisite Variety states that "the system must possess as much regulatory variety as can be expected from the environment" (Ashby, 1956). This law has some implications for this study. It implies that the regime worldview influences the requisite variety depending on the political context where e-government is being implemented. Because we have two regime worldviews, we need to have at least two responses (in this case indicators) that consider the variety of political contexts. Therefore, through appreciating the differences between these two worldviews, this study recommends using the Law of Requisite Variety to investigate the influence of political regimes on e-government. In the same way, in our repertoire of responses, we should not assume that one discipline has the answer but have a variety of cross-disciplinary responses.Originality/value -The contribution of this study lies in going beyond the statistical analyses of the UN EGDI to come up with possible interpretations of the reasons why political regimes differ in their e-government performance and what could be the reasons behind such variations. Based on analyzing correlations between e-participation performance and regime types, and interviews with experts, two different e-government perspectives could be identified: one for democracies and one for autocracies. Through identifying the relationship between these perspectives and the e-government performance of each regime type, this study provides governments and policy makers with new evidence that different regime types have different motivations for developing their e-government performance. Hence, e-government policies and strategies ought to match particular political contexts.

T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The most important biological ecosystems on the earth are mangroves, palms, shrubs, and trees that have adjusted to the challenging environments of high salinity, warm air and temperatures, severe tides, murky, sediment-hampered waterways, and oxygen-depleted soils make up mangroves that are mostly found in the intertidal zone. It is a sanctuary for a variety of aquatic animals and provide protection to coastal land. It acts as "Kalpvruksh" for human being and aquatic culture. Despite the importance of the mangrove ecosystem, the area of mangroves has been declining for several decades. The multispectral data and image processing techniques are frequently used to map and monitor mangrove changes. In this study, the changes of mangroves were accom-plished along the Ghogha coast, Bhavnagar district of Gujarat coast, India using the Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2A satellite data for 2016 and 2018, respectively. The image analysis and change detection studies were carried out using QGIS (3.10.14) and ArcMap (10.7.1) software. Using high-resolution satellite data and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), this research attempts to determine the geographical extent of mangroves. The result shows that the total mangrove cover decreased from 2016 to 2018 and Sentinel-2A images shows a better performance in comparison to Landsat 8 OLI, because of its higher spatial resolution.

TI  - Using airborne and DESIS imaging spectroscopy to map plant diversity across the largest contiguous tract of tallgrass prairie on earth
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland ecosystems are under threat globally, primarily due to land-use and land-cover changes that have adversely affected their biodiversity. Given the negative ecological impacts of biodiversity loss in grasslands, there is an urgent need for developing an operational biodiversity monitoring system that functions in these ecosystems. In this paper, we assessed the capability of airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy (also known as hyperspectral imaging) to capture plant alpha-diversity in a large naturally-assembled grassland while considering the impact of common management practices, specifically prescribed fire. We collected a robust in -situ plant diversity data set, including species composition and percent cover from 2500 sampling points with different burn ages, from recently-burned to transitional and pre-prescribed fire at the Joseph H. Williams Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Oklahoma, USA. We expressed in-situ plant alpha-diversity using the first three Hill numbers, including species richness (number of observed species in a plant community), exponential Shannon entropy index (hereafter Shannon diversity; effective number of common species, where species are weighed proportional to their percent cover), and inverse Simpson concentration index (hereafter Simpson diversity; effective number of dominant species, where more weight is given to dominant species) at four different plot sizes, including 60 m x 60 m, 120 m x 120 m, 180 m x 180 m, and 240 m x 240 m. We collected full-range airborne hyperspectral data with fine spatial resolution (1 m) and visible and near-infrared spaceborne hyper -spectral data from DESIS sensor with coarse spatial resolution (30 m), and used the spectral diversity hypoth-esis-i.e., that the variability in spectral data is largely driven by plant diversity-to estimate alpha-diversity remotely. In recently-burned plots and those at the transitional stage, both airborne and spaceborne data were capable of capturing Simpson diversity-a metric that calculates the effective number of dominant species by emphasizing abundant species and discounting rare species-but not species richness or Shannon diversity. Further, neither airborne nor spaceborne hyperspectral data sets were capable of capturing plant alpha-diversity of 60 m x 60 m or 120 m x 120 m plots. Based on these results, three main findings emerged: (1) management practices influence grassland biodiversity patterns that can be remotely detected, (2) both fine-and coarse -resolution remotely-sensed data can detect the effective number of dominant species (e.g., Simpson diversity), and (3) attention should be given to site-specific plant diversity field data collection to appropriately interpret remote sensing results. Findings of this study indicate the feasibility of estimating Simpson diversity in naturally -assembled grasslands using forthcoming spaceborne imagers such as National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-tration's Surface Biology and Geology mission.

TI  - Research on the emission reduction effects of carbon trading mechanism on power industry: plant-level evidence from China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Carbon trading mechanism has been adopted to foster the green transformation of the economy on a global scale, but its effectiveness for the power industry remains controversial. Given that energy-related greenhouse gas emissions account for most of all anthropogenic emissions, this paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of this trading mechanism at the plant level to support relevant decision-making and mechanism design. Design/methodology/approach This paper constructs a novel spatiotemporal data set by matching satellite-based high-resolution (1 x 1 km) CO2 and PM2.5 emission data with accurate geolocation of power plants. It then applies a difference-in-differences model to analyse the impact of carbon trading mechanism on emission reduction for the power industry in China from 2007 to 2016. Findings Results suggest that the carbon trading mechanism induces 2.7% of CO2 emission reduction and 6.7% of PM2.5 emission reduction in power plants in pilot areas on average. However, the reduction effect is significant only in coal-fired power plants but not in gas-fired power plants. Besides, the reduction effect is significant for power plants operated with different technologies and is more pronounced for those with outdated production technology, indicating the strong potential for green development of backward power plants. The reduction effect is also more intense for power plants without affiliation relationships than those affiliated with particular manufacturers. Originality/value This paper identifies the causal relationship between the carbon trading mechanism and emission reduction in the power industry by providing an innovative methodology for identifying plant-level emissions based on high-resolution satellite data, which has been practically absent in previous studies. It serves as a reference for stakeholders involved in detailed policy formulation and execution, including policymakers, power plant managers and green investors.

TI  - Measurement report: Plume heights of the April 2021 La Soufriere eruptions from GOES-17 side views and GOES-16-MODIS stereo views
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We estimated geometric plume heights for the daytime eruptions of La Soufriere in April 2021 using visible red band geostationary side views and geostationary-polar orbiter stereo views. Most of the plumes either spread near the tropopause at 16-17 km altitude or penetrated the stratosphere at 18-20 km altitude. Overshooting tops reached heights of up to 23 km. These geometric heights were compared with radiometric heights corresponding to the coldest plume temperature, which usually represent ambiguous estimates within a wide range between a tropospheric and a stratospheric height match. The tropospheric lower bound of the radiometric height range always underestimated the geometric height by a couple of kilometers, even for smaller plumes. For plumes near or above the tropopause, the midpoint or the stratospheric upper bound of the radiometric height range was in reasonable agreement with the geometric heights. The geometric overshooting top height, however, was always above the radiometric height range. We also found that geometric plume heights can be estimated from infrared band side views too, albeit with increased uncertainty compared to the visible red band. This opens up the possibility of applying the side view method to nighttime eruptions.

TI  - Quaternary deformation patterns in East-Central Iran, constrained by coseismic-postseismic displacements of the 2017 Hojedk triplet earthquake in the Kerman Province
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Central Iranian Microcontinent (CIM) in east-central Iran is located north of the active Arabia-Eurasia collision zone. Here, we report on the structure, deformation patterns, and earthquake occurrences along the dextral Lakar-Kuh and Godar fault systems in the CIM. The geometry of these fault systems marks a major restraining bend responsible for surface and rock uplift in the Plio-Pleistocene that produced the Mian Kuh mountain range. The 2017 Hojedk triplet earthquake (Mw = 5.8-6.0) occurred in the Mian Kuh Range. Sentinel-1 A Interferometer Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images (descending and ascending) were used to extract the coseismic displacements associated with the earthquake and its aftershocks. The results indicate a maximum displacement of-20 cm, corresponding to hanging wall uplift along the radar Line-of-Sight (LOS) direction. The Geodetic Bayesian Inversion (GBIS) of the coseismic deformation indicates that the causative faults of the Hojedk earthquakes were two reverse faults with NW-SE-strikes and SW-dips, with minor dextral slip components. Given the focal mechanism solutions and the epicenter locations of the triple earthquake sequence, we infer that these faults at the southern termination of the Lakar-Kuh Fault represent two segments (with different dip angles) of a previously unrecognized, blind reverse fault (a splay of the Godar Fault at depth). The Hojedk Earthquake and the geometry and kinematics of its causative faults highlight the strong potential of seismic hazard zones along the strike-slip fault systems in the CIM.

TI  - Invasion of Spartina alternilora in the coastal zone of mainland China: Control achievements from 2015 to 2020 towards the Sustainable Development Goals
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Convention on Biological Diversity's 15th Conference of the Parties (CBD COP15) both emphasized the urgency of protecting biological diversity. Spartina alternilora (S. alternilora), as an invasive species in China, has posed severe biodiversity challenges, demanding nationwide control and management. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of S. alternilora management during China's SDGs implementation from 2015 to 2020. Landsat images acquired in 2015 (the beginning year of SDGs), 2018, and 2020 (the end year of SDGs' targets 6.6, 14.2, 14.5, and 15.8 related to alien invasion) were applied to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of S. alternilora extent. The results revealed a consistent shrinkage of S. alternilora, with a net areal reduction of 2610 ha from 2015 to 2020, implying the effectiveness of control measures on S. alternilora invasion. Provinces including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shanghai have succeeded in controlling S. alternilora, evidenced by the sharp reduction in S. alternilora area by 4908 ha, 2176 ha, and 1034 ha, respectively, from 2015 to 2020. However, better management of S. alternilora is needed in regions with more severe S. alternilora invasion, e.g., Shandong, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces. Our results suggest that relevant policies, regulations, and ecological restoration projects implemented by national or local governments in China received satisfactory results in S. alternilora control. Nevertheless, S. alternilora potential utilities and its governance effectiveness should be objectively evaluated and weighed to obtain the greatest ecological benefits and promote sustainable coastal ecosystems. The results of this study are expected to provide important baseline information benefitting the formulation of coastal protection and restoration strategies in China.

TI  - Single-cell profile of tumor and immune cells in primary breast cancer, sentinel lymph node, and metastatic lymph node
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Little is known about the host-tumor interaction in the lymph-node basin at a single cell level. This study examines single cell sequences in breast cancer nodal metastases of a patient with triple-negative breast cancer. Methods The primary breast tumor, sentinel lymph node, an adjacent lymph node with metastatic involvement and a clinically normal-appearing lymph node were collected during surgery. Single-cell sequencing was performed on all four specimens. Results 14,016 cells were clustered into 6 cell subpopulations. Cancer cells demonstrated the molecular characteristics of TNBC basal B subtype and highly expressed genes in the MAPK signaling cascade. Tumor-associated macrophages regulated antigen processing and presentation and other immune-related pathways to promote tumor invasion. CD8 + and CD4 + T lymphocytes concentrated more in sentinel lymph node and mainly stratified into two transcriptional states. The immune-cell amount variation among primary tumor, sentinel and normal lymph nodes showed a similar tendency between the sc-RNA-seq profile of TNBC samples and a previous reported bulk RNA-seq profile of a breast cancer cohort, including all four breast cancer subtype samples. Discussion Single-cell sequencing analysis suggested that the sentinel lymph node was the initial meeting site of tumor infiltration and immune response, where partial T lymphocytes perform anti-tumor activity, while other T cells exhibit an exhausted state. We proposed a molecular explanation to the well-established clinical principle that the 5-year and 10-year survival outcomes were noninferior between SLND and ALND.

T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is sighted more use cases of drones, and with the expanding population, food yields are becoming more well-organized. Drones are used in examining crops and exploiting data to determine what requires greater attention. This research study focuses on how deep learning (DL) has been used with drone technology to create solutions for detecting crop fields within a certain regions of interest (ROI). Extracting images from a drone and analysing them with a DL system to identify crop fields and yields for less-developed nations are solution to a prevalent challenge that land use-land cover (LULC) encounters. The limitations of drone spot-checking in the context of agricultural fields and the constraints of utilizing DL to detect yields. Also, a novel method is offered for detecting and tracking crop fields using a single camera on our UAV. The estimated background movements using a perspective transformation model given a sequence of video frames and then locate distinct locations in the background removed picture to detect moving objects. The optical flow matching is used to determine the spatiotemporal features of each moving item and then categorize our targets, which have considerably different motions than the backdrop. Kalman filter tracking has used to ensure that our detections are consistent across time. The hybrid crop field detection model is to evaluate on real uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) recordings. And the findings suggest that hybrid crop field detection successfully detects and tracks crop fields through tiny UAV's with low computational resources. A crop field module, which aids in reconstruction quality evaluation by cropping specific ROIs from the whole field, and a reversing module, which projects ROIs-Vellore to relative raw pictures, are included in the proposed method. The results exhibit faster identification of cropping and reversing modules, impacting ROI height selection and reverse extraction of ROI location from raw pictures.

TI  - Accuracy assessment and climatology of MODIS aerosol optical properties over North Africa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6.1 (C6.1) product was compared with ground-based measurements at five sites of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) in North Africa. The MODIS AOD showed a good correlation coefficient of similar to 0.78, a very small mean bias error of 0.009, and a root mean square error of 0.126 with AERONET. The Dark Target/Deep Blue (DT/DB) algorithm showed better performance at low aerosol loading while underestimating AOD at higher aerosol loading, mainly for coarse-dominated aerosol types. This work also showed the benefits of using MODIS retrievals as a reliable data source for aerosols and providing a long-term aerosol type classification. The primary aerosol type is dust emitted from the Sahara Desert, and the dusty atmosphere becomes gradually mixed with pollution aerosols approaching the coastal region. The annual mean MODIS AOD at 550 nm and Angstrom exponent at 412-650 nm (AE) ranged from 0.17 to 0.45 and from 0.13 to 1.25, respectively, in Algeria between 2001 and 2019. Lower AOD (< 0.22) and higher AE (> 1) were found in the northern region, while the highest AOD (0.35 to 0.45) and the lowest AE (< 0.25) were observed over the Tanezrouft desert in southern Algeria. The seasonal mean AOD was highest in summer, while the lowest was in winter due to very high easterly and northeasterly Harmattan surface wind over Zone of Chotts and the Tidikelt Depression, respectively. The negative AOD trends observed over Algeria could be partially connected to the decline (increase) in surface (850 hPa) winds over potential dust source areas in southern Algeria.

TI  - First report of the blood-feeding pattern in <i>Aedes koreicus</i>, a new invasive species in Europe
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes koreicus is an invasive mosquito species which has been introduced into several European countries. Compared to other invasive Aedes mosquitoes, little is known of its biology and ecology. To determine Ae. koreicus' vectorial capacity, it is essential to establish its feeding patterns and level of anthropophagy. We report on the blood-feeding patterns of Ae. koreicus, examining the blood meal origin of engorged females and evaluating the influence of different biotic and abiotic factors on feeding behavior. Mosquitoes were collected in 23 sites in northern Italy by manual aspiration and BG-sentinel traps; host availability was estimated by survey. The source of blood meals was identified using a nested PCR and by targeting and sequencing the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene. In total, 352 Ae. koreicus engorged females were collected between 2013 and 2020 and host blood meals were determined from 299 blood-fed mosquitoes (84.9%). Eleven host species were identified, with the highest prevalences being observed among roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) (N = 189, 63.2%) and humans (N = 46, 15.4%). Blood meals were mostly taken from roe deer in forested sites and from humans in urban areas, suggesting that this species can feed on different hosts according to local abundance. Two blood meals were identified from avian hosts and one from lizard. Ae. koreicus' mammalophilic feeding pattern suggests that it may be a potential vector of pathogens establishing transmission cycles among mammals, whereas its role as a bridge vector between mammals and birds could be negligible.

TI  - Spatiotemporal assessment of land surface temperature and vegetation in tropical urban areas
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use intensification and expansion in urban areas increases land surface temperature (LST). Several studies have developed to evaluate the LST and its drivers in the world, but few of them have addressed the annual and seasonal effects in urban areas located in tropical regions. This study assesses the spatiotemporal relationship between LST, green vegetation cover, and built-up areas in Brasilia, Federal District, Brazil. We used time series of Landsat images (2000-2019) to retrieve the LST and compare it with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and surface urban heat island (SUHI). Based on our results, the NDVI values increased from 0.46 to 0.58 between 2000 and 2019. A similar increasing trend was observed for LST (24.9 degrees C in 2000; 32.4 degrees C in 2019), which indicates that the magnitude of increase of urban vegetation cover was not able to reduce LST. The highest average LST and SUHI values were observed during local spring season (September to December; 41.9 degrees C and -3.2 degrees C, respectively). During the autumn (March to June) and winter (June to September) seasons, we observed a progressive increasing trend of the LST values. The NDVI explained 80% of the surface temperature variation within areas of native vegetation and 53% in urban areas. Based on our assessment of the spatiotemporal changes of the LST as a function of normalized difference vegetation and urban spectral indices, we provided crucial information to support urban green cover planning and management that, ultimately, will improve the population's well-being.

TI  - Comprehensive analysis of a decade of cumulative radiocesium testing data for foodstuffs throughout Japan after the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The unexpected accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station in Japan, which occurred on March 11th, 2011, after the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami struck the north-eastern coast of Japan, released radionuclides into the environment. Today, because of the amounts of radionuclides released and their relatively long half-life, the levels of radiocesium contaminating foodstuffs remain a significant food safety concern. Foodstuffs in Japan have been sampled and monitored for Cs-134,Cs-137 since the accident. More than 2.5 million samples of foodstuffs have been examined with the results reported monthly during each Japanese fiscal year (FY, from April 1(st) to March 31(st)) from 2012 to 2021. A total of 5,695 samples of foodstuffs within the "general foodstuffs" category collected during this whole period and 13 foodstuffs within the "drinking water including soft drinks containing tea as a raw material" category sampled in FY 2012 were found to exceed the Japanese maximum permitted level (JML) set at 100 and 10 Bq/kg, respectively. No samples from the "milk and infant foodstuffs" category exceeded the JML (50 Bq/kg). The annual proportions of foodstuffs exceeding the JML in the "general foodstuffs" category varied between 0.37% and 2.57%, and were highest in FY 2012. The Cs-134,Cs-137 concentration for more than 99% of the foodstuffs monitored and reported has been low and not exceeding the JML in recent years, except for those foodstuffs that are difficult to cultivate, feed or manage, such as wild mushrooms, plants, animals and fish. The monitoring data for foodstuffs show the current status of food safety risks from Cs-134,Cs-137 contamination, particularly for cultured and aquaculture foodstuffs on the market in Japan.

TI  - Sentinel-2 estimation of CNC and LAI in rice cropping system through hybrid approach modelling
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Earth observation techniques represent a reliable and faster alternative to in-situ measurements by providing spatio-temporal information on crop status. In this framework, a study was conducted to assess the performance of hybrid approaches, either standard (HYB) or exploiting an active learning optimisation strategy (HYB-AL), to estimate leaf area index (LAI) and canopy nitrogen content (CNC) from Sentinel-2 (S2) data, in rice crops. To achieve this, the PROSAIL-PRO Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) was tested. Results demonstrate that a wide range of rice spectra, simulated according to realistic crop parameters, are reliable when appropriate field background conditions are considered. Simulations were used to train a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithm. Both cross-validation and validation results showed that HYB-AL approach resulted the best performing retrieval schema. LAI estimation achieved good performance (R-2=0.86; RMSE=0.54) and resulted very promising for model application in operational monitoring systems. CNC estimations showed moderate performance (R-2=0.63; RMSE=0.89) due to a saturation behaviour limiting the retrieval accuracy for moderate/high CNC values, approximately above 4 [g m(-2)]. S2 maps of LAI and CNC provided spatio-temporal information in agreement with crop growth, nutritional status and agro-practices applied to the study area, resulting in an important contribution to precision farming applications.

TI  - Examining the relationship between land surface temperature and landscape features using spectral indices with Google Earth Engine
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is strongly influenced by landscape features as they change the thermal char-acteristics of the surface greatly. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBAI) correspond to vegetation cover, water bodies, impervious build-ups, and bare lands, respectively. These indices were utilized to demonstrate the relationship between multiple landscape features and LST using the spectral indices derived from images of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) of Sylhet Sadar Upazila (2000-2018). Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform was used to filter, process, and analyze trends with logistic regression. LST and other spectral indices were calculated. Changes in LST (2000-2018) range from-6 degrees C to +4 degrees C in the study area. Because of higher vegetation cover and reserve forest, the north-eastern part of the study region had the greatest variations in LST. The spectral indices corre-sponding to landscape features have a considerable explanatory capacity for describing LST scenarios. The cor-relation of these indices with LST ranges from-0.52 (NDBI) to +0.57 (NDVI).

TI  - Directional correction of ERA5 and CAWCR wave spectrum partitions in the Southeast Brazil
T2  - OCEAN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite data to calibrate ocean wave spectrum partitions are being carried out in recent wave hindcast datasets as a way of correcting historical sea state records. The directional correction method aims at establishing separate fitting coefficients, for windsea and swell partition, as well as for the different sectors from which the waves propagate. This technique is able to identify systematic errors reproduced by the wave models using altimeter data. This work calibrates the significant wave height Hs from wave spectrum partitions in the South Brazil's coast using a directional multiple linear regression, previously introduced and tested in the New Zealand's coast. The ERA5 and CAWCR hindcasts are considered and corrected based on the Globwave satellite data. In general, at the boundaries of our study area, both raw wave hindcasts underestimate significant wave height Hs regarding altimeter data, thus requiring correction coefficients greater than one. The scatter index analysis exhibits an improvement in the indices post calibration, as well as shows higher values nearshore with respect to offshore points for both databases before and after calibration. While ERA5 correction slightly overestimates, CAWCR correction underestimates to some extent, with respect to satellite data. The corrections were also further validated using buoy data over the continental shelf. Even in a shallow sea location, where the Rio Grande buoy is, the bulk wave parameter Hs provided by CAWCR shows improvements post calibration. Comparisons pre and post calibration per direction present better results for CAWCR than ERA5. All sectors analysed for the CAWCR hindcast display improvements after of the correction. The CAWCR correction provided good results and was used as boundary conditions for a higher-resolution regional hindcast.

TI  - Multi-air pollution risk assessment in Southeast Asia region using integratedremote sensing and socio-economic data products
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution has massive impacts on human life and poor air quality results in three million deaths annually. Airpollution can result from natural causes, including volcanic eruptions and extreme droughts, or human activities,including motor vehicle emissions, industry, and the burning of farmland and forests. Emission sources emit multiplepollutant types with diverse characteristics and impacts. However, there has been little research on the risk of multipleair pollutants; thus, it is difficult to identify multi-pollutant mitigation processes, particularly in Southeast Asia, whereair pollution moves dynamically across national borders. In this study, the main objective was to develop a multi-airpollution risk index product for CO, NO2, and SO2based on Sentinel-5P remote sensing data from 2019 to 2020The risk index was developed by integrating hazard, vulnerability, and exposure analyses. Hazard analysis considersair pollution data from remote sensing, vulnerability analysis considers the air pollution sources, and exposure analysisconsiders the population density. The novelty of this study lies in its development of a multi-risk model that considersthe weights obtained from the relationship between the hazard and vulnerability parameters. The highest air pollutionrisk index values were observed in urban areas, with a high exposure index that originates from pollution caused byhuman activity. Multi-risk analysis of the three air pollutants revealed that Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippineshad the largest percentages of high-risk areas, while Indonesia had the largest total high-risk area (4361 km2).Using thefindings of this study, the patterns and characteristics of the risk distribution of multiple air pollutants inSoutheast Asia can be identified, which can be used to mitigate multi-pollutant sources, particularly with respect tosupporting the clean air targets in the Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - Commercial whale-watching reduces vessel incidents in the vicinity of killer whales in Washington State
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is increasing focus on the impacts of whale-watching on marine mammal species around the world. In the inland waters of Washington State and British Columbia, a region known as the Salish Sea, killer whales (Orcinus orca) are protected by regulations to help mitigate the acoustic and physical disturbance from small vessels. Most recently, the State of Washington implemented a commercial whale-watching licensing program that restricts viewing hours of whale-watching vessels within one-half nautical mile of endangered Southern Resident killer whales to four hours a day during three months of the year. During the development of these regulations, an identified data gap was regarding the "sentinel effect", a question of whether the presence of commercial whalewatching vessels can help mitigate speed and distance incidents by private vessels via modeling correct viewing behavior and/or by directly contacting vessels to prevent such incidents from occurring. This pilot study conducted five months of boat-based and shore-based data collection on vessel incidents in the proximity of two killer whale populations in the Salish Sea. A negative binomial model predicts a significant decrease in mean estimated incidents per hour by private vessels in the presence of commercial whale-watching vessels, while there was no significant difference in the presence of boater education vessels. This study provides the first quantitative support for the sentinel effect, a finding that should be analyzed further in ongoing studies and incorporated into the adaptive management of vessel regulations, especially those that restrict only commercial whale-watching vessels.

TI  - Expert consultation using the on-line Delphi method for the revision of syndromic groups compiled from emergency data (SOS Medecins and OSCOUR®) in France
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Consultation data from emergency general practitioners known as SOS Medecins and emergency departments (ED) from OSCOUR (R) network to the French syndromic surveillance system SurSaUD (R) (Surveillance sanitaire des urgences et deces). These data are aggregated and monitored on a daily basis through groupings of one or more medical symptoms or diagnoses ("syndromic groups" (SG)). The objective of this study was to evaluate, revise and enrich the composition of SGs through a consensus of experts who contributed or have experience in syndromic surveillance. Methods Three rounds of a Delphi survey were organised, involving 15 volunteers from SOS Medecins and 64 ED physicians in the OSCOUR (R) network as well as 8 international epidemiologists. Thirty-four SOS Medecins and 40 OSCOUR (R) SGs covering major medical specialities were put to the experts, along with their diagnostic codes and their surveillance objectives. In each round, the experts could retain or reject the codes according to the surveillance objective. The panel could also put forward new diagnostic codes in the 1st round, included in subsequent rounds. Consensus was reached for a code if 80% of participants had chosen to keep it, or less than 20% to reject it. Results A total of 12 SOS Medecins doctors (80%), 30 ED doctors (47%) and 4 international experts (50%) participated in the three rounds. All of the SGs presented to the panel included 102 initial diagnostic codes and 73 additional codes for SOS Medecins, 272 initial diagnostic codes and 204 additional codes for OSCOUR (R). At the end of the 3 rounds, 14 SOS Medecins (40%) and 11 OSCOUR (R) (28%) SGs achieved a consensus to maintain all of their diagnostic codes. Among these, indicators of winter seasonal surveillance (bronchiolitis and gastroenteritis) were included. Conclusion This study involved a panel of national experts with international representation and a good level of involvement throughout the survey. In the absence of a standard definition, the Delphi method has been shown to be useful in defining and validating syndromic surveillance indicators.

TI  - Impact of land cover changes on water quality: an application to the Guajaro reservoir, Colombia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, remote sensing and geographic information systems were used to assess the influence of land cover characteristics on the water quality of the El Guajaro reservoir, in northern Colombia. The water quality data were acquired during three measurement and sampling campaigns (2013, 2015 and 2016), complemented with data obtained by the regional environmental authority. The status of land cover in the basin of the El Guajaro reservoir was assessed by calculating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) indicators and land cover classification, using Landsat-8 surface reflectance images obtained from the Google Earth Engine platform. The analysis of the interaction between vegetation cover and water quality was based on Pearson correlations and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The correlation analysis indicated significant correlations of NDVI with temperature (r = 0.47), DO (r = - 0.64), pH (r = - 0.37), general vegetation (r = 0.83), urban areas (r = 0.56), bare soil (r = - 0.86), and nutrients (r = - 0.92 and r = - 0.82, for NO3 and PO4 respectively); and NDMI with temperature (r = 0.46), DO (r = - 0.64), TSS (r = - 0.33), general vegetation (r = 0.87), urban areas (r = 0.61), bare soil (r = - 0.89), water areas (r = - 0.40), and nutrients (r = - 0.93 and r = - 0.83, for NO3 and PO4 respectively). Additionally, it was observed that land covers corresponding to urban areas and bare soil affects the water quality of the reservoir. The results displayed strong correlation and association between vegetation cover conditions, which are affected by the various agricultural activities that take place in the basin, and the water quality of the reservoir.

TI  - Microbeam Radiation Therapy Controls Local Growth of Radioresistant Melanoma and Treats Out-of-Field Locoregional Metastasis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Synchrotron-generated microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) represents an innovative preclinical type of cancer radiation therapy with an excellent therapeutic ratio. Beyond local control, metastatic spread is another important endpoint to assess the effectiveness of radiation therapy treatment. Currently, no data exist on an association between MRT and metastasis. Here, we evaluated the ability of MRT to delay B16F10 murine melanoma progression and locoregional metastatic spread.Methods and Materials: We assessed the primary tumor response and the extent of metastasis in sentinel lymph nodes in 2 cohorts of C57BL/6J mice, one receiving a single MRT and another receiving 2 MRT treatments delivered with a 10-day interval. We compared these 2 cohorts with synchrotron broad beam-irradiated and nonirradiated mice. In addition, using multiplex quantitative platforms, we measured plasma concentrations of 34 pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and frequencies of immune cell subsets infiltrating primary tumors that received either 1 or 2 MRT treatments.Results: Two MRT treatments were significantly more effective for local control than a single MRT. Remarkably, the second MRT also triggered a pronounced regression of out-of-radiation field locoregional metastasis. Augmentation of CXCL5, CXCL12, and CCL22 levels after the second MRT indicated that inhibition of melanoma progression could be associated with increased activity of antitumor neutrophils and T-cells. Indeed, we demonstrated elevated infiltration of neutrophils and activated T-cells in the tumors after the second MRT.Conclusions: Our study highlights the importance of monitoring metastasis after MRT and provides the first MRT fraction-ation schedule that promotes local and locoregional control with the potential to manage distant metastasis.

TI  - Reconstruction and application of the temperature-vegetation-precipitation drought index in mainland China based on remote sensing datasets and a spatial distance model
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, remote sensing drought monitoring indices have been gradually developed and have been widely used for global or regional drought monitoring due to their strong drought-monitoring capabilities and easy implementation advantages. However, some defects of remote sensing drought indices stand to be improved due to certain errors in the inversion of surface characteristics by remote sensing datasets. The temperaturevegetation-precipitation drought index (TVPDI) was taken as the research object, and the leaf area index (LAI), the difference between the land surface temperature (LST) and monthly average temperature, and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation data were selected instead of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), LST and tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) data to improve TVPDI. The improved remote sensing drought index was named the improved temperature-vegetation-precipitation drought index (iTVPDI). The drought-monitoring accuracy of iTVPDI was verified by the gross primary productivity (GPP), soil moisture, and crop yield per unit. The drought-monitoring ability of iTVPDI was verified with traditional drought indices, including the standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), temperature-vegetation drought index (TVDI), drought severity index (DSI) and crop water stress index (CWSI). The drought-monitoring accuracy of iTVPDI was verified by selecting sample areas. iTVPDI was applied to monitor drought in mainland China over the 2001-2020 period and obtained four main results. First, the correlation analyses of iTVPDI and TVPDI with GPP, crop yield per unit area, and soil moisture showed that iTVPDI had a stronger monitoring ability in Northeast, North, and Southwest China; the R2 value obtained with soil moisture was 0.62 (p < 0.05), and this value was higher than that of TVPDI. Then, the correlation analyses of iTVPDI and TVPDI with SPI, SPEI, PDSI, CWSI, DSI and TVDI showed that the correlation coefficients of iTVPDI and TVPDI with these six indicators were basically consistent, which indicated that the drought-monitoring capability of iTVPDI was consistent with that of TVPDI. In local areas such as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China, the monitoring ability of iTVPDI was stronger than that of TVPDI. Third, through the sample area analysis, iTVPDI was found to moderate the NDVI-characterized vegetation factors in TVPDI in low-vegetation-cover areas affected by soil disturbances and in high-vegetation-cover areas affected by oversaturation. Finally, the results obtained from the application of iTVPDI in mainland China showed that during the warm-dry to warm-wet climate transition between 2001 and 2021, in 2010 and 2018, and in other special drought years, iTVPDI had the best response.

TI  - Slip deformation along the Gyaring Co fault from InSAR and GPS
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) can monitor large-scale small deformation. Because the Sentinel-1 satellite has a stable orbit control and the data coherence in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is good, we utilize data from Sentinel-1 to analyze the slip deformation of the Gyaring Co fault (GCF) in the central Tibetan Plateau. Data are obtained from ascending and descending tracks covering the research area, and the deformation results are obtained by the stacking and analysis of time series. The results demonstrate that the GCF exhibit slow slip overall. An analysis of different sections indicates that the fault displays both right-lateral strike-slip and normal faulting behaviors, and the movement is particularly obvious in the middle section of the GCF. Furthermore, we investigate the contemporary slip rate of the GCF using GPS data and construct two velocity profiles perpendicular to the fault strike at the southeastern and northwestern ends of the fault. The southeastern profile shows similar to 4 mm/year of right-lateral strike-slip movement and a modest (< 1 mm/year) amount of crustal thickening across the fault, while the northwestern profile shows much slower (similar to 1 mm/year) right-lateral strike-slip motion and 0.5 mm/year of crustal extension. The GPS results are consistent with the InSAR deformation map derived using Sentinel-1 AB data from 2014 to 2017. Our results support the distributed crustal motion model in which most crustal deformation (shortening/extension/strike-slip) occurs on various active faults in the central Tibetan Plateau rather than being concentrated on several fast-moving fault zones, e.g., the GCF-BCF. Finally, we analyze the distribution of historical earthquakes and the gravity and aeromagnetic fields. We speculate that a fault may exist north of Gyaring Co Lake that may be an extension of the fault north of Mujiu Co Lake.

TI  - Identification and ranking of subaerial volcanic tsunami hazard sources in Southeast Asia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tsunamis caused by large volcanic eruptions and flanks collapsing into the sea are major hazards for nearby coastal regions. They often occur with little precursory activity and are thus challenging to detect in a timely manner. This makes the pre-emptive identification of volcanoes prone to causing tsunamis particularly important, as it allows for better hazard assessment and denser monitoring in these areas. Here, we present a catalogue of potentially tsunamigenic volcanoes in Southeast Asia and rank these volcanoes by their tsunami hazard. The ranking is based on a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) composed of five individually weighted factors impacting flank stability and tsunami hazard. The data are sourced from geological databases, remote sensing data, historical volcano-induced tsunami records, and our topographic analyses, mainly considering the eruptive and tsunami history, elevation relative to the distance from the sea, flank steepness, hydrothermal alteration, and vegetation coverage. Out of 131 analysed volcanoes, we found 19 with particularly high tsunamigenic hazard potential in Indonesia (Anak Krakatau, Batu Tara, Iliwerung, Gamalama, Sangeang Api, Karangetang, Sirung, Wetar, Nila, Ruang, Serua) and Papua New Guinea (Kadovar, Ritter Island, Rabaul, Manam, Langila, Ulawun, Bam) but also in the Philippines (Didicas). While some of these volcanoes, such as Anak Krakatau, are well known for their deadly tsunamis, many others on this list are lesser known and monitored. We further performed tsunami travel time modelling on these high-hazard volcanoes, which indicates that future events could affect large coastal areas in a short time. This highlights the importance of individual tsunami hazard assessment for these volcanoes, the importance of dedicated volcanological monitoring, and the need for increased preparedness on the potentially affected coasts.

TI  - Generating synthetic daily remote sensing products suitable for surface heat island and heatwaves assessments at urban scale
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Presently, no single satellite provides cloud-free daily land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index at high spatial resolutions to assess heatwaves in cities. Heatwaves are ephemeral, and it is important to have data of adequate temporal and spatial resolution to study them. This research presents a two-part machine learning approach that yields seamless synthetic daily land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index at resolutions (500 and 100 m) suitable for city-scale assessments. The first part involves creating a model to predict normalized difference vegetation index. The second predicts land surface temperature using a model created with the output of the first step and other features as predictors. The outputs were validated with Landsat products from two days. The predicted normalized difference vegetation index had a RMSE of 0.09 and 0.14 for the 500 m and 100 m products, respectively, when compared to the validation data. For the land surface temperature products, the RMSE was 4.28 and 4.33 for the 500 and 100 m products, respectively. Furthermore, a trend analysis reveals a good temporal correlation (500 m:0.66, and 100 m: 0.70) between the land surface temperature and surface-air temperature. The validations reveal that the generated cloud-free synthetic products are more suitable for intra-urban analysis because the models performed with a higher accuracy in built-up areas. Further investigations on how the models respond to changes in the predictors will provide useful for planners in making city-scale heat mitigation decisions.

TI  - A New Method for Automated Monitoring of Road Pavement Aging Conditions Based on Recurrent Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The automated monitoring of road pavement conditions is a challenging subject in intelligent transportation. However, the existing studies mostly focus on extracting pavement damages such as cracks, while the pavement aging conditions are still less investigated. In this paper, a novel method based on a modified recurrent neural network is designed for automated monitoring of asphalt pavement aging phenomena from fineresolution satellite imagery. A spectral augmentation method is proposed to enhance the spectral details of the road pavements. A novel loss function is also proposed to improve the bi-directional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) network in order to better classify different degrees of road pavement aging and non-pavement objects. In order to demonstrate the outperformance of the modified network Bi-GRU+, the Worldview-2 satellite image (16360 *7728) covering 16 asphalt roads in the southwestern suburb of Beijing City is used. The results show that the proposed approach has better performance than existing machine learning methods, with an overall accuracy of 98.16% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.97. The overall processing time of the proposed method is 7836 seconds in our case study. The proposed method is efficient for large-scale monitoring of road health conditions from fine-resolution satellite imagery. It can become a part of intelligent transportation and provide a new foundation for large-range automated monitoring of road pavement aging conditions.

TI  - An L1-regularized variational approach for NDVI time-series reconstruction considering inter-annual seasonal similarity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data are extensively applied in environmental and ecological researches. However, cloud-induced interference and contamination seriously affects the quality of the current NDVI products, bringing huge uncertainty for subsequent applications. Although plenty of temporal methods have been developed to reconstruct NDVI time series, they still struggle to solve the challenge of temporally continuous gaps, due to the insufficient utilization of the prior characteristics in the time series. This paper develops a variational-based method to reconstruct multi-year NDVI time series by jointly regularizing local smoothness and inter-annual Seasonal similarity using the L1-norm (termed the SeasonL1 method). The proposed method innovatively introduces the information from adjacent years combined with assistance from temporal neighbors, and the L1-norm is imposed to establish the two corresponding regularization terms, to better characterize their statistical distributions. Simulated and real-data experiments were conducted in the Yangtze River Economic Belt of China using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data, to validate the performance of the SeasonL1 method by comparing with five classic methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed SeasonL1 method can achieve a satisfactory performance with an acceptable time cost in terms of both the quantitative indicators and spatio-temporal visual effect. In particular, the SeasonL1 method shown obvious advantages in recovering temporally continuous missing values and preventing over -smoothing in the inflection points of vegetation growth. We expect that the SeasonL1 method will become a useful filtering approach for obtaining high-quality NDVI time-series data in large-scale applications.

TI  - Identifying areas of archaeological potential in the Swiss Alps using satellite-derived time-series of snow cover estimates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Alps have historically been crossed by populations moving between northern and southern Europe for various purposes. Testimonies of such human presence were long preserved from decomposition being covered and protected by perennial ice and snow. However, with ongoing climate change, large portion of these permanent snowed and frozen areas are being freed up exposing artifacts to rapid deterioration. Consequently, archaeologists are requiring new methods to monitor the cryosphere enabling them to efficiently identify potential areas of conservation and protection of archaeological remains. Herein, we used a 34-year satellite-derived time-series of snow cover estimates to identify potential zones for conservation of archaeological remains in the Valais alpine region (Switzerland). Findings suggest that over the considered analysis period (1984-2018), snow cover has declined of about 15% during the summer maximum melting season releasing a surface of approximately 45 km(2) in the study area. Moreover, crossing snow probabilities with Topographic Position Index (TPI) and slope data allowed to compute an Archaeological Potential (AP) map to derive zones with high potential of current or imminent release of archaeological remains. Combining this map with density of wood artifacts found on the field in a test area showed that 92.5% are inside identified receding snow/ice areas. Results of this analysis demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be a valid approach to monitor snow/ice minimum extension and identify perennial snowed and iced fields with archaeological potential. It provides the basis for defining new archaeological protection areas, preventing the loss of threatened ancient organic remains and enhances future field research campaigns in mountainous regions.

TI  - Strong methane point sources contribute a disproportionate fraction of total emissions across multiple basins in the United States
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding, prioritizing, and mitigating methane (CH4) emissions requires quantifying CH4 budgets from facility scales to regional scales with the ability to differentiate between source sectors. We deployed a tiered observing system for multiple basins in the United States (San Joaquin Valley, Uinta, Denver-Julesburg, Permian, Marcellus). We quantify strong point source emissions (>10 kg CH4 h(-1)) using airborne imaging spectrometers, attribute them to sectors, and assess their intermittency with multiple revisits. We compare these point source emissions to total basin CH4 fluxes derived from inversion of Sentinel-5p satellite CH4 observations. Across basins, point sources make up on average 40% of the regional flux. We sampled some basins several times across multiple months and years and find a distinct bimodal structure to emission timescales: the total point source budget is split nearly in half by short-lasting and long-lasting emission events. With the increasing airborne and satellite observing capabilities planned for the near future, tiered observing systems will more fully quantify and attribute CH4 emissions from facility to regional scales, which is needed to effectively and efficiently reduce methane emissions.

TI  - Genetic algorithm to optimize the SVM and <i>K</i>-means algorithms for mapping of mineral prospectivity
T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Unsupervised clustering (e.g., K-means) and supervised machine learning [e.g., support vector machines (SVMs)] methods can be used in data-driven classification and predictive mapping of mineral prospectivity. In this study, the conceptual model of porphyry-type Cu deposits in Varzaghan district, Northwest Iran, was utilized to translate mineralization-related processes into mappable targeting criteria, resulting in six evidence layers derived from geochemical, geological, structural and remote sensing data. Then, traditional K-means clustering (KMC) method and a supervised SVM were employed to construct GIS-based mineral prospectivity maps. One of the challenging issues for generation of mineral prospectivity maps using clustering algorithms is to select suitable cluster centers (called centroids) in order to circumscribe the similar spatial features into meaningful clusters. Machine learning methods are strongly sensitive to hyperparameter values that contribute to prediction, as the prediction accuracy can significantly enhance when the optimized hyperparameters are calibrated to training procedure. To reach these goals, a genetic algorithm was incorporated into K-means and SVM in order to automatically select the optimized cluster centroids and tuned hyperparameters, respectively, and two new prospectivity models namely GKMC and genetic-based SVM were then generated. To evaluate the performance accuracy in training procedures of SVM and genetic-based SVM, K-fold cross-validation and confusion matrix were employed. Moreover, success-rate curves were plotted to compare the overall performance of unsupervised clustering models comprising KMC and GKMC and also supervised machine learning models comprising SVM and genetic-based SVM for detection of favorable areas associated with porphyry-type Cu mineralization. The results suggested the superiority of genetic-based SVM model over other models.

TI  - Impacts of aspect on snow characteristics using remote sensing from 2000 to 2020 in Ajichai-Iran
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow is one of the most important sources of fresh water; however, its availability in high altitudes where there are few weather stations, makes it difficult to investigate its characteristics. On the other hand, although satellite imaging has opened new windows for investigating snow, studying it in the long term has not been feasible since retrieving and processing satellite images are extremely time-consuming. Emergence of Google Earth Engine accelerated retrieving and processing of satellite images so that processing 5000 images can be completed in a quite short time. The present study aims to use Google Earth Engine to investigate the effect of elevation and aspect on snow depth, snow water equivalent, snow cover area, snow density, snow permittivity and precipitation. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient of the above snow-related parameters was calculated using Pearson Correlation Coefficient formula. Findings revealed a correlation of above 0.9 between snow depth and snow water equivalent. Later, using The Mann Kendall Trend Test and the Sen's Slope Estimator, all four parameters were analyzed from 2000 to 2020. According to the results, with increasing the altitude, the rate of Sen Slope decreased in northern slopes and showed an increasing trend on the southern slopes.Also, the snow depth and snow water equivalent in the southern slopes at an altitude below 2000 m were 1.5 times and at an altitude of above 2000 m were almost 6 times that of the northern slopes.

TI  - Estimating daily PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations using an extreme gradient boosting model based on VIIRS aerosol products over southeastern Europe
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance of aerosol optical depth (AOD) products from the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) instrument to estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations has been determined at different locations; however, it is still limited over Europe. VIIRS dark target (DT) and deep blue (DB) AOD products at 6-km spatial resolution and independent variables from the MERRA-2 reanalysis were used for estimating daily PM2.5 concentrations in southeastern Europe. An estimation model based on the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) approach was developed and tested for DT and DB AODs. The estimations were compared with daily PM2.5 observations from 122 air quality monitoring stations in five countries, including Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Romania, and Turkey. The estimated PM2.5 concentrations were consistent with ground measurements with the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.82 and 0.78, showing overall low estimation uncertainties with the root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.43 and 8.38 mu g/m(3) and the mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.76 and 5.31 mu g/m(3) for DT and DB AOD datasets, respectively. Independent model results were also discussed based on each country and season. The best estimation accuracy reached the R value of 0.83 with an average RMSE of 9.05 mu g/m(3) and an MAE of 5.84 mu g/m(3) in Turkey with DB AOD. In contrast, the model with DT AOD was highly accurate with the R value of 0.85, showing minor overall uncertainties (i.e., RMSE = 6.08 and 3.31 mu g/m(3)) over Greece. The highest accuracies were obtained in autumn and spring, while the lowest ones were available in winter and summer. This study provides a feasible machine learning approach to estimate PM2.5 using VIIRS AOD products in southeastern Europe.

TI  - Spectrally simplified approach for leveraging legacy geostationary oceanic observations
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of multispectral geostationary satellites to study aquatic ecosystems improves the temporal frequency of observations and mitigates cloud obstruction, but no operational capability presently exists for the coastal and inland waters of the United States. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on the current iteration of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites, termed the R Series (GOES-R), however, provides sub-hourly imagery and the opportunity to overcome this deficit and to leverage a large repository of existing GOES-R aquatic observations. The fulfillment of this opportunity is assessed herein using a spectrally simplified, two-channel aquatic algorithm consistent with ABI wave bands to estimate the diffuse attenuation coefficient for photosynthetically available radiation, K-d(PAR). First, an in situ ABI dataset was synthesized using a globally representative dataset of above- and in-water radiometric data products. Values of K-d(PAR) were estimated by fitting the ratio of the shortest and longest visible wave bands from the in situ ABI dataset to coincident, in situ K-d(PAR) data products. The algorithm was evaluated based on an iterative cross-validation analysis in which 80% of the dataset was randomly partitioned for fitting and the remaining 20% was used for validation. The iteration producing the median coefficient of determination (R-2) value (0.88) resulted in a root mean square difference of 0.319 m(-1), or 8.5% of the range in the validation dataset. Second, coincident mid-day images of central and southern California from ABI and from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were compared using Google Earth Engine (GEE). GEE default ABI reflectance values were adjusted based on a near infrared signal. Matchups between the ABI and MODIS imagery indicated similar spatial variability (R-2 = 0.60) between ABI adjusted blue-to-red reflectance ratio values and MODIS default diffuse attenuation coefficient for spectral downward irradiance at 490 nm, K-d(490), values. This work demonstrates that if an operational capability to provide ABI aquatic data products was realized, the spectral configuration of ABI would potentially support a sub-hourly, visible aquatic data product that is applicable to water-mass tracing and physical oceanography research.

TI  - The need to tailor the omission of axillary lymph node dissection to patients with good prognosis and sentinel node micro-metastases
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Results of IBCSG-23-01-trial which included breast cancer patients with involved sentinel nodes (SN) by isolated-tumor-cells or micro-metastases supported the non-inferiority of completion axillary-lymph-node-dissection (cALND) omission. However, current data are considered insufficient to avoid cALND for all patients with SN-micro-metastases. Methods To investigate the impact of cALND omission on disease-free-survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), we analyzed a cohort of 1421 patients <75 years old with SN-micro-metastases who underwent breast conservative surgery (BCS). We used inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to obtain adjusted Kaplan-Meier estimators representing the experience in the analysis cohort, based on whether all or none had been subject to cALND omission. Results Weighted log-rank tests comparing adjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed significant differences in OS (p-value = 0.002) and borderline significant differences in DFS (p-value = 0.090) between cALND omission versus cALND. Cox's regression using stabilized IPTW evidenced an average increase in the risk of death associated with cALND omission (HR = 2.77, CI95% = 1.36-5.66). Subgroup analyses suggest that the rates of recurrence and death associated with cALND omission increase substantially after a large period of time in the half sample of women less likely to miss cALND. Conclusions Using IPTW to estimate the causal treatment effect of cALND in a large retrospective cohort, we concluded cALND omission is associated with an increased risk of recurrence and death in women of <75 years old treated by BCS in the absence of a large consensus in favor of omitting cALND. These results are particularly contributive for patients treated by BCS where cALND omission rates increase over time.

TI  - Chronic Opioid Use and Sleep Disorders
T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE CLINICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chronic opioid use is an established risk factor for impaired sleep architecture and SDB, especially CSA. These sleep-related consequences result in daytime impairment, including daytime hypersomnolence, fatigue, depression, and neurocognitive impairment. A careful medical history assessment and close follow-up are essential in patients using chronic opioids. Meanwhile, a large number of patients on opioids are found dead in bed, and postmortem, no cause is found, except presence of opioids and other drugs in the blood. We speculate that either a terminal apnea, or an arrhythmia could be a potential cause. In regard to arrhythmia and opioids, an association between methadone and torsade de pointes was first described in 2002 and subsequently found to be mediated by a blockade of the human ion channel responsible for the delayed rectifier potassium current.(58) A boxed warning was added to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling for methadone in 2006 about arrhythmia risk followed by a clinical practice guideline in 2009 recommending corrected QT interval screening. SDB associated with chronic opioid use is a diagnostic challenge. When diagnosed, opiates should be tapered or discontinued. Optimal treatment modalities have not been extensively studied in long-term randomized trials as reflected by a paucity of the available literature. Although studies are limited, new-generation ASVs deserve further research and should be attempted in patients with SDB, including CSA induced by chronic opioid use, especially in those who do not respond to conventional modes of therapy, such as CPAP or BPAP. It is important to screen for sleep related or daytime hypoventilation, and if present, consider BPAP with backup respiratory rate over ASV. The overall impact of ASV on SDB induced by chronic opioid use on long-term morbidity and mortality is unknown.

TI  - Where are the trees? Extent, configuration, and drivers of poor forest recovery 30 years after the 1988 Yellowstone fires
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Postfire recovery of fire-adapted forests remains uncertain as climate and fire regimes continue to change. Areas of poor postfire tree regeneration following late-20th-century fires may reveal characteristics associated with increased vulnerability to forest decline. However, sufficient time must have elapsed and pre-and postfire forest cover must be compared to distinguish areas that have not recovered. We used remotely sensed data and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to detect areas of poor forest recovery across > 250,000 ha of area burned as stand-replacing fire 30 years after the 1988 Yellowstone fires. We asked three questions: specialIntscript What is the extent and configuration of sparse and reduced forest recovery? specialIntscript How do vegetation characteristics compare between areas of sparse and reduced recovery vs. recovered forest? specialIntscript What environmental charac-teristics explain the distribution and patch size of sparse and reduced recovery? We related postfire (2013-14) NDVI to field-measured stem density to establish an NDVI threshold of sparse tree regeneration, and we con-trasted pre-(1986-87) and postfire (2018-19) NDVI as a proxy for pre-and postfire forest cover. Sparse and reduced forest recovery occupied -41,000 ha across the burned area, about half of which was symbolscript 150 m from ex situ seed sources. Patches of poor recovery were generally large, with -13,400 ha in patches symbolscript 50 ha and an area-weighted mean patch size of 97 ha. Vegetation was short (<2 m) in areas of sparse and reduced recovery and non-evergreen biomass was three times greater than in recovered forest. Sparse and reduced recovery was more likely at high elevations, on steep slopes, and far from ex situ seed sources, and patches were larger at high elevations and far from seed sources. It took 20 years for sparse and reduced recovery to be distinguishable from recovered forest using NDVI, suggesting a time lag before remotely sensed data can detect alternative pathways of postfire forest recovery. Now, 30 years after the 1988 fires,-16 % of the forest burned as stand-replacing fire has failed to recover. The extent and configuration of these areas suggest some may persist as sparse or non-forest for the foreseeable future, with implications for biodiversity and ecosystem processes.

TI  - Digital soil mapping of peatland using airborne radiometric data and supervised machine learning - Implication for the assessment of carbon stock
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands account for approx. 4.23 million km(2) of the land surface of Earth and between 5 % and 20 % of the global soil carbon stock, however much uncertainty exists. The release of carbon from modified peatlands is significant and affects the global carbon balance. The importance of conservation and rehabilitation of peatlands is clear. Global estimates currently use national scale mapping strategies that vary depending on available resources and national interest. The most up-to-date methods rely on satellite remote sensing data, which detect peat based on a multiband spectral signature, or reflected radar backscatter. However, satellite data may not be capable of detecting peat under landcover such as pasture or forest. Airborne geophysical surveys provide relevant subsurface information to update or redefine peatland extent maps at a national scale. Radiometric surveys, which measure the naturally occurring geologically sourced potassium, uranium, and thorium, offer the largest potential. Modelling of gamma ray attenuation shows that peat has a distinctive attenuation signature, due to its low bulk density, when considering all recorded radiometric data. This study exploits this signature by combining airborne radiometric data in a machine learning framework and training an artificial neural network to detect those data which have been acquired over previously mapped peatlands. A similar to 95 % predictability is achieved. The trained neural network can be then used to predict the extent of all peatlands within a region, including forested and agriculturally modified peatlands, and an updated peatland map can be produced. This methodology has implications for global carbon stock assessment and rehabilitation projects where similar datasets exist or are planned, by updating the extent and boundary positions of current peatlands and uncovering previously unknown peatlands under forestry or grasslands.

TI  - Filth Fly Parasitoid (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) Monitoring Techniques and Species Composition in Poultry Layer Facilities
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Muscid flies, especially house flies (Musca domestica L.) (Diptera: Muscidae), are a major pest of poultry layer facilities. Augmentative biological control of muscid flies with pteromalid wasps has gained increased attention in recent years. Knowing which pteromalid species are present in a specific area could produce more effective filth fly control. The purpose of this project was to survey parasitoid populations in poultry layer facilities in central and southeastern Pennsylvania from June through September. Two genera of parasitoids, Spalangia and Trichomalopsis, were collected over the course of the survey. Overall, out of 3,724 parasitized pupae the species collected in order of most to least common were Spalangia cameroni Perkins, Spalangia nigroaenea Curtis, Trichomalopsis spp., and Spalangia endius Walker. House fly parasitism overall and by each parasitoid species varied by location and over the four study months. A second objective was to evaluate a new parasitoid trap for surveying parasitoid wasp populations. This device uses a combination of house fly third instars and development media. This was compared to a more traditional method, the sentinel bag, which uses only fly pupae. A higher proportion of Spalangia spp. emerged from the new trap design and more Trichomalopsis spp. emerged from the sentinel bag. This suggests that using this new device alongside the traditional collection method may result in more accurate sampling of pteromalid populations.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain pastures are essential for maintainig biodiversity and local economies. Despite the great value and fragility of these ecosystems, an up-to-date overview of extent and type of alpine pastures is lacking in many areas of the Alps. In this study, the interpretation of ancillary information combined with expeditious field campaigns, and the harmonization of classification methodologies allowed us to: (1) define the spatial extent of mountain pastures; (2) identify the non-grazeable percentage in these areas; (3) Characterize and map pasture types within the Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy), where 4596 ha of grazeable areas were mapped. Among the 13 categories identified, the three most represented in the park are Bare thermophile grasslands (38%), Nardus swards (20%), and Alpine intermediate grasslands (18%). The maps obtained in this study are useful for animal management during the grazing season, and have the capability of geographically assessing potential forage avaibility through modeling and remote sensing data.

TI  - A novel algorithm for the generation of gap-free time series by fusing harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 observations with PhenoCam time series for detecting land surface phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is one of the most sensitive indicators to environmental and climate changes. In order to characterize the seasonal variation in relatively pure or homogenous vegetation types, fine spatial resolution satellite data (<= 30 m), such as Landsat, Sentinel-2, PlanetScope, or Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS), have been increasingly applied to detect land surface phenology (LSP). However, the most critical challenge in LSP detections is the gaps in temporal satellite observations caused by noise and persistent cloud/snow cover. Therefore, this study presented a novel algorithm for generating synthetic gap-free time series at the field scale (30 m) for LSP detections. Specifically, we first developed a framework to establish a large collection of temporal shapes of vegetation growth with as many as 100 grid-based Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) time series in a single PhenoCam site. For a given HLS pixel, the two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) time series was matched and fused with the most comparable temporal GCC shape selected from the collection of PhenoCam GCC time series to generate a synthetic gap-free HLS-PhenoCam EVI2 time series, which was used to detect the 30 m phenometrics. The detected phenometrics were evaluated using manually selected and spatially matched GCC observations as well as phenology detections from HLS alone. The result indicates that the HLS-PhenoCam phenometrics are very close to the observations from PhenoCam network with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.82-0.97, a mean absolute difference (MAD) of 2.8-3.5 days, a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.5-4.0 days, and a mean systematic bias (MSB) of 0.1-2.2 days. The HLS-PhenoCam detections are significantly improved relative to the HLS phenometrics that have a statistic accuracy of R = 0.57-0.78, MAD = 6.4-9.3 days, RMSE = 8.8-13.9 days, MSB =-5.2-5.9 days. The difference between HLS-PhenoCam and HLS alone LSP detections over a HLS tile could be on average larger than two weeks if high-quality observation (HQO) proportion in the annual HLS time series is <10%, which exponentially reduces with the increase of HQO in HLS observations. The an-alyses in this study suggest that the gap-free HLS-PhenoCam time series is able to be generated for producing high-quality phenology datasets across a local and regional scale, to bridge near-surface PhenoCam observations with satellite observations data at various scales, and to be used as a scalable phenology dataset for the validation of global MODIS and VIIRS LSP products.

TI  - Caught on camera: Field imagery reveals the unexpected importance of vertebrates for biological control of the banana weevil (<i>Cosmopolites sordidus</i> Col. Curculionidae)
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding of ecological interactions is necessary for the application of biological control. Banana is the second most produced fruit worldwide and the banana weevil (Cosmopolites sordidus) is the most important pest of banana and plantain. Its biological control remains challenging because of the robustness and cryptic behaviour of the adult and the hidden development of larval stages. Researchers therefore tend to favour conservation biological control of this pest. The commonly used methods for measuring the effects of natural enemies on the regulation of this pest focus on invertebrates and may underestimate the role of vertebrates on biological control. Using cameras, we recorded the predation of sentinel adult weevils in banana plots in La Reunion island that differed in weevil infestation levels and in animal biodiversity. To facilitate image analysis, we used background subtraction to isolate moving parts of image sequences and thus detect predators and predation events. Our cameras recorded only vertebrates as predators of adult banana weevils. The most important predator appeared to be the Asian shrew (Suncus murinus), which was responsible for 67% of the predation events. Other predators included the house mouse (Mus musculus), the oriental garden lizard (Calotes versicolor), and the guttural toad (Sclerophrys gutturalis). The exact time of predation events were determined from the images metadata. It was thus possible to identify predator foraging periods that coincided with activity of adult weevils. Our results confirm that images provide useful information for biological and ecological studies. Along with other recent studies, our results suggest that the role of vertebrates in biological control may be underestimated. Based on these results, we advocate for several management implications such as the installation of hedges, grasslands, and ponds to favour these vertebrate predators of the banana weevil, possibly also favouring other vertebrate and invertebrate natural enemies.

TI  - Remote sensing of tropical riverine water quality using sentinel-2 MSI and field observations
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the water quality as well as assessing its ecological status, both in coastal and inland environments, are essential tasks and pose serious environmental challenges. Although both field measurements and observations from permanent measuring stations may be available, the advent of modern remote sensors, such as MSI (MultiSpectral Instrument), on board the Sentinel-2 satellite, has made it possible to obtain inland biogeochemical products at high spatial (10 m) and temporal (5-days) resolutions. However, validating Sentinel-2 derived water quality estimations in tropical riverine and costal water is an ongoing effort.This study presents one of the first attempts to locally adapt and validate the C2RCC atmospheric processor for the inversion of IOPs to water quality parameters of productive tropical riverine waters in South East Asia using a time series of 65 Sentinel-2 MSI images from 2018 to 2021. We developed locally adapted relationships between C2X-Nets-derived inherent optical properties (IOPs) and surface reflectances with field observations of chl-a concentration, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), turbidity, transparency, and in situ reflectance spectra. Results have been validated against 3-years long time series of observations collected at six monitoring stations of the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority (MWA) of Thailand covering approximately 130 km-long stretch of the Chao Phraya river.Locally adapted C2X-Net processor showed good performances in predicting the chl-a concentrations, turbidity and Secchi disk depth. However, relatively low performance was noted for C2X-Nets processor in predicting CDOM absorption. During the period 2018-2021, the temporal trends of chl-a concentration and turbidity showed a clear seasonal pattern with peak turbidity values in the wet seasons. Spatial pattern of retrieved water quality products showed a noticeable change in correspondence with the built-up area of Bangkok. Even if elevated chl-a concentrations have been generally observed all year around, highest peaks have been observed in the dry and at beginning of the wet seasons.To the best knowledge of the authors, our findings firstly demonstrated the integration potential of C2RCC and satellite-retrieved water quality estimations into existing national water quality monitoring network in the context of water resources management and decision-making in the tropical Southeast Asian countries.

TI  - Compensating Errors in Cloud Radiative and Physical Properties over the Southern Ocean in the CMIP6 Climate Models
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern Ocean is covered by a large amount of clouds with high cloud albedo. However, as reported by previous climate model intercomparison projects, underestimated cloudiness and overestimated absorption of solar radiation (ASR) over the Southern Ocean lead to substantial biases in climate sensitivity. The present study revisits this long-standing issue and explores the uncertainty sources in the latest CMIP6 models. We employ 10-year satellite observations to evaluate cloud radiative effect (CRE) and cloud physical properties in five CMIP6 models that provide comprehensive output of cloud, radiation, and aerosol. The simulated longwave, shortwave, and net CRE at the top of atmosphere in CMIP6 are comparable with the CERES satellite observations. Total cloud fraction (CF) is also reasonably simulated in CMIP6, but the comparison of liquid cloud fraction (LCF) reveals marked biases in spatial pattern and seasonal variations. The discrepancies between the CMIP6 models and the MODIS satellite observations become even larger in other cloud macro- and micro-physical properties, including liquid water path (LWP), cloud optical depth (COD), and cloud effective radius, as well as aerosol optical depth (AOD). However, the large underestimation of both LWP and cloud effective radius (regional means similar to 20% and 11%, respectively) results in relatively smaller bias in COD, and the impacts of the biases in COD and LCF also cancel out with each other, leaving CRE and ASR reasonably predicted in CMIP6. An error estimation framework is employed, and the different signs of the sensitivity errors and biases from CF and LWP corroborate the notions that there are compensating errors in the modeled shortwave CRE. Further correlation analyses of the geospatial patterns reveal that CF is the most relevant factor in determining CRE in observations, while the modeled CRE is too sensitive to LWP and COD. The relationships between cloud effective radius, LWP, and COD are also analyzed to explore the possible uncertainty sources in different models. Our study calls for more rigorous calibration of detailed cloud physical properties for future climate model development and climate projection.

TI  - PECA-FY4A: Precipitation Estimation using Chromatographic Analysis methodology for full-disc multispectral observations from FengYun-4A/AGRI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-real-time precipitation estimates based on geostationary meteorological satellites are of great importance for monitoring hydrology-related disasters. Currently, the contributions of multispectral infrared observations to precipitation estimation have not been fully understood thus far. Motivated by estimating precipitation based on real-time data from geostationary satellites, this study proposes the Precipitation Estimation using Chromato-graphic Analysis (PECA) methodology based on full-disc observations from Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) of FengYun-4A (FY-4A). Compared with PERSIANN-CCS and FY4AQPE-Official, the results of PECA (PECA-FY4A) are comprehensively evaluated against the GSOD (global gauge data), CMS (Chinese gauge data) and IMERG-LR (micro-wave precipitation products) for the period from January, 2019 to November, 2021. The findings and conclusions mainly include but are not limited to the following: (1) PECA clearly reveals that T12, Delta T10_ 14, Delta T7_ 14, and Delta T7_ 8 are effective for estimating precipitation volumes, with strong correlation to precipitation volumes but significantly less redundant information. (2) IR band differences are still sensitive to heavy precipitation although the abilities of single IR bands have become insufficient. For example, Delta T7_8 are sensitive to heavy precipitation in the eye walls of the typhoons. (3) The evaluation results show that PERSIANN-CCS generally outperforms FY4AQPE-Official, while PECA-FY4A features significant improvements over PERSIANN-CCS (the international benchmark of IR precipitation products) in terms of CC (-10%,-100%, and -21%), RMSE (-20%,-36%, and -11%), and CSI (-25%,-100%, and -12%) against IMERG-LR, CMS and GSOD, respectively. The findings are expected to considerably contribute towards extending the current three-geostationary-satellite-series network (GOES, Meteosat, and Himawari) in PERSIANN-CCS to a four-geostationary-satellite-series network (by adding FY-4A and FY-4B) using PECA with higher quality, especially over the Asia-Pacific areas.

TI  - Sentinel-2 satellite and HYSPLIT model suggest that local cereal harvesting substantially contribute to peak<i> Alternaria</i> spore concentrations
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Alternaria is a human/animal allergen and plant/animal pathogen. Cereal harvesting emits a large amount of Alternaria spores into the atmosphere. However, estimating the peak spore periods and source areas from large areas is often a challenge because of insufficient observation stations. The purpose of this study was to examine, using remote sensing and an atmospheric transport and dispersion model, the contribution of cereal harvesting to peak Alternaria spore concentrations. Daily Alternaria spores were collected using Hirst-type traps in 12 sites in Europe for the period 2016-2018. Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) back -trajectory and dispersion model was integrated with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, Corine Land Cover 2018 (CLC2018) and Eurostat cereal data 2016 to map the Alternaria spore peaks and source areas in the 12 sites. Ground truth harvest data, collected at Worcester, UK, in 2018, and meteorological data were used to determine any effect of cereal harvesting and weather on peak spore concentrations. The results showed that the Sentinel-2 satellite detected agricultural areas that underwent intensive harvesting and this coincided with a rapid increase of Alternaria spore concentrations. Furthermore, local agricultural areas cultivated with cereals were the main sources of the peak Alternaria spore concentrations in all the study sites. Remote agricultural and non-agricultural sources, to a lesser extent, contributed to the peak spore concentrations at some sites, e.g. Borstel, Leicester and Worcester. Temperature during the harvesting periods (July and August) was found to significantly contribute to the peak spore concentrations. Overall, the study showed that it is possible to use Sentinel-2 satellite data alongside atmospheric transport and dispersion models to estimate periods of peak Alternaria spore concentra-tions and sources at a continental scale. This approach can be replicated for other bioaerosols that affect human health, agriculture and forestry.

TI  - Therapeutic strategies in ischemic cardiomyopathy: Focus on mitochondria! quality surveillance
T2  - EBIOMEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite considerable efforts to prevent and treat ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), effective therapies remain lacking, in part owing to the complexity of the underlying molecular mechanisms, which are not completely understood yet. It is now widely thought that mitochondria serve as "sentinel" organelles that are capable of detecting cellular injury and integrating multiple stress signals. These pathophysiological activities are temporally and spatially governed by the mitochondrial quality surveillance (MQS) system, involving mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, and biogenesis. Dysregulation of MQS is an early and critical process contributing to mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction and sublethal injury to cardiomyocytes during ICM. An improved understanding of the pathogenesis of ICM may enable the development of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming the challenge of myocardial ischemia and its cardiovascular sequelae. This review describes recent research on the protective effects of MQS in ICM and highlights promising therapeutic targets. Copyright (C) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Whiskers provide time-series of toxic and essential trace elements, Se:Hg molar ratios, and stable isotope values of an apex Antarctic predator, the leopard seal
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In an era of rapid environmental change and increasing human presence, researchers need efficient tools for tracking contaminants to monitor the health of Antarctic flora and fauna. Here, we examined the utility of leopard seal whiskers as a biomonitoring tool that reconstructs time-series of significant ecological and physiological biomarkers. Leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) are a sentinel species in the Western Antarctic Peninsula due to their apex predator status and top-down effects on several Antarctic species. However, there are few data on their contaminant loads. We analyzed leopard seal whiskers (n = 18 individuals, n = 981 segments) collected during 2018-2019 field seasons to acquire longitudinal profiles of non-essential (Hg, Pb, and Cd) and essential (Se, Cu, and Zn) trace elements, stable isotope (delta N-15 and delta O-13) values and to assess Hg risk with Se:Hg molar ratios. Whiskers provided between 46 and 286 cumulative days of growth with a mean similar to 125 days per whisker = 18). Adult whiskers showed variability in non -essential trace elements over time that could partly be explained by changes indict. Whisker Hg levels were insufficient (<20 ppm) to consider most seals being at "high" risk for Hg toxicity. Nevertheless, maximum Hg concentrations observed in this study were greater than that of leopard seal hair measured two decades ago. However, variation in the Se:Hg molar ratios over time suggest that Se may detoxify Hg burden in leopard seals. Overall, we provide evidence that the analysis of leopard seal whiskers allows for the reconstruction of time-series ecological and physiological data and can be valuable for opportunistically monitoring the health of the leopard seal population and their Antarctic ecosystem during climate change.

TI  - Plant community assemblages and environmental drivers in the mountainous grassland ecosystem of South Africa
T2  - PHYTOCOENOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of plant communities in the Grassland biome is influenced by multiple environmental variables such as climate, topography, geology, soil, and other ecological processes such as fire and grazing. This study focuses on mapping the grassland plant communities in the Golden Gate Highlands National Park (GGHNP) and determining the environmental factors influencing their spatial distribution.For vegetation classification, the TWINSPAN algorithm was firstly used to do a floristic analysis of 209 sampling plots and refined further using the Braun-Blanquet procedures and JUICE programmes. The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was used to determine the most important environmental variables influencing the spatial distribution of the grassland communities. Environmental spatial data were sourced from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and soil grid databases. The fire frequency was done using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burn area index 2001-2017, and the remote-sensing-based Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) for February 2020 was computed from 2001 to 2020 MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index The phytosociological analysis of the vegetation data resulted in nine major plants communities and five subcommunities. Our GLM analysis showed elevation, clay content, VCI, and fire frequency to be significant at a 95% confidence level and positively correlated with the grassland communities. Soil nitrogen was also significant but negatively correlated with the grassland communities (Z -value = -9.710, p = 0.33).The Spearman Rank Correlation showed a significant but weakly positive correlation between most of the environmental variables (r < 0.5). The identification and understanding of plant communities, as well as their associated environmental drivers, are of fundamental importance in the formulation and execution of biodiversity conservation strategies for the park. The data can also be used in climate change studies and also to monitor vegetation change over time.

TI  - Clinical Practice Guidelines on Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Melanoma: A Systematic Review and Quality Appraisal Using the AGREE II Instrument
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that is standard of care for the evaluation of clinically negative regional lymph nodes in patients with cutaneous melanoma. As the presence of metastases dictates patient prognosis and determines the need for further regional disease control or adjuvant therapy, SLNB is invaluable to clinical decision-making in patients presenting with melanoma. However, the indications for SLNB, specifically among patients with thin (<1 mm) or thick (>4 mm) melanomas, remain unclear. A number of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have been developed outlining recommendations for the role of lymph node biopsy in the management of melanoma. However, to date, their quality has not been critically appraised. Our objective was to systematically evaluate all available CPGs on this topic using the validated Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument. Four total guidelines met the inclusion criteria and underwent appraisal. Only one CPG achieved a "high" quality rating, indicating scores of >60% in at least five of the six AGREE II domains. Across all CPGs, the lowest scoring domains were "Applicability" and "Stakeholder involvement," which had average scores of 41.2% and 48.3%, respectively. Based on the AGREE II instrument, the quality of existing CPGs for the indications of SLNB for melanoma is low. Future guidelines should be pilot tested to evaluate barriers to application and should utilize multidisciplinary guideline development teams that include patients and key stakeholders in addition to clinical experts from all relevant disciplines.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction The COVID-19 restrictions have a lot of various peripheral negative and positive effects, like economic shocks and decreasing air pollution, respectively. Many studies showed NO2 reduction in most parts of the world. Methods Iran and its land and maritime neighbors have about 7.4% of the world population and 6.3% and 5.8% of World COVID-19 cases and deaths, respectively. The air pollution indices of them such as CH4 (Methane), CO_1 (CO), H2O (Water), HCHO (Tropospheric Atmospheric Formaldehyde), NO2 (Nitrogen oxides), O-3 (ozone), SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide), UVAI_AAI [UV Aerosol Index (UVAI)/Absorbing Aerosol Index (AAI)] are studied from the First quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2021 with Copernicus Sentinel 5 Precursor (S5P) satellite data set from Google Earth Engine. The outliers are detected based on the depth functions. We use a two-sample t test, Wilcoxon test, and interval-wise testing for functional data to control the familywise error rate. Result The adjusted p value comparison between Q2 of 2019 and Q2 of 2020 in NO2 for almost all countries is statistically significant except Iraq, UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait. But, the CO and HCHO are not statistically significant in any country. Although CH4, O-3, and UVAI_AAI are statistically significant for some countries. In the Q2 comparison for NO2 between 2020 and 2021, only Iran, Armenia, Turkey, UAE, and Saudi Arabia are statistically significant. However, Ch(4) is statistically significant for all countries except Azerbaijan. Conclusions The comparison with and without adjusted p values declares the decreases in some air pollution in these countries.

T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Offshore wind energy is at the advent of a massive global expansion. To investigate the development of the offshore wind energy sector, optimal offshore wind farm locations, or the impact of offshore wind farm projects, a freely accessible spatiotemporal data set of offshore wind energy infrastructure is necessary. With free and direct access to such data, it is more likely that all stakeholders who operate in marine and coastal environments will become involved in the upcoming massive expansion of offshore wind farms. To that end, we introduce the DeepOWT (Deep-learning-derived Offshore Wind Turbines) data set (available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5933967, Hoeser and Kuenzer, 2022b), which provides 9941 offshore wind energy infrastructure locations along with their deployment stages on a global scale. DeepOWT is based on freely accessible Earth observation data from the Sentinel-1 radar mission. The offshore wind energy infrastructure locations were derived by applying deep-learning-based object detection with two cascading convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to search the entire Sentinel-1 archive on a global scale. The two successive CNNs have previously been optimised solely on synthetic training examples to detect the offshore wind energy infrastructures in real-world imagery. With subsequent temporal analysis of the radar signal at the detected locations, the Deep-OWT data set reports the deployment stages of each infrastructure with a quarterly frequency from July 2016 until June 2021. The spatiotemporal information is compiled in a ready-to-use geographic information system (GIS) format to make the usability of the data set as accessible as possible.

TI  - Evaluation of Desertification in the Middle Moulouya Basin (North-East Morocco) Using Sentinel-2 Images and Spectral Index Techniques
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on the quantitative assessment of desertification in the Middle Moulouya basin located in the North-East of Morocco. Indeed, this study aimed to map the degree of desertification at the level of the basin in 2018 using the Sentinel-2 image. To do this, we have adopted a methodology based on several stages. First, we extracted the spectral indices, in particular, the NDVI, the albedo, the TGSI and the MSAVI. Then, different combinations of these indices were the subject of a linear regression analysis (NDVI-albedo, MSAVI-albedo, albedo-TGSI and TGSI-MSAVI) to use the best correlated combinations to construct the feature space. The results obtained showed that the NDVI-albedo and MSAVI-albedo combinations are the best correlated with respective correlation coefficients of r = - 0.73 and r = - 0.76, respectively. As a result, they were used to propose the desertification degree index (DDI) by exploiting the NDVI-albedo and MSAVI-albedo feature spaces. Finally, a desertification map was generated for the entire basin. It has five degrees of desertification (extreme, severe, moderate, low, non-desertification). According to our results, the situation of desertification in the basin is alarming. Indeed, 86.86% of the study area is located in the moderate to extreme desertification class. While only 12.25% and 0.89% fall in the low and no desertification categories, respectively. The MSAVI-albedo model gave a high overall accuracy of 93.75%, so it is perfectly effective for the quantitative analysis and monitoring of desertification at the level of the basin studied.

TI  - Combining Sentinel-2 data with an optical-trapezoid approach to infer within-field soil moisture variability and monitor agricultural production stages
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important precision agricultural variable that can be used to identify optimal growth conditions, infer vegetation stress, and maximize crop yield. However, obtaining soil moisture information with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution for such applications remains a challenge. The optical trapezoid model (OPTRAM), a shortwave infrared transformed reflectance and normalized difference vegetation index (STR-NDVI) method, has previously been used for retrieving soil moisture from optical remote sensing data. However, the capacity of OPTRAM for mapping the high-resolution spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture at individual agricultural field scales has yet to be explored. Here, we advance an approach for retrieving and quantifying the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture for individual fields using high spatiotemporal resolution Sentinel-2 imagery. We also propose the concept of a dynamic STR-NDVI space for identification of irrigation events and crop growth stages, such as irrigation start and end dates, and dates of initial crop growth, maturity and harvest. Preexisting OPTRAM parameterization schemes were evaluated for several crops (maize, carrot, alfalfa and Rhodes grass) and a new scheme was proposed. Results show that the original OPTRAM model can derive surface soil moisture (similar to 1 cm in depth) with acceptable coefficients of determination (R-2 >= 0.43) and root mean square errors (RMSE <= 0.09 m(3)/m(3)) against ground measurements when uniform dry and wet edge parameters are applied for all crop types. The proposed scheme produced improved soil moisture retrievals with an R-2 >= 0.65 and RMSE <= 0.05 m(3)/m(3) when the specific dry and wet edge parameters were applied for each specific crop type. By analyzing time series of STR-NDVI, we demonstrate that the dynamic STR-NDVI spaces not only traces the coevolution of surface processes but also quantifies the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture and vegetation status. Thus, the proposed dynamic STR-NDVI spaces based on the high spatiotemporal resolution Sentinel-2 imagery can both advance and extend the application of OPTRAM and improve the interpretation of soil moisture spatial heterogeneity at agricultural field scales, supporting efforts towards irrigation and crop growth monitoring in precision agriculture.

TI  - Trends in Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Concentration Along the Krishna-Godavari Basin as Observed From MODIS Archives
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Krishna-Godavari basin (KG), located along the southeast coast of India, is a proven rich source of gas hydrates exploration zone. An understanding of surface water conditions in this region is necessary to study the coastal dynamics, and the implications of pollutants to the marine ecological environment. Here, we report the long-term trends and spatio-temporal variability in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the KG basin, and discuss the dynamics of Chl-a patterns from 2002 to 2021. Monthly Chl-a averages from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used for the analysis of trends and seasonal distributions by linear regression fitting. Our results revealed a downward trend in Chl-a concentrations, with a value of -0.000003 mg/m(3) per month. A noticeable decreasing trend in the sediment load was also observed from the major rivers drained into the KG basin. The monthly runoff, precipitation, and wind fields were analysed to understand the Chl-a distribution patterns during the study period. We observed that runoff, precipitation, and wind forcing are the primary drivers controlling Chl-a distributions and dispersion patterns in the study area. The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the potential impacts of Chl-a to marine ecosystem, and provides new tools for assessing long-term trends in satellite-derived Chl-a concentrations in the prospective of climate change scenarios.

TI  - Assessing forest health using remote sensing-based indicators and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process in Valmiki Tiger Reserve, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activities, climate variability and environmental stresses have greatly affected forest ecosystems globally. Thus, monitoring of forest health is essential for proper planning and effective management. The present study employed an integrated approach of remote sensing and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to assess the forest health in the Valmiki Tiger Reserve in India. Advanced vegetation index, normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference moisture index, forest fragmentation, rainfall and soil types were derived from remote sensing data. Multiple buffer zones of villages, roads, railways and canals were also determined for analyzing the forest health status. These layers were prepared in the geographical information system. These layers were given weightage using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. These layers were integrated to prepare forest health map using weighted overlay method. The results revealed that the largest forest area was found under moderately healthy forest (37%) followed by healthy forest (31%) and unhealthy forest (13%). Of the total area of the Reserve, 19% area was under non-forest category. Human-induced disturbances such as encroachment, illegal sand mining, livestock grazing and forest conversion to agriculture have been attributed to the unhealthy forest in the Reserve. The receiver operating characteristic curve value and area under curve (0.792) show reliability of forest health map. The findings of this study may be helpful for forest managers, conservationists and local communities in devising sustainable strategies for effective management of the forest. The methodological framework adopted in this study may be utilized in other geographical regions interested in assessing forest health.

TI  - Investigation of Topographical Controls on the Groundwater Potential Zone in a Hilly Watershed Using a Geospatial and Geophysical Approach
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation of groundwater potential zone (GWPZ) in hilly regions is challenging due to its steep slopes, runoff, erosion, landslides, and changing land use patterns. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and remotely sensed data are integrated with Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) to identify the critical markers influencing the GPWZ. The findings suggest slope exposure, relief, fractures, and weathering are critical features of GWPZ. Hill slopes have distinct zones of varied recharge, whereas foot of a hill has an evenly distributed recharge area with significant evapotranspiration depending on landscape characteristics. The study demonstrates how integrated technologies might aid in overcoming the challenges. The linear combination method of weighted overlay is applied to integrate the GIS maps of different groundwater potential indexes (GWPI) using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method. The final map suggests that about 75% of the Aglar watershed in the Tehri Garhwal District, Uttarakhand, India, falls under the "moderate" to "high" GWPZ category, 17% area of the watershed falls under "very high" GWPZ, and the rest 8% of the area is under "very low" to "low" GWPZ. Subsequent integration of 2D ERT with the remote sensing (RS) and GIS outputs, yields a vertical subsurface mapping of soil heterogeneities with an effective depth of saturation that quantifies the GWPZ. The zone of saturation is mainly controlled by fractures and the weathered formation where electrical resistivity ranges between 25 and 225 omega-m. The mapping techniques affirm that the northern aspect of the watershed has a higher potential for groundwater occurrence than the southern aspect.

TI  - Extended validation and evaluation of the OLCI-SLSTR SYNERGY aerosol product (SY_2_AOD) on Sentinel-3
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the first extended validation of a new SYNERGY global aerosol product (SY_2_AOD), which is based on synergistic use of data from the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) and the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) sensors aboard the Copernicus Sentinel-3A (S3A) and Sentinel-3B (S3B) satellites. Validation covers period from 14 January 2020 to 30 September 2021. Several approaches, including statistical analysis, time series analysis, and comparison with similar aerosol products from the other spaceborne sensor, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), were applied for validation and evaluation of S3A and S3B SY_2 aerosol products, including aerosol optical depth (AOD) provided at different wavelengths, AOD pixel-level uncertainties, fine-mode AOD, and Angstrom exponent.Over ocean, the performance of SY_2 AOD (syAOD) retrieved at 550 nm is good: for S3A and S3B, Pearson correlation coefficients with the Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) component of the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) are 0.88 and 0.85, respectively; 88.6% and 89.5% of pixels fit into the MODIS error envelope (EE) of +/- 0.05 +/- 0.2 x AOD.Over land, correlation coefficients with AERONET AOD (aAOD) are 0.60 and 0.63 for S3A and S3B, respectively; 51.4% and 57.9% of pixels fit into MODIS EE. Reduced performance over land is expected since the surface reflectance and angular distribution of scattering are higher and more difficult to predict over land than over ocean. The results are affected by a large number of outliers.Evaluation of the per-retrieval uncertainty with the chi(2) test indicates that syAOD prognostic uncertainties (PU) are slightly underestimated (chi(2) = 3.1); if outliers are removed, PU describes the syAOD error well (chi(2) = 1.6).The regional analysis of the Angstrom exponent, which relates to the aerosol size distribution, shows spatial correlation with expected sources. For 40% of the matchups with AERONET in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and for 60% of the matchups in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), which fit into the AE size range of [1, 1.8], an offset between SY_2 AE (syAE) and AERONET AE (aAE) is within +/- 0.25. General overestimation of low (<0.5) syAE and underestimation of high (> 1.8) syAE results in high (0.94, globally) overall bias.Good agreement (bias < 0.03) was observed between Sy_2 fine-mode AOD (syFMAOD) and AERONET fine-mode AOD (aFMAOD) for aFMAOD < 1. At aFMAOD > 1, syFMAOD is considerably underestimated (by 0.3-0.5 in different aFMAOD ranges) in the NH. In the SH, only a few aFMAOD values above 1 are measured. The fine-mode fraction (FMF) in the SY_2 AOD product (syFMF) in the range of [0, 0.7] is overestimated; the positive offset of 0.3-0.5 for low (< 0.25) FMF gradually decreases.Differences between the annual and seasonal AOD values from SY_2 and MODIS (mod) Dark Target and Deep Blue products are within 0.02 for the study area (30 degrees S-60 degrees N, 80 degrees W-45 degrees E). The agreement is better over ocean; however, a difference up to 0.6 exists between syFMF and modFMF. Over bright land surface (Saharan desert) the difference in AOD between the two products is highest (up to 0.11); the sign of the difference varies over time and space.For both S3A and S3B AOD products, validation statistics are often slightly better in the Southern Hemisphere. In general, the performance of S3B is slightly better.

TI  - Inducing flooding index for vegetation mapping in water-land ecotone with Sentinel-1 & Sentinel-2 images: A case study in Dongting Lake, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water-land ecotone is a core area of wetlands which play an important role in ecological function. The infor-mation of vegetation type on the water-land ecotone is important for detecting the health of the wetland, and its protection. Seasonal flooding is a key factor in controlling the environment in water-land ecotone. Even pre-venting direct detection of the flooded vegetation with satellites, seasonal flooding has effects on the distribution of plants, which may provide potential information on vegetation classification with satellites. Therefore, the study induces flooding index in vegetation mapping in water-land ecotone with satellites. We applied Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to map vegetation in the Dongting Lake with random forest method. The Sentinel-1 SAR images were used to obtain the flooding index (i.e. inundation frequency), and Sentinel-2 images were applied to acquire the optical characteristic of vegetation. A comparative experiment based on whether the flooding index was added or not during vegetation mapping in the Dongting Lake was carried out to explore the role of flooding index in vegetation mapping. The results concluded that (1) seasonal flooding will hinder vegetation mapping using a single phase of optical information; (2) the classification accuracy of single phase scenario was signifi-cantly improved with the aid of flooding index especially in wet season; (3) the classification accuracy can be somewhat improved by adding flooding index for the multi-temporal scenario. The study implies that inundation frequency information can be used for vegetation mapping in water-land ecotone, especially for complex regions with insufficient cloud-free satellite images.

TI  - Phytoplankton biomass variation after cage aquaculture removal from the Daheiting Reservoir, China: observations from satellite data
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Cage-based aquaculture has been gradually discontinued in many lakes and reservoirs in China to reduce eutrophication triggered by the feed. This study aimed to analyse variations in phytoplankton biomass in Daheiting Reservoir before and after cage removal. Cage aquaculture in this reservoir was terminated in the spring of 2017. Changes in phytoplankton biomass were analysed using multispectral satellite data. Chlorophyll a concentration increased from 2016 to 2018, but decreased from 2018 to 2021. Cyanobacterial blooms were absent from 2016 to 2017, but suddenly appeared over an area of similar to 12.76 km(2) in 2018 and gradually decreased to 0.55 km(2) in 2021. Following the removal of cage aquaculture in 2017, phytoplankton biomass of the reservoir initially rapidly increased, peaking in 2018, and then declined. The rapid, short-term increase in phytoplankton biomass after cage removal might be due to sudden lack of algae predators (silver carp, bighead carp, and sturgeon, prey on algae and plankton), as cultured fish were removed from the reservoir. Decreased nutrient input in the water and the growth of wild fish resulted in subsequent decreases in phytoplankton biomass. These findings provide a reference for research methods and decision support for the change in phytoplankton biomass after cage removal.

TI  - Assessing the effects of ultraviolet radiation, residential greenness and air pollution on vitamin D levels: A longitudinal cohort study in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Vitamin D metabolism is essential in aging and can be affected by multiple environmental factors. However, most studies conducted single exposure analyses. We aim to assess the individual and combined effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, residential greenness, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and ozone (O3) on vitamin D levels in a national cohort study of older adults in China. We used the 2012 and 2014 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey data, and measured the environmental exposure in the same year. We interpolated the UV radiation from monitoring stations, measured residential greenness through satellite-derived Normalized Dif-ference Vegetation Index (NDVI), modeled PM2.5 with satellite data, and estimated O3 using machine learning. We dichotomized serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D), the primary circulating form of vitamin D, into non -deficiency (>= 50 nmol/L) and deficiency (<50 nmol/L) categories. We used the generalized estimating equation for analysis, adjusted for sociodemographic information, lifestyle, physical condition, and season of blood draw, and calculated joint odds ratios based on the Cumulative Risk Index. We also explored the interaction between interested exposures, modification of participants' characteristics, and potential mediation. We included 1,336 participants, with a mean age of 83 at baseline. In single exposure models, the odds ratios of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) for per interquartile range increase in UV radiation, NDVI, PM2.5, and O3 and decrease were 0.39 (95 % CI:0.33,0.46), 0.90 (0.81,1.00), 1.65 (1.53,1.78), 1.67 (1.46,1.92), respectively. UV radiation mediated nearly 48 % and 78 % of the relationship between VDD and PM2.5 and O3, respectively. The association between UV radiation and VDD was stronger in females than men (OR: 2.25 vs 1.22). UV radiation, residential greenness can protect against VDD, while, PM2.5 and O3 increase the risk of VDD. UV radiation partly mediated the association between air pollution and VDD.

TI  - Development of scalable lymphatic system in the 4D XCAT phantom: Application to quantitative evaluation of lymphoma PET segmentations
T2  - MEDICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Digital anthropomorphic phantoms, such as the 4D extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom, are actively used to develop, optimize, and evaluate a variety of imaging applications, allowing for realistic patient modeling and knowledge of ground truth. The XCAT phantom defines the activity and attenuation for a simulated patient, which includes a complete set of organs, muscle, bone, and soft tissue, while also accounting for cardiac and respiratory motion. However, the XCAT phantom does not currently include the lymphatic system, critical for evaluating medical imaging tasks such as sentinel node detection, node density measurement, and radiation dosimetry. Purpose In this study, we aimed to develop a scalable lymphatic system in the XCAT phantom, to facilitate improved research of the lymphatic system in medical imaging. Using this scalable lymphatic system, we modeled the lymph node conglomerate pathology that is characteristically observed in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). As an extended application, we evaluated positron emission tomography (PET) image quantification of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of these simulated lymphomas, though the phantoms may be applied to other imaging modalities and study design paradigms (e.g., image quality, detection). Methods A template model for the lymphatic system was developed based on anatomical data from the Visible Human Project of the National Library of Medicine. The segmented nodes and vessels were fit with non-uniform rational basis spline surfaces, and multichannel large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping was used to propagate the template to different XCAT anatomies. To model conglomerates observed in PMBCL, lymph nodes were enlarged, converged within the mediastinum, and tracer concentration was increased. We used the phantoms as inputs to a PET simulation tool, which generated images using ordered subsets expectation maximization reconstruction with 2-8 mm Gaussian filters. Fixed thresholding (FT) and gradient segmentation were used to determine MTV and TLG. Percent bias (%Bias) and coefficient of variation (COV) were computed as measures of accuracy and precision, respectively, for each MTV and TLG measurement. Results Using the methodology described above, we introduced a scalable lymphatic system in the XCAT phantom, which allows for the radioactivity and attenuation ground truth to be generated in 116 +/- 2.5 s using a 2.3 GHz processor. Within the Rhinoceros interface, lymph node anatomy and function were modified to create a cohort of 10 phantoms with lymph node conglomerates. Using the lymphoma phantoms to evaluate PET quantification of MTV, mean %Bias values were -9.3%, -41.3%, and 20.9%, while COV values were 4.08%, 7.6%, and 3.4% using 25% FT, 40% FT, and gradient segmentations, respectively. Comparatively for TLG, mean %Bias values were -27.4%, -45.8%, and -16.0%, while COV values were 1.9%, 5.7%, and 1.4%, for the 25% FT, 40% FT, and gradient segmentations, respectively. Conclusions In this work, we upgraded the XCAT phantom to include a lymphatic system, comprised of a network of 276 scalable lymph nodes and corresponding vessels. As an application, we created a cohort of phantoms with lymph node conglomerates to evaluate lymphoma quantification in PET imaging, which highlights an important application of this work.

TI  - Survival analysis in head and neck melanoma after negative sentinel lymph node biopsy: A seer-based population study
T2  - ENT-EAR NOSE & THROAT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background Cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) is one of the most aggressive skin tumors. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an important test before thorough treatment of melanoma. The aim of this study was to investigate cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients with head and neck CMM after negative SLNB and to analyze predictors of decreased survival. Methods Based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database, a study was conducted using data from patients with head and neck CMM after negative SLNB. The demographic, clinical, and pathological characteristics of the case population were analyzed. Cox univariate, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and multivariate Cox regression models were used to explore predictors of decreased survival; propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was used to reduce confounding bias, and outcomes were compared between the wide margin excision and narrow margin excision groups. Results A total of 1597 confirmed head and neck CMM patients with SLNB-negative were found. A Breslow>4.0 mm was the highest independent risk predictor for patients (HR 3.82, 95% CI 2.04-7.16, P < .001), and significant risk independent predictors also included a high mitotic rate >4 (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.06-2.25, P = .023). Age< 60 years old was a significant survival predictor (HR 0.56, 95% CI .37-.85, P = .007), and not scalp and neck CMM were also important factors for longer survival (auricle skin: HR .51, 95% CI .29-.90, P = .02; unspecified parts of face: HR .59, 95% CI .40-.87, P = .007). After harmonizing baseline data by PSM, it was found that the extent of surgical resection did not affect patient survival. Conclusion This study analyzed the risk factors affecting CSS in patients with CMM of the head and neck region with SLNB-negative and observed a statistically significant difference in the prognosis of patients with CMM in different aesthetic subunits of the head and neck region. Close clinical follow-up for this population is necessary, and periodic medical examinations should be carried out.

TI  - A hierarchical disturbance rejection depth tracking control of underactuated AUV with experimental verification
T2  - OCEAN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a hierarchical disturbance rejection depth tracking control scheme for the underactuated autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) with comparative experimental results. The proposed hierarchical control scheme is constructed by two layers in the kinematics and dynamics. First, the line-of-sight (LOS) guidance is adopted to transform the depth tracking problem of the underactuated AUV into the pitch tracking in the kinematics layer, and then the adaptive line-of-sight guidance (ALOS) is proposed to estimate online and compensate for the angle of attack neglected in the traditional LOS guidance or in the presence of disturbance. Second, in order to further enhance the capability of disturbance rejection, active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is adopted to track the desired pitch angle in the dynamics layer. In addition, a modified velocity saturation tracking differentiator (VSTD) by considering the motion characteristics of the AUV is introduced to enable the easy tuning of the control parameters and the adaptability to varying conditions in practice. Finally, a small size underactuated AUV prototype named as ARMs-AUV 1.0 is used to implement the control algorithms. Comparative experimental results are illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness and the remarkable performance of the proposed depth tracking control scheme.

TI  - Tree species diversity analysis using species distribution models: A <i>Faidherbia</i> albida parkland case study in Senegal
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Around the world, SDMs have been widely used to support forest management planning and biodiversity conservation. Beyond the prediction of species distribution provided by the SDMs, this study aimed to analyze the spatial distribution of tree species diversity using SDMs. The study area is a Faidherbia albida parkland in Central Senegal. It is characterized by a tree-based farming system dominated by Faidherbia albida. Using a robust and representative dataset of 9258 tree species occurrence, we first determined by an SDM the current potential spatial distribution of the 16 main tree species forming the parkland. Specifically, using 6 SDM algorithms and applying several modeling techniques with different categories of predictor variables (e.g., climate, topography, soil properties and human impact) we benchmarked 576 SDMs to achieve best model predictions for tree species. Then, tree species diversity maps were created on the basis of the resulting SDM predictions. Finally, the spatial dynamics of tree species diversity were discussed in relation to landscape characteristics, including heterogeneity, composition and human impact. The results showed that there is no single 'best' SDM algorithm (among the 6 algorithms tested) or modeling approach for all species. Benchmarking several modeling techniques allowed strengthening SDM performance, achieving AUC values that ranged from 0.64 (intermediate accuracy) to 0.87 (very good accuracy). The spatial dynamics of tree species diversity is related to the landscape heterogeneity and composition. In the Sahelian agroforestry systems (AFS), tree diversity is sustained by anthropization. A significant negative correlation with the distance to the village was found, i.e. the closer you get to the village, the greater the diversity of trees. This study could be crucial for analyzing tree species diversity when abundance information is not available.

TI  - Single-incision for breast-conserving surgery through round block technique
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims and objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using the single-incision round block technique in breast-conserving surgery with sentinel lymph node (SLN) retrieval for breast cancer without compromising oncological safety.Materials and methods: A retrospective observational case-control study was conducted from January 2017 to October 2021. The study population consisted of two groups. In both groups, breast-conserving surgery was carried out through the round-block technique. In group A, SLN retrieval was performed using the round-block incision (study group), while in group B, SLN retrieval was conducted through a second skin incision in the axilla (control group). The study was approved by the local ethics committee Zurich (BASEC-Nr. 2020-02857), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.Results: Overall, 134 patients met the inclusion criteria, of whom 86 women underwent breast-conserving surgery and SLN retrieval using the single-incision approach (group A), and 48 women underwent conventional surgery, using two independent incisions for tumour resection and SLN retrieval (group B). The overall success rate in group A regarding SLN retrieval was 97.7%, whereas most tumours were located in the upper outer (47.7%) and upper inner quadrant (27.9%). Although the technique was equally successful in the other quadrants, the share of tumours in the lower outer, and the lower inner quadrant, and the retroareolar region was smaller, representing 17.4%, 3.5% and 3.5%, respectively. The median number of dissected lymph nodes was two, with a positivity rate of 24.4%. The occurrence of axillary neuralgia and axillary skin retraction was significantly higher in group B along with tendentially more axillary seroma formation. There were no significant differences regarding reintervention rates, in terms of complications, resection margins, locoregional recurrences, or deaths with a mean follow-up of 11 months.Conclusions: The single-incision method through the round block technique is as safe and effective as the standard two-incision approach regarding nodal staging and resection margins, and seems to be applicable for tumours in all breast quadrants.

TI  - Tracing the predominant sources of carbon in PM2.5 using 813C values together with OC/EC and select inorganic ions over two COALESCE locations
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - As part of the COALESCE (Carbonaceous Aerosol Emissions, Source apportionment and Climate Impacts) campaign, ambient PM2.5 was collected at two regional sites (Bhopal and Mysuru) in India during 2019. We utilized organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC) and water-soluble inorganic ions together with 813C values, to better understand total carbon (TC) sources at these locations.The annual average 813C values (-26.2 +/- 0.6%o) at Mysuru and Bhopal (-26.6 +/- 0.6%o) were comparable. However, at Mysuru, except during winter, day-to-day variability was much lower (narrow range of-26.8 to-26.0%o) than that at Bhopal (range:-28.1 to-24.7%o), suggesting that TC was contributed by few sources, likely dominated by vehicular emissions. Seasonal average 813C values at Bhopal increased slightly (-25.8 +/- 0.5%o) during the winter (Jan-Feb) and decreased (-27.0 +/- 0.3%o) during the monsoon (Jun-Sep) season compared to the annual average. The decrease in 813C values during the monsoon season was likely driven by enhanced secondary organic aerosol formation. Further, based on MODIS derived fire spots and back trajectories, we infered that the 813C values (-27.5 to-26.0%o) in Bhopal during the post-monsoon season (Oct-Dec) were indicative of dominant biomass burning contributions. The inorganic ions/TC ratio during this season suggested that biomass burning aerosol was aged and may have been transported from crop residue burning in the Indo-Gangetic plains. At Mysuru, like the trend at Bhopal, the 613C values during the monsoon season were lower than those during the winter season.Finally, 613C values were input to a Bayesian model-MixSIAR to demonstrate the usefulness of such models in apportioning TC. In its simplest implementation, the model separated TC sources into fossil fuel emissions and non-fossil fuel sources . Fossil fuel combustion emissions accounted for 47 +/- 19% and 62 +/- 22% of the TC at Bhopal and Mysuru, respectively.

TI  - Mapping individual abandoned houses across cities by integrating VHR remote sensing and street view imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Abandoned houses (AH) present an utmost challenge confronting the urban environment in contemporary U.S. shrinking cities. Data accessibility is a major hurdle that prevents the acquisition of large-scale AH information at the individual property level. To this end, the latest revolution of open-access remote sensing platforms has witnessed a plethora of multi-source, multi-perspective fine-spatial-resolution data for urban environments, among which very-high-resolution (VHR) top-down view remote sensing images and horizontal-perspective Google Street View (GSV) images are prominent exemplifiers. In this study, we aim to map individual-level abandoned houses across cities by developing a method that can effectively leverage VHR remote sensing and GSV images. The proposed method is composed of four steps. First, we explored the feasibility of the three most relevant and complementary remote sensing data for individual-level AH detection, i.e., daytime VHR images, nighttime light VHR images, and GSV images. Second, we extracted discriminative features that are indicative of housing abandonment conditions from the three disparate data sources. Third, we applied decision-level fusion with Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) to better leverage the prior knowledge about data effectiveness. In the last step, a geographical random forests (GRF) model was first implemented to improve the predictions of where houses were occluded on GSV images. We mapped individual AH in two typical U.S. shrinking cities, Buffalo, NY, and Cleveland, OH, which allowed us to further explore the individual-property-level spatial characteristics of AH. Results revealed that the proposed DST fusion and GRF prediction consistently achieved promising per-formance across the two cities. Given the merits of incorporating open-access and multi-perspective data, our proposed method has the potential to be generalized to understanding regional and national-scale urban envi-ronments tackling housing abandonment challenges.

TI  - Machine Learning approach to Predict net radiation over crop surfaces from global solar radiation and canopy temperature data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As the ground-based instruments for measuring net radiation are costly and need to be handled skillfully, the net radiation data at spatial and temporal scales over Indian subcontinent are scanty. Sometimes, it is necessary to use other meteorological parameters to estimate the value of net radiation, although the prediction may vary based on season, ground cover and estimation method. In this context, artificial intelligence can be used as a powerful tool for predicting the data considering past observed data. This paper proposes a novel method to predict the net radiation for five crop surfaces using global solar radiation and canopy temperature. This contribution includes the generation of real-time data for five crops grown in West Bengal state of India. After manual analysis and data preprocessing, data normalization has been done before applying machine learning approaches for training a robust model. We have presented the comparison in various machine learning algorithm such as ridge and spline regression, random forest, ensemble and deep neural networks. The result shows that the gradient boosting regression and ridge regression are outperforming other ML approaches. The estimated predictors enable to reduce the number of resources in terms of time, cost and manpower for proper net radiation estimation. Thus, the problem of predicting net radiation over various crop surfaces can be sorted out through ML algorithm.

TI  - Use of the time series and multi-temporal features of Sentinel-1/2 satellite imagery to predict soil inorganic and organic carbon in a low-relief area with a semi-arid environment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of soil organic carbon (SOC) and inorganic carbon (SIC) contents at regional scales can be very important for sustainable agriculture and soil management. Low variation in terrain attributes (classically used for digital soil mapping) at low relief areas calls for additional spatial data to explain soil variability. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive capability of Sentinel-1 (radar) and Sentinel-2 (optical) time series and statistics, summarized as multi-temporal features (MTF) to improve the spatial predictions of SOC and SIC in Ghorveh plain, located in Kurdistan Province, Western Iran. A systematic grid sampling was then employed to collect 150 soil surface samples (0-30 cm) for SOC and SIC measurements. We applied boosted regression trees (BRT) and random forest (RF) to predict SOC and SIC contents by using covariate sets compiled from radar and optical time series and topographic attributes. Model performance, evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation, showed that RF using the covariate set containing time series of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and topographic attributes performed the best in predicting SOC (RMSE = 0.23, ME = 0.005, R2 = 0.29). On the other hand, for SIC, the covariate set containing MTF of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and topographic attributes ranked the best with BRT (RMSE = 0.77, ME= -0.001, R2 = 0.48). The study indicates that using the time series and MTF from multiple dates of remote sensing data with topographic attributes results in improved predictions. However, model performance for SIC and SOC was moderate to poor, respectively. Therefore more substantial studies would be required to verify if the computational effort is likely justified by an increase in accuracy in general.

TI  - The effects of environmental stressors on gonad biomarkers of a sentinel marine bivalve, <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i>
T2  - MOLLUSCAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work is to investigate the effects of environmental stressors on male reproductive biomarkers in sentinel species of bivalves inhabiting Annaba estuaries, considered to be reservoirs receiving industrial, agricultural, and domestic discharges. Male Mytilus galloprovincialis were collected in four seasons from a non-polluted site (S1) and two other locations receiving untreated sewage (S2) and a mixture of contaminants (S3). Testicular sperm concentration, motility, velocity, the amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH), the beat cross frequency (BCF), spermatozoan DNA fragmentation, and histological profiles were evaluated. Individuals from S2 and S3 have diminished sperm concentration, motility, velocity, ALH and BCF, along with a significantly increased spermatozoan DNA fragmentation that was much higher in S3. Testicular tissues demonstrated histo-pathological alterations in mussels subjected to anthropogenic activities during the four seasons. In conclusion, reproductive biomarkers of male mussels were both spatially and temporally variable, which is probably correlated to pollution types and the changing seasonal stressors.

TI  - Evapotranspiration in a subtropical wetland savanna using low-cost lysimeter, eddy covariance and modelling approaches
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) constitutes the largest loss of water from subtropical grassland and wetland ecosystems, yet data in much of the world have high uncertainty at the landscape scale as there is little information on plant water use. Additionally, anthropogenic alterations to grasslands are a major threat globally and alter ecosystem water use, but the impact of these changes is often unquantified. A major reason for this is the complexity and expense of field-based ET quantification methods such as agricultural lysimeters and eddy covariance systems. Accurate measurements of ET are critical for sustainable water management. This study developed two different low-cost lysimeters-weighing-type and water level-based, to measure ET under partly controlled conditions for single species as well as mixed grassland and wetland communities. Lysimeters were placed in an open-sided, transparent-roofed shade-house and watered periodically. ET values were then compared with (i) actual ET from an eddy covariance tower onsite, (ii) vapour transport-based reference ET models (FAO Penman-Monteith, modified Turc and Abtew simple radiation models), and (iii) reference ET data customized for vegetation types from the Florida Automated Weather Network (FAWN). Both weighing-type and water level lysimeters yielded seasonal patterns and annual magnitudes similar to other ET methods. Annual ET measurements from single-species weighing-type lysimeters (ranging from 881 to 1278 mm for four plant species, n = 5 per species, 20 in total) and water level lysimeters (1085 +/- 306 mm, plant community average, n = 31) were about 10-20% lower than reference ET models (similar to 1300 mm) and similar to FAWN data (1050 mm). Actual ET from eddy covariance was 722 mm for 10 months (missing data for February and March), while weighing lysimeter measurements for the dominant grass Paspalum notatum was 885 mm for the same 10 months. While rainfall exclusion and watering can result in ET differing from actual field conditions, low-cost lysimeters can provide an independent measure of ET for comparison with regional ET models/remote sensing data lacking field validation. Thereby, low-cost lysimeters are potentially useful for water resources and ecosystem management in data-poor regions of the world.

TI  - One-year mortality and years of potential life lost following bloodstream infection among adults: A nation-wide population based study
T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Limited data exist on long-term consequences of bloodstream infections (BSIs). We aimed to examine incidence, 1-year mortality, and years of potential life lost (YPLL) following BSI. We estimated the relative contribu-tion of hospital-onset BSI (HO-BSI) and antibiotic-resistant BSI to incidence, mortality and YPLL. Methods We used data from Israel's national BSI surveillance system (covering eight sentinel bacteria, comprising 70% of all BSIs) and the national death registry. Adults with BSI between January 2018 and December 2019 were included. The outcomes were all-cause 30-day and 1-year mortality, with no adjustment for co-morbidities. We calcu-lated the age-standardized mortality rate and YPLL using the Global Burden of Disease reference population and life expectancy tables.Findings In total, 25,376 BSIs occurred over 2 years (mean adult population: 6,068,580). The annual incidence was 209.1 BSIs (95% CI 206.5-211.7) per 100,000 population. The case fatality rate was 25.6% (95% CI 25.0-26.2) at 30 days and 46.4% (95% CI 45.5-47.2) at 1 year. The hazard of death increased by 30% for each decade of age (HR=1.3 [95% CI 1.2-1.3]). The annual age-standardized mortality rate and YPLL per 100,000 were 50.8 (95% CI 49. 7-51.9) and 1,012.6 (95% CI 986.9-1,038.3), respectively. HO-BSI (6,962 events) represented 27.4% (95% CI 26.9-28.0) of BSIs, 33.9% (95% CI 32.6-35.0) of deaths and 39.9% (95% CI 39.5-40.2) of YPLL. HO-BSI by drug-resistant bacteria (3,072 events) represented 12.1% (95% CI 11.7-12.5) of BSIs, 15.6% (95% CI 14.7-16.5) of deaths, and 18.4% (95% CI 18.1-18.7) of YPLL.Interpretation One-year mortality following BSI is high. The burden of BSI is similar to that of ischemic stroke. HO-BSI and drug-resistant BSI contribute disproportionately to BSI mortality and YPLL.Funding None.Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - A meta-methodology for preserving narrow objects when using spatial contextual classifiers for remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the field of land-cover classification with remote sensing images, methods that analyse purely the spectral information of individual pixels generally produce noisy results, due to salt-and-pepper effects. The use of methods that also incorporate spatial contextual information into classification, often defined as contextual or spectral-spatial approaches, is an effective strategy for reducing the occurrence of punctual noises and, consequently, improving accuracy. However, contextual methods still present a critical limitation: an over smoothing performance on certain classes can cause the loss of details on important spatial structures. They may overlook salient punctual and linear objects that can be efficiently classified using purely spectral information, particularly over areas of rapid class transition. This issue is commonly observed with the classification of medium spatial-resolution images that include narrow class structures, such as rivers and roads. To solve this problem, we present a strategy for contextual classification that allows adjusting a trade-off between noise smoothing and the preservation of small spatial details. The proposed strategy comprises a meta-methodology, in the sense that it does not depend on specific pixel-based and contextual classifiers. The meta-methodology for improving contextual classification methods (Meta-CTX) consists in performing a separability analysis, at the pixel level, based on the class membership estimates provided by a pixel-based classifier. The Meta-CTX analyses the distance between class membership estimates in order to identify pixels that are expected to be accurately classified using purely spectral information. The Meta-CTX preserves the per-pixel classification of these pixels. It uses spatial contextual information only to classify pixels that are more susceptible to classification errors. The experimental results indicate that the Meta-CTX can efficiently combine noise smoothing with the preservation of small spatial details in remote sensing image classification.

TI  - An evaluation of vegetation loss due to the super typhoon Sarika in Hainan Island of China
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continued strengthening of global climate change, various extreme climate events have become increasingly prominent. Typhoons are the most disastrous weather event that cause severe losses to the economy, agriculture, transportation, communication, and ecosystem in coastal regions. The super typhoon Sarika that hit Hainan Island on October 18, 2016, lasted for 15 h, and it was the most severe typhoon that hit this island in October since 1970. The coastal land of Hainan Island experienced gales with an average speed of 35 m/s. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the super typhoon Sarika on vegetation by performing normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) difference analysis using MODIS multi-temporal images acquired before and after the typhoon. The assessment of typhoons depends on the land-use types and landscape topography of slope, aspect, and altitude. The results indicated that the super typhoon Sarika seriously hit forestry, agriculture, shrubs, plantations, and orchards on Hainan Island. Overall, 79% of vegetation exhibited a negative change, whereas only 21% of vegetation exhibited a positive change in NDVI after the super typhoon Sarika. Agriculture was most severely impacted by the typhoon, where more than 81% of areas exhibited a decrease in NDVI, followed by plantations and orchards, where 77% of areas exhibited a decrease in NDVI. Additionally, the impact of the typhoon on vegetation was affected by the degree of NDVI decrease with the altitude, slope, and aspect. In conclusion, vegetation damage is associated with land cover types, altitude, aspect, and slope. NDVI decreased more in low-altitude plain and coastal areas than in higher altitude montane forest areas.

TI  - China's larch stock volume estimation using Sentinel-2 and LiDAR data
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Forest Stock Volume (FSV) is one of the key indicators in forestry resource investigation and management on local, regional, and national scales. Limited by the saturation problems of optical satellite remote-sensing imagery in the retrieving of stock volume, and the high cost of Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data, it is still challenging to estimate FSV in a large area using single-sensor remote-sensing data. In this paper, a method integrated multispectral satellite imagery and LiDAR data was developed to map stock volume in a large area. A random forest model was adopted to estimate the stock volume of larch forest in China based on the training samples from the Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS)-derived stock volume and corresponding Sentinel-2 imagery. Validation using National Forest Inventory (NFI) data, ALS-derived stock volume and ground investigation data demonstrated that the estimated stock volume had a high accuracy (R-2 = 0.59, RMSE = 59.69 m(3)/ha, MD = 39.96 m(3)/ha when validated with NFI data; R-2 ranged from 0.77 to 0.85, RMSE ranged from 38.68 m(3)/ha to 67.38 m(3)/ha, MD ranged from 24.90 m(3)/ha to 37.27 m(3)/ha when validated with ALS stock volume; R-2 = 0.42, RMSE = 79.10 m(3)/ha, MD = 62.06 m(3)/ha when validated with field investigation data). Results of this paper indicated the applicability of estimating stock volume of larch forest in a large area by combining Sentinel-2 data and airborne LiDAR data.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Land degradation (LD) and desertification are serious ecological, environmental, and social-economic threats in the world, and there is a demanding need to develop accountable and reproducible techniques to assess them at different scales. This study assesses LD and desertification with the help of remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) in the study region for the period past 29 years, i.e., from 1990 to 2019. The severity of LD and desertification was assessed quantitatively by collecting twelve soil samples in the study region and analyzing the eleven soil physico-chemical parameters and these values have made correlated with digital number (DN) values with LANDSAT 8 OLI/TIRS satellite image. The land cover analysis of LANDSAT imagery revealed that the water body slightly increased from 0.29% in 1990 to 0.46% in 2019, and built-up-land increased from 2.87% in 1990 to 5.31% in 2019. Vegetation decreased from 52.03% in 1990 to 28.57%. Fallow land, degraded land, and desertified lands increased at alarming rates, respectively 13.71% to 26.35, 18.57% to 22.31%, and 12.53% to 17.00%. It is also established that the multi-temporal analysis of change detection data can provide a sophisticated measure of ecosystem health and variation, and that, over the last 29 years, considerable progress has been made in the respective research.

TI  - Developing a parsimonious canopy model (PCM v1.0) to predict forest gross primary productivity and leaf area index of deciduous broad-leaved forest
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperate forest ecosystems play a crucial role in governing global carbon and water cycles. However, unprecedented global warming presents fundamental alterations to the ecological functions (e.g., carbon uptake) and biophysical variables (e.g., leaf area index) of forests. The quantification of forest carbon uptake, gross primary productivity (GPP), as the largest carbon flux has a direct consequence on carbon budget estimations. Part of this assimilated carbon stored in leaf biomass is related to the leaf area index (LAI), which is closely linked to and is of critical significance in the water cycle. There already exist a number of models to simulate dynamics of LAI and GPP; however, the level of complexity, demanding data, and poorly known parameters often prohibit the model applicability over data-sparse and large domains. In addition, the complex mechanisms associated with coupling the terrestrial carbon and water cycles poses a major challenge for integrated assessments of interlinked processes (e.g., accounting for the temporal dynamics of LAI for improving water balance estimations and soil moisture availability for enhancing carbon balance estimations). In this study, we propose a parsimonious forest canopy model (PCM) to predict the daily dynamics of LAI and GPP with few required inputs, which would also be suitable for integration into state-of-the-art hydrologic models. The light use efficiency (LUE) concept, coupled with a phenology submodel, is central to PCM (v1.0). PCM estimates total assimilated carbon based on the efficiency of the conversion of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation into biomass. Equipped with the coupled phenology submodel, the total assimilated carbon partly converts to leaf biomass, from which prognostic and temperature-driven LAI is simulated. The model combines modules for the estimation of soil hydraulic parameters based on pedotransfer functions and vertically weighted soil moisture, considering the underground root distribution, when soil moisture data are available. We test the model on deciduous broad-leaved forest sites in Europe and North America, as selected from the FLUXNET network. We analyze the model's parameter sensitivity on the resulting GPP and LAI and identified, on average, 10 common sensitive parameters at each study site (e.g., LUE and SLA). The model's performance is evaluated in a validation period, using in situ measurements of GPP and LAI (when available) at eddy covariance flux towers. The model adequately captures the daily dynamics of observed GPP and LAI at each study site (Kling-Gupta efficiency, KGE, varies between 0.79 and 0.92). Finally, we investigate the cross-location transferability of model parameters and derive a compromise parameter set to be used across different sites. The model also showed robustness with the compromise single set of parameters, applicable to different sites, with an acceptable loss in model skill (on average +/- 8 %). Overall, in addition to the satisfactory performance of the PCM as a stand-alone canopy model, the parsimonious and modular structure of the developed PCM allows for a smooth incorporation of carbon modules to existing hydrologic models, thereby facilitating the seamless representation of coupled water and carbon cycle components, i.e., prognostic simulated vegetation leaf area index (LAI) would improve the representation of the water cycle components (i.e., evapotranspiration), while GPP predictions would benefit from the simulated soil water storage from a hydrologic model.

TI  - Study on Water Quality Inversion Model of Dianchi Lake Based on Landsat 8 Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient, comprehensive, continuous, and accurate monitoring of organic pollution in lakes can provide a reliable basis for water quality assessment and water pollution prevention This paper takes Dianchi Lake as the research object, aiming at the four important water quality indexes of permanganate index (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), hydrogen ion (pH), and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N); based on the correlation analysis of Landsat 8 data and measured water quality data, an inversion model is constructed to obtain the spatial distribution of the four indexes. The results show that the relative errors of permanganate index (COD) in neural network and multiple regression are 9.68% and 17.48%, respectively; 3.81% and 3.36% in dissolved oxygen (DO); 1.25% and 1.58% in hydrogen ion (pH); in ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), it is 15.39% and 24.97%, respectively. The lowest COD in the study area is 6.2 mg/L and the highest is 9.8 mg/L; in 2018, the DO is 5.81 mg/L at the lowest and 9.05 mg/L at the highest; the lowest pH is 5.9 mg/L, the highest is 8.54 mg/L, and the lowest NH3-N is 0.22 mg/L, the highest is 0.41 mg/L. The inversion results of the overall pollutant concentration in the study area are consistent with the actual situation, with only some slight deviations in some areas. The two inversion models can effectively monitor the water quality and spatial distribution of Dianchi Lake. The remote sensing inversion model of water quality has the value of in-depth research and promotion.

TI  - Afterslip From the 2020 M 6.5 Monte Cristo Range, Nevada Earthquake
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate postseismic deformation following the 15 May 2020, M-w 6.5 Monte Cristo Range, Nevada earthquake using geodetic and aftershock data. Seven months of Sentinel 1-A/B SAR images were used to model deformation as afterslip on two subparallel fault planes outlined by aftershocks. Postseismic deformation fits exponential and logarithmic decay models equally well. For exponential decay, the average decay time is similar to 38 days. On the western plane, where most coseismic slip was observed, afterslip was minor, occurred at shallower depths than coseismic slip, and is anticorrelated with aftershock distribution. On the eastern plane, afterslip is significant, exceeds coseismic moment release, occurred at and below coseismic slip, and is correlated with aftershock distribution. On both segments, geodetic moment exceeds seismic moment, suggesting most afterslip occurred aseismically. Aseismic creep does not make up for observed coseismic shallow slip deficit, perhaps related to fault immaturity.

TI  - Introduction of the DISAMAR radiative transfer model: determining instrument specifications and analysing methods for atmospheric retrieval (version 4.1.5)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - DISAMAR (determining instrument specifications and analysing methods for atmospheric retrieval) is a computer model developed to simulate retrievals of properties of atmospheric trace gases, aerosols, clouds, and the ground surface from passive remote sensing observations in a wavelength range from 270 to 2400 nm. It is being used for the TROPOMI/Sentinel-5P and Sentinel-4/5 missions to derive Level-lb product specifications. DISAMAR uses the doubling-adding method and the layer-based orders of scattering method for radiative transfer calculations. It can perform retrievals using three different approaches: optimal estimation (OE), differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS), and the combination of DOAS and OE, called DISMAS (differential and smooth absorption separated). The derivatives, which are needed in the OE and DISMAS retrievals, are derived in a semi-analytical way from the adding formulae. DISAMAR uses plane-parallel homogeneous atmospheric layers with a pseudo-spherical correction for large solar zenith angles. DISAMAR has various novel features and diverse retrieval possibilities, such as retrieving aerosol layer heights and ozone vertical profiles. This paper provides an overview of the DISAMAR model version 4.1.5 without treating all the details. We focus on the principle of the layer-based orders of scattering method, the calculation of the semi-analytical derivatives, and the DISMAS retrieval method, and it is to our knowledge the first time that these methods are described. We demonstrate some applications of DISMAS and the derivatives.

TI  - Perspective on satellite-based land data assimilation to estimate water cycle components in an era of advanced data availability and model sophistication
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - The beginning of the 21(st) century is marked by a rapid growth of land surface satellite data and model sophistication. This offers new opportunities to estimate multiple components of the water cycle via satellite-based land data assimilation (DA) across multiple scales. By resolving more processes in land surface models and by coupling the land, the atmosphere, and other Earth system compartments, the observed information can be propagated to constrain additional unobserved variables. Furthermore, access to more satellite observations enables the direct constraint of more and more components of the water cycle that are of interest to end users. However, the finer level of detail in models and data is also often accompanied by an increase in dimensions, with more state variables, parameters, or boundary conditions to estimate, and more observations to assimilate. This requires advanced DA methods and efficient solutions. One solution is to target specific observations for assimilation based on a sensitivity study or coupling strength analysis, because not all observations are equally effective in improving subsequent forecasts of hydrological variables, weather, agricultural production, or hazards through DA. This paper offers a perspective on current and future land DA development, and suggestions to optimally exploit advances in observing and modeling systems.

TI  - Exploring Satellite-Derived Relationships between Cloud Droplet Number Concentration and Liquid Water Path Using a Large- Domain Large-Eddy Simulation
T2  - TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Important aspects of the adjustments to aerosol-cloud interactions can be examined using the relationship between cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) and liquid water path (LWP). Specifically, this relation can constrain the role of aerosols in leading to thicker or thinner clouds in response to adjustment mechanisms. This study investigates the satellite retrieved relationship between Nd and LWP for a selected case of mid-latitude continental clouds using high-resolution Large-eddy simulations (LES) over a large domain in weather prediction mode. Since the satellite retrieval uses the adiabatic assumption to derive the Nd, we have also considered adiabatic Nd (NAd) from the LES model for comparison. The joint histogram analysis shows that the NAd- LWP relationship in the LES model and the satellite is in approximate agreement. In both cases, the peak conditional probability (CP) is confined to lower NAd and LWP; the corresponding mean LWP ( LWP ) shows a weak relation with NAd. The CP shows a larger spread at higher NAd (>50 cm-3), and the LWP increases non-monotonically with increasing N at higher N simulated N Ad in both cases. Nevertheless, both lack the negative NAd-LWP relationship Ad, the entrainment effect on cloud droplets. In contrast, the model d-LWP clearly illustrates a much more nonlinear (an increase in LWP with increasing Nd and a decrease in LWP at higher Nd) relationship, which clearly depicts the cloud lifetime and the entrainment effect. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates a regime dependency (marine and continental) in the NAd-LWP relation from the satellite retrievals. Comparing local vs large-scale statistics from satellite data shows that continental clouds exhibit only a weak nonlinear NAd-LWP relationship. Hence a regime-based Nd-LWP analysis is even more relevant when it comes to warm continental clouds and their comparison to satellite retrievals.

TI  - A Characterization of Clouds and Precipitation Over the Southern Ocean From Synoptic to Micro Scales During the CAPRICORN Field Campaigns
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The persistent Southern Ocean (SO) shortwave radiation biases in climate models and reanalyses have been associated with the poor representation of clouds, precipitation, aerosols, the atmospheric boundary layer, and their intrinsic interactions. Capitalizing on shipborne observations collected during the Clouds Aerosols Precipitation Radiation and atmospheric Composition Over the Southern Ocean 2016 and 2018 field campaigns, this research investigates and characterizes cloud and precipitation processes from synoptic to micro scales. Distinct cloud and precipitation regimes are found to correspond to the seven thermodynamic clusters established using a K-means clustering technique, while less distinctions are evident using the cyclone and (cold) front compositing methods. Cloud radar and disdrometer data reveal that light precipitation is common over the SO with higher intensities associated with cyclonic and warm frontal regions. Multiple lines of evidence suggest the presence of diverse microphysical features in several cloud regimes, including the likely dominance of ice aggregation in deep precipitating clouds. Signatures of mixed phase, and in some cases, riming were detected in shallow convective clouds away from the frontal conditions. Two of the K-means clusters with contrasting cloud and precipitation properties are observed over the high-latitude SO and coastal Antarctica, suggesting distinct physical processes therein. Through a single case study, in-situ and remote-sensing data collected by an overflight of the Southern Ocean Clouds Radiation Aerosol Transport Experimental Study were also evaluated and complement the ship-based analysis.

T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar has been proven to be able to monitor slow deforming landslides with mm-precision. Continental- and nationwide-scale Sentinel-1 PSI (persistent scatterer interferometry) datasets with millions of deformation time series are publicly available, e.g., via the European Ground Motion Service or the Ground Motion Service Germany. This creates the possibility for an increased routine use of PSI for landslide applications. However, the use of PSI datasets is often done by visual inspection. The huge amount of measurements makes visual inspection, subjective, time-consuming, and error prone due to outliers. This study demonstrates how spatial and temporal patterns of the PSI velocity and time series can be detected in a semi-automatic way to improve objective information extraction. Therefore, two landslides, namely, Trittenheim and Piesport landslides, in Germany are analyzed using Sentinel-1 PSI datasets from the Ground Motion Service Germany. The post-processing technique semi-automatically detects spatial clusters of deforming PS with a maximum LoS velocity of 18 and 7 mm/a in Trittenheim and Piesport landslides, respectively. Furthermore, a correlation and time-lag between the surface deformation and a potential triggering factor is found. Results show that an increase in climatic water balance accelerates landslide deformation at the investigated locations. Results are verified by a second independent Sentinel-1 PSI dataset from the Ground Motion Service Germany.

TI  - Identification of smoke and sulfuric acid aerosol in SAGE III/ISS extinction spectra
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a technique to classify the composition of enhanced aerosol layers as either smoke or sulfuric acid aerosol using extinction spectra from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III instrument aboard the International Space Station (SAGE III/ISS). This method takes advantage of the different spectral properties of smoke and sulfuric acid aerosol, which is manifest in distinctly different spectral slopes in the SAGE III/ISS data. Herein we demonstrate the utility of this method and present an evaluation of its performance using four case-study events of two moderate volcanic eruptions (2018 Ambae eruption and 2019 Ulawun eruption, both of which released <0.5 Tg of SO2) and two large wildfire events (2017 Canadian pyroCb and 2020 Australian pyroCb). We provide corroborative data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument to support these classifications. This method correctly classified smoke and sulfuric acid plumes in the case-study events >81 % and >99.5 % of the time, respectively. The application of this method to a large volcanic event (i.e., the 2019 Raikoke eruption; >= 1.5 Tg SO2) serves as an example of why this method is limited to small and moderate volcanic events as it incorrectly classified Raikoke's larger sulfuric acid particles as smoke. We evaluated the possibility of smoke being present in the stratosphere before and after the Raikoke eruption. While smoke was present during this time period it was insufficient to account for the magnitude of smoke classifications we observed. Therefore, while this method worked well for largescale wildfire events and eruptions that inject less SO2, the size of the aerosol created by the Raikoke eruption was outside the applicable range of this method.

TI  - A Method to Account for the Impact of Water Vapor on Observation-Based Estimates of the Clear-Sky Shortwave Direct Radiative Effect of Mineral Dust
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The shortwave direct radiative effect of dust, the difference between net shortwave radiative flux in a cloud free and cloud and aerosol free atmosphere, is typically estimated using forward calculations made with a radiative transfer model. However, estimates of the direct radiative effect made via this initial method can be highly uncertain due to difficultly in accurately describing the relevant optical and physical properties of dust used in these calculations. An alternative approach to estimate this effect is to determine the forcing efficiency, or the direct radiative effect normalized by aerosol optical depth. While this approach avoids the uncertainties associated with the initial method for calculating the direct effect, random errors and biases associated with this approach have not been thoroughly examined in literature. Here we explore biases in this observation-based approach that are related to atmospheric water vapor. We use observations to show that over the Sahara Desert dust optical depth and column-integrated atmospheric water vapor are positively correlated. We use three idealized radiative models of varying complexity to demonstrate that a positive correlation between dust and water vapor produces a positive bias in the dust forcing efficiency estimated via the observation-based method. We describe a simple modification to the observation-based method that correctly accounts for the correlation between dust and water vapor when estimating the forcing efficiency and use this method to estimate the instantaneous forcing efficiency of dust over the Sahara Desert using satellite data, obtaining -12.3 +/- 6.68 to 20.9 +/- 11.9 W m(-2) per unit optical depth.

TI  - Monitoring ground movement at Volcan de Colima, Mexico, using Sentinel-1 data and SqueeSAR<SUP>®</SUP>
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcan de Colima is a highly active stratovolcano in western Mexico which presents a significant hazard to over 300,000 people who live within ca 40 km of the volcano. Due to its persistent activity, the volcano is actively monitored and researched, and understanding the patterns of behaviour is vital to accurate hazard assessment.Sentinel-1 SAR images from ascending and descending orbits allow 1D and 2D ground motions to be retrieved using multi-interferogram techniques. SqueeSAR((R))'s unique processing allows a better characterisation of subtle ground movements in remote, rural mountainous areas compared to many other multi-interferogram techniques. A dataset of 147 SAR scenes (2017-2019) has been processed to show patterns of lava subsidence (<150 mm of downward vertical deformation over 2 years), as well as volcano deflation and apparent westward lateral movement. These data indicate that viscous andesitic lava flows may remain mobile for years following eruption and emplacement, and that the entire volcanic edifice is subsiding.Despite the apparent quiescence, volcanic edifices can remain highly dynamic after the termination of explosive or effusive activity. We interpret that the western flank of Volcan de Colima may become steeper with time and may be of long-term concern for hazard assessment activities.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF LEGAL HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The leading police power case of Lawton v. Steele, decided by the US Supreme Court in 1894, offers insight into the question of judicial class bias during the decades following the Civil War. Conflict arose in rural northern New York State over restrictions on livelihood fishing by nets imposed to protect sport angling by affluent tourists. Opposition to the restrictions was grounded in a producerist worldview and class consciousness. The matter reached the courts in a challenge to state laws permitting the summary destruction, without legal process, of nets placed illegally. Seemingly prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment and previous case law, such destruction was upheld by a Supreme Court divided along ideological lines, correlating with the justices' Whig or Jacksonian antecedents. The dissenters, those of Jacksonian sympathies, argued unsuccessfully against the challenged laws.

TI  - Case report: Atypical anaphylactic reaction to Patent Blue V dye during breast cancer surgery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The most common causes of perioperative hypersensitive reactions are neuromuscular blocking drugs, latex, and antibiotics, although there are other more emerging causative agents. Allergic reactions to Patent Blue V (PBV) dye have been reported. Most of them are mild and presented with blue coloration of cutaneous plaque. The PBV dye is widely used in the identification of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer and other malignancies. Here, we present a case of 33-year-old patient with carcinoma of the breast proposed for sentinel lymph node and skin-sparing mastectomy with severe, life-threatening anaphylaxis which occurred immediately after PBV dye was injected, with cardiopulmonal resuscitation and prolonged refractory hypotension. The patient was without previous exposure to PBV and signs of skin rash, erythema, or bronchospasm, making the diagnosis and management of such cases challenging. Skin tests were performed on all drugs used in premedication and induction of anesthesia and PBV showed positive at IDT of 1:10. Physicians must always think of possible adverse reaction to PBV and for the potential risk of anaphylactic reaction immediately after the dye is injected, during anesthesia and other procedures.

T2  - Nauplius
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2015, a serious environmental disaster occurred at ULTRACARGO -Aratu S/A Terminal (Cubatao, SP) causing a long-lasting, large-scale, fire that resulted in the release of various chemical pollutants, including those used to contain the fire. These pollutants affected adjacent regions and the innermost area of the Santos-Sao Vicente Estuarine System, requiring the assessment of environmental quality in two mangrove areas post-disaster (2016). This assessment considered biomarkers for the species including population density, structure, and cytogenotoxicity. The population structure and cytotoxicity of Ucides cordatus (Linnaeus, 1763) only changed slightly from pre-disaster (2013) to post-disaster (2016), as a consequence of the greater resilience and biological flexibility of this crab to environmental stress caused by pollutants. We recommend continuous monitoring be conducted using this species endemic to the mangroves of the study site, as this will make it possible to assess the magnitude of the chronic environmental impacts of the accident. In addition, it could guide environmental agencies in damage mitigation or in the quantification of possible future impacts.

TI  - Complementing XCO<sub>2</sub> imagery with ground-based CO<sub>2</sub> and <SUP>14</SUP>CO<sub>2</sub> measurements to monitor CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuels on a regional to local scale
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Various satellite imagers of the vertically integrated column of carbon dioxide (XCO2) are under development to enhance the capabilities for the monitoring of fossil fuel (FF) CO2 emissions. XCO2 images can be used to detect plumes from cities and large industrial plants and to quantify the corresponding emission using atmospheric inversions techniques. However, this potential and the ability to catch the signal from more diffuse FF CO2 sources can be hampered by the mix between these FF signals and a background signal from other types of CO2 surface fluxes, and in particular of biogenic CO2 fluxes. The deployment of dense ground-based air-sampling networks for CO2 and radiocarbon ((CO2)-C-14) could complement the spaceborne imagery by supporting the separation between the fossil fuel and biogenic or biofuel (BF) CO2 signals. We evaluate this potential complementarity with a high-resolution analytical inversion system focused on northern France, western Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, and a part of the Netherlands and with pseudo-data experiments. The inversion system controls the FF and BF emissions from the large urban areas and plants, in addition to regional budgets of more diffuse emissions or of biogenic fluxes (NEE, net ecosystem exchange), at an hourly scale over a whole day. The system provides results corresponding to the assimilation of pseudo-data from a single track of a 300 km swath XCO2 imager at 2 km resolution and from surface ground-based CO2 and/or (CO2)-C-14 networks. It represents the diversity of (CO2)-C-14 sources and sinks and not just the dilution of radiocarbon-free FF CO2 emissions. The uncertainty in the resulting FF CO2 emissions at local (urban area/plant) to regional scales is directly derived and used to assess the potential of the different combinations of observation systems. The assimilation of satellite observations yields estimates of the morning regional emissions with an uncertainty down to 10 % (la) in the satellite field of view, from an assumed uncertainty of 15 % in the prior estimates. However, it does not provide direct information about emissions outside the satellite field of view or about afternoon or nighttime emissions. The co-assimilation of (CO2)-C-14 and CO2 surface observations leads to a further reduction of the uncertainty in the estimates of FF emissions. However, this further reduction is significant only in administrative regions with three or more (CO2)-C-14 and CO2 sampling sites. The uncertainty in the estimates of 1 d emission in North Rhine-Westphalia, a region with three sampling sites, decreases from 8 % to 6.6 % when assimilating the in situ (CO2)-C-14 and CO2 data in addition to the satellite data. Furthermore, this additional decrease appears to be larger when the ground stations are close to large FF emission areas, providing an additional direct constraint for the estimate of these sources rather than supporting the characterization of the background signal from the NEE and its separation from that of the FF emissions. More generally, the results indicate no amplification of the potential of each observation subsystem when they are combined into a large observation system with satellite and surface data.

TI  - Channel bar development, braiding and bankline migration of the Brahmaputra-Jamuna river, Bangladesh through RS and GIS techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Erosion of banks and channel migrations are usually common phenomenon and recurring geo-hazardous problem in the Brahmaputra-Jamuna river system of Bangladesh. The present study intensively analysed multi-temporal Landsat satellite imageries (Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+, Landsat OLI TIRS), historical documents (Hunter maps), and literature information employing Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System techniques, and estimation of braiding and sinuosity indices especially emphasizing channel bar development, braiding, and bank-line migration of the river. The computed braiding indices of the river were 1.5, 10.3, 13.4, 11.0, 10.6 and 14.6 for the year of 1853-1857, 1977, 1989, 2000, 2014 and 2018, respectively (overall deciphering increasing trend). Similar to the braiding indices, the sinuosity indices (2.58, 7.02, 9.92, 8.31, 7.42 and 11.25 for the same selected years) of the river have also been changed over time. During 1853-1857 to 2018, 766.7 and 1624.2 km(2) of lands extensively eroded on the east and west bank, respectively at a rate of 4.8 and 10.1 km(2) yr(-1). However, from 1977 to 2018, the erosion rates were 14.4 and 12.5 km(2) yr(-1), respectively. High discharges, sediment transport associated with random bars formation related braiding expansion, and weak bank materials are presumably the governing factors for causing such simultaneous severe bank erosion and remarkable bank-line migration phenomenon. Although, from 1853-1857 to 1977 the erosion of the river followed the river flow direction. It is expected that the outcomes of this research can contribute further research on morphodynamic characteristics of the braided river for better understanding the river characteristics, the river hydromorphology, water and sediment transport, its bank erosion, and formulating protective measurement plan for their sustainable current flow path maintenance.

TI  - Empiric recommendations for population disaggregation under different data scenarios
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution population mapping is of high relevance for developing and implementing tailored actions in several fields: From decision making in crisis management to urban planning. Earth Observation has considerably contributed to the development of methods for disaggregating population figures with higher resolution data into fine-grained population maps. However, which method is most suitable on the basis of the available data, and how the spatial units and accuracy metrics affect the validation process is not fully known. We aim to provide recommendations to researches that attempt to produce high-resolution population maps using remote sensing and geospatial information in heterogeneous urban landscapes. For this purpose, we performed a comprehensive experimental research on population disaggregation methods with thirty-six different scenarios. We combined five different top-down methods (from basic to complex, i.e., binary and categorical dasymetric, statistical, and binary and categorical hybrid approaches) on different subsets of data with diverse resolutions and degrees of availability (poor, average and rich). Then, the resulting population maps were systematically validated with a two-fold approach using six accuracy metrics. We found that when only using remotely sensed data the combination of statistical and dasymetric methods provide better results, while highly-resolved data require simpler methods. Besides, the use of at least three relative accuracy metrics is highly encouraged since the validation depends on level and method. We also analysed the behaviour of relative errors and how they are affected by the heterogeneity of the urban landscape. We hope that our recommendations save additional efforts and time in future population mapping.

TI  - Predicting dry matter intake in Canadian Holstein dairy cattle using milk mid-infrared reflectance spectroscopy and other commonly available predictors via artificial neural networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dry matter intake (DMI) is a fundamental component of the animal's feed efficiency, but measuring DMI of individual cows is expensive. Mid-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (MIRS) on milk samples could be an inexpensive alternative to predict DMI. The objectives of this study were (1) to assess if milk MIRS data could improve DMI predictions of Canadian Holstein cows using artificial neural networks (ANN); (2) to investigate the ability of different ANN architectures to predict unobserved DMI; and (3) to validate the robustness of developed prediction models. A total of 7,398 milk samples from 509 dairy cows distributed over Canada, Denmark, and the United States were analyzed. Data from Denmark and the United States were used to increase the training data size and variability to improve the generalization of the prediction models over the lactation. For each milk spectra record, the corresponding weekly average DMI (kg/d), test-day milk yield (MY, kg/d), fat yield (FY, g/d), and protein yield (PY, g/d), metabolic body weight (MBW), age at calving, year of calving, season of calving, days in milk, lactation number, country, and herd were available. The weekly average DMI was predicted with various ANN architectures using 7 predictor sets, which were created by different combinations MY, FY, PY, MBW, and MIRS data. All predictor sets also included age of calving and days in milk. In addition, the classification effects of season of calving, country, and lactation number were included in all models. The explored ANN architectures consisted of 3 training algorithms (Bayesian regularization, Levenberg-Marquardt, and scaled conjugate gradient), 2 types of activation functions (hyperbolic tangent and linear), and from 1 to 10 neurons in hidden layers). In addition, partial least squares regression was also applied to predict the DMI. Models were compared using cross-validation based on leaving out 10% of records (validation A) and leaving out 10% of cows (validation B). Superior fitting statistics of models comprising MIRS information compared with the models fitting milk, fat and protein yields suggest that other unknown milk components may help explain variation in weekly average DMI. For instance, using MY, FY, PY, and MBW as predictor variables produced a predictive accuracy (r) ranging from 0.510 to 0.652 across ANN models and validation sets. Using MIRS together with MY, FY, PY, and MBW as predictors resulted in improved fitting (r = 0.679-0.777). Including MIRS data improved the weekly average DMI prediction of Canadian Holstein cows, but it seems that MIRS predicts DMI mostly through its association with milk production traits and its utility to estimate a measure of feed efficiency that accounts for the level of production, such as residual feed intake, might be limited and needs further investigation. The better predictive ability of nonlinear ANN compared with linear ANN and partial least squares regression indicated possible nonlinear relationships between weekly average DMI and the predictor variables. In general, ANN using Bayesian regularization and scaled conjugate gradient training algorithms yielded slightly better weekly average DMI predictions compared with ANN using the Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm.

TI  - Predicting methane emission in Canadian Holstein dairy cattle using milk mid-infrared reflectance spectroscopy and other commonly available predictors via artificial neural networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Interest in reducing eructed CH4 is growing, but measuring CH4 emissions is expensive and difficult in large populations. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of milk mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) data to predict CH4 emission in lactating Canadian Holstein cows. A total of 181 weekly average CH4 records from 158 Canadian cows and 217 records from 44 Danish cows were used. For each milk spectra record, the corresponding weekly average CH4 emission (g/d), test-day milk yield (MY, kg/d), fat yield (FY, g/d), and protein yield (PY, g/d) were available. The weekly average CH4 emission was predicted using various artificial neural networks (ANN), partial least squares regression, and different sets of predictors. The ANN architectures consisted of 3 training algorithms, 1 to 10 neurons with hyperbolic tangent activation function in the hidden layer, and 1 neuron with linear (purine) activation function in the hidden layer. Random cross-validation was used to compared the predictor sets: MY (set 1); FY (set 2); PY (set 3); MY and FY (set 4); MY and PY (set 5); MY, FY, and PY (set 6); MIRS (set 7); and MY, FY, PY, and MIRS (set 8). All predictor sets also included age at calving and days in milk, in addition to country, season of calving, and lactation number as categorical effects. Using only MY (set 1), the predictive accuracy (r) ranged from 0.245 to 0.457 and the root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 87.28 to 99.39 across all prediction models and validation sets. Replacing MY with FY (set 2; r = 0.288-0.491; RMSE = 85.94-98.04) improved the predictive accuracy, but using PY (set 3; r = 0.260-0.468; RMSE = 86.95-98.47) did not. Adding FY to MY (set 4; r = 0.272-0.469; RMSE = 87.21-100.76) led to a negligible improvement compared with sets 1 and 3, but it slightly decreased accuracy compared with set 2. Adding PY to MY (set 5; r = 0.250-0.451; RMSE = 87.66-100.94) did not improve prediction ability. Combining MY, FY, and PY (set 6; r = 0.252-0.455; RMSE = 87.74-101.93) yielded accuracy slightly lower than sets 2 and 3. Using only MIRS data (set 7; r = 0.586-0.717; RMSE = 69.09-96.20) resulted in superior accuracy compared with all previous sets. Finally, the combination of MIRS data with MY, FY, and PY (set 8; r = 0.590-0.727; RMSE = 68.02-87.78) yielded similar accuracy to set 7. Overall, sets including the MIRS data yielded significantly better predictions than the other sets. To assess the predictive ability in a new unseen herd, a limited block cross-validation was performed using 20 cows in the same Canadian herd, which yielded r = 0.229 and RMSE = 154.44, which were clearly much worse than the average r = 0.704 and RMSE = 70.83 when predictions were made by random cross-validation. These results warrant further investigation when more data become available to allow for a more comprehensive block cross-validation before applying the calibrated models for large-scale prediction of CH4 emissions.

TI  - Evaluation of water flux predictive models developed using eddy-covariance observations and machine learning: a meta-analysis
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid accumulation of water flux observations from global eddy-covariance flux sites, many studies have used data-driven approaches to model water fluxes, with various predictors and machine learning algorithms used. However, it is unclear how various model features affect prediction accuracy. To fill this gap, we evaluated this issue based on records of 139 developed models collected from 32 such studies. Support vector machines (SVMs; average R-squared = 0.82) and RF (random forest; average R-squared = 0.81) outperformed other evaluated algorithms with sufficient sample size in both cross-study and intra-study (with the same data) comparisons. The average accuracy of the model applied to arid regions is higher than in other climate types. The average accuracy of the model was slightly lower for forest sites (average R-squared = 0.76) than for croplands and grasslands (average R -squared = 0.8 and 0.79) but higher than for shrubland sites (average R-squared = 0.67). Using R-n/ R-s, precipitation, T-a, and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FA-PAR) improved the model accuracy. The combined use of T-a and R-n/ R-s is very effective, especially in forests, while in grasslands the combination of W-s and R-n/ R-s is also fective. Random cross-validation showed higher model accuracy than spatial cross-validation and temporal cross-validation, but spatial cross-validation is more important in spatial extrapolation. The findings of this study are promising to guide future research on such machine-learning-based modeling.

AB  - Background: Approval of adjuvant anti-programmed cell death protein 1 therapy for pathologic stage IIB/C cutaneous melanoma has led some to question the role of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in the clinical stage IIB/C disease.Objective: To determine the prognostic significance of SLN staging on disease-specific survival (DSS) for clinical stage IIB/C primary cutaneous melanoma in the preimmunotherapy era.Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed evaluating patients who underwent excision of clinical stage IIB/C cutaneous melanoma using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2011). Patients who did and did not undergo SLN biopsy were compared using propensity matching, and among those who underwent SLN biopsy, matched patients were further stratified by SLN status (SLN positive [SLN+] or SLN negative [SLN-]).Results: Of the 8562 patients evaluated, 6021 (70.3%) underwent SLN biopsy. SLN positivity was associated with significantly reduced 5-year DSS among matched patients who underwent SLN biopsy (47.1% SLN+ vs 75.5% SLN-; P<.001). Five-year DSS remained significantly different across matched T-stages: T3b (54.2% SLN= vs 64.8% SLN-; P=.004), T4a (55.5% SLN1 vs 71.6% SLN-; P=.001), and T4b (38.6% SLN+ vs 60.9% SLN-; P<.001).Limitations: Retrospective study.Conclusion: For patients with clinical stage IIB/C cutaneous melanoma, SLN status provides essential prognostic information.

TI  - Transformative learning of medical trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic: A mixed methods study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a transformative effect on individuals across the world, including those in healthcare. Transformative learning is an educational theory in which an individual's worldview is fundamentally altered through conscious reflection (Cognitive Rational), insights (Extrarational), or social reform (Social Critique). We utilized transformative learning theory to characterize the experiences of medical trainees during the pandemic.Methods We used the Transformative Learning Survey in September and October 2020 to evaluate the processes and outcomes of transformative learning in health professions students and housestaff at an academic medical center during the pandemic. We analyzed survey scores for three process domains and four outcome subdomains. We inductively coded the survey's two open-ended questions and performed qualitative and mixed-methods analyses.Results The most prominent TL outcome was Self-Awareness, Acting Differently was intermediate, and Openness and Worldview Shifts were lowest. Cognitive Rational and Social Critique processes were more prominent than Extrarational processes. Students were more likely than housestaff to undergo transformative learning through the Social Critique process (p = 0.025), in particular the sub-processes of Social Action (p = 0.023) and Ideology Critique (p = 0.010). Qualitative analysis via the aggregation of codes identified four responses to the pandemic: negative change, positive change, existential change, or no change. Negative changes (67.7%) were most common, with students reporting more of these changes than housestaff (74.8% vs 53.6%; p < 0.01). Only 8.4% of reported changes could be defined as transformativeConclusions Through the theoretical lens of transformative learning, our study provides insight into the lives of learners during the pandemic. Our finding that medical students were more likely to use Social Critique processes has multiple parallels in the literature. If leaders in academic medicine desire to create enlightened change agents through transformative learning, such education must continue throughout graduate medical education and beyond.

TI  - Remote sensing-supported mapping of the activity of a subterranean landscape engineer across an afro-alpine ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Subterranean animals act as ecosystem engineers, for example, through soil perturbation and herbivory, shaping their environments worldwide. As the occurrence of animals is often linked to above-ground features such as plant species composition or landscape textures, satellite-based remote sensing approaches can be used to predict the distribution of subterranean species. Here, we combine insitu collected vegetation composition data with remotely sensed data to improve the prediction of a subterranean species across a large spatial scale. We compared three machine learning-based modeling strategies, including field and satellite-based remote sensing data to different extents, in order to predict the distribution of the subterranean giant root-rat GRR, Tachyoryctes macrocephalus, an endangered rodent species endemic to the Bale Mountains in southeast Ethiopia. We included no, some and extensive fieldwork data in the modeling to test how these data improved prediction quality. We found prediction quality to be particularly dependent on the spatial coverage of the training data. Species distributions were best predicted by using texture metrics and eyeball-selected data points of landscape marks created by the GRR. Vegetation composition as a predictor showed the lowest contribution to model performance and lacked spatial accuracy. Our results suggest that the time-consuming collection of vegetation data in the field is not necessarily required for the prediction of subterranean species that leave traceable above-ground landscape marks like the GRR. Instead, remotely sensed and spatially eyeball-selected presence data of subterranean species could profoundly enhance predictions. The usage of remote sensing-derived texture metrics has great potential for improving the distribution modeling of subterranean species, especially in arid ecosystems.

TI  - Spatial Prediction of the Groundwater Potential Using Remote Sensing Data and Bivariate Statistical-Based Artificial Intelligence Models
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation of the groundwater potential in a given region must be performed in groundwater resource management. The main purpose of this research was to simulate the groundwater potential in Wuqi County, China, based on five artificial intelligence models. The five data mining methods included the decision forest by penalizing attributes (forest PA) model, rudiment of the radial basis function network (RBFN) model, certainty factor (CF) model, logistic regression (LR) model and naive Bayes (NB) model. According to local geographic environment characteristics, a total of sixteen conditioning factors were selected, the two-variable CF model was used to calculate the weight of factor subclasses, and multicollinearity analysis and the SVM method with different filter types were used to assess the independence and importance, respectively, of the conditioning factors. In addition, to obtain better model prediction results, the relevant modeling parameters of the forest PA and RBFN models were optimized via the tenfold cross-validation method in the modeling process. Finally, corresponding groundwater potential maps (GWPMs) of each model were generated, groundwater areas with a high potential were identified, and the consistency between the groundwater potential maps was compared by calculating the kappa statistical index. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to verify the accuracy and success rate of each model. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test method was also used to evaluate the significance of several benchmark numerical models. The results indicated that all five models achieved a satisfactory performance, and the models with optimized parameters (forest PA and RBFN models) realized greater predictive capabilities than those of the other unoptimized models. The results of this study could provide a certain guiding significance for rational management of groundwater systems and could contribute to the formulation of measures to ensure the best future use of groundwater energy.

TI  - Decadal changes in premature mortality associated with exposure to outdoor PM<sub>2.5</sub> in mainland Southeast Asia and the impacts of biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In mainland Southeast Asia (SEA), a rapid increase of fossil fuel consumption and massive particulate matter emissions from biomass burning (BB) are severely threatening the health of local inhabitants. In this study, surface PM2.5 data, satellite fire observations and emission inventories were integrated with the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) to estimate premature mortality attributable to PM(2.5 )exposure from 1990 through 2019 and to explore and quantify the health burden associated with BB and anthropogenic emissions in mainland SEA. BB in mainland SEA has remained intense over the past decades. Owing to a lack of effective control measures, emission inventory and satellite-observed data both showed that BB has markedly intensified in several regions, including northern Cambodia and northern Laos. The multiannual average (1997-2015) BB PM2.5 emission was 1.6 x 10(6) t/yr, which is much higher than that of anthropogenic (fossil fuel combustion) PM2.5 emission. GEMM results indicated that PM2.5-related premature mortality in mainland SEA more than doubled from 100 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 88-112) thousand in 1990 to 257 (95 % CI, 228-286) thousand in 2019. Decomposition analysis revealed that variations in population size and age structure also promoted this increase of PM2.5-related deaths. Given that mainland SEA is a rapidly developing region, it is expected that local public health will face increasing challenges due to population growth, population ageing, and increased anthropogenic emissions. Therefore, it is imperative for policymakers to consider these influential factors, set practical mitigation targets, and explore how to effectively and systematically combine BB with anthropogenic emission controls to maximize the health benefits.

TI  - Machine-Learning Estimation of Snow Depth in 2021 Texas Statewide Winter Storm Using SAR Imagery
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequency of extreme climate events has escalated since 1980. In February 2021, an unprecedented winter storm dumped the snow record in Texas. It claimed hundreds of lives and evolved into a national major disaster. However, we still lack a systematic approach to quantify large-scale snow depth. Here, we use the differential coherence from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to characterize the surface disturbance due to this winter storm. We further rely on machine-learning algorithms to quantify Texas statewide snow depth using surface disturbance map, SAR amplitude, precipitation, temperature, surface topography, land cover, and population. Our approach can provide an independent snow depth estimation. Approximately 89% of Texas accumulated over 30-mm snow depth. The SAR and machine-learning integrated methods can also be applied to quantify other forms of surface disturbance and to ultimately help natural hazard mitigation.

TI  - Isolating the direct and indirect impacts of urbanization on vegetation carbon sequestration capacity in a large oasis city: evidence from Urumqi, China
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Oasis cities are deeply affected by human activities in arid and semi-arid regions. Vegetation is an important repository in the carbon cycle of oasis urban ecosystems. The continuous expansion of urban has a disproportionate impact on the carbon sequestration capacity of vegetation. Till now, studies have been conducted to quantify the impact of urbanization on vegetation carbon sequestration capacity, the mechanism of such impact remains unclear and lacks systematic investigations, especially in oasis urban. Understanding the impact mechanism greatly benefits the sustainable development of oasis urban and regional carbon neutrality. To fill this knowledge gap, we design a theoretical framework to analyze the impact of urbanization on vegetation carbon sequestration capacity by isolating the direct and indirect impacts in Urumqi, China. Some results based on Landsat images indicated that the Impervious Surface Areas (ISAs) expanded by 436.98 km(2) during 2000 - 2019. The Net Primary Productivity (NPP) calculated using the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) was directly caused by the loss of 51.45 Gg C (1 Gg = 109 g). Another important finding proved that the direct carbon loss caused by urbanization did not change the upward trend of the total carbon sequestration capacity of vegetation, but only slowed down this upward trend by 20.86%. Our results provide new insights into urban vegetation carbon sinks and contribute to a better understanding of the uncertainty of urbanization toward carbon neutrality. This study will provide scientific data support and suggestions for the sustainable development of oasis cities and the regional carbon budget.

TI  - Impact assessment of drought monitoring events and vegetation dynamics based on multi-satellite remote sensing data over Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a complex hazard caused by the disruption of rainwater balance, and it always has an impact on ecological, farming and socio-economic. In order to protect farming land in Pakistan, effective and timely drought monitoring is extremely essential. Therefore, a regular drought monitoring is required to study drought severity, its duration and spread, to ensure effective planning and to help reduce their possible adverse impacts. In this study, multi-satellite data were used for reliable drought monitoring. For monitoring changing trend of drought in Pakistan, the NVSWI, DSI, VCI, and NAP indices were chosen as a tool incorporated with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based NDVI and ET/PET. Due to the low vegetation and significantly high changing trend of drought, NDVI, DSI and TVDI are useful to characterize drought frequency in Pakistan. The yearly DSI index shows that Pakistan suffered of drought with low vegetation during 2001, 2002 and 2006 study years. The seasonal DSI, VCI, NAP, NDVI, and NVSWI values confirmed that 2001, 2002 and 2006 led to severe drought years in Pakistan. The regression analysis between VHI, VCI, NDVI and NVSWI values are significantly positively correlated. The NAP, DSI, and NVSWI showed the positive signs for good drought monitoring indices for agricultural regions of Pakistan. The trend of drought change from 2001 to 2017 also showed characteristics. The results showed that from 2001 to 2017, the drought trend of the whole region changed obviously, and the overall drought frequency showed a downward trend. The good performance of DSI, and NVSWI could, explicitly, contribute progressively towards improving specific drought mitigation strategies and disaster risk reduction at regional and national levels.

TI  - SBAS-DInSAR analysis of January 2020 eruption of La cumbre Volcano, Galapagos Archipelago
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Galapagos Archipelago in the Pacific Ocean, situated 1000 km from the Ecuadorian coast, has been considered one of the UNESCO World Heritage sites. Its geographical location, ongoing seismo_volcanic activ-ities, and the island's extreme isolation have led to the development of a wide variety of unique plant and animal species, which inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. La cumbre volcano is one of the most active volcanoes in the Galapagos archipelago and is situated closest to the mantle plume. Eruptions are frequent here, with a record of 30 eruptions since 1800. Recently La Cumbre volcano erupted on 2020 January 12, with 11 seismic tremors recorded on that day with a maximum magnitude of 4.7. The Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) is an advanced Differential Interferometric SAR technique used to generate the deformation time series from the sequence of SAR datasets with a reduced spatiotemporal decorrelation. It is one of the best approaches for monitoring and analyzing surface deformations from space with a millimeter level of accuracy. In this paper, we analyze the January 2020 eruption of the La cumbre volcano using the SBAS technique. 9 Sentinel-1C band SAR data granules from 2019 November 17 to 2020 February 21 were used to generate the deformation time series map for estimating the degree of deformation at the volcanic edifice. As per the analysis, it is evident that the recent eruption has caused a displacement of up to-38 cm at the South Eastern flank of the crater, which has increased initially and then decreased on approaching the steady-state of eruption.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act 2017 formalised a new way to view, use and understand Te Awa Tupua-the Whanganui River. While giving legal personhood to a river is relatively recent, the paradigm shift towards a new consciousness of natural phenomena having physical and spiritual identities originates from Indigenous knowledge, values and practices. The framework that will implement this new change, Te Pa Auroa na Te Awa Tupua, is values-based, appoints positions and governance groups, includes a whole-of-river strategy, is supported with funding and applies legal recognition to the Whanganui River and its intrinsic values. This article seeks to build a bridge of understanding to facilitate non-Indigenous engagement with implementing Te Pa Auroa na Te Awa Tupua as an organising framework for human action and relations with human and nonhuman entities.

TI  - Pan-Alpine glacier phenology reveals lowering albedo and increase in ablation season length
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in many parts of the world are reported to be undergoing a darkening process (decrease in surface albedo). This has multiple causes, including the presence of impurities (such as mineral dust, carbonaceous particles, algae and cryoconite), and debris. Also glacier melt can induce an albedo decrease by initiating a melt-albedo feedback cycle. The extent of this albedo decrease and its spatial variability in different mountain ranges however are poorly known. In this study, we assess albedo changes on a selection of Alpine glaciers (542 glaciers > 0.1 km(2)) by deriving eight albedo metrics from MODIS MOD10A1 satellite observations over a time period of 20 years (2000-2019). Albedo metrics include the start and end of the ablation season and its length, calculated through the selection of a threshold (albedo = 0.4) to separate melting ice from snow. We further calculated the number of ice melt days, integral of the length of the ablation season, minimum annual albedo, mean summer albedo and mean annual albedo. We identified significant trends in all metrics for a large percentage of glacier cells. A negative trend in minimum albedo (-0.06 decade(-1) on average) was identified for 56% of glacier cells, and 70% of glaciers; a positive trend in the length of season (+18 days decade(-1) on average) was identified for 11% of glacier cells and 19% of glaciers. Changes in minimum albedo occur mostly around the glacier median elevation, while for other metrics (e.g. start and length of season) changes are more frequent at the glacier termini (i.e. below 25th elevation percentile). We further investigated the relationship between the metrics and climate (downscaled ERA5 reanalysis data) and topographic (ALOS AW3D30 DEM) variability; we found that average summer temperature and elevation are the most significant proxies for all metrics (maximum correlation = 0.40 between elevation and minimum albedo) compared to spring temperature and other topographic variables. Finally, we looked at the ability of the albedo metrics to represent annual and summertime glacier mass balance of 31 selected Alpine glaciers in the World Glacier Monitoring Service database, finding significant correlations between minimum and summertime albedo and annual mass balance (R-2 = 0.44 for minimum albedo and 0.40 for summertime albedo using all observations). Considering individual glaciers, all showed significant correlations with minimum albedo, and some of them are strongly correlated (e.g. Argentiere: R-2 = 0.84, Saint Sorlin R-2 = 0.88). Our glacier phenology approach opens new perspectives for the remote sensing of alpine and polar glaciers.

TI  - Improved global evapotranspiration estimates using proportionality hypothesis-based water balance constraints
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of global evapotranspiration (ET) is critical to understand the water and energy cycles in the Earth system. Satellite-driven ET algorithms serve as an effective way to estimate the global ET. However, many algorithms have been designed independently of water balance constraints, which potentially limit their ability to estimate ET in water-limited and high interception regions. As ET remains one of the most uncertain terms in the global water budgets, incorporating water balance constraints into algorithms should improve the performance of ET estimates. In this study, we developed a general solution (denoted PEW) based on the proportionality hypothesis to incorporate available water control into the widely used Priestley Taylor-Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) ET algorithm. Simulated performances of the PEW model and PT-JPL algorithm were evaluated against 106 FLUXNET eddy covariance (EC) towers data at the site scale. Meanwhile, model results were compared at the global scale with the means of the widely used ET products. We found that the PEW model has smaller errors than the original PT-JPL algorithm, with the greatest improvements in water-limited regions and areas characterized by the high interception. Moreover, by incorporating the water balance constraints into the ET algorithm, the PEW model has the ability to distinguish variations in ET affected by El Nino-Southern Oscillation. In summary, our study offers a convincing evidence regarding the incorporation of water balance constraints into remote sensing algorithms for more accurately mapping global terrestrial ET with an enhanced understanding of ET variation under climate change. This model is the first of its kind among remote-sensing models to provide global land ET estimation with the proportionality hypothesis-based water balance constraints.

However, the published large-scale energy intensity cannot support the formulation of local policies. What's more, the research work about the evaluation of fine-scale energy intensity is rare. To solve this problem, a "top-down" method based on machine learning is proposed to evaluate the fine-scale energy intensity. Appropriate features were extracted from multi-source satellite data, then the performances of multiple machine learning models were compared. It is found that deep neural network reaches the highest level among these models. Therefore, it was selected to estimate city-scale energy intensity from the year of 2001-2017. It turns out that the energy efficiency of southeast cities is higher than that of northwest cities in China, and most cities are developing towards the direction of improving energy efficiency. Among all cities, the central ones are the fastest to improve energy efficiency. However, the energy efficiency of a few cities is found to reduce during this period. The proposed method can also be used in other countries to help governments save energy and reduce emissions. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mega Asian dust event over China on 27-31 March 2021 observed with space-borne instruments and ground-based polarization lidar
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the background of global climate change, the frequency of extreme weather events is ever-increasing. Climatic anomaly in dust source areas and intensive Mongolian cyclones jointly cause the reoccurrence of super dust storms in spring 2021. A mega dust storm broke out in southeast Mongolia on 27 March and significantly impacted air quality in China until 31 March. However, neither intensity nor affected areas are well depicted by the forecasting model. Here we report the horizontal distribution, transport path, dissipation, and influence on surface air quality of this event with the combination of space-borne and ground-based observations. Prudent analysis indicates a longer duration (5 days) and farther-south affected areas (25 degrees N) than the previous report. Dust plumes were first transported to North and Northeast China, the Bohai Sea, and the Yellow Sea (28 March), and then respectively moved eastward to Korea-Japan regions and southward over mainland China (29 March), with PM10 values > 500 mu g m(-3) in 64 cities. Dust aerosols over the Yellow Sea retraced to the coastal areas of East China on 29 March, resulting in severe degradation of air quality over mainland China (25-40 degrees N and 105-120 degrees E) during 29-31 March. On 31 March, dust particles in this region were gradually removed, attributed to the wet removal and the enhanced south branch of westerlies. In central China, ground-based polarization lidar observed dust similar to 26 h earlier (1600 LT, 27 March) than surface PM10 measurements. The dust plume showed a triple-layer vertical structure. The bottom layer mixed with local anthropogenic aerosols, concentrating most dust particles (>100 mu g m(-3)); the upper two were composed of pure dust particles with lower mass concentration (<50 mu g m(-3)). This study reveals the capacity of comprehensive observations with multiple approaches from both space and ground in real-time monitoring of mega dust storms and validating the sand storm forecasting.

TI  - Spatio-temporal signature of surface biophysical parameters in response to extreme IOD events using remote sensing
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indian Ocean (IO) evidenced significant effects on regional and global ocean-atmospheric coupling variability in recent decades. Anomalous negative (positive) Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events witnessed along tropical IO during 2016 (2019) are one of them. The spatial signature of anomalous IOD events was studied using sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA), sea surface height, sea surface salinity, chlorophyll -a, zonal and meridional wind components obtained from remote sensing data. The strong easterly wind anomaly blowing along the Sumatra coast causes strong coastal upwelling pioneer for the positive IOD event in 2019. The westward horizontal advection of seawater leads to low (high) sea surface height anomaly along eastern (western) tropical IO. The eastern (western) tropical IO becomes gradually cold (warm) during the mature phase (September-October-November) of positive IOD. Due to strong upwelling high and low sea surface salinity were observed along the eastern and western tropical IO respectively. The prolonged stronger upward (downward) Ekman pumping velocity in east (west) results in divergence (convergence) of seawater responsible for the increase (decrease) of chlorophyll -a and marine primary productivity. The reverse phenomena were characterized by warmer (cooler) SSTA, higher (lower) sea surface height, low (high) sea surface salinity, and decrease (increase) of chlorophyll -a in the eastern (western) tropical IO in the 2016 negative IOD year. The westward (eastward) zonal Ekman mass transport is possible fueling the extreme condition of positive (negative) IOD events. A strong eastward propagating downwelling Kelvin wave was observed due to the reflection of the upwelling Rossby wave from the African coast. Dominated picoplankton (microplankton) to other phytoplankton size classes are responsible for the reoccurrence of open ocean bloom along western (eastern) tropical IO during positive IOD.

TI  - Dynamics of pollutant emissions from wildfires in Mainland China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the dynamics of pollutant emissions from wildfires in mainland China from 2001 to 2019 using MODIS fire products combined with the measurements of emission factors of different vegetation types. The biomass distribution in Mainland China has heterogeneous temporal and spatial pattern, with inter-year variations and a decreasing trend from east to west. Overall, from 2001 to 2019, biomass combustion in Mainland China reached 479.59 Tg (25.24 Tg.a-1), in which northeast, north, east, south, central, northwest, and southwest regions accounted for 20.95%, 31.14%, 8.89%, 9.06%, 3.98%, 0.33% and 25.64% of total biomass combustion, respectively. The emissions of CO, CO2, CxHy, NOx, PM2.5, TC, OC and EC were 47.30, 288.05, 12.90, 0.40, 1.43, 0.83, 0.70, and 0.12 Tg (1 Tg = 1012g), respectively. PM2.5, TC and OC emissions increased in the southwest, while all pollutant emissions declined significantly in the southern region. For particulate matter from wildfires, both the ratio of its emissions to total dust and the ratio of its concentration to atmospheric PM2.5 showed an increasing trend, implying that the relative environmental impacts of particulate emissions from wildfires may be rising. In addition, our results show that the current Chinese wildfire management has successfully reduced on average more than 80% of pollutant emissions from wildfire from 2001 to 2019 compared to the natural wildfire regime (no strict wildfire management). This research on the temporal-spatial changes of pollutant emissions from wildfires in Mainland China provides support for further exploration of wildfire impacts on regional environments, and indicates the effectiveness of Chinese current wildfire policy on the pollutant emission mitigation.

TI  - Characterizing ecosystem change in wetlands using dense earth observation time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands in drylands are vulnerable to degradation and disappearance due to the combined effects of increasing anthropogenic disturbances and climatic extremes. Such influences may drive non-linear shifts in surface re-sponses that require long-term monitoring approaches for their study. Here, we used a piece-wise regression model to characterize long-term Ecosystem Change Types (ECT) in the surface water and vegetation dynamics of the Inner Niger Delta wetlands in Mali between 2000 and 2019. We also examined the added benefits of using a dense Landsat time series for such segmented trend analysis in comparison with MODIS products that are regularly used for ecosystem trends assessment. Our approach has found statistically significant (p < 0.05) long-term changes in wetland ecosystems, as calculated from Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image series on both the MODIS and the Landsat scales. The class-specific accuracies of the detected ECTs were evaluated through the validation of temporal trajectories based on the TimeSync logic at selected probability sample locations. Results showed higher user's, producer's, and overall accuracies (OA) when using a dense Landsat time series (OA = 0.89 +/- 0.01), outperforming the MOD09A1 time series (OA = 0.37 +/- 0.03). Our study provides a robust framework for long-term wetland monitoring that demonstrates the benefits of applying dense Landsat time-series imagery for accurate quanti-fications of linear and non-linear ecosystem responses in vast highly dynamic floodplain systems. Delivering such an improved assessment, in a spatial resolution that better resolves the characteristics of wetlands ecosystems, has the potential to support the information needs of global conservation and restoration efforts.

TI  - Spatiotemporal distribution of aerosols over the Tibet Plateau and Tarim Basin (1980-2020)
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) represents the optical attenuation of aerosol, which, to a certain extent, can reflect regional air pollution levels with obvious spatiotemporal characteristics. However, the currently limited moni-toring technology cannot provide long-time sequential and detailed AOD information. Therefore, in this paper, Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) data, and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) data from 1980 to 2020 were used to analyze the characteristics of both the spatiotemporal distribution of aerosols and dust transportation in the Tibet Plateau and Tarim Basin. Moreover, Random Forest (RF) Model was employed for ranking the importance of multiple natural factors (evaporation, mean surface temperature, daily precipitation, mean air pressure, mean relative humidity, mean temperature and mean wind speed) on AOD, Wavelet Analysis Method was utilized for the scale analysis between key natural factors and AOD, and Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) Model was applied to the simulation of the transportation trajectories of dust aerosols. The results show that high AOD values in the Tibet Plateau and Tarim Basin appeared in spring. Dust aerosols in the northern slope of the Tibet Plateau dispersed and decreased from the north to the middle of Plateau. Dust Aerosol Optical Depth (DAOD) reached its peak in spring and summer with the maximum transportation range of 34 degrees N or so. Besides, Tarim Basin transported dust to the northern slope of the Tibet Plateau significantly, which was then transported to the main body of the Plateau along its northern slope (37 degrees N) with a dust particle proportion of 40%-80%. Moreover, precipitation was the most significant factor (32.18%) influencing the spatiotemporal distribution of AOD. The former lagged behind the latter by 5/12 periods at most and showed a negative cor-relation with it.

TI  - Developing a sub-meter phenological spectral feature for mapping poplars and willows in urban environment
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Poplar and willow catkins (PWCs) have caused severe impacts on human health and environmental quality, and accurate poplars and willows (PaWs) mapping with remote sensing is essential to monitor and manage the PWCs. However, two major issues have constrained the urban tree species (e.g. PaWs) identification: (1) the urban tree landscapes are highly fragmented and susceptible to the existence of mixed pixels in the remote sensing imagery; (2) the tree species in urban environment are diverse with high spectral similarity. To this end, this study developed a sub-meter phenological spectral feature (Spsf) with multi-scale and multi-temporal remote sensing imagery for monitoring PaWs at the tree species level. Spsf includes three steps: (1) exploring three key phenological periods of PaWs (leafless period, greenleaf period, and senescence period); (2) selecting one or three spectral indexes to characterize each phenological period; (3) stacking the spectral vegetation indexes from Sentinel-2 SR imagery and freely available sub-meter (0.8 m) Google Earth imagery together. Subsequently, Spsf was taken as the input data to train the deep learning DeepLabv3 + model for predicting the PaWs distribution. The Beijing Plain was chosen as the study area, where the distribution of PaWs was extensive and fragmented. Compared with the field survey reference data, the derived PaWs map achieved the overall accuracy higher than 92 % and the Kappa coefficient of 0.83. The Spsf integrated rich spatial information from sub-meter imagery and phenological spectral information from Sentinel-2 imagery, which may alleviate the impacts of mixed pixels and enhance the spectral separability between PaWs and other tree species effectively. The proposed Spsf-based method provides a new paradigm for sub-meter tree species mapping with multi-source free remote sensing data. The PaWs map can serve as reference data for the relevant departments to monitor and manage the PWCs.

TI  - The FIRST model: Spatiotemporal fusion incorrporting spectral autocorrelation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decade, spatiotemporal fusion has become an indispensable tool for monitoring land surface dy-namics due to its promising ability to produce surface reflectance products with both high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, existing fusion methods usually generate multispectral band products by predicting each spectral band separately, so the useful information of spectral autocorrelation within the spectrum has been ignored and waits to be exploited. To address this issue, we propose a novel spatiotemporal fusion method, the spatiotemporal Fusion Incorrporting Spectral autocorrelaTion (FIRST) model, to fully utilize the multiple spectral bands of surface reflectance products. Compared with other fusion methods, the model has three distinct ad-vantages: (1) it utilizes spectral autocorrelation in a many-to-many regression framework that simultaneously inputs and predicts multispectral bands without the collinearity effect; (2) it maintains high fusion accuracy when the spatiotemporal variation is large with acceptable computational efficiency; and (3) it can produce robust results even with input images contaminated by haze and thin clouds. We tested the FIRST model at several experimental sites and compared it with four typical methods, the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) model, the regression model Fitting, spatial Filtering and residual Compensation (Fit-FC) model and the enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM). The results demonstrate that FIRST yields better overall performance for its simple and effective technical principles. FIRST is thus expected to provide high-quality remotely sensed data with high spatial resolution and frequent observations for various applications.

TI  - Low sensitivity <i>of Pinus mugo</i> to surface ozone pollution in the subalpine zone of continental Europe
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High altitudes have been exposed to enhanced levels of surface ozone (O-3) concentrations over recent decades compared to the pre-industrial era. The responses of vegetation to this toxic pollutant are species-specific and depend on the climate conditions. In this paper, we explored the reaction of Pinus mugo (P. mugo) to O-3-induced stress in the continental climate of an ozone-rich mountain area in the High Tatra Mountains (Western Carpathians). The effects of O-3 doses modelled by a deposition model, O-3 concentrations and other factors on P. mugo were identified from (a) satellite-based data via NDVI (normalised differenced vegetation index) over 2000-2020 and (b) visible injury on needle samples gathered from P. mugo individuals at ground-truth sites in 2019 and 2020. Analysing the NDVI trend, we observed non-significant changes (p > 0.05) in the greenness of P. mugo despite growing in an environment with the average seasonal O-3 concentration around 51.6 ppbv, the maximum hourly concentrations more than 90 ppbv and increasing trend of O-3 doses by 0.1 mmol m(-2) PLA (plant leaf area) year(-1). The visible O-3 injury of samples collected at study sites was low (mean injury observed on 1-10% of needles' surface), and the symptoms of injury caused by other biotic and abiotic factors prevailed over those caused by O-3. In addition, the correlation analyses between NDVI and the climatic factors indicated a significant (p < 0.05) and positive relationship with photosynthetic active radiation (R = 0.45) in July, and with stomatal conductance (R = 0.52) and temperature factor (R = 0.43) in August. Therefore, we concluded that the positive effect of climate conditions, which support the growth processes of P. mugo, may suppress the negative effect of the mean O-3 doses of 17.8 mmol m(-2) PLA accumulated over the growing season.

TI  - Assessing Forest Cover Loss Using Landsat Images and GIS: A Case Study in Colombian Protected Area
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Corchal "El Mono Hernandez" Fauna and Flora Sanctuary is a protected area located in northern Colombia and is home to the Pterocarpus officinalis forest. In this area, however, this forest cover is declining due to natural causes associated with a change in the hydrosedimentological dynamics. Multitemporal assessment was performed to quantify the forest loss. Landsat images from the years 1986, 1998, 2003, 2013, and 2018 were downloaded and a supervised classification was performed using four cover classes: "Pterocarpus officinalis," "other vegetation," "waterbody," and "bare land." The results showed that the vegetation cover of Pterocarpus officinalis forest had an initial extent of 865.26 ha in 1986; for the 1986-1998 period, the reduction was 60.30 ha; for the 1998-2003 period, it was 399.15 ha; and for the 2003-2013 period, it was 78.30 ha. Contrary to previous periods, in the 2013-2018 period, 79.65 ha of forest was recovered. In conclusion, Pterocarpus officinalis forest lost approximately 50% of its cover during the 1986-2018 period. This information is of great importance for government and management entities for decision-making in the conservation and restoration of this forest.

TI  - The influence and contribution of fine mode particles to aerosol optical properties during haze events at the foothills of Himalaya-Karakorum region
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade, the regional haze is considered as one of the most devastating weathers which causes serious impacts on air quality, human health, and transportation over the Indo-Gangetic Plain, particularly the eastern part of Pakistan. In this paper for the first time, the long-term characterization of aerosols optical properties during haze events were carried out using ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra satellite over Lahore and Faisalabad for the period of 2009-2018. Firstly, the MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) was correlated with AERONET AOD and reported a high degree of R-squared correlation of value 0.78 between two datasets for the months of October, November and December during the study period (2009-2018). After validation of data, the daily averaged AOD and Angstrom Exponent (AE) values exceeding 1 were selected as heavy haze events. Then the aerosol optical properties such as AOD, AE, Volume Size Distribution (VSD), and Fine Mode Fraction (FMF) of AOD were retrieved from AERONET and MODIS for further analysis. The distribution of AOD and AE showed that most of the values were greater than 1.3 and 1.1, respectively, during haze events over both study sites. The daily averaged profile of aerosol VSD exhibited a bimodal lognormal distribution having dominant fine mode peaks at radius between 0.19 and 0.25 mu m as compared to coarse modes peaks. Furthermore, the contribution of fine-mode AOD to the total AOD was quite higher (i.e., 86-98%) during haze events showing the greater contribution of fine mode aerosol particles. The correlation of AE with AOD and FMF revealed that the pronounced aerosol types were fine mode aerosol particles originated due to biomass burning and urban/industrial emissions during haze events. These types of fine mode aerosol particles were also confirmed with Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) subtype measurements. Furthermore, the back trajectories revealed that most air masses were received from the local/regional aerosol sources, showing the contribution of fine mode aerosol particles to haze events whilst some of the trajectories were from Afghanistan, Iran, and India showing long range transportation of air masses to the receptor sites.

TI  - A new approach to evaluate the risk of bark beetle outbreaks using multi-step machine learning methods
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) alter forest ecosystem functioning through tree mortality, thus causing billions of dollars in economic and ecological damages worldwide. Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann is considered one of the most significant insect pest species of pine (Pinus spp.) trees in the United States (U.S.), Central America, and Mexico. To manage this threat, research has sought to predict and forecast outbreaks and identify high risk areas to focus on preventative management and reduce economic losses. Prior work has focused on using environmental predictors, but limitations have arisen regarding data availability and structure. Our research objective was to improve on current D. frontalis outbreak prediction models using contemporary modeling techniques. Beetle outbreak data were obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USDA-FS) and were paired with three spatial-temporal beetle outbreak dynamics from the prior year, fifteen climate variables (DAYMET and WORLDCLIM) (temperature, radiation, wind, and water resources), two terrain attributes (NASA) (elevation and compound topographic index), and four vegetation indices [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)] [maximum and mean normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)] as predictive features. Extreme gradient boosting was used to create two separate models that predicted the probability and magnitude of beetle outbreaks, which were used to create interpolated prediction maps for the southeastern U.S. The interpolated maps were combined to estimate outbreak risk (i.e., risk = probability of outbreak x magnitude of outbreak). Overall model accuracy was 87.7% when tested on an independent dataset. Distance to prior year outbreak and mean NDVI were the most important features when predicting the probability of outbreak, while summer maximum temperature, distance to prior year outbreak, and winter minimum temperature were the highest weighted features when predicting the magnitude. Results indicated that most of the southeastern U.S. was at low risk (<0.0001% damage per hectare) for the years 2008-2020. Risk was highest for 2012, 2016, and 2017. A few areas in Alabama, Georgia, northern Florida, and South Carolina contained stands at higher risk for damage (>0.01% per hectare) and some locations were at risk for >90% damage per hectare. Extreme gradient boosting paired with outbreak probability and magnitude performed well and is proposed as a solution for future bark beetle prediction and forecasting for more timely management strategies. The inclusion of climatic variables in outbreak models allows for forecasting the effects of future climate change on pine pest populations globally.

TI  - Assessing mangrove species diversity, zonation and functional indicators in response to natural, regenerated, and rehabilitated succession
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem restoration (2021-2030) lists mangrove ecosystems as a restoration priority. Interest in their conservation has increased recently due to their widespread degradation. Anthropogenic stressors and rehabilitation practices, specifically, have resulted in a significant decline in their species compositions. We investigated the knowledge gaps in terms of potential spatial diversity, intertidal zonation, and the historic state of mangrove forest species, and tested the role of environmental factors such as topography, as well as rehabilitation practices on diversity. Diversity and complexity indices, surface elevation, and species and structural diversities along three simplified transect lines over a broad geographical area and under various management practices were analyzed in Trat province, Thailand. Quantitative statistical zonation analyses within each transect and at the landscape-scale were performed using randomization tests and hierarchical cluster analysis. A modified "automatic regrowth monitoring algorithm (ARMA), " based on Landsat (1987-2020) and Sentinel-2 MSI (2015-2020) annual median composites was also used. Fifteen species were identified, with Ceriops tagal as the dominant species. Statistical analysis, however, failed to identify any significant zonation patterns at transect or landscape-scales at specific elevations. Rehabilitated and naturally regenerated stands showed gradual increases in their Normalized Difference Infrared Index over time. After 30 years, the rehabilitated stands made up of Rhizophoraceae monocultures were the same height as the adjacent natural stands. Depending on the location and propagule availability, the diversity and structure of regenerated stands exhibited high variation. Effluent from shrimp farms may have contributed to the disturbance of the forest stands and changes in shrimp farming practices could have facilitated their recovery. The results of the present study provide a valuable diversity baseline for the study site and secondary succession in rehabilitated and regenerated mangroves. The ARMA algorithm has also been confirmed as a valuable tool for future investigations of secondary succession and mangrove biodiversity status.

TI  - Reconstruction of 60-year (1961-2020) surface air temperature on the Tibetan Plateau by fusing MODIS and ERA5 temperatures
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The warming amplification of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has exerted great impacts on the environment in and around the region. It is necessary to thoroughly investigate the temperature changes over the TP. However, the commonly used station observations, satellite products and reanalysis data for relevant studies suffer from deficiencies of sparse spatial distribution, limited temporal coverage and large uncertainties, respectively. This leaves the current understanding of temperature change on the TP still inadequate. Therefore, we propose a multi-source data fusion method to integrate the advantages of different data. Combining the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) products and station observations, this new method first obtains short-term satellite -derived surface air temperature (SAT) estimates over grids. The European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts ReAnalysis 5 land portion (ERA5-Land) temperature with long time range is then clustered and used as independent variables for the Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR) model. Based on this BRR model, the temporal span of the estimated gridded satellite SAT is extended, and a fused 1-km monthly mean SAT dataset is generated over the TP from 1961 to 2020. The results indicate that the fused data generated by our proposed method has good accuracy with overall RMSE and MBE of 1.33 ? and 1.03 ?, respectively. Despite the temporal and spatial heterogeneity, the performance of the fused SATs is acceptable across seasons and geographical locations. The dataset also shows a great potential for detecting accurate long-term temperature changes across the TP. This fused SAT data owns the advantages from multiple data sources with high accuracy, good spatial continuity, fine spatial resolution and wide temporal coverage, which confirms that our fusion method can provide a favorable opportunity to explore the warming over the TP.

TI  - Comparison of single tree detection methods to extract support trees for cable road planning
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - For the provision of various ecosystem services in steep terrain, such as protection against natural hazards, a forest must be managed, which often requires the use of cable yarders. The design of a cable road is a complex and demanding task that also includes the search for appropriate support and anchor trees. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether and with what reliability potential support trees for cable yarding can be detected using remote sensing data. The detection of potential support trees was tested using 48 method combinations on 10 test plots of the Experimental Forest Management project in cable yarder terrain in the Swiss Alps in the Canton of Grisons. The most suitable method combinations used a Gaussian filter and a local maxima algorithm. On average, they had an extraction rate of 108.9-124.5% (root mean square, RMS) and a mean commission error of 66.0-67.2% (RMS). The correctly detected trees deviated horizontally by an average of 1.8 to 1.9 m from the position of the reference trees. The difference in tree heights was 1.1 to 1.6 m. However, for the application of single tree detection to support cable road planning in steep and complex terrain, too few potential support trees were detected. Nonetheless, the accuracy of the extracted tree parameters would already be sufficient for cable road planning.

TI  - Quantifying the impacts of opencast mining on vegetation dynamics over eastern India using the long-term Landsat-series satellite dataset
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Enhanced spatio-temporal and up-to-date information on vegetation dynamics at various spatial scales are imperative in understanding the human, biosphere, and atmosphere interactions. Thus, the present study attempts to derive the vegetation greenness trends with the medium spatial resolution (30 m) satellite data at the regional scale with the support of Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. The long-term Landsat series satellite dataset was employed to characterize vegetation greenness trends using the Mann-Kendall test over the mining-dominated regions of Eastern India (Jharkhand and Odisha states) for two study periods, viz. earlier (1988-2004) and later (2000-2020). The key findings revealed that -1285 km2 (2.97%) and 1688 km2 (3.91%) areas over Jharkhand state and - 5213 km2 (5.68%) and 2940 km2 (3.20%) areas over Odisha state showed the negative vegetation greenness trend (indicative of decreasing vegetation activity) during 1988-2004 and 2000-2020, respectively. It was observed that the major anthropogenic activities, particularly opencast mining, are the major factor for vegetation degradation in Jharkhand and Odisha states, contributing to -3-5.7% vegetation degradation during the study periods. The negative vegetation greenness trend patches were mainly observed in mining sites, settlement encroachments, construction sites, roadways, logging sites, etc. The drastic rise in the intensity of mining activities in the last two decades (2000-2020) has led to massive vegetation destruction compared to the earlier period (1988-2004). Furthermore, the key climatic parameters (i.e., precipitation, temperature, downward radiation, and soil moisture) have less control over the long-term vegetation greenness trends in the mining-dominated regions (- 27%) in contrast to forest regions (- 47%). The findings of the study shall be helpful to the policy-makers, stakeholders, environmentalists, and government bodies to formulate and implement various sustainable development programs in the mining-dominated regions to ensure ecological conservation and enhance ecological services.

TI  - Impact of forest fire frequency on tree biomass and carbon stocks in the tropical dry deciduous forest of Panna Tiger Reserve, Central India
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are an important ecological force that shaped the forest ecosystems, but uncontrolled fires also cause great loss of biological diversity, as well as economic wealth. Fires are critical pathways of carbon loss from a tropical dry deciduous forest. The present work estimates the effect of forest fires on tree biomass and carbon storage pattern of tropical dry deciduous forest of Panna Tiger Reserve, Madhya Pradesh, Central India. Forest fire maps were prepared using Landsat Images (1997-2017), which were classified into seven fire frequency classes (B1-B7) and one control class (B0). Five plots were laid randomly in every fire class and all trees were enumerated in these fire frequency classes. A total of 44 tree species were recorded belonging to 33 genera and 21 families. The density ranged 402-597 individuals/ha while basal area ranged 8.84-15.89 m(2)/ha. The total trees biomass ranged from 71.41 to 124.58 Mg/ha, and total carbon ranged between 33.87 and 59.26 Mg C/ha. Among all fire frequency classes; the highest biomass was recorded in B2 (124.00 Mg/ha) followed by B0 (118.00 Mg/ha) whereas the least was in the B7 (70.80 Mg/ha) class. Carbon stock has the same pattern as that biomass accumulation. Tree carbon stock showed a significant positive relationship with a basal area (R-2 = 9.66). Our results reveal that the higher percentage of carbon was stored in intermediate burned areas whereas the lower percentage was in higher fire frequency areas. The results of the present study would improve understanding of carbon stock present in different fire frequencies and could be used to enhance the carbon sequestration potential in fire-affected areas through conservation and proper management.

TI  - MODIS-Landsat fusion-based single-band algorithms for TSS and turbidity estimation in an urban-waste-dominated river reach
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Riverine ecosystem management along an urban stretch mostly depends on high-frequent (daily-scale) monitoring of water quality at finer spatial resolutions. However, with the decrease in the number of in-situ monitoring stations owing to their expensive maintenance cost, there is a need to develop the next-generation remote sensing (RS) tools as an alternate approach with better synoptic coverage of river water quality assessment. This study advocates three novel model variants to estimate the total suspended solids (TSS) concentration at daily -scale using the public-domain MODIS and Landsat satellite datasets. The MODT model variant uses the 1-dayx250 m MODIS public domain datasets, and the FUST model is based on the 1-dayx30 m MODIS-Landsat fusion datasets, whereas the CFUST model integrates the Frank Copula with the FUST model. These hierarchical model variants are assessed in the urban-waste-dominated lower Ganges, namely the Hooghly River and the Brahmani River, in eastern India using the measured in-situ TSS datasets at multiple monitoring stations from 2016 to 2019. The results reveal that the CFUST is the best TSS estimation model variant that performs with the average coefficient of determination of 0.88-0.93, mean absolute error of 0.17-0.19, and normal root mean square error of 0.05-0.09. Conclusively, the proposed CFUST and CFUSTU stochastic models can be used as potential tools for TSS and turbidity assessment along the dynamic river systems, respectively.

TI  - Robust Anthropogenic Signal Identified in the Seasonal Cycle of Tropospheric Temperature
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous work identified an anthropogenic fingerprint pattern in T-AC(x, t), the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of mid- to upper-tropospheric temperature (TMT), but did not explicitly consider whether fingerprint identification in satellite T-AC(x, t) data could have been influenced by real-world multidecadal internal variability (MIV). We address this question here using large ensembles (LEs) performed with five climate models. LEs provide many different sequences of internal variability noise superimposed on an underlying forced signal. Despite differences in historical external forcings, climate sensitivity, and MIV properties of the five models, their T-AC(x, t) fingerprints are similar and statistically identifiable in 239 of the 240 LE realizations of historical climate change. Comparing simulated and observed variability spectra reveals that consistent fingerprint identification is unlikely to be biased by model underestimates of observed MIV. Even in the presence of large (factor of 3-4) intermodel and inter-realization differences in the amplitude of MIV, the anthropogenic fingerprints of seasonal cycle changes are robustly identifiable in models and satellite data. This is primarily due to the fact that the distinctive, global-scale fingerprint patterns are spatially dissimilar to the smaller-scale patterns of internal T-AC(x, t) variability associated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. The robustness of the seasonal cycle detection and attribution results shown here, taken together with the evidence from idealized aquaplanet simulations, suggest that basic physical processes are dictating a common pattern of forced T-AC(x, t) changes in observations and in the five LEs. The key processes involved include GHG-induced expansion of the tropics, lapse-rate changes, land surface drying, and sea ice decrease.

TI  - Developing a long-term high-resolution winter fog climatology over south Asia using satellite observations from 2002 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The vast Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) south of the Himalaya are subject to dense fog every year during winter months (December-January), severely disrupting rail, air and public transport of millions of people living in northern India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. Air pollution combined with high moisture availability in the shallow boundary layer, are important factors affecting the persistence and widespread nature of fog over the IGP. Despite the environmental significance and impacts on the public at-large, an in depth understanding of the long-term spatial-temporal distribution of the south Asian fog, is presently not available in the literature. We utilize infrared remote sensing techniques to develop a high-resolution (asymptotic to 1 km x 1 km) fog/low-stratus detection climatology over the past two decades (2002-2020), using Aqua/MODIS satellite observations. A dynamic brightness temperature difference threshold (involving 3.96 mu m and 11.03 mu m bands) for nighttime fog/low-stratus detection is constructed based on systematic radiative transfer simulations involving cloud effective radius, cloud top height, liquid water path and satellite viewing geometry. Our satellite-based fog/low-stratus detection is consistent with theoretical simulations of fog characterization and is also found to be well-correlated with near-surface visibility observations of dense fog (r = 0.89, p-value << 0.01). We also provide satellite -derived nighttime estimates of fog/low-cloud effective radius that are comparable to the operational daytime MODIS cloud data product and limited in situ observations. In terms of fog/low-stratus frequency, the IGP is relatively uniformly covered by widespread fog/low-stratus occurrences with the largest frequency found in the low-lying Terai region, bordering India and Nepal, which is also consistently observed in our daytime fog/low-stratus detection results over the last two decades. Additionally, the interannual variations in fog/low-stratus occurrences track closely with that of relative humidity in the IGP, which is associated with shallow boundary layer conditions during winter-time favoring the formation and persistence of fog. Overall, these long-term satellite-derived results present new high-resolution data and insights into the dense and often intense winter fog occurrences which routinely engulf the entire stretch of the Indo-Gangetic Plains and cause significant degradation to ground visibility in one of the world's most densely populated regions.

TI  - Spaceborne LiDAR and animal-environment relationships: An assessment for forest carnivores and their prey in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Animal conservation requires understanding animal-habitat relationships. The integration of novel remote sensing platforms such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has dramatically improved the resolution of insight when evaluating animal-habitat relationships by characterizing forest structure. However, conventional LiDAR collection (e.g., airborne or terrestrial laser scanning) may be limited by small spatial extents and logistical constraints (e.g., budget) associated with sampling. NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission provides an alternative and complement to conventional LiDAR sampling with globally available waveform LiDAR, which is being collected to characterize vertical and horizontal structure of Earth's forests. Forest carnivores are wide-ranging species occupying forested ecosystems, and are generally associated with vertical and horizontal forest structure for their survival and reproduction. We evaluated patterns in occurrence and habitat use of forest carnivores, which included Pacific martens (Martes caurina), Rocky Mountain red foxes (Vulpes vulpes macroura), and coyotes (Canis latrans) and patterns in occurrence of their prey; American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and snowshoe hares (Lepus americans). Camera trap data were collected during the 2014-2017 winters in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in Wyoming, USA. Our objectives were to (1) combine GEDI samples with multispectral satellite imagery from Landsat 8 to upscale vertical forest structure metrics; (2) assess the relative importance of environmental characteristics influencing occurrence and habitat use of forest-associated predators and prey; and (3) determine if GEDI-derived variables aided our efforts in characterizing animal-environment relationships. We used Random Forest regression models to upscale GEDI samples across our study area and implemented a multi-tiered approach using generalized linear mixed effect models to simultaneously evaluate animal-environment relationships and how GEDI-derived metrics improved the animal-habitat models. GEDI-derived metrics of relative height and foliage height diversity improved our animal-environment models and were among the strongest covariates (effect sizes were 1.3-1.8 times larger than the next closest) in the coyote, red squirrel, and snowshoe hare models. All five species were influenced to some degree by the frequency of rebaiting a camera trap and varying conditions of snow depth. Collectively, our work indicates forest canopy height and complexity variables significantly improved our ability to assess the importance of forest characteristics on forest carnivores and their prey. Indeed, there is an untapped opportunity to enhance animal ecology and conservation planning with continued integration of GEDI information with freely available satellite data to characterize attributes of forest structure across expansive areas.

TI  - Assessment of air quality during worst wildfires in Mugla and Antalya regions of Turkey
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, a worse and large-scale forest fire broke out across Turkey, which adversely affected the country's air quality level and caused a tremendous loss. Mugla and Antalya cities were the hot spot areas of this fire that experienced adverse effects. In this paper, we examined and compared the air pollution before and during the forest fire episode i.e., from 27 July to 10 August 2021 in Antalya and Mugla. The results show that before the fire accusation, i.e., on 27 July, the daily mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) was 0.1 indicating a clear sky. However, after the fire breakout on 28 July, this daily mean AOD value rapidly increased to 0.52 on 6 August, indicating intense air pollution. The highest AOD was 2.2 over northern Marmaris, Ula, southeastern Milas, and Mugla Merkezon on 5 August 2021. The results show that peak fire activity occurred during 4-8 August. Meanwhile, the highest NO2 concentration was 167 mu mol/m(2) over mid-east Merkez and Koycegiz. The peak HCHO load was 750 mu mol/m(2) over southern Mugla city. Moreover, Mugla and central Antalya cities experienced the highest O-3 concentration of 0.14 mol/m(2). Similarly, at the junction of Dalaman, Koycegiz, and Ortaca, a peak in CO (0.08 mol/m(2)) and aerosol index (AI) (3.5) had been observed. The high-altitude smoke was observed over Mugla city. Whereas, over Antalya, mixed aerosols were dominant, followed by smoke, dust, non-smoke fine mode, and fine dominating aerosols.

TI  - Modeling of surface sediment concentration in the Doce River basin using satellite remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface sediment concentration (SSC) is linked to several problems related to water quality and its monitoring is costly because of the required fieldwork and laboratory analyses. Thus, sediment measurements are often spo-radic, punctual, and performed during a short period. Orbital remote sensing allows the monitoring of SSC along the river channel permitting continuous and spatial information. This work had two objectives: (1) to model the surface concentration of sediments in the main channel of the Doce river using data from Multispectral Instru-ment (MSI)/Sentinel 2 and Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat 8 satellite sensors; and (2) to compare different linear modeling approaches to select the best variables for SSC monitoring. For comparison with actual field data, we used mean SSC measurements in 14 sediment gauge stations from 2013 to 2020. Reflectance data of the MSI/Sentinel 2 and OLI/Landsat 8 satellites bands and spectral indices related to the monitoring of water resources were used as explanatory variables. Simple and multiple linear regression models (SLR and MLR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and Elastic Net regression were used to predict the SSC. The near-infrared band images from both MSI/Sentinel 2 and OLI/Landsat 8 satellites showed a strong linear rela-tionship with the SSC. Multiple linear regression, LASSO and Elastic Net regressions showed good performance for SSC prediction. Sediment flow maps show an SSC reduction in the Doce river channel in recent years, indicating that part of the material from the Funda similar to o tailings dam rupture may have been transported through sediment resuspension and transport processes.

TI  - Forest canopy stratification based on fused, imbalanced and collinear LiDAR and Sentinel-2 metrics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge about the forest canopy stratification is of essential importance for forest management and planning. Collecting structural information (e.g. natural regeneration) still depends on cost and labour intensive forest inventories with a coarse spatio-temporal resolution. Remote sensing partly overcomes these limitations and particularly active sensors of type light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have proven their great potential of separating forest strata. The applicability of LiDAR metrics for the differentiation of the spruce dominated forest strata in Central Germany has not been tested yet. Additionally, studying the potential of Sentinel-2 metrics for the classification of forest strata is lacking too.In this study, we investigated the capabilities of six different classification approaches for the differentiation of five forest strata that are typical for the study region. Reference data were derived from forest inventory measurements surveyed on a dense 200 x 200 m grid. The six classification approaches were trained with fused and un-fused LiDAR and Sentinel-2 inferred metrics. The classification results were compared using the overall mean accuracy, sensitivity and specificity via receivers operating characteristics of multi-class problems. We were interested in the classification abilities of Sentinel-2 metrics due to the obvious advantages of Sentinel-2 based metrics (free of charge, high spatio-temporal coverage). We assumed that the canopy structure determines the reflection on stand level and thus might facilitate the classification of different canopy strata. Beforehand, it was important to examine the influence of distinctly imbalanced and collinear reference data on the classification results.We found that the Random Forest classifier most accurately separated the five forest strata with a mean overall accuracy of 83.3% (Kappa = 76.2%). These values were achieved from balanced training data and the classification capability was confirmed by classification results from an independent test data set. Fused predictors of active (LiDAR) and passive (Sentinel-2) remote sensing revealed no substantial improvement in the classification accuracy due to the dominant role of LiDAR metrics. Herein, we identified that especially the height variability, top height, portion of LiDAR-returns between 2 m and 10 m and the standard deviation of the return number between the 25th and 50th height percentile, predominately contributed to the classification accuracy. Classification results purely based on Sentinel-2 metrics revealed a rather small overall mean accuracy of 54.7%. The metrics (e.g. median, variance, entropy) were derived from Sentinel-2 indices, covering the visible and near to short infrared spectrum. Variable importance computations unraveled a detectable but minor contribution of MSI, TCG, NDVI to the classification result. Finally, our data driven observations illustrated serious drawbacks associated to data imbalance, collinearity and autocorrelation and presented practical guidance to cope with these issues.

TI  - Changes in vegetation cover and its influencing factors in the inner Mongolia reach of the yellow river basin from 2001 to 2018
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation cover is one of the primary indicators of changes in ecosystems. China has implemented a few large-scale afforestation programs in the arid and semi-arid areas, including the Inner Mongolia Reach of the Yellow River Basin to prevent and control soil erosion. Although these programs have alleviated the environment problems in the region to a certain extent, the effects of the increasing vegetation greenness on the environments under climate change remain controversial for the argued large water consumption. In this study, the spatio-temporal characteristics of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the vegetation coverage area of the study area based on remote sensing data from 2001 to 2018. Meanwhile, using the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) method - an excellent algorithm for ensemble learning methods - to forecast vegetation growth in the following ten years. The results indicated that, despite of the spatial heterogeneity, the vegetation NDVI exhibited a significant increase across the study area. Based on the NDVI trend, the area of improved vegetation in this region was much larger than the degraded area from 2001 to 2018, accounting for 85.9% and 8.6% of the total vegetation coverage area, respectively. However, the forecasting result by the Hurst index shows the future growth and carbon sequestration capacity in most areas showed a declining trend. Further, based on the Coupled Model Inter comparison Project -Phase 6 (CMIP6) data, the XGBoost method is used to predict the growth status and carbon sequestration capacity of vegetation in this area under different climate scenarios. The results showed that different climate scenarios had little effect on vegetation growth from 2019 to 2030. Results from this study may provide basis for the protection of ecological environment in the Inner Mongolia Reach of the Yellow River Basin.

TI  - Role of Geospatial Technology in Shifting Cultivation Studies in India: A Systematic Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Shifting cultivation is a traditional farming system that has been practised in many parts of the world for centuries. It is rampant in the northeast region of India and has widespread environmental and socio-economic impacts. The application of geospatial technology for studying the same has been slowly but surely gaining momentum. This systematic review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, intending to present a comprehensive picture of remote sensing-based shifting cultivation studies in India to date, collate their findings, and identify research gaps that could be addressed using geospatial techniques. For the review, Scopus search results were refined to eliminate redundancies, and a total of 44 English language publications from peer-reviewed scientific journals were considered. The studies were apposed about their respective areas of interest, satellite data and products used, time frames, approaches, and findings. A majority of the studies are focused on mapping and monitoring shifting cultivation areas, using Landsat or IRS LISS III imagery. In the Indian context, geospatial technology can be effectively used to explore the pattern of spatio-temporal variations of shifting cultivation, disturbance and recovery cycles, secondary vegetation growth, and impacts of shifting cultivation on carbon dynamics and climate. With the availability of new sensors, data integration methods, and free algorithms/software and platforms, geospatial technology has the potential to address various aspects related to shifting cultivation.

TI  - Relational holon science and Popper's 3 worlds in engineering practice
T2  - SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to outline, briefly, Rosen's relational theory of biology engendered relational holon science and Popper's metaphysical ontology of 'three worlds' as the shared physical and non-physical. We consider both theories, explore their similarities and to begin to interpret and integrate them into new ways of thinking about the processes of creating engineered systems We propose a model that consists of holons set in a holarchy that is based on a modern interpretation of Aristotle's four causes. Relational holon science is mathematically sound through the causal closure of a holon and formal consistency in category theory. The schema relates the material reality of Popper's world1 and the formal knowledge of world3 through the subjective/experiential world2. The overall aim is to help to improve engineering practice within a theoretical foundation for practical common-sense schema such as Plan, Do Check and Act (PDCA) and Observe, Orient, Decide and Act (OODA) and a different worldview of our natural world.

TI  - Combining aerial photos and LiDAR data to detect canopy cover change in urban forests
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The advancement and accessibility of high-resolution remotely sensed data has made it feasible to detect tree canopy cover (TCC) changes over small spatial scales. However, the short history of these high-resolution collection techniques presents challenges when assessing canopy changes over longer time scales (> 50 years). This research shows how using high-resolution LiDAR data in conjunction with historical aerial photos can overcome this limitation. We used the University of British Columbia's Point Grey campus in Vancouver, Canada, as a case study, using both historical aerial photographs from 1949 and 2015 LiDAR data. TCC was summed in 0.05 ha analysis polygons for both the LiDAR and aerial photo data, allowing for TCC comparison across the two different data types. Methods were validated using 2015 aerial photos, the means (Delta 0.24) and a TOST test indicated that the methods were statistically equivalent (+/- 5.38% TCC). This research concludes the methods outlined is suitable for small scale TCC change detection over long time frames when inconsistent data types are available between the two time periods.

TI  - Tawhiti nui, tawhiti roa: tawhiti tuauriuri, tawhiti tuahekeheke: a Maori lifecourse framework and its application to longitudinal research
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Maori hold unique views on the lifecourse but there has been limited Maori-led longitudinal research to date. There is a particular need for kaupapa Maori and interface longitudinal research that generates matauranga Maori and enables Maori-initiated transformative action. In this paper, we identify key features of a Maori lifecourse framework and its application to longitudinal research at the interface of matauranga Maori and Western science. We describe how these features are applied in the Taranaki Maori-led longitudinal research programme Te Kura Mai i Tawhiti. Maori will benefit from a regionally-focussed Maori approach to lifecourse research at the interface. This approach can be applied directly in future localised research led by Maori and other Indigenous peoples. Maori-led longitudinal research will inform effective interventions to lift Maori wellbeing and prospects throughout all stages of life and strengthen Maori contributions to wider society. Maori approaches to longitudinal research will help shape new futures for Maori and a brighter future for all peoples of Aotearoa New Zealand.

TI  - Oral microbial extracellular DNA initiates periodontitis through gingival degradation by fibroblast-derived cathepsin K in mice
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Periodontitis is a highly prevalent disease leading to uncontrolled osteoclastic jawbone resorption and ultimately edentulism; however, the disease onset mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Here we propose a mechanism for initial pathology based on results obtained using a recently developed Osteoadsorptive Fluogenic Sentinel (OFS) probe that emits a fluorescent signal triggered by cathepsin K (Ctsk) activity. In a ligature-induced mouse model of periodontitis, a strong OFS signal is observed before the establishment of chronic inflammation and bone resorption. Single cell RNA sequencing shows gingival fibroblasts to be the primary cellular source of early Ctsk. The in vivo OFS signal is activated when Toll-Like Receptor 9 (TLR9) ligand or oral biofilm extracellular DNA (eDNA) is topically applied to the mouse palatal gingiva. This previously unrecognized interaction between oral microbial eDNA and Ctsk of gingival fibroblasts provides a pathological mechanism for disease initiation and a strategic basis for early diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis.A highly sensitive imaging probe shows that oral microbial extracellular DNA triggers early activity of Ctsk in gingival fibroblasts, initiating periodontitis in mice.

TI  - <i>Streptococcus agalactiae cadD</i> alleviates metal stress and promotes intracellular survival in macrophages and ascending infection during pregnancy
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Perinatal infection with Streptococcus agalactiae, or Group B Streptococcus (GBS), is associated with preterm birth, neonatal sepsis, and stillbirth. Here, we study the interactions of GBS with macrophages, essential sentinel immune cells that defend the gravid reproductive tract. Transcriptional analyses of GBS-macrophage co-cultures reveal enhanced expression of a gene encoding a putative metal resistance determinant, cadD. Deletion of cadD reduces GBS survival in macrophages, metal efflux, and resistance to metal toxicity. In a mouse model of ascending infection during pregnancy, the Delta cadD strain displays attenuated bacterial burden, inflammation, and cytokine production in gestational tissues. Furthermore, depletion of host macrophages alters cytokine expression and decreases GBS invasion in a cadD-dependent fashion. Our results indicate that GBS cadD plays an important role in metal detoxification, which promotes immune evasion and bacterial proliferation in the pregnant host.

TI  - Development of the LCMAP annual land cover product across Hawai'i
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Following the completion of land cover and change (LCC) products for the conterminous United States (CONUS), the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS's) Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection initiative has broadened the capability of characterizing continuous historical land change across the full Landsat records for Hawai`i at 30-meter resolution. One of the challenges of implementing the LCMAP framework to process annual land cover maps in Hawai`i is to collect sufficient high-quality training data. Although multiple datasets depicting land cover information are available in Hawai`i, they covered limited time frames and were produced from various remote sensing sources with different, classification categories, spatial resolution, and mapping accu-racies. No solo product is suitable to provide LCMAP training data labels on its own. In this paper, we focused on enhancing the LCMAP training datasets to generate land cover products from 2000 to 2019 in Hawai`i. A total of 200 independent reference data plots were generated and manually interpreted for validating the mapping re-sults produced by the training datasets. The results revealed that using the appropriate filter of multiple products as training data pools improved the classification model performance. The effect of training datasets (e.g., spatial coverage, quality) on accuracies for different land cover types were summarized. The LCMAP land surface change products for Hawai`i are available at https://doi.org/10.5066/P91E8M23.

TI  - Showcasing the TAIAO project: providing resources for machine learning from images of New Zealand's natural environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Proper management of the earth's natural resources is imperative to combat further degradation of the natural environment. However, the environmental datasets necessary for informed resource planning and conservation can be costly to collect and annotate. Consequently, there is a lack of publicly available datasets, particularly annotated image datasets relevant for environmental conservation, that can be used for the evaluation of machine learning algorithms to determine their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, the Time-evolving Data Science and Artificial Intelligence for Advanced Open Environmental Science (TAIAO) project in New Zealand aims to provide a collection of datasets and accompanying example notebooks for their analysis. This paper showcases three New Zealand-based annotated image datasets that form part of the collection. The first dataset contains annotated images of various predator species, mainly small invasive mammals, taken using low-light camera traps predominantly at night. The second provides aerial photography of the Waikato region in New Zealand, in which stands of Kahikatea (a native New Zealand tree) have been marked up using manual segmentation. The third is a dataset containing orthorectified high-resolution aerial photography, paired with satellite imagery taken by Sentinel-2. Additionally, the TAIAO web platform also contains a collated list of other datasets provided and licensed by our data partners that may be of interest to other researchers.

TI  - Active tectonics in the Main Boundary Thrust zone, Garhwal Himalaya, as evident from palaeoseismic signatures, morphotectonic features and PSI base ground deformation
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Garhwal Himalaya, the steeply inclined Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) is characterized by landforms that indicate towards tectonic activity in the recent past. Linear active fault trace, sub-recent fault scarps, strath terrace, uplifted terraces, deflected drainage, and triangular facet cones are some of the morphotectonic evidences of recent tectonic activity along the MBT. The MBT is defined by active fault trace in the form of linear depression and shows a prominent slope break across it. Thrusting of the Lesser Himalayan bedrocks over the colluvial deposits and back tilting of the colluvial deposits are also observed in the MBT zone. The formation of the sag pond and the deposition of the Quaternary lacustrine sediments followed by the deformation of the lacustrine deposits indicate phases of tectonic activities along the MBT. The later phase of deformation is represented by the folded lacustrine and colluvial deposits, where the amplitude of the fold measures about 3 m-high and the deformed section measures about 23 m in length. The ongoing deformation patterns of the MBT zone have also been monitored with the help of Synthetic Aperture Radar-based time series analysis. We used Sentinel-1C dataset in ascending direction with polarization of the VV+ VH acquired between December 2, 2017 to September 7, 2021 to identify phase changes caused by ongoing active deformation. The Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) result based on Sentinel-1A suggests that the Dehradun-Mussoorie and adjoining region has undergone an average deformation of 5.5 to -11 mm/year and the ground displacement of 1.5 to -3.8 cm. The time series analysis reveals that the Mussoorie hills in the MBT zone have higher rate of deformation.

TI  - The effect of spatial and temporal scale on camouflage in North African rodents
T2  - BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background matching, a common form of camouflage, is a widespread anti-predator adaptation that hinders detection or recognition by increasing the resemblance of prey to its environment. However, the natural environment is complex and both spatially and temporally variable, which constrains effective background matching as an anti-predator strategy. Here, using remote sensing data (publicly available satellite imagery), we investigated how variation of habitat parameters predicts background matching in 16 Sahara-Sahel rodent species across spatial and temporal scales. All fur colour parameters (hue, saturation and brightness) strongly matched the respective habitats of the different species. Background matching in terms of hue was best at the microscale, whereas results for saturation and brightness showed more variation across spatial scales among species. Camouflage across the temporal scale (from 1 to 3 years before capture) was variable among species for all colour parameters. These complex interactions suggest that, in desert rodents, colour parameters are differentially sensitive to the respective scale of the habitat, plausibly reflecting the behaviour and life history of the species and the ecological properties determining their activity patterns. Consequently, the division between habitat (camouflage) generalists and specialists might become blurred in temporally changing and spatially variable environments.

TI  - Memory, orality and 'God-talk' in sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The indigenous people of sub-Saharan Africa approach their Supreme Being and express their reverence in diverse ways, as depicted in the different local names that describe this supernatural being. The African cultural worldview foregrounds that virtuous rapport with the Supreme Being provides wisdom and facilitates good cohabitation among humans. It is argued in this article that teachings from the Christian Bible contribute negatively to the disintegration, fragmentation and death of indigenous knowledge systems, which include African cultural values, memory and oral traditions. Recently, some African scholars have begun to create awareness of some of Africa's lost treasures. However, such contributions are disappointingly few. This study argues that memory and orality among Africans should be promoted and supported through various platforms, such as academic writing. This article will discuss memory, orality and 'God-talk' in terms of the following: teachings on moral values (e.g. relationships, marriage, humaneness [ubuntu or hunhu]) and the preservation of cultural heritage. The discussion uses qualitative analysis of secondary data and personal observation.Contribution: Firstly, the present study will provide for the readership in general, and academia in particular, a new perspective on African customs and indigenous belief systems about a Supreme Being. For example, Musiki as a Shona local dialect name for 'God' was already in use before the emergence of Christianity in Southern Africa. Secondly, previous contributions have not sufficiently explored memory and orality. This investigation serves as a resource or starting point for further research on memory and orality.

TI  - Background climate modulates the impact of land cover on urban surface temperature
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities with different background climates experience different thermal environments. Many studies have investigated land cover effects on surface urban heat in individual cities. However, a quantitative understanding of how background climates modify the thermal impact of urban land covers remains elusive. Here, we characterise land cover and their impacts on land surface temperature (LST) for 54 highly populated cities using Landsat-8 imagery. Results show that urban surface characteristics and their thermal response are distinctly different across various climate regimes, with the largest difference for cities in arid climates. Cold cities show the largest seasonal variability, with the least seasonality in tropical and arid cities. In tropical, temperate, and cold climates, normalised difference built-up index (NDBI) is the strongest contributor to LST variability during warm months followed by normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), while normalised difference bareness index (NDBaI) is the most important factor in arid climates. These findings provide a climate-sensitive basis for future land cover planning oriented at mitigating local surface warming.

TI  - Variability of Near-Surface Salinity in the Nordic Seas Over the Past Three Decades (1991-2019)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Nordic Seas have been widely implicated by deep water formation as a part of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. This study explores the spatiotemporal variations in the near-surface salinity over the Nordic Seas associated with surface freshening factors by using monthly TOPAZ4 reanalysis data from 1991 to 2019. We first show that reliability of TOPAZ4 data compared to the salinity products of other reanalysis data, satellite data, and in-situ measurements in the Nordic Seas. The salinity variability was larger in the Greenland Sea (GS) than in the Norwegian Sea (NS) on both time scales of seasonal and interannual. The seasonal change of GS salinity was coincident with the seasonality of sea ice extent. The longer-time variations are decomposed by empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. The GS salinity is mainly affected by current advection (29%) and sea ice extent (11%). The interannual response of salinity to the sea ice extent over the GS differs by season. NS salinity variability responds to the strength of the Subpolar Gyre associated with a large-scale atmospheric system that caused the freshening event in the mid-1990s. The propagation of the northward Atlantic Water core is observed over the period of about 3 years from the Faroe Shetland Channel to the Fram Strait at a speed of 2.6-6.5 degrees year(-1). Other freshening factors such as sea ice export from the Arctic, freshwater flux at the Fram Strait, and net precipitation are also discussed. For the past three decades, the continuous trend appeared only in the sea ice extent, which might be a signal of climate changes over high latitude. However, there was no significant trend other than the periodic change in a few years to the decadal time scale in the salinity of GS and NS. As preconditioning for deep convection, near-surface salinity within Greenland Sea Gyre was influenced by salinity fluctuation in both GS and NS.

TI  - Spatial-temporal analysis of the changes in<i> Populus</i><i> euphratica</i> distribution in the Tarim National Nature Reserve over the past 60 years
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - P. euphratica in the Tarim National Nature Reserve has been included in the tentative list of Chinese World Heritage Sites due to its rarity and its ecological and aesthetic value. The temporal and spatial changes in P. euphratica forests in the Reserve from 1964 to 2020 have been monitored to analyze and discuss the human activities and natural condition factors that influence P. euphratica distribution based on multisource remote sensing data, including Corona, SPOT series, Sentinel-2, and Landsat series data. In the Reserve, P. euphratica was originally distributed mainly along the Tarim River channel and within 3 km of it, but gradually contracted from the upper to the lower region river with the impact of the river drying up. It has diminished significantly with the rapid expansion of farmland over the past 60 years, especially from 1995 to 2015, which was a period of rapid agricultural development. The influence of cultivated land on P. euphratica was significant along the Tarim River and within 1 km of it, while it was weakened beyond 1 km. The occurrence of P. euphratica declined with an increase in soil salinity, and it was highly restricted under extremely salinized soil conditions. P. euphratica appeared more frequently within 3 km of the river channel because the natural conditions with high ground-water levels and mild soil salinity are more suitable for its distribution, and degradation is less likely, except when impacted by human disturbance. Areas of farmland increased from 1964 to 2020, severely salinized soil along the Tarim River within 3 km increased from 1995 to 2020, and the downstream region of the Tarim River dried up in the Reserve. Therefore, we should ensure that we rationally utilize water resources, reduce land cultivation, and control soil salinization to protect P. euphratica from degradation.

TI  - Percutaneous Left Atrial Appendage Closure with the LAmbre Device Protected by a Cerebral Protection System in a 76-Year-Old Man with Persistent Left Atrial Appendage Thrombus
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Unusual clinical courseBackground: Despite use of optimal oral anticoagulation regimens, left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombus may develop and persist in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The therapeutic options in this population are limited. Percutaneous LAA closure (LAAC) is performed to reduce thrombus formation and the risk of thromboembolism. However, this approach is prohibited in patients with LAA thrombus. We report the case of a 76-year-old man with AF and persistent LAA thrombus who underwent percutaneous LAAC with the LAmbre device protected by the SENTINEL Cerebral Protection System (CPS).Case Report: A 76-year-old man with history of persistent AF treated with pulmonary veins and LAA isolation developed LAA thrombus resistant to different anticoagulation therapies, including apixaban and Phenprocoumon, with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 3-3,5. Repeated follow-up transesophageal echocardiography showed a persistent LAA thrombus despite optimal INR values. Thus, we performed a percutaneous LAAC us-ing a double-umbrella-designed appendage occluder and a CPS to minimize the risk of intraprocedural cere-bral embolization. The procedure was guided by transesophageal echocardiography and fluoroscopy. No signs of systemic thromboembolism were noted, and the CPS filters showed no evidence of thrombotic material.Conclusions: This report shows that the use of a CPS during percutaneous LAAC may reduce the risk of procedural cerebral embolization and could be used as an alternative therapy for patients with contraindication or lack of effec-tiveness of oral anticoagulation.

TI  - <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-labeled colloid SPECT/CT versus planar lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel lymph node detection in patients with breast cancer: a meta-analysis
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) and planar lymphoscintigraphy (PL) in patients with primary breast cancer, undergoing lymphoscintigraphy at initial staging. Specifically, we assessed the detection rate (DR) for sentinel lymph node (SLN), the absolute number of detected SLNs by each technique, and the proportion of patients with additional SLNs detected by one technique compared to the other one. Finally, we aimed to evaluate the impact of SPECT/CT on the surgical approach. Methods Original articles, providing a head-to-head comparison between SPECT/CT and PL, including patients with primary breast cancer at first presentation, were searched in PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases through March 31(st), 2022. The DR of the imaging techniques was calculated on a per-patient analysis; studies were pooled on their odds ratios (ORs) with a random-effects model to assess the presence of a significant difference between the DRs of SPECT/CT and PL. The number of additional SLNs, calculated as relative risk (RR), and the pooled proportion of patients with additional SLNs using one imaging technique rather than the other one were investigated. The pooled ratio of surgical procedures (SLN harvesting) influenced by the use of SPECT/CT, according to the surgeons, was calculated. Results Sixteen studies with 2693 patients were eligible for the calculation of the DR of SPECT/CT and PL. The DR was 92.11% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 89.32-94.50%] for SPECT/CT, and 85.12% (95% CI 80.58-89.15%) for PL, with an OR of 1.96 (95% CI 1.51-2.55) in favor of SPECT/CT. There was a relative risk of detection of larger number of SLNs (RR: 1.22, 95% CI 1.14-1.32; 12 studies; 979 patients) for SPECT/CT (n = 3983) compared to PL (n = 3321) and a significant proportion of patients with additional SLNs detected by SPECT/CT, which were missed by PL (18.88%, 95% CI: 11.72%-27.27%; 13 studies). Four articles, with a total number of 1427 patients, revealed that 23.98% of the surgical procedures benefited from the use of SPECT/CT. Conclusions This meta-analysis favors SPECT/CT over PL for the identification of SLN in patients with primary breast cancer at staging due to higher DR, more SLNs depicted, and a significant proportion of subjects with additional detected SLNs by SPECT/CT compared to PL. Furthermore, SPECT/CT positively influences the surgical procedure. However, PL remains a satisfactory imaging option for imaging departments not equipped with SPECT/CT due to its good patient-based DR.

TI  - A revitalisation of European farming and the promise of the biodynamic worldview
T2  - CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - In 2020 and amidst the upsurge in discourse around de-industrialisation, a consortium of sixteen indigenous leaders and organisations released a briefing statement that urged change amongst modern regenerative farming movements. Called 'Whitewashed Hope', the critique encouraged these movements to go deeper than simply taking indigenous practices out of context, but rather to encompass the worldviews they represent and in doing so to enable the cultural and relational changes needed for humanity's collective healing. This paper takes a critical analysis approach to address the question of whether the critique of regenerative agriculture holds true for biodynamic agriculture in particular. This is explored using the hypothesis that there is no evidence of a synergistic relationship between the biodynamic worldview and the indigenous worldview as characterised in the document Whitewashed Hope. Drawing from the works of Rudolf Steiner as well as from other biodynamic texts, the paper uncovers synergies that exist between biodynamic and indigenous worldviews and explores the implications for regenerative farming systems. The aim of this paper is to instigate further debate and enquiry around the underexplored topic of how our worldviews impact our farming systems and of ways to develop an expanded worldview for more revitalised farming in the European context.

TI  - Classification of Land Cover Remote-Sensing Images Based on Pattern Recognition
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of remote sensing technology, remote sensing image data plays an active role in the dynamic monitoring of global resource changes and land cover utilization. Remote sensing image land cover classification is an important application direction of remote sensing data; how to further improve the accuracy of remote sensing image land cover classification is very important for the effective application of remote sensing data. The traditional remote sensing image land cover classification is mainly to classify remote sensing data according to the spectral data of ground objects. However, due to the complex environment of remote sensing images and the dynamic changes of the environment, traditional classification methods based only on pixel spectral data are often unable to achieve. A satisfactory classification result is achieved. In addition, some researchers have also proposed to combine pixel neighborhood texture information to supplement spectral feature data. Although the traditional classification method based on spectral features solves the problem of time-consuming visual interpretation, to a certain extent, due to the limited semantic expression ability and poor generalization ability of the design features, the classification accuracy is still not very satisfactory. This paper mainly studies the classification method of land cover remote sensing image based on pattern recognition. This paper is based on the experimental results of remote sensing data in Nanjing Yuhuatai District in 2018 and 2019. The ground resolution of the data is 2.5 meters. Data is projected, corrected, and equalized. Half of the images covering 43.75 square kilometers are used as training samples, and the remaining 50 square kilometers are used for detection. In the classification results of this IndianPines data, OA only increased by nearly 10% to 86.2%, AA increased by 13%, r was 82.77%, and Kappa coefficient was 0.84. In the classification results of Salinas data, both OA and AA increase by about 5%, and the optimization effect is not obvious.

TI  - Spatial distribution mapping of permafrost in Mongolia using TTOP
T2  - PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the results of permafrost mapping in Mongolia based on the TTOP (temperature-on-top-of-permafrost) approach, which were validated against in situ measurements at various locations. In situ measurements indicated that the mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) ranged from 0.6 to 2.2 degrees C interannually, showing the greatest variability when furthest from 0 degrees C. The differences between the modeled and measured MAGTs exceeded +/- 1 degrees C in locations where permafrost was in a nonequilibrium state and was controlled predominantly by local factors. It was estimated that permafrost occupies one-third of Mongolia. We divided the extent of the permafrost into five zones: continuous, discontinuous, sporadic, isolated, and seasonally frozen ground. In total, the permafrost zones cover similar to 462.8 x 10(3) km(2), accounting for 29.3% of Mongolia. Of this total area, continuous permafrost accounted for 118.3 x 10(3) km(2) (7.5%), discontinuous permafrost 127.7 x 10(3) km(2) (8.1%), sporadic permafrost 112.4 x 10(3) km(2) (7.1%), and isolated permafrost 104.4 x 10(3) km(2) (6.6%).

TI  - Out of the blue: Volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> emissions during the 2021-2022 eruptions of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai (Tonga)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Most volcanism on Earth is submarine, but volcanic gas emissions by submarine eruptions are rarely observed and hence largely unquantified. On 15 January 2022 a submarine eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai (HTHH) volcano (Tonga) generated an explosion of historic magnitude, and was preceded by similar to 1 month of Surtseyan eruptive activity and two precursory explosive eruptions. We present an analysis of ultraviolet (UV) satellite measurements of volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2) between December 2021 and the climactic 15 January 2022 eruption, comprising an unprecedented record of Surtseyan eruptive emissions. UV measurements from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA's Aura satellite, the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) on Suomi-NPP, the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on ESA's Sentinel-5P, and the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) aboard the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) are combined to yield a consistent multi-sensor record of eruptive degassing. We estimate SO2 emissions during the eruption's key phases: the initial 19 December 2021 eruption (similar to 0.01 Tg SO2); continuous SO2 emissions from 20 December 2021-early January 2022 (similar to 0.12 Tg SO2); the 13 January 2022 stratospheric eruption (0.06 Tg SO2); and the paroxysmal 15 January 2022 eruption (similar to 0.4-0.5 Tg SO2); yielding a total SO2 emission of similar to 0.6-0.7 Tg SO2 for the eruptive episode. We interpret the vigorous SO2 emissions observed prior to the January 2022 eruptions, which were significantly higher than measured in the 2009 and 2014 HTHH eruptions, as strong evidence for a rejuvenated magmatic system. High cadence DSCOVR/ EPIC SO2 imagery permits the first UV-based analysis of umbrella cloud spreading and volume flux in the 13 January 2022 eruption, and also tracks early dispersion of the stratospheric SO2 cloud injected on January 15. The similar to 0.4-0.5 Tg SO2 discharged by the paroxysmal 15 January 2022 HTHH eruption is low relative to other eruptions of similar magnitude, and a review of other submarine eruptions in the satellite era indicates that modest SO2 yields may be characteristic of submarine volcanism, with the emissions and atmospheric impacts likely dominated by water vapor. The origin of the low SO2 loading awaits further investigation but scrubbing of SO2 in the water-rich eruption plumes and rapid conversion to sulfate aerosol are plausible, given the exceptional water emission by the 15 January 2022 HTHH eruption.

TI  - Geoinformatics based detection and delineation of paleochannels in hard rock terrain of Koel River Basin, Jharkhand, eastern India
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Paleochannels evoke interest in view of their geological/tectonic history, the origin of their sediments compo-sition, and prospecting for groundwater resources. The present study demonstrates the delineation of paleo-channels in hard rocky terrain in parts of the Koel river basin in the Jharkhand state in eastern India. High -resolution optical satellite data Sentinel-2 and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 have been used to carry out the visual interpretation for the identification of paleochannels in the prospects of groundwater resources. Six major paleochannels locations were identified based on flow direction, flow accumulation, drainage, closed depression area, normalized difference water index (NDWI) (pre and post-monsoon seasons), and Topographic Wetted Index (TWI). The abandoned courses were recognizable as curvilinear or meandering segments of dry channels by using the drainage map. Pre and post-monsoon NDWI exhibited water storage zones, which were generally filled after monsoon season by rainwater along the paleochannels. TWI more than 1.3 and depression more than 30 depicted wetted zones along with the delineated paleochannels locations. Both the satellite-derived (NDWI) and digital elevation model (DEM) derived (i.e. TWI, depression area, drainage) indices indicated the presence of six major paleochannels, which were further corroborated with radar data and field -based data. Areas of low topography with dendritic drainage, depth and flow direction was studied which controls the recharge potential of groundwater and pattern were investigated where the chances of occurrence of groundwater are more. This comprehensive study concluded that satellite-based information can be useful for demarcating paleochannels over hard rocky terrains and TWI performed better compared to other parameters (NDWI, drainage, and morphometric study) as an indication of potential groundwater prospects.

TI  - Improved false-negative rates using a novel patient selection flowchart in initially biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer undergoing blue-dye alone guided sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Current trials support the application of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in node-positive breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with a lower false-negative rate (FNR) if dual-tracer (radioisotope and blue-dye) is used. However, radioisotopes are not available in many areas of the world. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility and accuracy of SLNB mapped with methylene-blue-dye alone. Methods This study enrolled 132 patients with biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer with a clip placed in the positive node who then received NAC. After chemotherapy and before operation, all patients underwent axillary ultrasound (AUS) assessment and were classified as either negative (AUS-) or positive (AUS +) according to the axillary status. All patients underwent both SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). SLNB was mapped with methylene-blue-dye alone. FNRs were evaluated on factors potentially affecting false-negative SLN finding. Results Using methylene-blue-dye alone, the FNR of SLNB was 9.9%. Post-NAC AUS assessment (p = 0.009) and the number of SLNs retrieved (p = 0.029) showed association with FNRs in multivariate analysis. In AUS- group, FNR was as low as 2.5%. In AUS + group, retrieving >= 4 SLNs including the clipped node improved FNR from 17.1% to 4.8%. A flowchart was designed with the combination of post-NAC AUS assessment, retrieved SLN number, and the retrieved of clipped node further improve overall FNR to 3.3%. Conclusion In biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer treated with NAC, using a flowchart to optimize patient selection reduces the FNR of single-tracer (methylene-blue-dye) guided SLNB.

TI  - Pediatric Residency Training amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: Exploring the Impact of Supervision and Clinical Practice Guidelines on Clinical and Financial Outcomes
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. This study is aimed at calculating the magnitude of the effect of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) and supervision in inhibiting the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical and financial outcomes of non-COVID-19 inpatient care by pediatric residents in academic medical center (AMC) hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. The cohort retrospective study was conducted. This study collected patient data from pediatric residency programs. A research cohort consisted of non-COVID-19 pediatric patients at Dr. Soetomo General Academic Hospital. This study compared the subgroup of patients treated during the pandemic with those treated before the pandemic. The results were analyzed using SPSS 26.0 and Smart-PLS. Results. There was a 41.4% decrease in pediatric inpatients during the pandemic with an increased severity level and complexity level, a reduction of 7.46% availability of supervisors, an increase of 0.4% in readmission < 30 days, an increase of 0.31% in-hospital mortality, an increase the total costs of care, and a decrease of insurance claim profit. CPG did not moderate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical outcomes (beta=-0.006, P=0.083) but moderated the financial outcomes (beta=-0.022, P=0.000), by reducing the total cost of care and increasing insurance claim profit. Supervision moderated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical outcomes (beta=0.040, P=0.000) by increasing aLOS and on the financial outcomes (beta=-0.031, P=0.000) by reducing the total cost of care and increasing insurance claim profit. This study model had a 24.0% variance of explanatory power for clinical outcomes and 49.0% for financial outcomes. This study's structural model effectively predicted clinical outcomes (Q2=0.238) and financial outcomes (Q2=0.413). Conclusion. Direct supervision inhibited the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on both clinical and financial outcomes of non-COVID-19 inpatient care by pediatric residents, while CPG only inhibited the negative impact on financial outcomes. Implication of This Study. In a disaster, the availability of CPG and direct supervision makes AMC hospitals able to inhibit the negative impact of disasters on clinical and financial outcomes.

TI  - MODIS-based evaluation of agricultural drought, water use efficiency and post-drought in Iran; considering the influence of heterogeneous climatic regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a devastating natural event that affects crop yield and upsets the terrestrial carbon cycle balance. Agricultural drought affects water use efficiency (WUE) through changes in gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET). However, there is limited study that investigate drought induced WUE and drought recovery period in heterogeneous climate regions. The purpose of this study was twofold, i.e. to quantify the influence of agricultural drought on WUE and to estimate drought recovery period in different climate regions of Iran. Climate zoning was performed for Iran based on the De Martonne classification method, and agricultural drought was monitored using standard vegetation index during 2000-2020. Years 2000, 2001, and 2008 were identified as drought years. The remote sensing indices of GPP and ET showed that WUE increased during the drought years in all climates and more significantly in arid zones than in humid ones. Arid regions were also more resistant and humid regions were more resilient to drought. In all climates except the very humid zone, WUE anomalies upsurged with increased drought severity. The recovery period was faster in humid climates than in arid regions, and longer recovery periods were observed in areas where severe drought occurred. The results of this study are crucial to gaining insights into water and carbon cycles. We showed that considering climate regions in drought assessment can efficiently reveal the role of environmental heterogeneity which is essential for the efficient management of drought at large-scale studies.

TI  - Sentinel-2 high-resolution data for river discharge monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - River monitoring is an open issue due to many intrinsic problems of the ground monitoring network. Over the last few decades, the role of satellite sensors in river discharge estimation is significantly increased thanks to the strong growth in technologies and applications. Focusing on daily river discharge measurements, a non-linear regression model has been used to link the near-infrared (NIR) reflectance ratio between a dry and a wet pixel around the section of a river to the ground measurements of river discharge. The use of medium-resolution satellite data, such as those from MODIS sensors, enables to monitor high and low flows in medium-sized catchments (<100,000 km2), thanks to satellite frequent revisit time and wide spatial coverage. However, such sensors are not suitable to provide information for medium-narrow rivers (< 250 m wide), nor to study river features and patterns that are averaged within a single pixel. Here, we investigated the use of Sentinel-2 NIR reflectances to support the hypothesis that a higher spatial resolution, i.e. 10 m, is able to better identify the wet pixels, more related to the river dynamics, with obvious advantages for river discharge estimation compared to the medium resolution sensors (e.g., MODIS at 250 m). Moreover, it also allows both a finer distinction between vegetation, soil and water and the characterization of water turbidity in the river area. A new formulation enriched by the sediment component is proposed together with a first step toward an uncalibrated procedure to select the wet pixels. Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform has been employed for the data analysis, allowing to avoid the download of big amounts of data, fostering the reproducibility of the analysis in different locations. The accuracy of the river discharges derived from Sentinel-2 reflectances is evaluated against the in-situ observations from selected gauging stations along two Italian rivers, Po and Tiber. The results confirm the good performances obtained with high-resolution images over the Po River, with average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ranging between 0.39 and 0.56 for the different configurations adopted. Relatively worse results were obtained over the Tiber River where the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ranged between 0.2 and 0.61, due to an issue on the registration of Sentinel-2 images.

TI  - Robust ocean color from drones: Viewing geometry, sky reflection removal, uncertainty analysis, and a survey of the Gulf Stream front
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and robust retrieval of ocean color from remote sensing enables critical observations of aquatic natural systems, from open ocean biological oceanography, coastal biodiversity, and water quality for human health. In the last decade, studies have increasingly highlighted the important role of small-scale processes in coastal and marine ecology and biogeochemistry, but observation and modeling at these scales remains technologically limited. Unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS, aka drones) can rapidly sample large areas with high spatial and temporal resolution; but the challenge of accurately retrieving ocean color, particularly with common wide field-of-view multispectral imagers, has limited the adoption of this technology. As UAS endurance, autonomy, and sensor capabilities continue to increase, so does this technology's potential to observe the ocean at fine scales, but only if proper protocols are followed. The present study provides a guide for achieving (1) ideal viewing geometry of UAS-borne ocean color sensors, (2) techniques for the removal of sun glint and reflected skylight to derive water-leaving radiances, (3) characterization of uncertainty in these measurements, and (4) converting water-leaving radiances to remote-sensing reflectance for analytic end products such as chlorophyll a estimates. Documented open-source code facilitates replication of this emerging technique. Using this methodology, we briefly describing fine-scale variability of the Gulf Stream front off North Carolina alongside synoptic satellite data and in situ measurements for comparison. These results demonstrate how UAS-based ocean color measurements complement and enhance conventional ocean observations and modeling to resolve fine-scale variability and close the lacuna between satellite and in situ methods.

TI  - Assessing spatial patterns and drivers of burn severity in subtropical forests in Southern China based on Landsat 8
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Burn severity assessment is vital for the development of effective fire management strategies. Subtropical forests in Southern China support rich forest resources but are also disturbed by frequent forest fires, resulting in varying burn severity areas. However, the lack of accuracy assessment of burn severity based on spectral indices has limited our understanding of spatial patterns and drivers of burn severity in this region and the implementation of effective forest fire management. In this study, we compared the accuracy of different spectral indices from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) in assessing burn severity. Moreover, the optimal spectral index was selected to map burn severity and analyze its spatial patterns and drivers by using the random forest model. The results showed that (1) dNBR, RdNBR, and RBR outperformed the others in accuracy of fitting burn severity, and dNBR was slightly higher in accuracy classification; (2) vegetation (pre-fire NDVI) and human activity (distance to the nearest road or settlement) were the most important drivers affecting burn severity patterns; (3) the proportion of moderate and low burn severity was higher, and most burn areas were concentrated near settle-ments and roads, but areas with higher burn severity tended to be distributed in uphill, sunny slopes, and high altitudes. In view of this, we recommend targeted forest fire management according to the distribution pattern and drivers of burn severity in this region, including setting up fire belts near residential areas and roads, and prioritizing fuel removal plans in areas prone to develop higher burn severity.

TI  - Follicular lymphoma without lymphadenopathy incidentally diagnosed by sentinel lymph node biopsy during breast cancer surgery: a case report
T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Concurrent breast cancer and malignant lymphoma is a rare phenomenon. This report describes malignant lymphoma that was incidentally diagnosed from a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) during breast cancer surgery. Case presentation A 73-year-old woman with a history of ovarian cancer and diabetes presented with right focal asymmetric density on a mammogram acquired during routine breast cancer screening. Ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 13.5-mm tumor in the upper lateral region of the right breast. A US-guided Mammotome biopsy revealed invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast. Preoperative assessments including positron emission tomography-computerized tomography, found no evidence of axillary lymphadenopathy or distant metastasis. Because the breast cancer was stage I, the patient underwent a right mastectomy and a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) at our hospital. Pathological assessment of the biopsy revealed follicular lymphoma (FL), but no metastatic breast cancer. The patient was referred to hematology to stage the FL. Bone marrow findings were negative and stage I FL was diagnosed. After the mastectomy, she was monitored and given adjuvant therapy with an aromatase inhibitor. Conclusions Follicular lymphoma was incidentally diagnosed from an SLNB obtained to determine the dissemination of early-stage breast cancer. Collaboration with hematologists is important to determine optimal treatment plans for such patients regardless of the rarity of such events.

TI  - Clinical prediction model based on 18F-FDG PET/CT plus contrast-enhanced MRI for axillary lymph node macrometastasis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposePositron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful for detecting axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis in invasive ductal breast cancer (IDC); however, there is limited clinical evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of the combination of PET/CT plus MRI. Further axillary surgery is not recommended against ALN micrometastasis (lesion <= 2 mm) seen in sentinel lymph nodes, especially for patients who received proper adjuvant therapy. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a prediction model based on PET/CT plus MRI for ALN macrometastasis (lesion >2 mm) and explore the possibility of risk stratification of patients using the preoperative PET/CT plus MRI and biopsy findings. Materials and methodsWe retrospectively investigated 361 female patients (370 axillae; mean age, 56 years +/- 12 [standard deviation]) who underwent surgery for primary IDC at a single center between April 2017 and March 2020. We constructed a prediction model with logistic regression. Patients were divided into low-risk and high-risk groups using a simple integer risk score, and the false negative rate for ALN macrometastasis was calculated to assess the validity. Internal validation was also achieved using a 5-fold cross-validation. ResultsThe PET/CT plus MRI model included five predictor variables: maximum standardized uptake value of primary tumor and ALN, primary tumor size, ALN cortical thickness, and histological grade. In the derivation (296 axillae) and validation (74 axillae) cohorts, 54% and 61% of patients, respectively, were classified as low-risk, with a false-negative rate of 11%. Five-fold cross-validation yielded an accuracy of 0.875. ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate the validity of the PET/CT plus MRI prediction model for ALN macrometastases. This model may aid the preoperative identification of low-risk patients for ALN macrometastasis and provide helpful information for PET/MRI interpretation.

TI  - Analysis, of multi-temporal remotely sensed spectral indices influence on ecology of Singrauli sub-district, Madhya Pradesh using an ecological impact index
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the ecological quality of Singrauli sub-district over a decade was investigated based on images of IRS LISS III and Landsat series of 2005, 2010 and 2015 respectively. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was employed to develop the Geo-Spatial Ecological Impact Index (GEII) by assigning weights to the five ecological parameters (vegetative cover, moisture content, built-up index, water index and Land Surface Temperature (LST) and to determine the degree of impact on each one due to the increased anthropogenic activities. The study concluded that, there was an increase in the built up and the overall LST by 6.24 degrees C whereas, the vegetation covers and moisture content has decreased during the years 2005 to 2015. Aggregate change in ecological quality can be inferred from the increasing mean of GEII values from 3.39 to 3.61 indicates deteriorating ecological quality. The predicted map of GEII 2025 prepared using artificial neural network (ANN) revealed that the high ecological impact zones will cover 37.95% of the area by 2025. The result obtained from the study can be useful for policy and decision mak-ers for sustainable development of urban sectors and natural resource management of the area with respect to ecological impact assessment.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Pest population dynamics are related to a continental overwintering gradient
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Overwintering success is an important determinant of arthropod populations that must be considered as climate change continues to influence the spatiotemporal population dynamics of agricultural pests. Using a long-term monitoring database and biologically relevant overwintering zones, we modeled the annual and seasonal population dynamics of a common pest, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), based on three overwintering suitability zones throughout North America using four decades of soil temperatures: the southern range (able to persist through winter), transitional zone (uncertain overwintering survivorship), and northern limits (unable to survive winter). Our model indicates H. zea population dynamics are hierarchically structured with continental-level effects that are partitioned into three geographic zones. Seasonal populations were initially detected in the southern range, where they experienced multiple large population peaks. All three zones experienced a final peak between late July (southern range) and mid-August to mid-September (transitional zone and northern limits). The southern range expanded by 3% since 1981 and is projected to increase by twofold by 2099 but the areas of other zones are expected to decrease in the future. These changes suggest larger populations may persist at higher latitudes in the future due to reduced low-temperature lethal events during winter. Because H. zea is a highly migratory pest, predicting when populations accumulate in one region can inform synchronous or lagged population development in other regions. We show the value of combining long-term datasets, remotely sensed data, and laboratory findings to inform forecasting of insect pests.

TI  - Recent Decadal Aerosol Trends over Oceanic Regions Surrounding Indian Landmass
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of aerosol distribution and trends in the total atmospheric column as well as at different vertical levels of the atmosphere can provide crucial inputs to understand the role of aerosols in the changing climatic scenario. Indian region is one of the major aerosol hotspots and it is therefore important to have a continuous monitoring of varying aerosol trends over both land and surrounding water bodies. Several studies have been already carried out to investigate the aerosol changes over Indian mainland. This study provides insight into the columnar and vertical distribution as well as trends of aerosols over six oceanic zones surrounding the Indian region over the Arabian Sea (AS) and the Bay of Bengal (BoB) waters during winters and post-monsoons (2010-2019). The work has been carried out using the Level 2 aerosol datasets from space-borne Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarisation (CALIOP) onboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) mission, Dark Target algorithm data products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Aqua sensor as well as the model reanalysis products from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application-2 (MERRA-2) Reanalysis. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) back trajectory frequency cluster analysis has also been carried out to explore the possible sources of aerosols. The variability of planetary boundary layer height from European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis-5 (ECMWF ERA 5) Reanalysis products in connection with changes in aerosol distribution has also been discussed.

TI  - Value-adding in biosecurity surveillance and monitoring: Testing colour and non-target semiochemical lures on Psylloidea and Pentatomoidea
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cost efficiency in biosecurity surveillance is vital, and the ability to survey multiple pest species using just one trap is, therefore, highly appealing. The Psylloidea, or plantlice, contain significant horticultural pest species that act as vectors for a number of deleterious plant bacteria. We examine the efficacy of using two different coloured sticky traps, and two semiochemical lures on the general Psylloidea and Pentatomoidea fauna, and a target extant pest psyllid; tomato potato psyllid (TPP) Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc) in Western Australia. Specifically, we test the effect of semiochemical lure (no lure, Asian citrus psyllid ACP lure, brown marmorated stink bug BMSB lure, combined lures), sticky trap colour (yellow-green vs yellow) and sentinel plant (tomato vs citrus) on psyllid and pentatomid species in 104 urban backyards across Perth, Australia. We found that tomato sentinel host plants and yellow-green traps significantly increased the capture rate of TPP, but that lures decreased the capture of TPP constraining their use. Yellow-green traps also increased the capture rate of all other Psylloidea. Although BMSB lures reduced TPP capture, these lures increased the abundances of other Psylloidea and the pest stinkbug Plautia affinis (Dallas) on traps. Thus, our experiment demonstrates that increased efficiencies can be gained with multi-species traps and semiochemical lures for particular groups, provided that they have been tested on focal organisms in the first instance, as reactions to non-target lures are unpredictable and species specific.

TI  - Prior land surface reflectance-based sandstorm detection from space using deep learning
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional sandstorm detection methods use radiation differences among dust, underlying surface, and cloud to distinguish them by setting appropriate thresholds. Owing to the complex structure of the underlying surface, dust, and cloud, it is difficult to set a uniform threshold to achieve high-precision separation. Deep learning (DL) has powerful information mining capabilities and can fully use spectral differences between dust, land surface, and clouds. However, under the limited band information provided by satellite sensors, DL cannot easily distinguish highly heterogeneous land surfaces from multi-modal dust and cloud. This study proposes a sandstorm detection algorithm with DL supported by a land surface reflectance (LSR) dataset. The clear sky LSR dataset was obtained based on the MOD09A1 product. Based on the dataset, the difference between the reflectance observed by the satellite and the corresponding LSR is generated, which is used as a characteristic parameter of sandstorm detection with the deep learning method. The sandstorm detection of MODIS data is realized using multi-band radiation and radiation difference with DL. Results showed that the sandstorm detection algorithm used in this study was consistent with the OMI AI product with a detection accuracy of 84.6%. Compared with the detection results without the LSR dataset, this method effectively improves the accuracy of sandstorm identification.

TI  - Navigating the space between co-design and mahitahi: Building bridges between knowledge systems on behalf of communities
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF RURAL HEALTH
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Aims: To provide knowledge and recommendations for researchers, health professionals and policymakers on navigating between science and matauranga (knowledge) Maori when using co-design methodologies.Context: It is well known that the health system in Aotearoa/New Zealand does not provide culturally responsive services, programmes or approaches. Indigenous, remote and vulnerable populations that are not well served by medical and scientific models would be better served by the underlying premise of co-design methodology. However, co-design is a Western methodology. Mahitahi is presented here as a culturally responsive method of co-design that builds approaches by utilising the worldview of the people that the health system most needs to have impact upon. Co-design and mahitahi have synergies, and working at the interface between Western and Maori knowledge systems can provide innovative solutions that draw on the strengths of both approaches.Approach: Authors will outline the benefit co-design processes have for improving health outcomes for remote and vulnerable populations. Mahitahi will be described and the synergies with co-design emphasised with important distinctions also highlighted. The use of Indigenous knowledge systems, using Maori as the case example, will be outlined.Conclusion: Recommendations will be provided to guide researchers, health professionals and policy makers when planning a co-design approach with remote and vulnerable communities.

TI  - Beyond topo-climatic predictors: Does habitats distribution and remote sensing information improve predictions of species distribution models?
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Species Distribution Models (SDM) represent a powerful tool to predict species' habitat suitability on a landscape and fill the gap between truncated observation data and all possible locations. SDMs have been widely used in theoretical studies of species niches as well as in conservation applications. Here, we evaluated the impacts of predictors' type on models' performances and spatial predictions using 72 plant species belonging to six ecological groups at a regional scale in the area of Geneva (Switzerland). Twelve models were created using various combinations of high-resolution (25 m) explanatory variables including topography, pedology, climate, habitats and remote sensing data. Models integrating a combination of habitats and topopedo-climatic predictors had significantly higher performances, while remote sensing predictors showed low performances. Our results suggest that the number and the level of details of habitat predictors (broad or very precise) do not fundamentally affect prediction maps. However, selecting too few, overly simplified or exceedingly complex habitat predictors tend to lower models' performances. The use of eight habitat categories complemented with eight topopedo-climatic predictors produced models with the highest performances. Ecological groups of species responded differently to models and while alpine and ruderal species have greater average performances due to a high affinity with topopedo-climatic predictors, wetlands' species were less performant on average. These results underline the necessity of developing or having access to habitats distribution data especially in a conservation context.

TI  - Monitoring the combined effects of drought and salinity stress on crops using remote sensing in the Netherlands
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Global sustainable agricultural systems are under threat, due to increasing and co-occurring drought and salinity stresses. Combined effects of these stresses on agricultural crops have traditionally been evaluated in smallscale experimental studies. Consequently, large-scale studies need to be performed to increase our understanding and assessment of the combined impacts in agricultural practice in real-life scenarios. This study aims to provide a new monitoring approach using remote-sensing observations to evaluate the joint impacts of drought and salinity on crop traits. In our tests over the Netherlands at large spatial scale (138.74 km(2)), we calculated five functional traits for both maize and potato from Sentinel-2 observations, namely leaf area index (LAI), the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), the fraction of vegetation cover (FVC), leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), and leaf water content (Cw). Individual and combined effects of the stresses on the seasonal dynamics in crop traits were determined using both one-way and two-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs). We found that both stresses (individual and co-occurring) affected the functional traits of both crops significantly (with R-2 ranging from 0.326 to 0.796) though with stronger sensitivities to drought than to salinity. While we found exacerbating effects within co-occurrent stresses, the impact level depended strongly on the moment in the growing season. For both crops, LAI, FAPAR, and FVC dropped the most under severe drought stress conditions. The patterns for Cab and Cw were more inhibited by co-occurring drought and salinity. Consequently, our study constitutes a way towards evaluating drought and salinity impacts in agriculture, with the possibility of potential large-scale application for sustainable food security.

TI  - Gravity and Remote Sensing Methods as a Solution in Identifying Geothermal Reservoirs on Volcanoes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tiris Village, Lamongan Volcano complex is an area that has geothermal potential. The existence of geothermal potential in this study was identified using the gravity method combined with remote sensing methods. Remote sensing method is used to obtain a map of the distribution pattern of the soil surface temperature and a map of the continuity of the straightness and fault structure. The data used in the remote sensing method is secondary data in the form of Landsat-8 imagery and DEM SRTM 1 arc. Processing of the soil surface temperature map was obtained by using thermal infrared processing NDVI. The form of continuity of the straightness or fault structure is obtained by processing Landsat-8 multispectral image data in the form of 567 band composite and DEM SRTM data form of 3D topographic modeling. The data from the composite band 567 was reviewed visually using a 3D topographic model. The gravity method is the main method in this research because it is used to obtain the residual Bouguer anomaly distribution. The residual Bouguer anomaly data was obtained by using the moving average through spectrum analysis. The residual Bouguer anomaly distribution can be used for qualitative interpretation of the distribution of the earth's gravitational acceleration at the measurement location. The quantitative interpretation of the gravity data is based on the surface density estimation graph using the Parasnis method and 3D inversion modeling, using residual Bouguer anomaly data. The results of 3D inversion modeling provide four types of subsurface rock layers based on the density distribution value, namely, the first rock layer rho 1=2.52-2.67 g/cm(3), the second rock layer rho 2=2.72-2.77 g/cm(3), the third rock layer rho 3=2.80-2.83 g/cm(3), and the fourth rock layer rho 4=2.84-2.86 g/cm(3). The third rock layer is assumed to be reservoir rock and is estimated to be at a depth of 500-800 meters below the measurement point. The fourth rock layer is assumed to be intrusive igneous rock, which penetrates dominantly in the middle of the measurement location, which is oriented southwest, south to north, which is indicated by the high anomaly continuity on the regional Bouguer anomaly map. Based on the results of 3D inversion modeling and spectrum analysis of the average depth of the regional Bouguer anomaly, it is found that the intrusive rock layer is thought to be at a depth of 350 meters below the measurement point.

TI  - Improved CASA model based on satellite remote sensing data: simulating net primary productivity of Qinghai Lake basin alpine grassland
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model is widely used to estimate vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) at regional scales. However, the CASA is still driven by multisource data, e.g. satellite remote sensing (RS) data, and ground observations that are time-consuming to obtain. RS data can conveniently provide real-time regional information and may replace ground observation data to drive the CASA model. We attempted to improve the CASA model in this study using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) RS products, the GlobeLand30 RS product, and the digital elevation model data derived from radar RS. We applied it to simulate the NPP of alpine grasslands in the Qinghai Lake basin, which is located in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. The accuracy of the RS-data-driven CASA, with a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 22.14 % and root mean square error (RMSE) of 26.36 g C m(-2) per month, was higher than that of the multisource-data-driven CASA, with a MAPE of 44.80 % and RMSE of 57.43 g C m(-2) per month. The NPP simulated by the RS-data-driven CASA in July 2020 shows an average value of 108.01 +/- 26.31 g C m(-2) per month, which is similar to published results and comparable with the measured NPP. The results of this work indicate that simulating alpine grassland NPP with satellite RS data rather than ground observations is feasible. We may provide a workable reference for rapid simulation of grassland NPP to satisfy the requirements of accounting carbon stocks and other applications.

TI  - Vessel detection via multi-order saliency-based fuzzy fusion of spaceborne and airborne SAR images
T2  - INFORMATION FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on vessel target detection by fusing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing images collaboratively collected from spaceborne and airborne platforms. Accurate vessel detection is difficult in the presence of inshore interferences and in the case of structured and shaped targets. In this study, we have proposed a new method for the fusion of spaceborne and airborne SAR images based on multi-order superpixel-level saliency and fuzzy logic (MSSFL). We first generated a new global regional contrast map (GRCM) by exploiting the multi-order superpixel-level saliency (MSS). In GRCMs, the vessel targets are well restored, and the background is suppressed. Next, a new fuzzy logic approach based on regional features is presented to fuse the MSS information provided by the GRCMs of the spaceborne and airborne SAR images. This regional feature-based fuzzy fusion can further enhance the vessel target regions and filter out the inshore interference regions. Experimental results using the SAR images of Gaofen-3 satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle show that the proposed MSSFL method yields a higher target-to-clutter ratio of fused images and improved detection performance, compared with the commonly utilized image fusion approaches and the classical detection algorithms solely using spaceborne or airborne SAR images.

TI  - The US Food and Drug Administration Sentinel System: a national resource for a learning health system
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) created the Sentinel System in response to a requirement in the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 that the agency establish a system for monitoring risks associated with drug and biologic products using data from disparate sources. The Sentinel System has completed hundreds of analyses, including many that have directly informed regulatory decisions. The Sentinel System also was designed to support a national infrastructure for a learning health system. Sentinel governance and guiding principles were designed to facilitate Sentinel's role as a national resource. The Sentinel System infrastructure now supports multiple non-FDA projects for stakeholders ranging from regulated industry to other federal agencies, international regulators, and academics. The Sentinel System is a working example of a learning health system that is expanding with the potential to create a global learning health system that can support medical product safety assessments and other research.

TI  - Impact of mining-induced deforestation on soil surface temperature and carbon stocks: A case study using remote sensing in the Amazon rainforest
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon rainforest is one of the most important ecosystems on the planet; however, the environmental pressure created by anthropic activities require monitoring of this critical biome. In this study, we assessed the evolution of deforestation in an open mine pit and its impact on surface environment (i.e., temperature and carbon stocks) using remote sensing techniques. The study was carried out on an area of 11,283.3 ha in the municipality of Maraba, Para State, Brazil, where the "Salobo " copper mine is located. A temporal analysis was conducted, using Landsat satellite images (2005-2020). Subsequently, the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the deforested area were determined. Mining-induced deforestation has expanded from 0.9 ha in 2005 to 2214 ha in 2020 with an increase in surface temperature of 10 ? in the period. The temperature difference between the pit and the adjacent forest ranged from 30 to 40 ? over the 15 years, while the temperature at the forest edges rose by 4 ?. The correlation coefficient between exposed soil temperatures and mining deforestation was 0.66. CO2 emissions, increasing from 0.005 Tg CO2 in 2005 to 1.82 Tg CO2 in 2020 due to mining deforestation. The findings demonstrate the significant environmental impact of deforestation, which may also have an influence on local climate. The results can provide scientific support for public policies aimed at mitigating the issue.

TI  - Investigating the impacts of satellite fire observation accuracy on the top-down nitrogen oxides emission estimation in northeastern Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - NOx fire emissions greatly affect atmosphere and human society. The top-down NOx fire emission estimation is highly influenced by satellite fire observation performance (e.g., fire detection) by affecting the derivation of emission coefficient (EC) and fire radiative power (FRP) magnitude. However, such influence is lack of comprehensive study. Here, we developed an algorithm to evaluate such impacts in northeastern Asia using multi-source data during 2012-2019. Specifically, we extracted near-concurrent fire observations from MODIS and its successor VIIRS over their orbit-overlapping area and combined respectively with OMI NO2 concentration to derive NOx EC. We compared EC between MODIS and VIIRS, and defined a synergetic effect index (SEI) to explore the combined effects on NOx fire emission estimation due to potentially different ECs and FRP between the two sensors. Finally, we applied EC to estimate NOx emission and made comparison between MODIS and VIIRS. Results show that: 1) both sensors derived considerably higher NOx EC for low-biomass vegetation fires (e. g., grassland fires) than other vegetation fires; however, MODIS EC is about 30% lower than VIIRS EC while similar values are derived for forest fires; 2) synergetic effects induced by different ECs and FRP magnitudes between the two sensors are more significant during fall and winter than in spring and summer; 3) annual NOx emissions based on MODIS EC are 15-23% lower than that from VIIRS EC during 2012-2019, while both are lower than the conventional bottom-up emission inventories GFED and FINN by an average of 23-44%; nevertheless, the EC-based NOx estimations presented high spatiotemporal correlation of R usually between 0.70 and 0.95 with GFED and FINN. These results reveal and quantify the critical impacts of satellite fire observation performance on EC derivation and fire emission estimation, which is helpful in reducing estimation uncertainty.

TI  - Understanding the impact of vegetation dynamics on the water cycle in the Noah-MP model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of extreme climate events, especially prolonged drought, on ecosystem response, can influence the land-atmosphere interactions and modify local and regional weather and climate. To investigate the impact of vegetation dynamics on the simulation of energy, water, and carbon exchange at the land surface and streamflow, especially during drought conditions, we compared the performance of multiple versions of the Noah- multiparameterization (MP) land surface model (both Noah-MP LSM, version 3.6 and 4.0.1) with default configurations as well as various vegetation physics options, including the dynamic or input leaf area index (LAI) and the fractional vegetated area (FVEG). At the site level, simulated water and energy fluxes from each version were compared to eddy covariance (EC) flux tower measurements and remote sensing data from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at well-characterized natural grassland sites in Kansas from 2008 to 2018. The ability of each version to reproduce annual mean river flows was compared to gauged observations at United States Geological Survey (USGS) stations over 11 years (2008-2018). Model performance in replicating spatial patterns during extreme events was assessed by comparing simulated soil moisture (SM) percentiles over the state of Kansas to the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM). Results from these comparisons indicate that (a) even though there were differences in the latent heat (LE) components (i.e., transpiration, canopy evaporation, and soil evaporation), the total LE is mostly insensitive to variations in LAI across all model versions. This indicates that the incoming net radiation limits the total evaporation, as the presence of adequate soil moisture allows for higher soil evaporation when LAI limits transpiration; (b) regardless of the model version, the force of the precipitation largely dictates the accuracy of evapotranspiration (ET) simulation; (c) Overestimation of LE resulted in underestimation of streamflow, particularly over the land surface type dominated by a combination of grasses and cropland in the western and central part of the state; (d) all of the tested Noah-MP 4.0.1 vegetation physics produced spatial patterns of drought that more closely matched the USDM as compared to version 3.6. These findings have important relevance for applications of large-scale ecosystem-atmosphere feedbacks in water, carbon, and energy exchange.

TI  - Investigating the impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on air quality, surface Urban Heat Island, air temperature and lighting energy consumption in City of Melbourne
T2  - ENERGY STRATEGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has threatened city economies and residents' public health and quality of life. Similar to most cities, Melbourne imposed extreme preventive lockdown measures to address this situation. It would be reasonable to assume that during the two phases of lockdowns, in autumn (March) and winter (June to August) 2020, air quality parameters, air temperature, Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI), and lighting energy consumption most likely increased. As such, to test this assumption, Sentinel 5, ERA-5 LAND, Sentinel 1 and 2, NASA SRTM, MODIS Aqua and Terra, and VIIRS satellite imageries are utilized to investigate the alterations of NO2, SO2, CO, UV Aerosol Index (UAI), air temperature, SUHI, and lighting energy consumption factors in the City of Melbourne. Furthermore, satellite imageries of SentiThe results indicate that the change rates of NO2 (1.17 mol/m2) and CO (1.64 mol/m2) factors were positive. Further, the nighttime SUHI values increased by approximately 0.417 degrees C during the winter phase of the lockdown, while during the summer phase of the lockdown, the largest negative change rate was in NO2 (-100.40 mol/m2). By contrast, the largest positive change rate was in SO2 and SUHI at night. The SO2 values increased from very low to 330 mu m mol/m2, and the SUHI nighttime values increased by approximately 4.8 degrees C. From the spatial point of view, this study also shows how the effects on such parameters shifted based on the urban form and land types across the City of Melbourne by using satellite data as a sig-nificant resource to analyze the spatial coverage of these factors. The findings of this study demonstrate how air quality factors, SUHI, air temperature, and lighting energy consumption changed from pre-lockdown (2019) to lockdown (2020), offering valuable insights regarding practices for managing SUHI, lighting energy consump-tion, and air pollution.

TI  - Simulating the freezing-thawing processes based on MODIS data in the Three-River Souce Region, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The processes of soil freezing-thawing lead to soil water and heat movement in cold regions, which significantly influences the hydrological and energy cycles in the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This study presents a soil water content coupled with heat transfer model based on physical processes of water and heat movement in frozen soil. The model was calibrated and validated using the measured data of soil temperature and frost and thaw depth at 19 stations in and around the Three-River Source Region of China. The results show that the frozen soil model could capture the processes of soil freezing-thawing processes well at this region. The relationship between model parameters and climate and vegetation factors was analyzed using the observation data and remote sensing data obtained from MODIS, and results showed that the parameter c which represents the soil properties has a good correlation with longitude and vegetation coverage. A multi-regression model was established to estimate the model parameters in regions without observation data and its determination coefficient R (2) was 0.82. The mean relative error between calibration and inversion parameters of 19 stations is 6.29%. Thus, the proposed method can be applied to cold regions without observation data to obtain the parameters and simulated the soil freezing-thawing processes.

TI  - Comparison of sentinel lymph node biopsy and elective neck dissection for early oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma patients with clinically node-negative necks: systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF LARYNGOLOGY AND OTOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: This study aimed to compare the prognostic utility of sentinel node biopsy and elective neck dissection in early stage clinically node-negative oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma patients.Method: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to March 2022. Hazard ratios, Kaplan-Meier curves, p-values and survival outcomes were extracted.Results: Twelve studies involving 10 583 patients were included. No significant differences in overall survival between sentinel node biopsy and elective neck dissection groups were found. Heterogeneity was not detected in pooled overall survival, disease-free survival and disease-specific survival analyses (all I-2 less than 50). In subgroup analyses by follow-up period, sentinel node biopsy and elective neck dissection had similar prognostic value.Conclusion: Sentinel node biopsy might be a valuable alternative to elective neck dissection for the management of early stage clinically node-negative oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.

TI  - Assessment of the potential for quantifying multi-period suspended sediment concentration variations using satellites with different temporal resolution
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is a crucial indicator for coastal health and geomorphological evolution, featured by complex periodic processes on multiple timescales in response to different cyclic forcing factors. Although remote sensing has functioned as an important means for SSC estimation with sufficient spatio-temporal coverage, the low effective sampling rates and resulting unevenly spaced characteristics of the retrieved time series would hamper the extraction of the representative SSC portrayal (amplitude and phase) on multiple timescales, especially for low -resolution satellites. Here, we retrieved a 9-year hourly GOCI SSC time series (January 2012 to December 2020) at two coastal sites in China (Haimen and Haizhou Bay) as reference cases, and utilized them to obtain MODIS, Sentinel and Landsat sequences with average temporal resolutions of 0.5, 5.6 and 11.2 days as preliminary investigations into amplitude and phase extractions. Furthermore, we generated GOCI-based hypothetical satellite time series with tem-poral resolutions ranging from 1 to 16 days (1088 subsets) and their mutual combination (591,328 subsets) to explore general laws when extracting amplitudes and phases from satellites with different temporal resolutions by application of the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram and phase-folded diagram methods. The amplitude and phase deviations were found to increase with decreasing temporal resolution on seasonal and fortnightly timescales at Haimen and in Haizhou Bay, while by mutual combination of satellites the errors could be reduced as more data were utilized for the extraction. It is shown that larger amplitude and phase deviations occur on the seasonal timescale in comparison to the fortnightly timescale at Haimen, whereas the situation reverses in the case of Haizhou Bay. These results demonstrate that tempo-ral resolution, data characteristics on the target timescale and absolute SSC amplitude codetermine the extraction ac-curacy. This further indicates that satellites with lower temporal resolutions can potentially be used on a global scale for extracting the feature changes of multi-period SSC variations, in particular as continuous improvements in data quantity and quality can be expected in the future.

TI  - A novel nomogram for decision-making assistance on exemption of axillary lymph node dissection in T1-2 breast cancer with only one sentinel lymph node metastasis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundT1-2 breast cancer patients with only one sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis have an extremely low non-SLN (NSLN) metastatic rate and are favorable for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) exemption. This study aimed to construct a nomogram-based preoperative prediction model of NSLN metastasis for such patients, thereby assisting in preoperatively selecting proper surgical procedures. MethodsA total of 729 T1-2 breast cancer patients with only one SLN metastasis undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy and ALND were retrospectively selected from Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital between January 2013 and December 2020, followed by random assignment into training (n=467) and validation cohorts (n=262). A nomogram-based prediction model for NSLN metastasis risk was constructed by incorporating the independent predictors of NSLN metastasis identified from multivariate logistic regression analysis in the training cohort. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by the calibration curve and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Finally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to determine the clinical utility of the nomogram. ResultsOverall, 160 (21.9%) patients had NSLN metastases. Multivariate analysis in the training cohort revealed that the number of negative SLNs (OR: 0.98), location of primary tumor (OR: 2.34), tumor size (OR: 3.15), and lymph-vascular invasion (OR: 1.61) were independent predictors of NSLN metastasis. The incorporation of four independent predictors into a nomogram-based preoperative estimation of NSLN metastasis demonstrated a satisfactory discriminative capacity, with a C-index and area under the ROC curve of 0.740 and 0.689 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The calibration curve showed good agreement between actual and predicted NSLN metastasis risks. Finally, DCA revealed the clinical utility of the nomogram. ConclusionThe nomogram showed a satisfactory discriminative capacity of NSLN metastasis risk in T1-2 breast cancer patients with only one SLN metastasis, and it could be used to preoperatively estimate NSLN metastasis risk, thereby facilitating in precise clinical decision-making on the selective exemption of ALND in such patients.

TI  - Robust disturbance observer-based fast maneuver method for attitude control of optical remote sensing satellites
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims at developing a novel fast attitude maneuver framework for optical remote sensing satellites subject to multiple uncertainties and limited control energy. The proposed framework relies on a two-layer approach, where the first layer provides the agile attitude planning which enforces the satisfaction of the con-trol energy constraint, whereas the second layer, named the special fast maneuver controller, ensures the high -precision attitude tracking by suitably manipulating the agile attitude planning information. In addition, a novel disturbance observer is introduced into the scenario to enhance the robustness of the proposed fast maneuver controller against multiple uncertainties. The uniform ultimate boundedness of the proposed method is analyzed rigorously with the Lyapunov theory. To demonstrate the effectiveness, the proposed method is applied to the fast attitude maneuver of both simulated and real Jilin-1 GaoFen-02 satellite, which shows excellent control performance despite multiple uncertainties and limited control energy.

TI  - Yield estimate for the January 2016 DPRK nuclear test based on InSAR and numerical modelling with mechanical heterogeneity
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) provides a way of measuring ground deformation caused by underground nuclear testing via a satellite remote sensing platform. We present a finite-element model (FEM) of the nuclear test site in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, formerly North Korea) constrained by InSAR data. The model simulates elastic deformation caused by an underground explosion and includes high-resolution topography and mechanical heterogeneity. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the effect of mechanical heterogeneity (a layered structure in our case) on deformation modelling at the DPRK test site. Sensitivity testing shows that inclusion of topography, mechanical layering and the combined effect results in 48.2, 22.6 and 91.5 per cent increase in the maximum predicted deformation, respectively. This suggests that previous models that do not account for these complexities may overestimate the nuclear yield and/or underestimate the depth of burial (DoB). We performed a parameter search to solve for the cavity size and DoB that best reproduce ground deformation observed in ALOS-2 InSAR data covering the DPRK's 4th nuclear test (DPRK4). Using these best-fit values with a cavity-yield scaling law, we estimate the yield of DPRK4 to be 10-20 kt at a DoB of 542-826 m. Our method provides an estimate that is independent from and complementary to traditional seismic methods, which is useful for a location that is data-limited.

TI  - A new comprehensive index for monitoring maize lodging severity using UAV-based multi-spectral imagery
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lodging significantly reduces crop yield and grain quality. Timely and accurately monitoring crop lodging severity to help farmers to adjust the field management and settle reasonable insurance claim. The purpose of this paper is to effectively monitor maize lodging severity using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a multi -spectral camera. Considering the plant height (PH), lodging angle (LA) and SPAD, each agronomic trait was transformed into a membership matrix by giving each factor a weight. The comprehensive superiority of each evaluation result based on agronomic trait (PH, LA, SPAD) was calculated by using the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method, and the comprehensive lodging evaluation index (CLEI) was constructed. The relationships between the spectral reflectance (SR), texture feature (TF), vegetation index (VI) and PH, LA, SPAD, CLEI were established. The CLEI was calculated and mapped by using the sensitive features derived from UAV-based multi-spectral imagery. According to the distribution of CLEI, the research area was divided into five grades, including non-lodging (NL), light lodging (LL), moderate lodging (ML), severe lodging (SL) and very severe lodging (VSL). The results showed that among the CLEI models constructed by single feature, VI per-formed best and the R-2 of cross-validation was 0.66 which was higher than agronomic trait models (the R-2 of PH, LA, and SPAD models were 0.56, 0.58, 0.41, respectively). The R-2 and nRMSE of cross-validation of the CLEI model constructed by the top three sensitive features (CIre, NDRE, Re_Mea) were 0.80 and 23.78%, while the R-2 of the PH, LA, and SPAD models were 0.74, 0.71, 0.46, respectively. The accuracy of the new comprehensive index (CLEI) model was better than that of single agronomic trait (PH, LA and SPAD) model. The CLEI proposed in this paper using UAV-based multi-spectral imagery can effectively monitor the lodging severity of maize.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use and land-cover (LULC) mapping in the complex area is a challenging task due to the mixed vegetation patterns, and rough mountains with fast-flowing rivers. In Vietnam, LULC update is not frequently. In this study, we applied a supervised machine learning (Random forest-RF) approach to mapping LULC in Thanh Hoa province, Vietnam from 2011 to 2015 utilizing multi-temporal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from MODIS, combined with topographic features. Random forest classification (RFC) reached a total prediction accuracy of 91% and Kappa coefficient (K) of 0.89 across eight LULCs. Besides, the results showed that the features extracted from time-series NDVI comprising the mean of yearly NDVI, the sum of NDVI, and the topography were the important variables controlling the LULC classification. For similar studies on the distribution of LULC, the method proposed in this study could be helpful.

TI  - Self-adaptive non-covalent albumin-binding near-infrared probe conjugates enabling precise sentinel lymph node metastasis illumination and primary tumor imaging
T2  - NANO RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumor sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis plays a vital role in tumor staging and therapeutic decision-making process. However, precise diagnosis of primary tumors and lymphatic metastases is still hindered by low imaging resolution and poor photostability of fluorescent probes. Herein, we report three novel IR820-fatty acid (FA) conjugates (IR-OA, IR-LA, and IR-PA) for precise lymphatic metastasis illumination and primary tumor diagnosis. The IR-FA conjugates are able to non-covalently bound to albumin in vivo, and the fluorescence quantum yield is significantly enhanced after incubation with bovine serum albumin (BSA) in vitro. Moreover, the BSA-IR-FA conjugates display large Stokes shift (> 120 nm), dramatically improving in vivo imaging resolution. Among them, IR-PA demonstrates distinct advantage over IR-OA, IR-LA, and IR-maleimide (MAL) (fluorescent probe previously reported by our group) in terms of fluorescence quantum yield, photostability, and imaging resolution. As a result, IR-PA exhibits satisfactory imaging results with high fluorescence intensity and imaging resolution in sentinel lymph node metastasis illumination and primary tumor location. Our findings provide a self-adaptive albumin-binding near-infrared probe conjugate for accurate diagnosis of primary tumors and lymphatic metastases.

TI  - Is the world wormier than it used to be? We'll never know without natural history collections
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many disease ecologists and conservation biologists believe that the world is wormier than it used to be-that is, that parasites are increasing in abundance through time. This argument is intuitively appealing. Ecologists typically see parasitic infections, through their association with disease, as a negative endpoint, and are accustomed to attributing negative outcomes to human interference in the environment, so it slots neatly into our worldview that habitat destruction, biodiversity loss and climate change should have the collateral consequence of causing outbreaks of parasites. But surprisingly, the hypothesis that parasites are increasing in abundance through time remains entirely untested for the vast majority of wildlife parasite species. Historical data on parasites are nearly impossible to find, which leaves no baseline against which to compare contemporary parasite burdens. If we want to know whether the world is wormier than it used to be, there is only one major research avenue that will lead to an answer: parasitological examination of specimens preserved in natural history collections. Recent advances demonstrate that, for many specimen types, it is possible to extract reliable data on parasite presence and abundance. There are millions of suitable specimens that exist in collections around the world. When paired with contemporaneous environmental data, these parasitological data could even point to potential drivers of change in parasite abundance, including climate, pollution or host density change. We explain how to use preserved specimens to address pressing questions in parasite ecology, give a few key examples of how collections-based parasite ecology can resolve these questions, identify some pitfalls and workarounds, and suggest promising areas for research. Natural history specimens are 'parasite time capsules' that give ecologists the opportunity to test whether infectious disease is on the rise and to identify what forces might be driving these changes over time. This approach will facilitate major advances in a new sub-discipline: the historical ecology of parasitism.

TI  - Identifying distinct plastics in hyperspectral experimental lab-, aircraft-, and satellite data using machine/deep learning methods trained with synthetically mixed spectral data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing production and use of plastics are becoming a serious progressive issue and people pay increasing attention to the effects of plastics on ecosystems and human health. The availability of hyperspectral data from space sensors inspired us to study the feasibility to detect and identify different types of plastics in aircraft-, Goafen-5 (GF-5) and PRISMA satellite data by means of deep-, and machine learning models trained with spectral signatures. In this context, various inhouse and public spectral libraries are used to create a compre-hensive database with mixed pixels of different plastic and non-plastic materials. The endmembers of plastic types involved in this study are polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS), covering 95% of the global production. Additionally, some important varieties of industrial plastics types such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), polyamide (PA), polycarbonate (PC), and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) were included in the investigations. Different samples with varying optical properties (color, brightness, transmissivity) have been selected for each plastic type. As non-plastic materials we have chosen spectra of vegetation, rocks, soils and minerals contained in the public US libraries (ECOSTRESS and USGS). The number of spectra for the training of the deep learning and machine learning models was enlarged by a random linear mixing method and the resulting database was separated into a training and a test group for subsequent multi-label classification. Algorithms selected are a convolutional neural network (CNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). To investigate the transferability to any hyperspectral image data obtained by air-, and spacecraft sensors, we opted for a unifi-cation of the spectral response functions (SRF) and the spectral sampling intervals of all data. Validation is accomplished based on the test group of the spectral database, and tested by controlled laboratory and aircraft experiments recorded over surfaces with varying background materials. Results are further analyzed for the influence of different noise quantities and abundance levels. The performance of the three models is roughly balanced for the validation of the spectral data with an overall accuracy of 97%, 96%, and 95% for the CNN, RF, and SVM, models respectively. In the controlled lab experiments, various accuracy indicators, such as the recall rates and the comprehensive metrics F1-score, OA, and Kappa suggest the RF classifier as the most robust one, followed by the SVM and CNN models. As for the evaluation of the aircraft data from controlled experiments, the RF further outperforms the other two models, behaving most robustly and reliably against conditions with un-known plastics and unknown background surfaces. Thus, the RF was used to classify the ten types of plastics mentioned above in one GF-5 and two PRISMA satellite recordings of the same area. In comparison of both sensor systems, the RF produced high quality and transferable results for detecting plastic mainly related to green-houses, sport fields, photovoltaic constructions and industrial sites that are discussed in detail in this paper.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the current economic growth that Egypt is going through, it is necessary to increase research about the exploration of mineral resources. The current study is one of those studies that aim to define highly radio-active zones at East Wadi Qena area (EWQ), Eastern Desert using airborne radiometric and remote sensing data. This area is characterized by a complex geological setting which encountered multi-phases of deformation and tectonic events. Airborne radiometric data are used for identifying the presence of uranium, thorium, and po-tassium in the present study. Ternary composite map is important in radioelement exploration, as they reveal the source of radioactivity. In addition, semi-quantitative statistical analysis is an effective way in calculating radiometric anomalies. Moreover, processing and classification of remote sensing data are applied for valuable mapping of alteration and mineralization zones in the granitic rocks in the considered area. In this regard, radioactive potential zones (RPZ) have been evaluated using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) through geospatial analysis tools in Geographic Information System (GIS). Five spatial maps are extracted from among the dominant and contributing factors to the concentration of radioactive elements for resolving a radioactive prediction model. The results show that EWQ area is promising for radioactive minerals exploration at diverse phases of granitic rocks, unexpectedly Dokhan volcanics and metavolcanic rocks. The integration between remote sensing and airborne radiometric data can effectively expect the radioactive favorable zones in the study site that can be help for future investigations in other difficult accessible areas.

TI  - Two decades of land cover mapping in the Rio de la Plata grassland region: The MapBiomas Pampa initiative
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Rio de la Plata Grasslands (RPG) region is the largest area of the temperate humid and sub-humid grasslands biome in South America and one of the largest in the world. The region is lo-cated on fertile soils, generally very suitable for agricultural development, so it is undergoing an intense land cover change process. Our knowledge of these changes remains incomplete. Most re-gional-scale studies have been conducted over specific periods, limited subsets of the RGP, coarse resolution and, in general, used land cover classes that are not readily compatible. In this work we described and analyzed the land cover changes in the entire RPG region for the first two decades of the 21st century, especially those related to grasslands loss. We generated annual land cover maps with 30-m resolution that discriminate between 8 categories: native woody forma-tion, forest plantation, swampy areas and flooded grassland, grassland, farming, non-vegetated area, water and non-observed. The map series was evaluated for the years 2001 and 2018 using a completely independent dataset, selected by stratified randomized sampling. Overall accuracy was 73.5% , 77.8% for 2001 and 2018, respectively, with user and producer accuracies that varied between classes and years. In 20 years, RPG region lost, at least, 2.4 million ha of grassland (9% of the remaining grassland area in 2001). Most of these losses are concentrated in Brazil and Uruguay and are associated with new agricultural or forestry areas that increased by 5% and 100%, respectively. Our maps allow a comprehensive understanding of the transformation processes that RPG are undergoing and provide the context on which to explore a large set of hy-potheses related to ecosystem structure and functioning. It will also contribute to improving deci-sion-making at both the regional and national levels.

TI  - Estimation of aboveground carbon stock using Sentinel-2A data and Random Forest algorithm in scrub forests of the Salt Range, Pakistan
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Forest ecosystems play a vital role in the global carbon cycle as forests store similar to 283 Gt of carbon globally and hence help mitigate climate change. Carbon stock estimation is the key step for assessing the mitigation potential of a given forest. About 5-10 Gt CO2 equivalent emissions come from deforestation and forest degradation annually. Pakistan's forest resources are currently deteriorating due to deforestation and degradation and resulting in sourcing carbon dioxide emissions. One forest type that has been examined little so far in this context is subtropical scrub forests. This research suggests a workflow to estimate the carbon stock from three carbon pooLs (aboveground, belowground and litter) in scrub forests of the Soft. Range, Pakistan by incorporating remote sensing and geographic information system techniques. The study's objectives include the estimation of biomass and carbon stocks by using field inventory data and akometric equations, quantifying CO2 sequestration by using the 'IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories' and finally map biomass and carbon by utilizing satellite imagery and statistical analysis. For prediction and mapping of biomass and carbon, field plots data along with vegetation indices and spectral bands of the Sentinel-2A satellite imagery were fed into a Random Forest (RF) algorithm in the cloud computing Google Earth Engine platform. Our results of ground data suggest that the examined scrub forests harbour 243 917 t of biomass, 114 989 t of carbon and 422 009 t of CO2 equivalent in the three carbon pools of the study area with a mean biomass density of 12.04 t ha -1 (+/- 5.31) and mean carbon density of 5.72 t ha(-1) (+/- 2.46). The RF model showed good performance with reasonable R-2 (0.53) and root mean square error (3.64 t ha(-1)) values and predicted average biomass at 13.93 t ha(-1) (+/- 4.35) and mean carbon density of 6.55 t ha(-1) (+/- 2.05). The total predicted and field-measured biomass has a plausible difference in values while the mean values have a minimal difference. The red-edge region and short-wave infrared (SWIR) region of the Sentinel-2A spectrum showed a strong relationship with aboveground biomass estimates from the field. We conclude that the combination of Sentinel-2A data coupled with ground data is a cost-effective and reliable tool to estimate various carbon pools in the scrub forests at a regional scale and may contribute to formulate policies to manage forests sustainably, enhance forest cover and conserve biodiversity.

TI  - The relationship between air quality and MODIS aerosol optical depth in major cities of the Yangtze River Delta
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The AOD derived from the MODIS deep blue(DB) algorithm and AQI were used to investigate the correlation between AOD and AQI in seven major cities of Yangtze River Delta (YRD) from January to December 2019. The accuracy of MODIS AOD was validated by AERONET. Moreover, the AOD and AQI were studied to explore the annual and seasonal distribution characteristics, and the correlation analysis was carried out using five regression models. It was found: I) There was a significant correlation between AOD and AERONET data (R-2 > 0.80, RMSE = 0.106, and MAE = 0.089). II) The highest AQI was observed in winter (83), followed by spring (76), autumn (74), and summer (72). III) The monthly average AOD showed noticeable seasonal variations, which reached the highest in summer (0.91) and the lowest in winter (0.69), followed by spring and autumn. IV) Among the five models, the cubic model obtained the best results with R-2 > 0.55. In the sub-seasonal regression model, the cubic model outperformed other models in spring (R-2 > 0.57), summer (R-2 > 0.76) and autumn (R-2 > 0.38). However, in winter the composite model outperformed others (R-2 > 0.68). V) Considering annual data, the AOD can predict over 70% of the variations in AQI (0.41<R-2 <0.81). These results demonstrate the feasibility of AOD derived from the MODIS DB algorithm in AQI prediction. The method used in this study can be applied as an aid for air pollution control programs in different regions.

TI  - Estimation of daily ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations over the Pearl River Delta using 1 km resolution MODIS AOD based on multi-feature BiLSTM
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PM2.5 concentrations prediction faces the challenge of insufficient ground stations and a lack of monitoring capability for future expectations. In this study, we performed time-series prediction of daily PM2.5 concentra-tions at the monitoring sites in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, China, based on Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory (BiLSTM) network, combining the 1-km resolution satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data as well as meteorological parameters, geographic features, socio-economic developments, and other influencing factors. The model results show good performance in model predictions (R-2 of 0.58-0.78) and scrolling prediction (R-2 of 0.42-0.83) at each PM2.5 monitoring site. Model performance varies by year and season, where the model performs best in 2015 (R-2 of 0.75), better in summer and fall (R-2 of 0.59-0.81), and worse in spring and winter (R-2 of 0.49-0.72). The PM2.5 concentrations of January 2019 were predicted with evaluation indicators (R-2 of 0.62, RMSE of 12.887), which was consistent with the expected performance of our model in the PRD region during winter. Accurate spatiotemporal predictions of future pollution distributions can provide decision support for PM2.5 management countermeasures. Further, more monitoring stations and the latest data are still urgently needed.

TI  - Assessment of the dynamics of urban surface temperatures and air pollution related to COVID-19 in a densely populated City environment in East Java
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic that has hit the whole world has caused losses in various aspects. Several countries have implemented lockdowns to curb the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that caused death. However, for developing countries such as Indonesia, it is not suitable for lockdown because it considers the economic recession. Instead, the Large-scale Social Restrictions (LSSR) regulation is applied, the same as the partial lockdown. Thus, it is hypothesized that implementing LSSR that limits anthropogenic activities can reduce heat emissions and air pollution. Utilization of remote sensing data such as Terra-MODIS LST and Sentinel-5P images to investigate short-term trends (i.e., comparison between baseline year and COVID-19 year) in surface temperature, Surface Urban Heat Islands Intensity (SUHII), and air pollution such as NO2, CO, and O-3 in Malang City and Surabaya City, East Java Province. Spatial downscaling of LST using the Random Forest Regression technique was also carried out to transform the spatial resolution of the Terra-MODIS LST image to make it feasible on a city scale. Raster re-gridding was also implemented to refine the Sentinel-5P spatial resolution. The accuracy of LST spatial downscaling results is quite satisfactory in both cities. Surface temperatures in both cities slightly decreased (below 1 degrees C) during LSSR was applied (P < 0.05). SUHII in both cities experienced a slight increase in both cities during LSSR. NO2 gas was reduced significantly (P < 0.05) in Malang City (similar to 38%) and Surabaya City (similar to 28%) during LSSR phase due to reduced vehicle traffic and restrictions on anthropogenic activities. However, CO and O-3 gases did not indicate anomaly during LSSR. Moreover, this study provides insight into the correlation between SUHII change and the distribution of air pollution in both cities during the pandemic year. Air temperature and wind speed are also added as meteorological factors to examine their effect on air pollution. The proposed models of spatial downscaling LST and re-gridding satellite-based air pollution can help decision-makers control local air quality in the long and short term in the future. In addition, this model can also be applied to other ecological research, especially the input variables for ecological spatial modeling.

TI  - Assessment of the ASAR and PALSAR Sensors Applicability for Detecting and Monitoring of Landslides in the Zagros Area (Iran) Through Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR)
T2  - GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lunching satellites equipped with the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor for interferometry applications has created a great chance to detect and monitor extremely slow, slow and even quick ground deformations. Accordingly, the objective of this research is to compare and assess capabilities of the ASAR and PALSAR sensors to detect, monitor and map landslides in part of the Zagros mountain range occurring in the south of Isfahan, Iran. In addition, generating an accurate landslide distribution map of the study area by combined usage of the ASAR and PALSAR images in two different passes was evaluated. Two image datasets including 17 PALSAR and 21 ASAR images acquired by the ALOS and ENVISAT satellites, respectively were processed by the Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) method. 16 interferogram pair images of the sensors were found to be suitable for the analysis based on an initial processing. 914 landslides were identified covering an area of 13,578 ha by processing the radar images and field studies as well. The maximum vertical displacement was estimated to be 1.58 m during 6 May 2010 to 2 September 2011 by analysis of both the PALSAR and ASAR pair images. The PALSAR images performed more efficient than ASAR images to map the landslides distribution due to the higher wavelength and subsequently more wave penetration and also lower incoherency. However, the ASAR can distinguish the landslides in more details because of its lower wavelength. It was concluded that the DInSAR method is more favorable for identification of the landslides with smaller area and higher frequency.

TI  - Experimental and numerical analysis of resonant sloshing flow in a membrane tank of different filling levels
T2  - OCEAN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In an effort to better understand the sloshing behaviour in LNG tanks, experimental and numerical modelling of a prismatic tank have been carried out for different filling levels. An analytical approach is first applied to identify the eigen-frequencies at the intermediate filling levels from 25% to 70%, where resonant sloshing flows are likely to occur. Model tests are carried out where pure sway excitation is applied on a 1:70 scale prismatic tank, for the two filling levels at the respective eigen-frequencies for filling levels 35% and 70%. From the experiments, it is observed that swirling flows can be induced even when the tanks are initialised to a horizontal position and subjected to sway excitation where both the initial horizontal levelling of the tank, as well as the pure sway excitations are ensured. This phenomenon is also investigated numerically using a variable acceleration solver based on the fixed mesh in OpenFOAM for five filling levels from 25% to 70%. Good agreement is also observed between the experiments and the computed results. The swirling phenomena are captured in the OpenFOAM simulations. The ratio between Fx and Fy can be used as an indication of swirling flows, where we note that swirling flows are observed for the cases with Fx/Fy around 0.20, for the filling ratios above 25%. There is a clear influence of the excitation amplitudes and filling ratio on the occurrence of swirling flows. Additional load cases to investigate the sensitivity of the tank sloshing to different inclination angles are also carried out. From this study, we observe that off-axis forcing could be induced on LNGCs even when the excitations are purely translational.

TI  - Secondary cities under siege: examining peri-urbanisation and farmer households? livelihood diversification practices in Ghana
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Land formalisation and commoditisation are influencing peri-urban growth in secondary cities. This notwithstanding, studies on peri-urbanisation have not prioritized secondary cities and how land transactions shape city expansion and engender livelihood diversification. Few perspectives in urban theory and practice are derived from such secondary cities, while trajectories indicate that such cities are becoming the new face of urbanisation in the Global South. Drawing evidence from Wa, Ghana, the study explores the dynamics of peri-urbanisation, and livelihood diversification through the lenses of land formalisation and a sustainable livelihood framework. Primary data were sourced from randomly selected households using questionnaires together with key informant interviews, focus group discussions and observation. To understand the spatial characteristics of peri-urban areas, Landsat satellite data were employed in analysing the land use land cover (LULC) change in Wa Municipality from 1986 to 2019. Descriptive statistics, thematic analysis and content analysis were deployed to analyse the quantitative and qualitative primary data gathered. The findings show substantial physical urban development and transition from the inner urban enclave into the periphery from the 1980s-2010s. The observed urban transformation was primarily motivated by land sales in the peri-urban areas. Despite the significant land conversion from agricultural to other uses, it was revealed that farming remained an integral livelihood activity for periurban households. The results indicate that embracing and applying the ideals of negotiated planning will be imperative in shaping the sustainable transformation in secondary cities.

TI  - Individual perceptions on rainfall variations versus precipitation trends from satellite data: An interdisciplinary approach in two socio-economically and topographically contrasted districts in Abidjan, C?te d'Ivoire
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Global climate projections show that rising trends in precipitation very probably contribute to the resurgence of the risk of flooding in African cities. There remain however uncertainties regarding the patterns of change in past and future precipitation in the countries of West Africa. There are still too few studies focus on the individual perceptions of populations in Africa on these climate changes, although this is an essential lever for the implementation of warning systems. The aim of present study is to consider in parallel the perceptions of the residents of the city of Abidjan re-garding the variability of precipitation and the meteorological data. A survey among 503 individ-uals was carried out at Abidjan in two districts with contrasted topographical profiles, socio-economic conditions and exposure to flooding, in order to record their perceptions regarding the variations in precipitation between 2009 and 2018. The CHIRPS precipitation data was used to calculate the trends in the climate indicators with the Mann-Kendall method. The results show that there is a similarity between the perception of individuals surveyed and an increasing trend in days of rainfall of more than 50 mm and intensity of precipitation.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to analyze land-use change and urban expansion in Binh Duong province, Vietnam, from 1995 to 2020. Multitemporal Landsat images were used to develop land-use maps. Area statistics and transition matrices were employed to explore the land-use change; meanwhile, annual expansion rate (AER), expansion contribution rate (ECR), and district-, ring-, and sector-based analyses were employed to analyze the urban expansion. The results showed that there was a large transition from agricultural and unused lands to other uses. This resulted in an expansion of developed areas, recreational regions, mining sites, and water surfaces, a drastic decline of agricultural land for annual crops, and a fluctuation of perennial cropland and unused land. The study also indicated that the urban area has expanded 65 times within 25 years at an increasing rate. The AER and ECR were uneven between subregions, and there was a gradual expansion and shift from south to north of the province. The factors affecting the changes comprise natural conditions, development histories, policies and practices for urbanization, industrialization, and agricultural development, and product price fluctuations in the market. Practical lessons learned from this study could be useful for land planning and policymaking in other localities.

TI  - The value of whole-lesion histogram analysis based on field-of-view optimized and constrained undistorted single shot (FOCUS) DWI for predicting axillary lymph node status in early-stage breast cancer
T2  - BMC MEDICAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This study aims to estimate the amount of axillary lymph node (ALN) involvement in early-stage breast cancer utilizing a field of view (FOV) optimized and constrained undistorted single-shot (FOCUS) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) approach, as well as a whole-lesion histogram analysis. Methods This retrospective analysis involved 81 individuals with invasive breast cancer. The patients were divided into three groups: N-0 (negative ALN metastasis), N1-2 (low metastatic burden with 1-2 ALNs), and N->= 3 (heavy metastatic burden with >= 3 ALNs) based on their sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Histogram parameters of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) depending basically on FOCUS DWI were performed using 3D-Slicer software for whole lesions. The typical histogram characteristics for N-0, N1-2, and N->= 3 were compared to identify the significantly different parameters. To determine the diagnostic efficacy of significantly different factors, the area under their receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was examined. Results There were significant differences in the energy, maximum, 90 percentile, range, and lesion size among N-0, N1-2, and N->= 3 groups (P < 0.05). The energy differed significantly between N-0 and N1-2 groups (P < 0.05), and some certain ADC histogram parameters and lesion sizes differed significantly between N-0 and N->= 3, or N1-2 and N->= 3 groups. For ROC analysis, the energy yielded the best diagnostic performance in distinguishing N-0 and N1-2 groups from N->= 3 group with an AUC value of0.853. All parameters revealed excellent inter-observer agreement with inter-reader consistencies data ranging from0.919 to 0.982. Conclusion By employing FOCUS DWI method, the analysis of whole-lesion ADC histogram quantitatively provides a non-invasive way to evaluate the degree of ALN metastatic spread in early-stage breast cancer.

TI  - Sea surface salinity variability in the western subpolar North Atlantic based on satellite observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface salinity (SSS) variability during the recent decade in the western subpolar North Atlantic is inves-tigated using three satellite salinity products, Aquarius, SMAP and SMOS, as well as in-situ observations. Satellite datasets successfully resolve the large scale SSS pattern but are significantly biased near the western boundary regions. Freshwater flux induced by sea ice formation/melting plays a dominant role in shaping the SSS annual cycle in the coastal regions of the western Labrador Sea, but data gaps and uncertainties prevent satellite products from accurately resolving the seasonality in the Labrador Shelf. On the other hand, seasonal fluctuations near the Grand Banks are reasonably captured in satellite data. They are essentially driven by both local freshwater flux associated with ice and advective signals from the north. The interannual variability of SSS is detectable in both in-situ observations and Aquarius. During the low salinity period in 2011-2012, interannual anomalies are no longer controlled by ice formation/melting. Instead, they are mostly determined by oceanic advection, which moves low salinity water around the Labrador Sea in a cyclonic direction. In addition, the Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Function (DINEOF) is applied to satellite datasets to weed out noise and fill data gaps. The resulting reconstructed datasets show apparent bias reduction and better performances in depicting seasonal cycles in both coastal region and deep ocean. DINEOF does not improve the capability of SMAP and SMOS in resolving the interannual anomalies as their original fields do not include such signals.

TI  - High-resolution multispectral imagery and LiDAR point cloud fusion for the discrimination and biophysical characterisation of vegetable crops at different levels of nitrogen
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution remote sensing data has expanded the scope, precision, and scale of remote sensing applications in agriculture. Availability of spatial information at actionable field units is vital for using remote sensing data in agriculture. Crop discrimination and biophysical characterisation sensitive to nutrient levels have not been addressed at the patch level. This work investigates the synergetic application of high-resolution satellite imagery and terrestrial LiDAR point cloud for object-level discrimination and biophysical characterisation of a few crops at different nitrogen (N) levels. To this end, cabbage, eggplant, and tomato at three levels of N were grown on the experimental fields of the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru, India, in 2017. Fusing the multispectral imagery (WorldView-III) and LiDAR point cloud (terrestrial laser scanner) at the feature level, object-level supervised classification and estimation of two critical biophysical pa-rameters (crown area and biomass) were performed using the support vector machine (SVM) and Random Forests (RF) algorithms with reference to different N levels. Results suggest discrimination of vegetable crops with high accuracy (92%), about 20% higher than the individual sensors, from the fused imagery sensitive to N levels. The quality of re-trievals indicates a contrasting pattern wherein the accuracy of the crown area is high with the LiDAR point cloud at various N levels. For the biomass, there is no perceptible differ-entiation of N levels within a crop. The accuracy of crop classification with reference to N levels is similar from both RF and SVM algorithms. However, RF algorithm offered sub-stantially higher classification results when the N status is ignored. In contrast, the quality of biophysical modelling is very high and is similar from both the algorithms. Weather conditions and sub-field level environment-induced variations in the crop growth likely are the factors responsible for the reduced sensitivity of remote sensing data to crop N levels at the patch level.

AB  - Flooding is one of the most catastrophic natural disasters in terms of provoking socio-economic losses. The current study is to foster a flood susceptibility map of Krishna District in Andhra Pradesh (AP) through integrating remote sensing data, geographical information system (GIS), and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Eleven factors, including elevation, slope, aspect, land use/land cover (LULC), drainage density, topographic wetness index, stream power index, lithology, soil, precipitation, and distance from the streams, are considered for identifying and evaluating the spatial distribution of critical flood-susceptible regions. Thematic maps of different factors were derived in GIS using remote sensing data obtained from Sentinel-2A (satellite sensor), shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model (SRTM DEM v3), and other scientific data products. An analytical hierarchy process is a mathematical approach for decision support, primarily based on the weight and rank of different causative factors. AHP technique is implemented for flood hazard modeling and ascertaining the Flood Hazard Index (FHI) to produce a flood susceptibility map. Different thematic maps weighed with the AHP framework are combined using overlay analysis to produce the flood susceptibility map of the study region. The outcomes of the study demonstrate the potential of GIS and AHP in providing a premise to recognize the vulnerable areas that are susceptible to flood. According to the findings, the Flood Hazard Index is 42% and the study region is classified into very high, high, moderate, low, and very low susceptible, respectively. Following that, historical flood data was used to validate the accuracy of the generated flood susceptibility map. This shows that a maximum of 90% of the data points are within floodplain.

TI  - Estimating aboveground carbon stocks of urban trees by synergizing ICESat-2 LiDAR with GF-2 data
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately mapping carbon stocks of urban trees is necessary for urban managers to design strategies to mitigate climate change. However, the aboveground carbon stocks of urban trees are usually underestimated by passive remote sensing data because of the signal saturation problem. The research is the first attempt to develop a framework to map aboveground carbon density of trees in urban areas by synergizing Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) LiDAR data with Gaofen-2 (GF-2) imagery. The framework consists of three key steps. First, we used a support vector machine classifier to classify GF-2 images and extracted urban tree regions. Second, we estimated the tree carbon density of ICESat-2 strips by developing a ICESat-2 photon feature-based aboveground carbon density estimation model. Third, we mapped the carbon density of urban trees by developing a synergistic model between ICESat-2 and GF-2 data based on an object-oriented method. We tested the approach for the areas within the fifth ring road of Beijing, China. The results showed that the 50th percentile height (PH50) of nighttime photons was a good predictor for estimating carbon density of urban trees, with a R2 of 0.69 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.81 kg C m- 2. Using the spectral features generated by GF-2 imagery, we could further extrapolate the carbon density estimated by ICESat-2 strip data to a full coverage of accurate mapping carbon density by urban trees, resulting in a R2 of 0.64 and a RMSE of 2.32 kg C m- 2. The carbon stocks within the fifth ring road of Beijing were 8.28 x 108 kg in total, with the mean carbon density of 3.52 kg C m- 2. Such estimations were larger than that of previous study using passive remote sensing data only, suggesting the integration of spaceborne LiDAR and spectral data could greatly reduce the underestimation of carbon stocks of urban trees. Our approach can more accurately estimate carbon stocks of urban trees and has the potential to be applicable in other cities.

TI  - A remote sensing based study of tropospheric ozone concentration amid COVID-19 lockdown over India using Sentinel-5P satellite data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Amid the COVID-19 crisis, governments all over the world, and not excluding India, took to lockdown measures to deaccelerate the spread of the COVID-19 virus. This led to reduction of atmospheric pollution by declining the harmful Nitrogen and Sulphur Oxide (NOX and SOX) concentrations. However, one hand while the stratospheric Ozone (O-3) showed repair, the lower atmospheric O-3 concentrations demonstrated a remarkable increase during lockdown phase over India. This study aims to estimate the O-3 concentration during the Covid-19 lockdown over Pune city in India using freely available Sentinel-5P satellite datasets. The study makes use of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Random Forest (RF) regressions and compares the findings of the two algorithms based on estimation results. This study utilizes lower atmospheric O-3 concentration data from Sentinel-5P satellite of the European Space Agency (ESA) over the Indian mainland for a month of lockdown scenario (March 22(nd), 2020, to April 25(th), 2020) and shows the remarkable increase in concentration of O-3 gas as a pollutant. Despite the complete lockdown over India during this given time frame, there has been enough emission of O-3 precursors from other sources such as stubble burning. The estimates of tropospheric O-3 concentration for May 2020 for Pune city, using OLS and RF Regressions, have been validated with May 2020 data. The results have provided a RMSE of 1.05 and 1.23 with R-2-statistics of 0.90 and 0.857 in training and testing phases for OLS and RMSE of 0.98 and MAE of 1.07 with R-2-statistics of 0.968 and 0.895 in training and testing phases of the RF. The outcome of this study has proven that O-3 gas concentrations in the atmosphere depends upon various other causative factors apart from the precursor gases. The study also shows that the remotely sensed Sentinel-5P datasets, supplemented with ground-based sensor data can help in time and cost saving estimation of O-3 concentrations in the troposphere with considerable accuracy.

TI  - MODIS sensors can monitor spatiotemporal trends in fog and low cloud cover at 1 km spatial resolution along the U.S. Pacific Coast
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fog and low cloud cover (FLCC) provide critical moisture for ecosystems along the Pacific Coast during the summer months and it is currently unclear how climate change has affected FLCC occurrence. Additionally, FLCC impacts visibility and transportation safety for both road and air traffic. As such, a method for the monitoring of FLCC is necessary to inform land management decisions for fog-obligate species and to improve transportation safety, among other applications. Several gaps exist in current FLCC detection methodologies and while the Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor has previously been used to detect fog, its utility has not been validated. In this study, we create a 20 year (2000-2020) FLCC dataset using the Terra MODIS cloud flags and examine its effectiveness in detecting daily and monthly FLCC presence along the California and southern Oregon coast for the summer months (June-September). We validate the accuracy of this method using an existing FLCC dataset derived from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) observations collected at 15 min intervals from 2000 to 2009. The two FLCC datasets have a strong linear relationship for FLCC frequency for each summer month, with an average r(2) of 0.82 and p-value of < 0.01. This strong relationship demonstrates the ability of Terra MODIS to reliably and accurately detect FLCC. Finally, we demonstrate a case study application of our FLCC dataset in a time series analysis over five coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) state parks in the Big Sur region of coastal California. This case study highlights the benefits provided by a 1 km resolution FLCC dataset for ecological applications and for monitoring spatiotemporal FLCC patterns across summer months over two decades. Our case study results showed that the number of foggy days fluctuates considerably year-to-year with no discernible positive or negative trend occurring between 2000 and 2020. Finally, we present a freely-accessible Google Earth Engine application to view and download the monthly FLCC data for all summer months for the years 2000-2020. The methods and dataset presented in this paper provide a means for efficient, daily FLCC monitoring at 1 km(2) resolution, as well as the capacity for historical FLCC analyses.

TI  - Chang'E-5 samples reveal high water content in lunar minerals
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The formation and distribution of lunar surficial water remains ambiguous. Here, we show the prominence of water (OH/H2O) attributed to solar wind implantation on the uppermost surface of olivine, plagioclase, and pyroxene grains from Chang'E-S samples. The results of spectral and microstructural analyses indicate that solar wind-derived water is affected by exposure time, crystal structure, and mineral composition. Our estimate of a minimum of 170 ppm water content in lunar soils in the Chang'E-S region is consistent with that reported by the Moon Minerology Mapper and Chang'E-S lander. By comparing with remote sensing data and through lunar soil maturity analysis, the amount of water in Chang'E-S provides a reference for the distribution of surficial water in middle latitude of the Moon. We conclude that minerals in lunar soils are important reservoirs of water, and formation and retention of water originating from solar wind occurs on airless bodies.

TI  - Spatial Variability of NDVI and SPAD for Variable- and Fixed-Rate Fertilization in Olive Orchards
T2  - ERWERBS-OBSTBAU
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the spatial variability of fertilization requirements by using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil plant analysis development (SPAD) data for olive orchards. The research was carried out in Ayvalik, Turkey. The olive orchard was divided into two parts to measure NDVI and SPAD for variable-rate fertilization and fixed-rate fertilization. The NDVI was measured with a GreenSeeker sensor and SPAD readings were made with a SpadMeter. Geographic coordinates of the NDVI and SPAD measurements were also determined by a global navigation satellite system (GNSS). After applying these fertilization methods, NDVI and SPAD measurements were recorded. Soil and leaf samples were analysed in the laboratory to determine the content of plant nutrients for nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K). Spatial variability maps were created for NDVI and SPAD values. According to the statistical analyses, NDVI values varied between 0.577 and 0.838 and the coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated as 6.45% for all measurements. The average NDVI was determined as 0.739 and the CV was 7.04% for fixed-rate fertilization and 0.734 and 5.87% for variable-rate fertilization. Differences between NDVI measurements for fixed-rate fertilization and variable-rate fertilization were not statistically significant according to t-test results (t = 0.524, p > 0.05). The NDVI measurements were made around trees and the GreenSeeker sensor measured NDVIs from a mixture of leaves, branches and air for each olive tree; this situation affected the NDVI measurements. In addition, the colour, shape and content of the olive leaf also affected the NDVI measurements.

TI  - Landsat-8 based coastal ecosystem mapping in South Africa using random forest classification in Google Earth Engine
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastlines worldwide are home to an increasing number of people and are subject to many pressures. This, combined with natural dynamics and hazards, often results in the degradation of coastal and marine ecosys-tems and infrastructure. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt effective management strategies to ensure sus-tainable use of coastal ecosystems, which requires up-to-date data on the extent of coastal ecosystems. This research aimed to create a coastal ecosystem land cover map for South Africa using the random forest algo-rithm to classify Landsat 8 imagery. Processing was done using the Google Earth Engine platform. A total of 522 Landsat 8 images were called to create a median image for classification. The impact of the number of trees, the number of variables per split, and variable selection on overall classification accuracy and Kappa values were evaluated. This was done by increasing the number of trees from 100 to 500 with increments of 100, setting the number of variables per split to three, four or five, and reducing the number of input varia-bles from the original 18 variables, to the 10 most important variables, to the 5 most important variables, based on variable importance scores. Results suggest that the number of input variables used in the model had a greater impact on accuracy than the number of trees used, or the number of variables used per split. The average overall accuracy was 82.28%, with values ranging between 75.33% and 86.70%, while the average Kappa was 0.8068 and values ranged between 0.7310 and 0.8550. The model with the highest overall accu-racy was the model using all input variables, 500 trees, and three variables per split. A major challenge was the misclassification of certain vegetation classes due to the complex successional mosaic they form, causing mixed signals and generally lower classification accuracy. Despite model limitations, results were satisfactory and have shown that coastal land cover classification and monitoring could be aided by the rapid classifica-tion of Landsat 8 imagery in Google Earth Engine using the random forest algorithm.

T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on crop yield prediction is essential for farmers, governments, scientists, and agricultural agencies to make well-informed decisions. Majority of yield prediction methods have been based on data assimilation, which incorporates consecutive obser-vation of canopy development from remote sensing data into model simulations of crop growth processes. But this study used high res-olution Sentinel-2 data with combination of different types of secondary data in Random Forest (RF) regression model on different phases of the crop growing season for higher accurate rice yield prediction. For that First, computed crop/non-crop and rice/non-rice crops through RF classifiers were applied on seasonal median composites of Sentinel-2 data for each pixel in the region. Thousands of crop/non-crop labels were collected using an in-house google earth engine (GEE) labeler, and several crop type labels were obtained from various sources during the crop growing seasons. Results demonstrate that sentinel-2 imagery is useful to detect crop/non-crop classes from cropland with more than 85% accuracy, thus it can be used for crop prediction. Furthermore, the Sentinel-2 imagery with secondary data such as environmental, soil and topographic data perform higher accuracy for yield prediction. Its show 0.40 to 1.01 t/ha yield production range at a landscape level. Overall, this study illustrates the Sentinel-2 imagery, GEE platform, advanced classification and rice yield mapping algorithms are enhance the understanding of precision agricultural systems.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Springtime nitrogen oxides and tropospheric ozone in Svalbard: results from the measurement station network
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Svalbard is a remote and scarcely populated Arctic archipelago and is considered to be mostly influenced by long-range-transported air pollution. However, there are also local emission sources such as coal and diesel power plants, snowmobiles and ships, but their influence on the background concentrations of trace gases has not been thoroughly assessed. This study is based on data of tropospheric ozone (O-3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) collected in three main Svalbard settlements in spring 2017. In addition to these ground-based observations and radiosonde and O-3 sonde soundings, ERAS reanalysis and BrO satellite data have been applied in order to distinguish the impact of local and synoptic-scale conditions on the NOx and O-3 chemistry. The measurement campaign was divided into several sub-periods based on the prevailing large-scale weather regimes. The local wind direction at the stations depended on the large-scale conditions but was modified due to complex topography. The NOx concentration showed weak correlation for the different stations and depended strongly on the wind direction and atmospheric stability. Conversely, the O-3 concentration was highly correlated among the different measurement sites and was controlled by the long-range atmospheric transport to Svalbard. Lagrangian backward trajectories have been used to examine the origin and path of the air masses during the campaign.

TI  - Hydrological data and modeling to combine and validate precipitation datasets relevant to hydrological applications
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Region: Forty-one river basins in Brazil and neighboring countries in South America.Study Focus: In large river basins, on countrywide or continental scales, it is often difficult to have consistent and accurate long time series of spatially distributed precipitation data available. However, these are needed to calibrate hydrological models and to run hydrological simulations continuously in real-time streamflow forecasting. In this study, we assess two real-time precipi-tation products based on rain gauges and satellite data (TRMM-MERGE and CPC-NOAA) for their use in streamflow forecasting in the hydropower sector in Brazil. To take advantage of each precipitation data source and derive a unique dataset, a methodology is proposed to combine, extend, and validate the datasets. We consider the discharges at the river basin outlets as an independent and robust reference for hydrological applications. Observed discharges are used to quantify precipitation uncertainties and to weight the blending, while discharges obtained from hydrological modeling are used to validate the final precipitation product.New Hydrological Insights for the Region: The proposed blending method, which uses the uncer-tainty of the original datasets to define the weighting factors, was efficient in generating a pre-cipitation product that performs better than each dataset separately when used to force a hydrological model. The use of the double-mass curve correlation to extend the time series of the datasets beyond their common period allowed us to produce long time series of precipitation for South American basins and hydrological applications. The study shows that it is possible to rely on river discharge data and hydrological modeling to select and combine different precipitation products in the region and presents a step-by-step methodology to do so.

TI  - Pan-Arctic melt pond fraction trend, variability, and contribution to sea ice changes
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Because the Pan-Arctic melt pond significantly influences the mass balance of sea ice, analyzing changes in the Pan-Arctic melt pond can offer insights into the Arctic sea ice and environment. In this study, the MODIS level 2 surface reflectance product (MOD09A1) was used to calculate variability and trends in the Pan-Arctic melt pond fraction (MPF) from May 9 to August 29 during the period 2000-2019, along with its relationship with September sea ice extent (SIE). The results showed that as a result of advances in Arctic ice melt onset and the extension of the melting period, the MPF as a whole showed an insignificant upward trend but that the MPF in the multiyear ice area increased significantly. Melt pond distribution is closely related to atmospheric circulation over the Arctic. Significant positive and negative geopotential height anomalies at different locations in the Arctic will cause poleward winds from different directions, bringing warm, humid air and leading to an increase in MPF in different regions of the Arctic. There is a strong negative correlation between integrated MPF and September SIE, concentrated in the northern part of the Beaufort Sea. On June 18, the integrated MPF had the strongest correlation with September SIE, at-0.96. The use of linear regression and support vector machine combined with integrated MPF and 850-hpa average wind, Arctic Oscillation (AO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indexes to forecast September SIE shows that the support vector machine is more suitable for forecasting September SIE. When the forecast factor is only the integrated MPF, the MPF is integrated from May 9 to June 10 has the forecast accuracy is the highest, with a considerable forecast skill. When the average May-June AO is combined with the integrated MPF, the forecast skill will be further improved.

TI  - Quantitative prediction of toxin-producing <i>Aphanizomenon</i> cyanobacteria in freshwaters using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to develop an empirical model to predict the spatial distribution of Aphanizomenon using the Ridiyagama reservoir in Sri Lanka with a dual-model strategy. In December 2020, a bloom was detected with a high density of Aphanizomenon and chlorophyll-a concentration. We generated a set of algorithms using in situ chlorophyll-a data with surface reflectance of Sentinel-2 bands on the same day using linear regression analysis. The in situ chlorophyll-a concentration was better regressed to the reflectance ratio of (1+R-665)/(1-R-705) derived from B4 and B5 bands of Sentinel-2 with high reliability (R-2 =0.81, p<0.001). The second regression model was developed to predict Aphanizomenon cell density using chlorophyll-a as the proxy and the relationship was strong and significant (R-2 =0.75, p<0.001). Coupling the former regression models, an empirical model was derived to predict Aphanizomenon cell density in the same reservoir with high reliability (R-2 =0.71, p<0.001). Furthermore, the predicted and observed spatial distribution of Aphanizomenon was fairly agreed. Our results highlight that the present empirical model has a high capability for an accurate prediction of Aphanizomenon cell density and their spatial distribution in freshwaters, which helps in the management of toxic algal blooms and associated health impacts.

TI  - A review of explainable AI in the satellite data, deep machine learning, and human poverty domain
T2  - PATTERNS
M3  - Review
AB  - Recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep machine learning have created a step change in how to measure human development indicators, in particular asset-based poverty. The combination of satellite imagery and deep machine learning now has the capability to estimate some types of poverty at a level close to what is achieved with traditional household surveys. An increasingly important issue beyond static estimations is whether this technology can contribute to scientific discovery and, consequently, new knowledge in the poverty and welfare domain. A foundation for achieving scientific insights is domain knowledge, which in turn translates into explainability and scientific consistency. We perform an integrative literature review focusing on three core elements relevant in this context-transparency, interpretability, and explainability-and investigate how they relate to the poverty, machine learning, and satellite imagery nexus. Our inclusion criteria for papers are that they cover poverty/wealth prediction, using survey data as the basis for the ground truth poverty/wealth estimates, be applicable to both urban and rural settings, use satellite images as the basis for at least some of the inputs (features), and the method should include deep neural networks. Our review of 32 papers shows that the status of the three core elements of explainable machine learning (transparency, interpretability, and domain knowledge) is varied and does not completely fulfill the requirements set up for scientific insights and discoveries. We argue that explainability is essential to support wider dissemination and acceptance of this research in the development community and that explainability means more than just interpretability.

TI  - Assessment of the Capability of Satellite Images in Determining the Topsoil Moisture Content in the Dust Hotspot of Southeastern Ahvaz in Iran
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture content is one of the critical parameters in water resource studies and watershed management. Large-scale field measurement is a tough, time-consuming, and costly task. newly, models based on remote sensing indicators have found special importance with high accuracy to investigate the soil and water resources. This study aims to use Landsat 8 satellite imagery to study variation in topsoil moisture content of dust hotspots of southeastern Ahvaz of Iran, over the five months (from February to June 2019). After monthly field sampling, satellite images were applied to determine the NDMI index and the topsoil moisture content using Bands 5 and 6 (main Bands) of Landsat 8 satellites. Then, by fusion, with Band 8 (panchromatic Band), the soil moisture content map was obtained for each month. The Pearson correlation positive was obtained between the NDMI of the main band and the NDMI of fusion with the soil moisture content of field for April month, with a correlation coefficient 0.543, and a significance level of 0.05 (P-value < 0.05). Also, for each month, the humidity index modeling was obtained for both data (the main (original) band and the fusion band). The proposed model was evaluated using statistical metrics namely R2, RMSE and MAE to April month, and the results were 0.57, 1.25 and 5.45, respectively. After validating the models, the best ones were selected for estimating the soil moisture content. Finally, the obtained results showed that Landsat 8 data presented satisfying outcomes for estimating map soil moisture content.

TI  - An exploratory study of Sentinel-1 SAR for rapid urban flood mapping on Google Earth Engine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Real-time, near-real-time, and accurate flood extent information is critical for emergency response during disaster events such as floods. Accurate extents are critical for disaster management and relief efforts. Despite multiple efforts, there are still many challenges in automated processing of Sentinel-1 SAR to generate reliable inundation maps. The major advantage of SAR compared to optical imagery is its data collection capability despite any weather conditions even thick cloud situation. Currently, there is a knowledge gap of employing different polarization combinations of SAR imagery for flooding research. First, ten different combinations of the two original VH and VV polarizations are designed for rapid and accurate urban flood mapping. To examine the significant potentials of the polarization combinations for flood mapping, four flood mapping methods namely threshold, change detection, unsupervised and supervised classification, in combination with a zero-depth flood method, are designed and used to map flood extents. Among different polarization combinations, the multipli-cation, squared multiplication, addition, and squared addition combinations have resulted in good results for flood extent mapping. In addition, a flood depth estimation approach has been used to address the over-estimation of urban flooded areas. In all four methods, the deduction of overestimated flooded areas using the threshold of zero flood depth has improved the overall accuracy on average 7 % for all methods. The results show that all four methods implemented on Google Earth Engine are good using different combinations to identify flooded areas but change detection method requires little user involvement, and this can be applied to new study areas without estimating flooding depth for the affected areas. Whereas the supervised classification will need more user's involvement to collect sample points. Among all the combinations, squared addition of polarizations has been consistently performed well for all methods. All the analysis has been done on the Google Earth Engine platform, and this strategy can be used to map flood in any urban environment. The finding of this study will enhance local governments and federal agencies rapid assessment of flooding disasters and making accurate decisions.

TI  - Validation of Copernicus Sentinel-3/OLCI Level 2 Land Integrated Water Vapour product
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Validation of the Integrated Water Vapour (IWV) from Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) was performed as a part of the "ESA/Copernicus Space Component Validation for Land Surface Temperature, Aerosol Optical Depth and Water Vapour Sentinel-3 Products" (LAW) project. High-spatial-resolution IWV observations in the near-infrared spectral region from the OLCI instruments aboard the Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B satellites provide continuity with observations from MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer). The IWV was compared with reference observations from two networks: GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) precipitable water vapour from the SuomiNet network and integrated lower tropospheric columns from radio-soundings from the IGRA (Integrated Radiosonde Archive) database.Results for cloud-free matchups over land show a wet bias of 7 %-10 % for OLCI, with a high correlation against the reference observations (0.98 against SuomiNet and 0.90 against IGRA). Both OLCI-A and OLCI-B instruments show almost identical results, apart from an anomaly observed in camera 3 of the OLCI-B instrument, where observed biases are lower than in other cameras in either instrument. The wavelength drift in sensors was investigated, and biases in different cameras were found to be independent of wavelength. Effect of cloud proximity was found to have almost no effect on observed biases, indicating that cloud flagging in the OLCI IWV product is sufficiently reliable. We performed validation of random uncertainty estimates and found them to be consistent with the statistical a posteriori estimates, but somewhat higher.

TI  - Usefulness and potential pitfalls of pre-operative PET-CT in patients with endometrial cancer undergoing one- and two-step sentinel lymph node mapping: Do negative findings on PET-CT negativity really indicate node negativity?
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. We investigated the utility of Positron emission tomography-Computed tomography (PET-CT) in the setting of two different sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping techniques; the conventional cervical injection method (one-step) and the two-step method, which involves fundal injection followed by cervical injection.Methods. Patients with endometrial cancer undergoing FDG PET-CT followed by laparoscopic or robotic sur-gical staging with SLN mapping at the Yonsei Cancer Center between July 2014 and April 2021 were stratified into the PET-positive group (with suspected or likely lymph nodes metastasis) and PET-negative group. A chart re-view was performed for the number of harvested SLNs, patterns of SLN metastases, and recurrence.Results. Among 466 patients undergoing one-step (n = 276) and two-step (n = 190) SLN mapping, LN me-tastasis was identified in 21 of 434 PET-negative and 18 of 32 PET-positive patients. The sensitivity and specificity of PET-CT for diagnosing lymph node metastasis were 46.2% and 96.7%, respectively. Among PET-positive pa-tients with LN metastasis, anatomical distribution was concordant in 14/18 patients (77.8%). Among PET -negative patients, four (2.3%) had metastatic para-aortic SLNs, including three (1.7%) with isolated para-aortic metastases; metastatic para-aortic SLNs were exclusively found in the two-step group. Among PET-positive pa-tients, para-aortic SLN metastasis was identified in 35.7% of two-step and 16.7% of one-step group. Among the 21 PET false-negative patients, recurrence was seen in four patients (19%) after a median follow-up of 34 months (range: 7-70 months).Conclusions. PET-CT served as a useful guide to clinicians with high anatomical concordance rate in patients with LN metastasis. However, despite high specificity, sensitivity was limited. SLN metastasis pattern, especially at the para-aortic level, indicates that the two-step SLN technique might be useful in PET-negative and PET -positive patients.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Impacts of land-use and land-cover change on rural livelihoods: Evidence from eastern Sierra Leone
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes have been observed in Sierra Leone, but to what extent they impact rural livelihoods, amidst investment by multinational companies in non-food crops and mining, remains a grey area in the scientific discourse. Against this backdrop, this study attempts, for the first time, to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of LULC changes and their impacts on household livelihoods in a rural area in eastern Sierra Leone, using remote sensing and ancillary socio-economic and livelihood data. For this purpose, temporal Landsat images at 1986, 2000 and 2020 were subjected to the Maximum Likelihood classification algorithm to map and detect the change of the six most informative LULC classes in the test site. Ground-truth LULC and socio-economic and household livelihood surveys were conducted to obtain ancillary data. Results indicate a sub-stantial (51%) decrease in Wetland area (29,525 ha to 14,554 ha) but an increase in Dense Forest of 24% (8,873 ha to 11,036 ha) over the 34-year period. While the natural assets of households are on the decline, physical and financial assets are on the increase. However, household livelihood outcomes are less favourable and households are therefore vulnerable to food insecurity as changes in LULC persist.

TI  - COVID-19, climate shocks, and food security linkages: evidence and perceptions from smallholder farming communities in Tanzania
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Insights on the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are critical for designing and implementing policies to alleviate the food security burden it may have caused, and for bolstering rural communities against similar macroeconomic shocks in the future. Yet estimating the causal effects of the pandemic is difficult due to its ubiquitous nature and entanglement with other shocks. In this descriptive study, we combine high-resolution satellite imagery to control for plot-level rainfall with household socio-economic panel data from 2014, 2016, 2019 and 2020, to differentiate the effect of the pandemic from climatic shocks on food security in Morogoro, Tanzania. We find evidence of decreased incomes, increased prices of staple foods, and increased food insecurity in 2020 relative to previous years, and link these changes to the pandemic by asking households about their perceptions of COVID-19. Respondents overwhelmingly attribute economic hardships to the pandemic, with perceived impacts differing by asset level.

TI  - Higher rates of regional disease but improved outcomes in pediatric versus adult melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Malignant melanoma is rare in the pediatric population and management is largely extrapolated from adult guidelines. Adult data have shown that immediate completion lymph node dissection (CLND) does not improve overall survival in selected patients with clinically node negative, sentinel lymph node-positive disease. Current nodal management in children is unknown.Methods: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for patients with melanoma from 20122017 and patients categorized as pediatric ( <= 18 years, n = 962) or adult (n = 327,987). Factors associated with CLND in children with positive SLNB were evaluated in multivariable analysis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed.Results: Compared to adults, children present with thicker primary tumors (T3 or T4 26.5% vs 15.5%, p < 0.001), resulting in higher rates of nodal assessment with SLN biopsy or LND (60.2% vs 36.6%, p < 0.001) and higher rates of regional nodal disease (35.1% vs 23.4%, p < 0.001). Children underwent higher rates of CLND after SLN biopsy (10.4% vs 4.1%) and upfront lymph node dissection (15.2% vs 8.7%). A decreased rate of CLND was noted in 2017 compared to 2012 (odds ratio (OR) 0.16 (p = 0.005). CLND was performed more often on multivariable analysis for older pediatric age ( > 12 years, OR = 1.6, p = 0.037) and lower extremity primary (OR = 0.29, p < 0.001). Children with regional nodal disease have improved 3-year overall survival compared to adults (96.5% vs 71.0%, p < 0.001).Conclusions: Children with melanoma have higher rates of nodal disease but better survival than adults. As in adults, there has been a recent increase in close nodal observation rather than CLND for patients with positive SLN. Further study of nodal surveillance for pediatric patients is warranted.

TI  - Transcutaneous sentinel lymph node detection in cutaneous melanoma with indocyanine green and near-infrared fluorescence: A diagnostic sensitivity study
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy with preoperative radiocolloid-based lymphoscintigraphy and blue dye injection is considered the standard procedure for staging nodal metastases in early-stage cutaneous melanoma patients with clinically uninvolved lymph nodes. While this combination renders good accuracy in SLN detection, radiation exposure and the frequent allergic reactions to the blue dye are considered drawbacks of this technique. Indocyanine green (ICG) is a water-soluble fluorescent dye that can be identified through near-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRFI). The aim of this prospective diagnostic sensitivity study was to assess the feasibility of ICG and NIRFI to identify SLNs in melanoma transcutaneously ("before skin incision") and to analyze the various factors influencing detection rate, in comparison to lymphoscintigraphy. This study included 93 patients undergoing SLN biopsy for cutaneous melanoma. The region and the number of the SLNs identified with lymphoscintigraphy and with ICG were recorded. Patients' characteristics, as well as tumor details were also recorded preoperatively. One hundred and ninety-four SLNs were identified through lymphoscintigraphy. The sensitivity of ICG for transcutaneous identification of the location of the SLNs was 96.1% overall, while the sensitivity rate for the number of SLNs was 79.4%. Gender and age did not seem to influence detection rate, but a body mass index >30 kg/m(2) was associated with a lower identification rate of the number of SLNs (P = .045). Transcutaneous identification of SLNs through ICG and NIRFI technology is a feasible technique that could potentially replace in selected patients the standard SLN detection methodology in cutaneous melanoma.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of two novel serotypes of Tibet orbivirus from <i>Culicoides</i> and sentinel cattle in Yunnan Province of China
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tibet orbivirus (TIBOV), a new candidate of Orbivirus genus, was initially isolated from mosquitoes in Tibet in 2009 and subsequently from both Culicoides and mosquitoes in several provinces of China and Japan. Little is known about the origin, genetic diversity, dissemination and pathogenicity of TIBOV, although its potential threat to animal health has been acknowledged. In this study, two viruses, V290/YNSZ and V298/YNJH, were isolated from the Culicoides and sentinel cattle in Yunnan Province. Their genome sequences, cell tropism in mammalian and insect cell lines along with pathogenicity in suckling mice were determined. Genome phylogenetic analyses confirmed their classification as TIBOV species; however, OC1 proteins of the V290/YNSZ and V298/YNJH shared maximum sequence identities of 31.5% and 33.9% with other recognized TIBOV serotypes (TIBOV-1 to TIBOV-4) and formed two monophyletic branches in phylogenetic tree, indicating they represented two novel TIBOV serotypes which were tentatively designated as TIBOV-5 and TIBOV-6. The viruses replicated robustly in BHK, Vero and C6/36 cells and triggered overt clinical symptoms in suckling mice after intracerebral inoculation, causing mortality of 100% and 25%. Cross-sectional epidemiology analysis revealed silent circulation of TIBOV in Yunnan Province with overall prevalence of 16.4% (18/110) in cattle, 10.8% (13/120) in goats and 5.5% (6/110) in swine. The prevalence patterns of four investigated TIBOV serotypes (TIBOV-1, -2, -5 and 6) differed from each one another, with their positive rates ranging from 8.2% (9/110) for TIBOV-2 in cattle to 0.9% (1/110) for TIBOV-1 and TIBOV-5 in cattle and swine. Our findings provided new insights for diversity, pathogenicity and epidemiology of TIBOV and formed a basis for future studies addressing the geographical distribution and the zoonotic potential of TIBOV.

TI  - Superficial versus deep inguinal nodal dissection for vulvar cancer staging
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. The objective of this study was to compare the rate of groin recurrence among women undergoing superficial or deep inguinal lymph node dissections in suspected early-stage vulvar carcinoma. Secondary objec-tives included comparison of overall survival and post-operative morbidity between the study groups. Methods. A retrospective cohort of 233 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the vulva who under-went an inguinal lymph node dissection at two major academic institutions from 1999 to 2017 were analyzed. Demographic, surgical, recurrence, survival, and post-operative morbidity data were collected for 233 patients, resulting in a total of 400 groin node dissections analyzed.Results. Rates of overall primary recurrence of disease between superficial and deep inguinal LND (42.5 vs. 39.8%, p = 0.70) and rates of inguinal recurrence (3.4 vs. 8.3%, p = 0.16) were similar. Overall rates of postoper-ative morbidity were significantly higher in the cohort undergoing deep LND (70.3% vs 44.3%, p < 0.01). Rates of lymphedema (42.4 vs 15.9%, p < 0.01), readmission (26.3 vs 6.8%, p < 0.01), and infection (40.7 vs 14.8%, p < 0.01) were all significantly higher among patients undergoing deep LND. There was no significant difference noted in overall survival between the study groups when adjusting for stage and age (HR 1.08, p = 0.84). Conclusion. Superficial inguinal LND had no significant difference in rate of recurrence or overall survival when compared to deep inguinal LND in patients with vulvar SCC. Those who received a deep LND had a signif-icant increase in overall morbidity, including lymphedema, readmission, and infection. For patients who cannot undergo or fail sentinel lymph node mapping, a superficial inguinal lymph node dissection may have similar out-comes in recurrence and overall survival with a reduction in overall morbidity as compared to a complete, or deep, lymph node dissection.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - On the model-assisted regression estimators using remotely sensed auxiliary data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The model-assisted difference and regression estimators are increasingly used with forest inventory and remotely sensed data to increase the precision of estimates of inventory parameters. Although these estimators date back at least 50 years and appear in multiple current sampling textbooks, the associated terminology is inconsistently defined, even among the prominent authorities. Further, two of the most prominent statistical sampling textbooks, Cochran (1977) and Sa spacing diaeresis rndal et al. (1992), use considerably different notation.The study focused on three objectives: (1) to formulate consistent and operationally useful definitions via a synthesis of the literature, (2) to construct a bridge between the more complex Sa spacing diaeresis rndal et al. (1992) notation and the more commonly used Cochran (1977) notation, and (3) to assess sample size, model form and g-weight effects on the unbiasedness of the regression estimators of both the population mean and the variance of its estimate.The data analyses entailed Monte Carlo simulations using an artificial population constructed using inventory and airborne laser scanning data and both across- and within-dataset analyses for 11 inventory datasets representing six countries on four continents. The analyses focused on assessing the unbiasedness of the regression estimators of both the mean and variance, the role of the g-weights on the unbiasedness of the variance estimator, and differences for linear versus nonlinear models. Key terminological distinctions were that the generalized estimators accommodate unequal probability sampling and that the difference estimator of the mean is unbiased whereas the regression estimator of the mean is only asymptotically unbiased, meaning it only approaches unbiasedness as the sample size increases.The key analytical conclusions were threefold: (1) the regression variance estimator was confirmed as asymptotically unbiased, (2) the form of the regression variance estimator that incorporated the g-weights was more accurate, and (3) the regression variance estimator was more accurate for linear models than for nonlinear models.

TI  - Performance evaluation of the CDN1 altimetry Cal/Val transponder to internal and external constituents of uncertainty
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A microwave range transponder has been operating at the CDN1 Cal/Val site on the mountains of Crete for about 6 years, to cal-ibrate international satellite radar altimeters in the Ku-band. This transponder is part of the European Space Agency Permanent Facility for Altimetry Calibration, and has been producing a continuous time series of range biases for Sentinel-3A, Sentinel-3B, Jason-2, Jason-3 and CryoSat-2 since 2015. As of 18-Dec-2020, the CDN1 transponder has allowed calibration of the new operational altimeter of Sentinel-6 MF satellite as it flies in tandem with Jason-3. This work investigates range biases derived from the long time series of Jason-3 (and subsequently that of Sentinel-6 MF since both follow the same orbit) and tries to isolate systematic and random con-stituents in the produced calibration results of the transponder. Systematic components in the dispersion of transponder biases are iden-tified as of internal origin, coming from irregularities in the transponder instrument itself and its setting, and of external cause arising from the altimeter, satellite orbit, Earth's position in space, geodynamic effects and others. Draconic harmonics, principally the 58-day period, play a significant role in the transponder results and create cyclic trends of maximum amplitude of 17 mm at times in the cal-ibration results. The attitude of the satellite body as it changes for solar panel orientation contributes an offset of about 7 mm when yaw rotation is off its central position, and the atmospheric, water mass and non-tidal ocean loadings are responsible for an annual sys-tematic signal of 10 mm. At the time of writing, all other constituents of uncertainty seem random in nature and not significantly influ-ential, although humidity requires further investigation in relation to the final transponder calibration results.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - The mosquito vectors that sustained malaria transmission during the Magude project despite the combined deployment of indoor residual spraying, insecticide-treated nets and mass-drug administration
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The "Magude project" aimed but failed to interrupt local malaria transmission in Magude district, southern Mozambique, by using a comprehensive package of interventions, including indoor residual spraying (IRS), pyrethroid-only long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) and mass-drug administration (MDA). Here we present detailed information on the vector species that sustained malaria transmission, their association with malaria incidence and behaviors, and their amenability to the implemented control interventions. Mosquitoes were collected monthly between May 2015 and October 2017 in six sentinel sites in Magude district, using CDC light traps both indoors and outdoors. Anopheles arabiensis was the main vector during the project, while An. funestus s.s., An. merus, An. parensis and An. squamosus likely played a secondary role. The latter two species have never previously been found positive for Plasmodium falciparum in southern Mozambique. The intervention package successfully reduced vector sporozoite rates in all species throughout the project. IRS was effective in controlling An. funestus s.s. and An. parensis, which virtually disappeared after its first implementation, but less effective at controlling An. arabiensis. Despite suboptimal use, LLINs likely provided significant protection against An. arabiensis and An. merus that sought their host largely indoors when people where in bed. Adding IRS on top of LLINs and MDA likely added value to the control of malaria vectors during the Magude project. Future malaria elimination attempts in the area could benefit from i) increasing the use of LLINs, ii) using longer-lasting IRS products to counteract the increase in vector densities observed towards the end of the high transmission season, and iii) a higher coverage with MDA to reduce the likelihood of human infection. However, additional interventions targeting vectors that survive IRS and LLINs by biting outdoors or indoors before people go to bed, will be likely needed to achieve local malaria elimination.

TI  - Debris-cover impact on glacier melting in the Upper Indus Basin
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Out of 4530 glaciers covering similar to 4770 km(2) in the Upper Indus Basin, viz., Chenab, Zanaskar and Suru sub-basins, we selected topographically and morphologically homogeneous set of 98 glaciers; 56 debris-covered and 42 clean to assess the impact of debris-cover on glacier melting. Satellite data analysis from 2000 to 2017 showed that the debris-covered glaciers have melted slower (2.49 +/- 0.05%; 0.15%a(-1)) than the clean glaciers (4.07 +/- 0.03%; 0.24%a(-1)). The intra-basin analysis revealed that clean and debris-covered glaciers in the Chenab have melted 2.34 +/- 0.17% and 1.1 +/- 0.30% (0.14%a(-1) and 0.06%a(-1)) and retreated 8.82 +/- 2.67ma(-1) and 5.7 +/- 2.67ma(-1) respectively. Similarly, clean and debris-covered glaciers in the Zanaskar have melted at similar rates of 4.58 +/- 0.07% and 4.55 +/- 0.21% (0.27%a(-1) and 0.25%a(-1)) and retreated 10.0 +/- 2.67ma(-1) and 8.4 +/- 2.67ma(-1) respectively. Clean and debris-covered glaciers in the Suru have melted 5.56 +/- 0.09% and 4.53 +/- 0.14% (0.33%a(-1) and 0.27%a(-1)) and retreated 9.6 +/- 2.67ma(-1) and 7.0 +/- 2.67ma(-1) respectively. Extensive debris-cover of similar to 32.3% modulates glacier loss in the Chenab and sparse debris-cover of 11.4% and 6.4% in the Suru and Zanaskar enhances the melting of the debris-covered glaciers. Overall, debris-covered glaciers melted slower than the clean glaciers, with inter- and intra-basin variations, suggesting that debris-cover plays a complex but significant role in modulating glacier melting under climate change.

TI  - Arctic shrub expansion revealed by Landsat-derived multitemporal vegetation cover fractions in the Western Canadian Arctic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Warming induced shifts in tundra vegetation composition and structure, including circumpolar expansion of shrubs, modifies ecosystem structure and functioning with potentially global consequences due to feedback mechanisms between vegetation and climate. Satellite-derived vegetation indices indicate widespread greening of the surface, often associated with regional evidence of shrub expansion obtained from long-term ecological monitoring and repeated orthophotos. However, explicitly quantifying shrub expansion across large scales using satellite observations requires characterising the fine-scale mosaic of Arctic vegetation types beyond index-based approaches. Although previous studies have illustrated the potential of estimating fractional cover of various Plant Functional Types (PFTs) from satellite imagery, limited availability of reference data across space and time has constrained deriving fraction cover time series capable of detecting shrub expansion. We applied regressionbased unmixing using synthetic training data to build multitemporal machine learning models in order to estimate fractional cover of shrubs and other surface components in the Mackenzie Delta Region for six time intervals between 1984 and 2020. We trained Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) models using Landsat-derived spectral-temporal-metrics and synthetic training data generated from pure class spectra obtained directly from the imagery. Independent validation using very-high-resolution imagery suggested that KRR outperforms RFR, estimating shrub cover with a MAE of 10.6% and remaining surface components with MAEs between 3.0 and 11.2%. Canopy-forming shrubs were well modelled across all cover densities, coniferous tree cover tended to be overestimated and differentiating between herbaceous and lichen cover was challenging. Shrub cover expanded by on average + 2.2% per decade for the entire study area and + 4.2% per decade within the low Arctic tundra, while relative changes were strongest in the northernmost regions. In conjunction with shrub expansion, we observed herbaceous plant and lichen cover decline. Our results corroborate the perception of the replacement and homogenisation of Arctic vegetation communities facilitated by the competitive advantage of shrub species under a warming climate. The proposed method allows for multidecadal quantitative estimates of fractional cover at 30 m resolution, initiating new opportunities for mapping past and present fractional cover of tundra PFTs and can help advance our understanding of Arctic shrub expansion within the vast and heterogeneous tundra biome.

TI  - Implementation of Remote-Sensing Data Processing Platform Based on Computable Storage
T2  - MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous researches on accelerating remote sensing data processing are based on traditional von Neumann architecture, which separates storage and computation. Under the architecture, data must be obtained from the storage device first and then transmitted to Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) through the system bus. The power consumption caused by the data handling is huge, even exceeding the energy consumption required for data processing. In order to reduce the migration of remote sensing data and alleviate the problems of storage wall and power wall under von Neumann architecture, we design a remote sensing data processing platform based on the system architecture of computable storage, which uses Solid-State Disk (SSD) with computing capability to process the remote sensing data and realize accelerated remote sensing data processing. Based on this platform, applications related to remote sensing data processing such as compression, target detection, and image classification are deployed in SSD to improve the information acquisition rate in remote sensing data. Experimental results show that after compression being offloaded to SSD computing performance is improved by 2.27 times compared with the host CPU. Compared with the host GPU, the target detection speed is improved by 6.25% and the power consumption is reduced by 66.7%. Compared with the host, the detection speed of remote sensing image classification is improved by 78.8%, the power consumption is reduced by 70%, achieving the expected classification effect. The Remote Sensing data Processing Platform based on Computable Storage (CSRSPP) distributes various computing tasks to the SSD for execution, which not only improves the processing speed of computing tasks, but also greatly reduces the power consumption of the platform.

TI  - Detection of degraded forests in Guinea, West Africa, based on Sentinel-2 time series by inclusion of moisture-related spectral indices and neighbourhood effect
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Unlike deforestation, forest degradation implies a change in forest structure, with no modification in land use; thus, it is subtle and less visible than deforestation. Moreover, forest degradation is a major concern, as the potential for carbon sequestration is reduced. Degradation is related to location, anthropogenic drivers, climate, and forest types, and there is no unique detection methodology to map this phenomenon on a global scale. This study proposes a procedure for detecting degraded forests using Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral imagery in Guinea, West Africa, and demonstrates that consideration of context improves degraded forest detection. In Guinea, the primary degradation process is selective logging in the massif forest, in addition to forest fragmentation caused by land use change. Monitoring forest degradation using remote sensing methods usually requires significant overhead in terms of photo-interpretation expertise. We proposed an approach to monitoring degradation through a semi-automated classification procedure with minimum photo-interpretation costs. First, the radio-metric values of the Sentinel-2 data were explored using a photo-interpreted reference map and ground obser-vations carried out with a local forester. Many of the ground observations found that forests considered as intact in the photo-interpreted reference map were degraded. This suggests photo-interpretation can be affected when investing in a single-date image. Our results showed that radiometric moisture-related indices (canopy water content [CWC], moisture stress index [MSI]), associated with leaf area index (LAI) retrieved from S2 data, were strongly related to the degree of degradation. Second, we improved the mapping of degraded forests through photo-interpretation of S2 data. Third, classification methodologies involving LAI, MSI, and CWC were estab-lished, and the results were compared with the improved photo-interpreted map. Two types of classification were compared: standard pixel-based classification and a hybrid method of classification that took contextual infor-mation into account by including neighbour pixel values in the algorithm to consider the pixel context, similar to the photo-interpretation methods. The inclusion of neighbour pixels in the semi-automated classification process led to a substantial improvement in the results. When contextual information was included, photo-interpretation of 1.6% of the latest year's data was sufficient to reach an overall accuracy above 85% requiring no use of past reference maps. Our method strongly supports the photo-interpretation procedure for less time-consuming and expensive map production, offering a significant foundation for degraded forest delineation in regions under similar conditions of canopy opening.

TI  - Impact of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption on the changes observed over the Indian near-equatorial ionosphere
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The response of the Tonga volcanic eruption on the ionospheric F-region over the near-equatorial sector has been studied using the 205 MHz VHF radar at Cochin, Kerala, India. The Tonga eruption, a massive underwater volcanic event that occurred at Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai in the Pacific Ocean, started on 14th December 2021 and ended with a giant explosion on 15th January 2022. The inter-nal gravity waves (IGWs) generated due to the eruption reverberated over the globe. The effect reached the ionosphere, creating spread-F irregularities. The activity was observed with the help of the 205 MHz VHF radar and other supporting instruments such as automatic weather station (AWS), Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver, and Swarm Charlie (Swarm C) satellite. Enhanced surface pressure of 2 hPa was recorded at Cochin and adjoining areas due to the direct (i.e., wave along the shorter great circle path) gravity wave (GW) on 15th January. The shorter great circle path wave required 10 h 50 min to reach the Indian near-equatorial sector whereas, its antipodal counterpart wave (wave along the longer great circle path) reached Kerala on 16th January first as enhanced (0.54 hPa) and subsequently as reduced (0.8 hPa) surface pressure fluctuations. After the transit of IGWs on 15th January, a bottom-side F-region irreg-ularity echo with a plume-like structure lasting for -4.5 h occurred between 276 km and 550 km. Multi-constellation (GPS, GLONASS, and GALILEO) observations and Swarm C satellite data over the Indian equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) sector showed quasi -periodic oscillations in the total electron content (TEC) and amplitude scintillations resulting from the IGWs of Tonga explosion.

TI  - Prevalence and risk assessment of microplastics in the Nile Delta estuaries: "The Plastic Nile" revisited
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent research is directed toward studying plastic pollution in rivers, and estuaries due to the importance of freshwa-ter bodies in all aspects of life. The river deltas and estuaries are interesting for studying the flux of plastics into the oceans. The Nile River has been identified as a hot spot of plastic litter flux in the eastern Mediterranean basin. In addition, it was nicknamed "Plastic Nile", yet this major river is largely unexplored with a lack of field measurements and adequate surveys. The current study was based on bridging this scientific gap. Three trips were conducted, cover-ing 30 km in the Rosetta branch and 23 km in the Damietta branch, during the high water level in summer 2021, and 10 km off the inlet of Lake Burullus, in spring 2021. Microplastics in surface water ranged from 761 +/- 319 to 1718 +/- 1008 MPs/m3, and from 167 +/- 137 to 1630 +/- 1303 MPs/kg of dry sediments. Land use/ land cover mapping using Sentinel-2 images showed several sources of pollution that contribute to plastic contamination in the study area. Ther-mal analysis indicated seven plastic polymers; including, PE, PP, PET, PEVA, and PTFE, using discarded plastic prod-ucts as reference materials. Microplastics were composed of colored and glossy fragments of sizes <500 mu m, originating from land-based sources. Pollution load, polymer risk assessment, and ecological risk indices were calculated. Based on field observations macro-plastics were retained within the extensive network of infrastructure and dam systems. 80-106 billion MPs/year were estimated to flux from the Nile estuaries into the Mediterranean Sea. The current situation urges the development of binding plans to reduce plastic waste in the Nile Delta, as well as setting environ-mental monitoring points along the Deltaic coast.

TI  - Multitemporal glacier inventory revealing four decades of glacier changes in the Ladakh region
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal inventories of glacierised regions provide an improved understanding of water resource availability. In this study, we present a Landsat-based multi-temporal inventory of glaciers in four Upper Indus sub-basins and three internal drainage basins in the Ladakh region for the years 1977, 1994, 2009 and 2019. The study records data on 2257 glaciers (of individual size > 0.5 km(2)) covering an area of similar to 7923 +/- 106 km(2) which is equivalent to similar to 30 % of the total glacier population and similar to 89 % of the total glacierised area of the region. Glacier area ranged between 0.5 +/- 0.02 and 862 +/- 16 km(2), while glacier length ranged between 0.4 +/- 0.02 and 73 +/- 0.54 km. Shayok Basin has the largest glacierised area and glacier population, while Tsokar has the least. Results show that the highest concentration of glaciers is found in the higher elevation zones, between 5000 and 6000 m a.s.l., with most of the glaciers facing towards the NW-NE quadrant. The error assessment shows that the uncertainty, based on the buffer-based approach, ranges between 2.6 % and 5.1 % for glacier area, and 1.5 % and 2.6 % for glacier length with a mean uncertainty of 3.2 % and 1.8 %, respectively. This multitemporal inventory is in good agreement with previous studies undertaken in parts of the Ladakh region. The new glacier database for the Ladakh region will be valuable for policy-making bodies, and future glaciological and hydrological studies. The data can be viewed and downloaded from PANGAEA, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.940994 (Soheb et al., 2022).

TI  - Changes in students' knowledge, values, worldview, and willingness to take mitigative climate action after attending a course on holistic climate change education
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Though the need for holistic climate change education has been realized around the world, there is a lack of studies that examine the multidimensional impact of climate change education in higher education. To amend for this gap in literature, this paper uses a pre-and post-questionnaire (N = 245) to examine how students' knowledge, values, worldview and willingness to take mitigative climate actions change during a course on climate change. Though the course was designed to be multidisciplinary and holistic, the results show that the course had limited impact. First, the pre-post tests showed a significant increase in science knowledge, but knowledge on mitigative actions remained unchanged despite related course assignments. Second, though participants' worldview seemed to change or strengthen during the course, minimal changes were seen in students' willingness to take mitigative actions. However, an increase in biospheric values-a strong predictor of pro -environmental behavior -was seen in some segments of participants, potentially predicting a lower carbon footprint for those students in the future. Furthermore, the findings suggest that during the course, individuals found new, environmentally friendly ways to address their hedonic pleasures, also potentially having long-term positive effects. Some differences in gender and field of study were noted. Implications of the findings are dis-cussed in relation to planning and implementing holistic climate change education.

TI  - A prospective randomized trial of standard versus multimedia-supplemented counseling in patients undergoing endometrial cancer staging surgery
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. A patient's understanding of surgery is often limited, especially in the setting of complex oncologic procedures. The use of supplemental materials can improve patients' knowledge of their procedure and satisfac-tion with decision making. We sought to determine if a multimedia-supplemented approach in patients under-going robotic endometrial cancer staging improves satisfaction with preoperative counseling. Secondary objectives were patient comprehension, physician satisfaction, and visit length.Methods. From 2018 to 2019, patients were randomized to standard physician education (SPE) or multimedia-based education (MBE), which included watching two novel videos followed by focused physician counseling. Basic demographic information was collected. Patient satisfaction was assessed using the Client Sat-isfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ-8, a validated satisfaction survey, scored 8-32) and a global satisfaction score (GGS, 10-point scale). Physician satisfaction was assessed using a GGS. Comprehension was assessed with a study-specific 9-question survey at three time points. t-tests and linear mixed models were used to compare groups.Results. Of the 75 patients included in the analysis, the majority were white (70%), 50-70 years old (72%), and had at least some college education (74%). The MBE group reported higher satisfaction on the CSQ-8 (31.69 vs 30.69, p < 0.01) and global satisfaction score (9.95 vs 9.74, p = 0.04). There was no difference in comprehension scores over time (p = 0.84) or between groups (p = 0.23). Visit lengths were significantly longer in the MBE group (90.36 vs 80.46 min, p = 0.04).Conclusions. Patients had high satisfaction and comprehension with both SPE and MBE. Multimedia education may be implemented in preoperative counseling based on provider preference and consideration should be made for further study of satisfaction, both patient and physician, and visit length after the initial implementation period.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Remote sensing of broad-scale controls on large river anabranching
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - River patterns reflect complex geomorphological processes and affect ecosystems and human development along floodplains. Physical controls on anabranching development have been studied primarily at local scales on relatively small rivers (i.e., discharge <1000 m3 s-1). However, there has been little systematic quantification of river anabranching (development of stable multiple channels) for large rivers globally. Here, we use remote sensing, cloud computing, and geospatial analysis to explore the importance of water surface slope, floodplain topography, sediment supply, substrate lithology, and permafrost to anabranching throughout 20 of the world's largest river basins. We use Landsat-derived surface water extent to compute an anabranching index (Ai) for-1 M km of river reaches, and compare it with global datasets of water surface slope, available floodplain extent, substrate lithology, and permafrost. We find that-49 +/- 19% of large-river mainstems are anabranching, ranging from at least-17% (Mekong) to as much as-84% (Ob'). At the basin scale, anabranching channels comprise at least-17% (Yenisey) to as much as-55% (Kolyma) of all Landsat-observable river reaches, with a mean global value of 35 +/- 11%. Anabranching channel patterns are most commonly associated with low water surface slope (normalized slope < 0.2; absolute slope < 0.2 m km-1) accompanying wide floodplains (normalized floodplain width > 0.6; absolute width > 42 km). Cross-sectionally averaged channel width increases in the most intensely anabranching reaches, suggesting net sediment storage due to reduced stream power. Unconsolidated sedi-mentary substrates promote both the prevalence and intensity of anabranching, whereas the presence of permafrost enhances intensity only. Overall, our results identify pervasive channel anabranching and some important control mechanisms throughout the world's large river basins, with strong implications for satellite -based discharge retrievals. We conclude that global analyses afforded by remote sensing and cloud computing offer additional, complementary approaches to traditional field-based approaches for understanding large river geomorphic processes and channel forms.

TI  - URE and URA for predicted LEO satellite orbits at different altitudes
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites have been frequently discussed for their benefits in positioning and navigation services as an augmentation to the global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs). Similar to the positioning concept based on ranging to GNSS satellites, precise positioning of single-receiver users needs high-accuracy orbits and clocks of LEO satellites as a pre-condition. For real-time users, high prediction accuracies of these orbits at different latencies are needed. Unlike the satellite clocks, the GNSS orbits can be typically predicted for hours with high accuracy. LEO satellites, however, face more complicated perturbing dynamic terms due to their low altitudes. Therefore, the prediction accuracy and integrity of their orbits need to be addressed. In this study, using real data of three test LEO satellites GRACE C, Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-3B of different altitudes, various reduced-dynamic prediction strategies are assessed, with the appropriate methods selected for different prediction times up to 6 h. The global-averaged orbital user range errors (OUREs) are shown to be altitude-related. For the 700-800 km Sentinel satellites and 500 km GRACE satellite, the RMS of the OUREs is at sub-dm and dm-level for the prediction time of 1 h, respectively, and around 0.2 m and 0.6 m at the prediction time of 6 h, respec-tively. For integrity purposes, the worst-location OURE are calculated for the predicted orbits using a proposed algorithm considering the Earth as an Ellipsoid, not a sphere as usually done for the GNSS satellites. The orbital user range accuracy (OURA) is then evaluated for different prediction periods, having a time-dependent model proposed to compute the overbounding OURA at any prediction time within 6 h. With an integrity risk of 10-5, using hourly quadratic polynomials as the time-dependent model, the overbounding OURA is around 0.1 m at the prediction of 1 h, and at the sub-meter level for the prediction of 6 h for the Sentinel satellites.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Automatic detection of suspected sewage discharge from coastal outfalls based on Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial pollution has a great impact on the coastal ecological environment, and widely distributed coastal outfalls act as the final gate through which pollutants flow into rivers and oceans. Thus, effectively monitoring the water qual-ity of coastal outfalls is the key to protecting the ecological environment. Satellite remote sensing provides an attractive way to monitor sewage discharge. Selecting the coastal areas of Zhejiang Province, China, as an example, this study proposes an innovative method for automatically detecting suspected sewage discharge from coastal outfalls based on high spatial resolution satellite imageries from Sentinel-2. According to the accumulated in situ observations, we established a training dataset of water spectra covering various optical water types from satellite-retrieved remote sensing reflectance (Rrs). Based on the clustering results from unsupervised classification and different spectral indices, a random forest (RF) classification model was established for the optical water type classification and detection of suspected sewage. The final classification covers 14 optical water types, with type 12 and type 14 corresponding to the high eutrophication water type and suspected sewage water type, respectively. The classification result of model training datasets exhibited high accuracy with only one misclassified sample. This model was evaluated by historical sewage discharge events that were verified by on-site observations and demonstrated that it could successfully recog-nize sewage discharge from coastal outfalls. In addition, this model has been operationally applied to automatically detect suspected sewage discharge in the coastal area of Zhejiang Province, China, and shows broad application value for coastal pollution supervision, management, and source analysis.

TI  - Seasonal differences in the dominant factors of surface urban heat islands along the urban-rural gradient
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has been accelerating; hence the effect of urban heat island (UHI) has increased. There has been extensive research on spatiotemporal UHI changes and drivers, however, data on the dominant seasonal factors of UHIs and the differences along urban-rural gradients remain limited. Based on Luojia-1A, Landsat 8, and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, we assessed the seasonal differences in surface UHI (SUHI), normalized differences in vegetation index (NDVI), built-up index (NDBI), and water index (NDWI) and their relationships in the Dalian City, Northeast China. We found that in the urban built-up area, the mean SUHI intensity (SUHII) decreased from that in summer (2.74?) > autumn (1.65?) > winter (0.28?) > spring (-0.79?). SUHII was more strongly affected by NDWI and NDBI than NDVI, and NDBI and NDWI showed positive and negative correlations with SUHII in different seasons, while NDVI and SUHII were positively correlated in spring and negatively correlated in the other seasons. When analyzing the dominant factors of SUHII, the importance results showed that, in spring, NDBI > NDVI > NDWI, in autumn, NDVI > NDWI > NDBI, in summer and winter, NDWI > NDVI > NDBI. In addition, SUHII changed the most in summer along the urban-rural gradient, decreasing from 2.74? to -2.74?. Among these indicators, except for spring NDVI which increased from 0.09 to 0.59 with distance from built-up areas, there was minimal change in NDVI, NDBI, and NDWI along the urban-rural gradient in other seasons (i.e., all were within 0.2). In this study, the difference analysis of SUHI and remote sensing indices along the urban-rural gradient can help to facilitate the rational layout of cities.

TI  - An ERA5 global climatology of tropical cyclone size asymmetry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The size of tropical cyclone (TC), defined as the radius of gale-force (34-kt) 10-m winds (R34) from a TC centre, is often asymmetric but received limited attention. Understanding the asymmetry of TC size is particularly essential to enhance the applicability, predictability, and preparedness for the parties in the coastal regions. In this study, the ERA5 reanalysis data are first validated by the QuikSCAT satellite data. Results demonstrate that the radius of ERA5 32-kt 10-m winds estimates best R34 in the QuikSCAT satellite data with a promising linear relationship (r = .75). A 41-year (1979-2019) homogeneous ERA5 global climatology of TC size asymmetry is hence established based on this linear regression model. Both the temporal and spatial characteristics of the TC size asymmetry are investigated and discussed. This study lays the important groundwork for future sophisticated research on TC size.

TI  - Strong influence of trees outside forest in regulating microclimate of intensively modified Afromontane landscapes
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is expected to have detrimental consequences on fragile ecosystems, threatening biodiversity, as well as food security of millions of people. Trees are likely to play a central role in mitigating these impacts. The microclimatic conditions below tree canopies usually differ substantially from the ambient macroclimate as vegetation can buffer temperature changes and variability. Trees cool down their surroundings through several biophysical mechanisms, and the cooling benefits occur also with trees outside forest. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of canopy cover on microclimate in an intensively modified Afromontane landscape in Taita Taveta, Kenya. We studied temperatures recorded by 19 microclimate sensors under different canopy covers, as well as land surface temperature (LST) estimated by Landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor. We combined the temperature records with high-resolution airborne laser scanning data to untangle the combined effects of topography and canopy cover on microclimate. We developed four multivariate regression models to study the joint impacts of topography and canopy cover on LST. The results showed a negative linear relationship between canopy cover percentage and daytime mean (R-2 = 0.65) and maximum (R-2 = 0.75) temperatures. Any increase in canopy cover contributed to reducing temperatures. The average difference between 0 % and 100 % canopy cover sites was 5.2 degrees C in mean temperatures and 10.2 degrees C in maximum temperatures. Canopy cover (CC) reduced LST on average by 0.05 degrees C per percent CC. The influence of canopy cover on microclimate was shown to vary strongly with elevation and ambient temperatures. These results demonstrate that trees have a substantial effect on microclimate, but the effect is dependent on macroclimate, highlighting the importance of maintaining tree cover particularly in warmer conditions. Hence, we demonstrate that trees outside forests can increase climate change resilience in fragmented landscapes, having strong potential for regulating regional and local temperatures.

TI  - Illiberal economies: ambivalence and critique in an alternative investment scheme
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL INSTITUTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines practices of critique and ambivalence among participants in a controversial Latin American investment scheme called the telares de la abundancia ('looms of abundance'). While the dominant discourses about the telares construe them as predatory, participants understand themselves as knowing subjects who reject a worldview based on economic rationality and utility in favour of one based on emotional connectedness. While this emphasis on emotional connection is not unique to the telares, what is remarkable is the central role that doubt plays: the tejedoras (weavers), as they call themselves, assert themselves quite explicitly not only as critical and knowing subjects, but also as profoundly ambivalent subjects who insist upon the incommensurability of emotional connection and financial gain even as they simultaneously pursue both. This article explores how tejedoras confront and deal with their doubts by cultivating practices of ambivalence. In so doing, it foregrounds the multiplicity of people's allegiances and intuitions in contexts marked by competing epistemologies, as is the case not only in Latin America but also in much of the world where illiberalism has become a central concern. Towards that end, the article develops the concept of 'illiberal economies' - spaces in which participants simultaneously pursue contradictory and mutually exclusive forms of value - as a way of shedding light on broader political and economic dynamics that can seem simultaneously (and paradoxically) nonsensical and irrational, on the one hand, and manipulative and instrumental, on the other. In so doing, the article foregrounds the ambivalent dynamics that are at the heart of illiberal economies in order to open up analytic possibilities for grappling with illiberalism more broadly.

TI  - Automatic monitoring of surface water dynamics using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data with Google Earth Engine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamic monitoring of floods is important for water resource management and disaster prevention. Obtaining multitemporal surface water distribution maps using remote sensing technology can help in elucidating the trends in water expansion so that measures can be quickly formulated. Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observation data are particularly suitable for this task because of their high spatial resolution and short revisit cycle, as well as its cloud-penetration ability. However, quickly and accurately mapping floods from a large number of SAR images remains challenging because of the enormous pressure on data acquisition and processing. Hence, in this study, we designed a new automatic SAR image flood mapping method based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform, which is an improvement over the Otsu method, and solves the problem of a higher segmentation threshold caused by images that do not meet the bimodal distribution hypothesis. In addition, to eliminate the omissions caused by salt-and-pepper noise and the misclassification caused mainly by low-backscattering-intensity vegetation and mountain shadows, we constructed an algorithm based on topological relationships and a DSM (Digital Surface Model) local search algorithm. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 96.213% and 98.611% and F1 scores of 0.87254 and 0.89298 for plains and mountainous terrain, respectively. This method uses powerful computing resources and abundant datasets provided by the GEE cloud platform, and can be used for large-scale, long-term, and dynamic flood monitoring.

TI  - Patients with initial nodal involvement due to breast cancer who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Combined sentinel node-radioguided surgery of the pathological node
T2  - REVISTA ESPANOLA DE MEDICINA NUCLEAR E IMAGEN MOLECULAR
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To study the feasibility and usefulness of the combined technique selective sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)-radioguided biopsy of the pathological lymph node in patients with breast cancer and axillary involvement undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).Material and methods: Prospective diagnostic study of 30 patients with breast cancer and cN1 axillary staging with NACT indication. Before NACT, the biopsied node was marked with a clip (MBN). After NACT an ultrasound was performed and in case of good response a SLNB (Tc-99m-nanocolloids) plus targeted axillary dissection MBN pathologic node radioguided biopsy (Tc-99m-albumin macroaggregates) was performed. Axillary lymph node dissection was performed if SLNB and/or MBN were positive for tumor cells. The localization-removal rate of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) and MBN were evaluated. False-negative rate and positive predictive value of SLNB alone were also evaluated.Results: Thirty patients were included in the study. SLN could be detected in all patients while MBN was successfully removed in 27 (90%). The SLN coincided with MBN in 15 patients (50%). In 12 patients SLNB was negative while MBN positive, leading to a FNR of 44,4% for SLNB alone. We found a positive predictive value of 37% for the SLNB. In 5 patients (18,5%) both SLNB and MBN were negative, avoiding axillary lymph node dissection.Conclusions: SLNB-MBN radioguided biopsy combined technique is a useful and accessible procedure for accurate axillary restaging after NACT, avoiding the high rate of false-negative rate of SLNB alone in this group of patients and avoiding a great number of axillary lymph node dissection.

AB  - Purpose This study aimed to evaluate whether axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be omitted in patients with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) who received total mastectomy (TM). Methods Consecutive breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive SLNs were retrospectively reviewed from a multi-institutional database. Patients were divided into sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) group and ALND group. Administration of adjuvant chemotherapy and survival were compared between groups. To further verify the results, a meta-analysis was also conducted. Results Among the 1161 enrolled patients, 893 (76.9%) received ALND and 268 (23.1%) underwent SLNB alone. Administration of chemotherapy was comparable between the two groups (91.1% vs. 90.6%, P = 0.798), which was consistent in TM (P = 0.638) and BCS cohort (P = 0.576). After a median follow-up of 36 months, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in recurrence-free survival (P = 0.583) regardless of surgery of breast. During further meta-analysis, 13 out of 4733 relative studies reported the association of axillary surgery and disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) in 1-2 positive SLNs patients. Pooled analysis showed no difference in adjusted DFS (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70-1.02) or OS (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93-1.11) between SLNB and ALND groups. Survival benefit of ALND remained non-significant after restricting the analysis in four studies with patients only receiving BCS, or in three studies with patients only receiving TM. Conclusion Further ALND does not impact adjuvant chemotherapy administration or disease outcome in breast cancer patients with 1-2 positive SLNs treated with TM.

TI  - CatLC: Catalonia Multiresolution Land Cover Dataset
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The availability of large annotated image datasets represented one of the tipping points in the progress of object recognition in the realm of natural images, but other important visual spaces are still lacking this asset. In the case of remote sensing, only a few richly annotated datasets covering small areas are available. In this paper, we present the Catalonia Multiresolution Land Cover Dataset (CatLC), a remote sensing dataset corresponding to a mid-size geographical area which has been carefully annotated with a large variety of land cover classes. The dataset includes pre-processed images from the Cartographic and Geological Institute of Catalonia (ICGC) (https://www.icgc.cat/en/Downloads) and the European Space Agency (ESA) (https://scihub.copernicus.eu) catalogs, captured from both aircraft and satellites. Detailed topographic layers inferred from other sensors are also included. CatLC is a multiresolution, multimodal, multitemporal dataset, that can be readily used by the machine learning community to explore new classification techniques for land cover mapping in different scenarios such as area estimation in forest inventories, hydrologic studies involving microclimatic variables or geologic hazards identification and assessment. Moreover, remote sensing data present some specific characteristics that are not shared by natural images and that have been seldom explored. In this vein, CatLC dataset aims to engage with computer vision experts interested in remote sensing and also stimulate new research and development in the field of machine learning.

TI  - Influenza surveillance systems using traditional and alternative sources of data: A scoping review
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: While the World Health Organization's recommendation of syndromic sentinel surveillance for influenza is an efficient method to collect high-quality data, limitations exist. Aligned with the Research Recommendation 1.1.2 of the WHO Public Health Research Agenda for Influenza-to identify reliable complementary influenza surveillance systems which provide real-time estimates of influenza activity- we performed a scoping review to map the extent and nature of published literature on the use of non-traditional sources of syndromic surveillance data for influenza.Methods: We searched three electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) for articles in English, French, and Spanish, published between January 1 2007 and January 28 2022. Studies were included if they directly compared at least one non-traditional with a traditional influenza surveillance system in terms of correlation in activity or timeliness.Findings: We retrieved 823 articles of which 57 were included for analysis. Fifteen articles considered electronic health records (EHR), 11 participatory surveillance, 10 online searches and webpage traffic, seven Twitter, five absenteeism, four telephone health lines, three medication sales, two media reporting, and five looked at other miscellaneous sources of data. Several articles considered more than one nontraditional surveillance method.Conclusion: We identified eight categories and a miscellaneous group of nontraditional influenza surveillance systems with varying levels of evidence on timeliness and correlation to traditional surveillance systems. Analyses of EHR and participatory surveillance systems appeared to have the most agreement on timeliness and correlation to traditional systems. Studies suggested non-traditional surveillance systems as complements rather than replacements to traditional systems.

TI  - Paper 1: a systematic synthesis of narrative therapy treatment components for the treatment of eating disorders
T2  - JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background There are presently a number of eating disorder treatment interventions that have a research-evidence base to support their effectiveness. However, rates of attrition and treatment outcomes demonstrate that there is no one-size fits all for the treatment of eating disorders. Narrative therapy is a promising, but under-researched, intervention for the treatment of eating disorders (EDs). The aim of this study was to conduct a narrative synthesis of the literature to explore the content and use of narrative therapy in the treatment of EDs. Method Data were extracted from 33 eligible included studies following systematic search of five data bases. Data included aims and objectives, sample characteristics, treatment details and components of narrative therapy, which informed the narrative synthesis. The study is reported according to the Preferred Reporting items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results Narrative therapy interventions for EDs consisted of several components including the narrative worldview; unpacking the problem story; finding, thickening the meaning and performance of stories hidden by the problem story; and safety considerations. A notable proportion of the extracted articles discussed components of unpacking problem stories, and finding and re-authoring openings (or unique outcomes) that were hidden by problematic stories. Relatively fewer papers discussed the processes by identity shifts were performed or lived out, including in the eating practices of those with a lived ED experience. Furthermore, few papers addressed how therapists established client safety within the narrative framework when working with EDs. Conclusion This narrative synthesis found that narrative practitioners utilise a variety of narrative therapy techniques in working with individuals with a lived ED experience. The current literature has emphasis on specific narrative therapy techniques used in ED treatments, with some aspects of the narrative worldview and safety considerations left undiscussed. Additional research is needed to explore how identity shifts in narrative therapy are performed and lead to measurable behavioural changes, and to consider how safety considerations can be established within the narrative worldview. Plain English summary There are a number of psychological therapies for eating disorders that have research evidence-base. These treatments, however, do not work for everyone as indicated by drop-out rates and eating disorders running a severe and enduring course for some people. Narrative therapy is a therapeutic intervention that has been reported as a promising intervention for people with an eating disorder. The focus of narrative therapy is to engage the person in finding identities hidden by problem-saturated identities and in the performance of these hidden identities. In this review, we have explored the use of narrative therapy for eating disorders to identify what aspects of this therapy are currently being used and which components are less referenced in the literature. Findings from this study support the need for further research into narrative therapy components in the treatment of eating disorders, particularly how hidden identities are performed and safety considerations are integrated into this therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Modeling the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) to study of its relationship with variations in the thermal field and with the indices of land use in the metropolitan area of Granada (Spain)
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding just how the increase in the Earth's Surface Temperature (LST) is related to alterations of the urban climate -Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) or Urban Hotspots (UHS)- and with the deterioration of cities' environmental quality has become a great challenge. Societies worldwide seek actions that might break these trends and improve the quality of life of local inhabitants. In this research, with the help of Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellite images, the evolution of land use/cover (LULC), LST and SUHI were studied over a long period, from 1985 to 2020, in the metropolitan area of the city of Granada (Spain). The aim was to evaluate how these variables, together with the Urban Index (UI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Proportion of Vegetation (PV), have influenced the variability of the UHS and the level of thermal comfort according to the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI). Reported as results, corroborated by statistical analysis, are mean increases in LST (2.2?), SUHI (0.6?), UHS (20.4%), and class 6 of the UTFV (26.2%). NDBI and UI are associated with high variations in LULCs. These have suffered increases in built-up and bare soil coverage, and decreases in water bodies, vegetation and farmland coverage.

TI  - Breast cancer: an up-to-date review and future perspectives
T2  - CANCER COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. The occurrence of breast cancer is associated with many risk factors, including genetic and hereditary predisposition. Breast cancers are highly heterogeneous. Treatment strategies for breast cancer vary by molecular features, including activation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), hormonal receptors (estrogen receptor [ER] and progesterone receptor [PR]), gene mutations (e.g., mutations of breast cancer 1/2 [BRCA1/2] and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha [PIK3CA]) and markers of the immune microenvironment (e.g., tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte [TIL] and programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]). Early-stage breast cancer is considered curable, for which local-regional therapies (surgery and radiotherapy) are the cornerstone, with systemic therapy given before or after surgery when necessary. Preoperative or neoadjuvant therapy, including targeted drugs or immune checkpoint inhibitors, has become the standard of care for most early-stage HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer, followed by risk-adapted post-surgical strategies. For ER-positive early breast cancer, endocrine therapy for 5-10 years is essential. Advanced breast cancer with distant metastases is currently considered incurable. Systemic therapies in this setting include endocrine therapy with targeted agents, such as CDK4/6 inhibitors and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors for hormone receptor-positive disease, anti-HER2 targeted therapy for HER2-positive disease, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and immunotherapy currently for part of triple-negative disease. Innovation technologies of precision medicine may guide individualized treatment escalation or de-escalation in the future. In this review, we summarized the latest scientific information and discussed the future perspectives on breast cancer.

TI  - Environmental Law and the Unsustainability of Sustainable Development: A Tale of Disenchantment and of Hope
T2  - LAW AND CRITIQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article we argue that sustainable development is not a socio-ecologically friendly principle. The principle, which is deeply embedded in environmental law, policymaking and governance, drives environmentally destructive neoliberal economic growth that exploits and degrades the vulnerable living order. Despite seemingly well-meaning intentions behind the emergence of sustainable development, it almost invariably facilitates exploitative economic development activities that exacerbate systemic inequalities and injustices without noticeably protecting all life forms in the Anthropocene. We conclude the article by examining an attempt to construct alternatives to sustainable development through the indigenous onto-epistemology of buen vivir. While no panacea, buen vivir is a worldview that offers the potential to critically rethink how environmental law could re-orientate away from its 'centered', gendered and anthropocentric, neoliberal sustainable development ontology, to a radically different ontology that embraces ecologically sustainable ways of seeing, being, knowing and caring.

TI  - Preclinical feasibility of robot-assisted sentinel lymph node biopsy using multi-modality magnetic and fluorescence guidance in the head and neck
T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a staging procedure dependent on accurate mapping of draining lymphatics via tracers. Robot-assisted SLNB enables access to multiple neck levels with a single incision and intraoperative fluorescence guidance to the SLN. Methods Lymphatic mapping in swine was done using a magnetic tracer and fluorescent dye, injected into the tongue. MRI preoperatively mapped lymphatic spread of the magnetic tracer. Dissection was performed using a da Vinci Xi robot guided by fluorescence-imaging of the dye. Results Robot-assisted SLNB was successfully performed in all animals (n = 5). A novel MRI protocol differentiated SLNs (n = 6) from lower echelon nodes (n = 11) based on flow progression. Fluorescence imaging provided valuable intraoperative guidance and correlated with magnetic-positive nodes. Conclusions This study demonstrates preclinical feasibility of a robot-assisted approach to SLNB using magnetic and fluorescent tracers in the head and neck, enabling both preoperative mapping and intraoperative guidance.

AB  - Clouds and aerosols play a vital role in the Earth's climate. Detecting polar mesospheric clouds, polar stratospheric clouds and aerosols is useful for monitoring climate change and atmospheric chemistry. ACE (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment) satellite data are used to provide an infrared spectral atlas of polar mesospheric clouds, three types of polar stratospheric clouds (nitric acid trihydrate, sulfuric/nitric acid ternary solutions, and ice), cirrus clouds, stratospheric smoke from fires and sulfate aerosols. Most of the example spectra have been modeled using the appropriate optical constants and the calculated extinction of sunlight by the particles.(C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping and Staging Surgery Via Gasless Transvaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery: A Case Report of an Endometrial Cancer Patient and Comorbid Rheumatic Heart Disease
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Unusual or unexpected effect of treatmentBackground: Conventional laparoscopic surgery and transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) both use CO2 pneumoperitoneum to expose the surgical space. However, CO2 pneumoperitoneum is undoubtedly dangerous for patients with rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and can cause cardiopulmonary impairments. Therefore, we selected the sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping strategy to guide the staging surgery via gasless vNOTES for an endometrial cancer (EC)-patient with comorbid RHD. Here, we discuss whether our selected surgical method was safe and feasible for this patient. Case Report: A 43-year-old woman with a history of RHD, severe mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension for more than 30 years received diagnostic curettage for irregular vaginal bleeding for more than 1 month. Pathological examinations revealed the occurrence of highly differentiated intrauterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma. She was admitted to the gynecological ward of our hospital for further surgery. We performed EC staging surgery with SLN mapping via gasless vNOTES and adopted a series of effective measures to solve the intraoperative complications of surgical space exposure. Surgery was successful. The patient recovered well and was discharged 5 days after surgery. She has been followed up in the gynecological clinic for nearly 1 year. At the time of this report, she had good recovery, no recurrence and metastasis, and normal tumor markers. Conclusions: For EC patients with comorbid RHD pathology, application of staging surgery with SLN mapping via gasless vNOTES was shown to be safe and feasible. This approach is expected to be highly effective for patients with contraindications to CO2 pneumoperitoneum laparoscopy.

TI  - Remote sensing image classification based on object-oriented convolutional neural network
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image classification is of great importance for urban development and planning. The need for higher classification accuracy has led to improvements in classification technology. In this research, Landsat 8 images are used as experimental data, and Wuhan, Chengde and Tongchuan are selected as research areas. The best neighborhood window size of the image patch and band combination method are selected based on two sets of comparison experiments. Then, an object-oriented convolutional neural network (OCNN) is used as a classifier. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the OCNN classifier is 6% higher than that of an SVM classifier and 5% higher than that of a convolutional neural network classifier. The graph of the classification results of the OCNN is more continuous than the plots obtained with the other two classifiers, and there are few fragmentations observed for most of the category. The OCNN successfully solves the salt and pepper problem and improves the classification accuracy to some extent, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed object-oriented model.

TI  - Cerrado deforestation threatens regional climate and water availability for agriculture and ecosystems
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado is one of the most biodiverse savannas in the world, yet 46% of its original cover has been cleared to make way for crops and pastures. These extensive land-use transitions (LUTs) are expected to influence regional climate by reducing evapotranspiration (ET), increasing land surface temperature (LST), and ultimately reducing precipitation. Here, we quantify the impacts of LUTs on ET and LST in the Cerrado by combining MODIS satellite data with annual land use and land cover maps from 2006 to 2019. We performed regression analyses to quantify the effects of six common LUTs on ET and LST across the entire gradient of Cerrado landscapes, Results indicate that clearing forests for cropland or pasture increased average LST by similar to 3.5 degrees C and reduced mean annual ET by 44% and 39%, respectively. Transitions from woody savannas to cropland or pasture increased average LST by 1.9 degrees C and reduced mean annual ET by 27% and 21%, respectively. Converting native grasslands to cropland or pasture increased average LST by 0.9 and 0.6 degrees C, respectively. Conversely, grasslandto-pasture transitions increased mean annual ET by 15%. To date, land changes have caused a 10% reduction in water recycled to the atmosphere annually and a 0.9 degrees C increase in average LST across the biome, compared to the historic baseline under native vegetation. Global climate changes from increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations will only exacerbate these effects. Considering potential future scenarios, we found that abandoning deforestation control policies or allowing legal deforestation to continue (at least 28.4 Mha) would further reduce yearly ET (by -9% and -3%, respectively) and increase average LST (by +0.7 and +0.3 degrees C, respectively) by 2050. In contrast, policies encouraging zero deforestation and restoration of the 5.2 Mha of illegally deforested areas would partially offset the warming and drying impacts of land-use change.

TI  - Interpretation of remote sensing and aeromagnetic data to depict the structural framework of the transitional zone between the Igarra Schist belt and Anambra Basin, Nigeria
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution aeromagnetic and Landsat-8 data were utilized for the structural investigation of the Igarra Schist Belt located where the Precambrian crystalline basement is unconformably overlain by the late-Cretaceous Anambra Basin fill. Analysis of the Landsat-8 data exhibits major lineaments that trend in E-W, ENE-WSW, NNW-SSE and N-S directions. Results from the analysis of total field anomaly data using total gradient amplitude and tilt angle of the horizontal gradient also show these same lineament trends. The superimposition of Landsat-8 and aeromagnetic data-derived lineaments resulted in the mapping of the regional lineaments, which provide clues to structurally controlled gold mineralization in the Igarra Schist Belt region. Details mapped from the remote sensing data show surface contacts that correspond to the boundary between the Igarra Schist Belt and Anambra Basin mapped from aeromagnetic data. The source parameter imaging of the aeromagnetic data provides depth estimates of the magnetic basement of the Igarra Schist Belt and Anambra Basin, which varies from 50 to above 650 m. The integration of the remote sensing and aeromagnetic lineaments with the 3-D Euler deconvolution results reveals that the locations of cluster solutions alignment with lineaments are target areas for gold mineralization, which is correlative to gold occurrences in the region.

TI  - Surface solar irradiation retrieval from MSG/SEVIRI based on APOLLO Next Generation and HELIOSAT-4 methods
T2  - METEOROLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the optimum usage of the new APOLLO Next Generation (APOLLO_NG) cloud retrieval scheme in the Heliosat-4 solar surface irradiance retrieval scheme. APOLLO_NG replaces the previously used APOLLO scheme and introduces a probabilistic cloud mask instead of binary cloud masking used previously. A cloud probability threshold of 1 % was found optimal for the usage of the Heliosat-4 cloud scheme. For direct irradiances, the use of an apparent optical depth in optically thin as well as in optically thick, but broken cloud conditions, was investigated. While for thin clouds the cloud optical thickness (COT) modificati n factor as known from literature was conf rmed, a COT modificati n factor of 0.2 for optically thick, but broken clouds was identif ed. Furthermore, an improved calibration of the SEVIRI instrument was implemented. The updated method is applied for MSG SEVIRI observations without any additional bias-correction and validated for Europe and Africa against observations from the BSRN and EnerMENA networks. Special focus is placed on the central European region affected mainly by clouds and the North African region with desert dust aerosols as well as clouds. The hourly SSI showed clear improvements. The relative bias of GHI ranges between -7 and 1.3 % with a mean value of -2.8 %. The relative RMSE of GHI is between 10.3 and 25.5 % and has a mean value of 13.7 %. The relative bias of DIR ranges between -16.6 and 17.8 % and has a mean value of -3.3 %. The relative RMSE of DIR is between 16.7 and 49 % with 29.7 % as mean. For European stations without strong aerosol effects but larger cloud impacts, the average relative GHI and DIR bias is -1.3 % and 3.3 % with mean relative GHI and DIR RMSE of 15.1 % and 30.6 % respectively. The presented method has been implemented into the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Radiation Service v4.

TI  - Sex-biased habitat selection by American marten in the Acadian Forest
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context For wildlife dependent on mature forest living in managed landscapes, habitat loss from land use can outpace habitat recovery from forest regrowth, challenging persistence of habitat specialists. For some species, the effects of habitat loss or fragmentation may also differ between sexes when physiological or behavioral differences influence space use.Objectives We evaluated differences in landscape-scale occurrence, as a function of habitat amount and configuration, between male and female American martens in the heterogeneous, commercial forestlands of northern Maine, USA.Methods Using location data from a long-term (1994-1997) radio-telemetry study, we modeled boundaries of home ranges occupied by resident adults (>1 year) and simulated potential home ranges in unoccupied areas. Landscape metrics of habitat amount and configuration within home ranges, calculated from time-specific maps of suitable habitat derived from Landsat satellite imagery, were used to develop binary logistic regression models that were compared within an information theoretic framework. We extrapolated and tested top performing models in two novel landscapes.Results Habitat amount was most important when predicting female occurrence. For males, which maintained larger home ranges, occurrence was influenced by habitat amount and patchiness (density and shape). Top sex-specific models reliably predicted marten occurrence (1991-1996) in an adjacent forest preserve, but overestimated occurrence, particularly for females, in a more distant (similar to 70 km Northeast) commercial forest in 2007.Conclusions Marten in our study exhibited nonlinear declines in occurrence as suitable habitat declined. Maintaining sufficient habitat to support adult females in particular will be important to the future conservation of this late breeding, area sensitive, habitat specialized species.

TI  - China's poverty assessment and analysis under the framework of the UN SDGs based on multisource remote sensing data
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Poverty has always been a global concern that has restricted human development. The first goal (SDG 1) of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is to eliminate all forms of poverty all over the world. The establishment of a scientific and effective localized SDG 1 evaluation and monitoring method is the key to achieving SDG 1. This paper proposes SDG 1 China district and county-level localization evaluation method based on multi-source remote sensing data for the United Nations Sustainable Development Framework. The temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of China's poverty areas and their SDG 1 evaluation values in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018 have been analyzed. Based on the SDGs global indicator framework, this paper first constructed SDG 1 China's district and county localization indicator system and then extracted multidimensional feature factors from nighttime light images, land cover data, and digital elevation model data. Secondly, we establish SDG 1 China's localized partial least squares estimation model and SDG 1 China's localized machine learning estimation model. Finally, we analyze and verify the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of China's poverty areas and counties and their SDG 1 evaluation values. The results show that SDG 1 China's district and county localization indicator system proposed in this study and SDG 1 China's localized partial least squares estimation model can better reflect the poverty level of China's districts and counties. The estimated model R-2 is 0.65, which can identify 72.77% of China's national poverty counties. From 2012 to 2018, the spatial distribution pattern of SDG evaluation values in China's districts and counties is that the SDG evaluation values gradually increase from western China to eastern China. In addition, the average SDG 1 evaluation value of China's districts and counties increased by 23% from 2012 to 2018. This paper is oriented to the United Nations SDGs framework, explores the SDG 1 localized evaluation method of China's districts and counties based on multisource remote sensing data, and provides a scientific and rapid regional poverty monitoring and evaluation program for the implementation of the 2030 agenda poverty alleviation goals.

TI  - Hemocytes of bivalve mollusks as cellular models in toxicological studies of metals and metal-based nanomaterials
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Understanding the impacts of environmental pollutants on immune systems is indispensable in ecological and health risk assessments due to the significance of normal immunological functions in all living organisms. Bi-valves as sentinel organisms with vital ecological importance are widely distributed in aquatic environments and their innate immune systems are the sensitive targets of environmental pollutants. As the central component of innate immunity, bivalve hemocytes are endowed with specialized endolysosomal systems for particle inter-nalization and metal detoxification. These intrinsic biological features make them a unique cellular model for metal-and nano-immunotoxicology research. In this review, we firstly provided a general overview of bivalve's innate immunity and the classification and immune functions of hemocytes. We then summarized the recent progress on the interactions of metals and nanoparticles with bivalve hemocytes, with emphasis on the involvement of hemocytes in metal regulation and detoxification, the interactions of hemocytes and nano -particles at eco/bio-nano interface and hemocyte-mediated immune responses to the exposure of metals and nanoparticles. Finally, we proposed the key knowledge gaps and future research priorities in deciphering the fundamental biological processes of the interactions of environmental pollutants with the innate immune system of bivalves as well as in developing bivalve hemocytes into a promising cellular model for nano-immuno-safety assessment.

TI  - Deep inspiration breath-hold radiation therapy in left-sided breast cancer patients: a single-institution retrospective dosimetric analysis of organs at risk doses
T2  - STRAHLENTHERAPIE UND ONKOLOGIE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background Radiotherapy can induce cardiac injury in left-sided breast cancer cases. Cardiac-sparing irradiation using the deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique can achieve substantial dose reduction to vulnerable cardiac substructures compared with free breathing (FB). This study evaluated the dosimetric differences between both techniques at a single institution. Methods From 2017 to 2019, 130 patients with left-sided breast cancer underwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS; n = 121, 93.1%) or mastectomy (ME; n = 9, 6.9%) along with axillary lymph node staging (n = 105, 80.8%), followed by adjuvant irradiation in DIBH technique; adjuvant systemic therapy was included if applicable. 106 (81.5%) patients received conventional and 24 (18.5%) hypofractionated irradiation. Additionally, 12 patients received regional nodal irradiation. Computed tomography (CT) scans in FB and DIBH position were performed for all patients. Intrafractional 3D position monitoring of the patient surface in deep inspiration and breath gating was performed using Sentinel and Catalyst HD 3D surface scanning systems (C-RAD, Catalyst, C-RAD AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Individual coaching and determination of breathing amplitude during the radiation planning CT was performed. Three-dimensional treatment planning was performed using standard tangential treatment portals (6 or 18 MV). The delineation of cardiac structures and both lungs was done in both the FB and the DIBH scan. Results All dosimetric parameters for cardiac structures were significantly reduced (p < 0.01 for all). The mean heart dose (Dmean) in the DIBH group was 1.3 Gy (range 0.5-3.6) vs. 2.2 Gy (range 0.9-8.8) in the FB group (p < 0.001). The Dmean for the left ventricle (LV) in DIBH was 1.5 Gy (range 0.6-4.5), as compared to 2.8 Gy (1.1-9.5) with FB (p < 0.001). The parameters for LV (V10 Gy, V15 Gy, V20 Gy, V23 Gy, V25 Gy, V30 Gy) were reduced by about 100% (p < 0.001). The LAD Dmean in the DIBH group was 4.1 Gy (range 1.2-33.3) and 14.3 Gy (range 2.4-37.5) in the FB group (p < 0.001). The median values for LAD such as V15 Gy, V20 Gy, V25 Gy, V30 Gy, and V40 Gy decreased by roughly 100% (p < 0.001). An increasing volume of left lung in the DIBH position resulted in dose sparing of cardiac structures. Conclusion For all ascertained dosimetric parameters, a significant dose reduction could be achieved in DIBH technique.

TI  - Highly bright aggregation-induced emission nanodots for precise photoacoustic/NIR-II fluorescence imaging-guided resection of neuroendocrine neoplasms and sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - BIOMATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the complementary high spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, the dual-modality imaging tech-nique of photoacoustic imaging (PAI)/the second near-infrared window fluorescence imaging (NIR-II FI) holds great promise for the detection of tumor tissues and sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Herein, by developing two aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) (C-NTBD and O-NTBD) with benzodithiadiazole as the electron acceptor, PAI/NIR-II FI was applied to the diagnosis and treatment of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) and their SLNs for the first time. Both AIEgens exhibited good PAI properties as well as intense NIR-II fluores-cence emission. Among them, C-NTBD nanoparticles (NPs) have better PAI and NIR-II FI performance with maximum absorption at 732 nm and emission peak at 1042 nm. In NENs-bearing nude mice model, after suc-cessful preoperative localization of NENs by PAI, NIR-II FI was then used to detect SLNs. Under the NIR-II FI guidance of C-NTBD NPs, an SLN with a diameter of 1 mm located in the chest wall and far away from the primary tumor site was even detected and precisely removed. This dual-modality imaging technology could improve the detection of NENs and the accuracy of intraoperative SLNs dissection, improve patient prognosis, and provide a new strategy for the precise treatment of NENs.

TI  - Evaluation of indocyanine green combined with methylene blue staining in sentinel lymph node biopsy of breast cancer
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Methylene blue as tracer used in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) have low detection rate and high false negative rate. Indocyanine green (ICG) can detect the flow of subcutaneous lymphatic vessels and the position of lymph nodes dynamically. This study sought to evaluate the efficacy of ICG combined with methylene blue staining in SLNB of breast cancer.Methods: One hundred and fifty-six early breast cancer patients treated at our hospital from July 2020 to May 2022 were enrolled in this study. SLNB was performed by ICG combined with methylene blue staining under the guidance of the fluorescent tracer navigation system FLI-10B. Standard axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed in patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis confirmed by intraoperative frozen pathology, while low ALND was performed in patients with negative SLNs. According to the staining condition, the SLNs were divided into: (I) the combined group (SLNs with methylene blue staining and/or ICG luminescence); (II) the methylene blue group (SLNs with methylene blue staining alone); and (III) the ICG group ( SLNs with ICG luminescence alone). The detection rate, accuracy, sensitivity, and false negative rate of SLNB were compared among the 3 groups.Results: A total of 592 SLNs were detected in the combined group (average 3.8 SLNs), yielding a detection rate of 97.4%; the accuracy, sensitivity, and false negative rates were 97.4%, 92.7%, and 7.3%. In the methylene blue group, 390 SLNs were detected (average 2.5 SLNs), yielding a detection rate of 84.6%; the accuracy, sensitivity, and false negative rates were 83.3%, 89.1%, and 10.9%. A total of 483 SLNs were detected in the ICG group (average 3.1 SLNs), the detection rate was 92.9%; the accuracy, sensitivity and false negative rates were 91.7%, 90.9%, and 9.1%. The average number of detected SLNs, detection rate and accuracy rate in the combined group were higher than those in the methylene blue group (P<0.05), and the accuracy rate of the combined group was higher than that of the ICG group (P<0.05).Conclusions: ICG combined with methylene blue staining is a promising and effective tracing strategy in the SLNB of breast cancer with high detection and accuracy rates.

TI  - Ultrasound-assisted carbon nanoparticle suspension mapping <i>versus</i> dual tracer-guided sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with early breast cancer (ultraCars): phase III randomized clinical trial
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Appropriate tracing methods for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) play a key role in accurate axillary staging. This prospective, non-inferiority, phase III RCT compared the feasibility and diagnostic performance of ultrasound-assisted carbon nanoparticle suspension (CNS) mapping with dual tracer-guided SLNB in patients with early breast cancer.Methods: Eligible patients had primary breast cancer without nodal involvement (cN0), or had clinically positive lymph nodes (cN1) that were downstaged to cN0 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to undergo either ultrasound-assisted CNS sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping (UC group) or dual tracer-guided mapping with CNS plus indocyanine green (ICG) (GC group). The primary endpoint was the SLN identification rate.Results: Between 1 December 2019 and 30 April 2021, 330 patients were assigned randomly to the UC (163 patients) or GC (167 patients) group. The SLN identification rate was 94.5 (95 per cent c.i. 90.9 to 98.0) per cent in the UC group and 95.8 (92.7 to 98.9) per cent in the GC group. The observed difference of -1.3 (-5.9 to 3.3) per cent was lower than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 6 per cent (Pnoninferiority = 0.024). No significant difference was observed in metastatic node rate (30.5 versus 24.4 per cent; P= 0.222), median number of SLNs harvested (3 (range 1-7) versus 3 (1-8); P= 0.181), or duration of surgery (mean(s.d.) 7.53(2.77) versus 7.63(3.27) min; P= 0.316) between the groups. Among the subgroup of patients who had undergone neoadjuvant treatment, the SLN identification rate was 91.7 (82.2 to 100) per cent in the UC group and 90.7 (81.7 to 99.7) per cent in the GC group.Conclusion: The diagnostic performance of ultrasound-assisted CNS mapping was non-inferior to that of dual tracer-guided SLN mapping with CNS plus ICG in patients with early breast cancer.

TI  - Software Defect Prediction and Analysis Using Enhanced Random Forest (extRF) Technique: A Business Process Management and Improvement Concept in IOT-Based Application Processing Environment
T2  - MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Software defect prediction is a thriving study area in the realm of software engineering and processing in the IOT-based environment. Defect prediction creates a list of defective source code artifacts so that quality assurance companies may successfully assign limited methods for certifying programming things by investing more effort into the bad source code. Defect prediction can assist estimate maintenance times, which can help with quality assurance, dependability, security, and cost reduction. Many predictions in IOT-based processing environment and business process management and enhancement challenges still exist in defect expectation ponders, and there are various noteworthy concerns. In addition, it is difficult to apply these methodologies practically because most of the investigations veriSed in open-source programming ventures with the goal that present forecast models might not work for other programming items including business programming. Investigating security issues in crossproject deformity expectation is required since if we have more accessible restrictive datasets, the assessment of forecast models will be more stable. In general, every defect is essential regarding quality, reliability, security, and cost-effectiveness. Therefore, an enhanced and improved maintenance schedule is required to acknowledge forecasting techniques. Therefore, in this article, we have evaluated different Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques, among which Extended Random Forest (extRF) technique is one for defective system prediction. The Extended Random Forest (extRF) technique is the extended form of the Random Forest (RF), which is a supervised learning technique into semi-supervised learning getting the hang of reSning every arbitrary tree given an individual-training worldview. An enhancing technique is recommended, and a weighted mixture of irregular trees creates the Snal forecast results.

TI  - Trends of key surveillance performance indicators of acute flaccid paralysis: a descriptive analysis, Uganda, 2015-2020
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Polio is disease caused by poliovirus which can in turn cause irreversible paralytic disease, presenting as Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP). A sensitive AFP surveillance system, in which all reported AFP cases are evaluated, first to determine if they are true AFP cases or not, is key for tracking polio eradication. True AFP cases are then later categorized as polio AFP or non-polio AFP (NPAFP) cases. Sensitivity is defined by meeting an annual NPAFP rate/100,000 population < 15 years of >= 4/100,000, and an annual stool adequacy (SA) rate of >= 80%. We describe Uganda's AFP surveillance performance between 2015-2020, based on the WHO-recommended indicators, including; NPAFP and stool adequacy rate. Methods We performed a descriptive analysis of national AFP surveillance data, 2015-2020 obtained from ministry of health. We evaluated proportion of reported AFP cases that were true AFP, and changes in NPAFP and stool adequacy (SA) rate over the study period. We evaluated the trends in achieving the targeted NPAFP and SA rates from 2015-2020. We used QGIS to illustrate patterns in NPAFP and SA rates across districts and subregions. Results Among 3,605 AFP cases reported and investigated countrywide from 2015-2020, 3,475 (96%) were true AFP cases. All the true AFP cases were non-polio related. District reporting was near-complete (97-100% each year). Overall, the mean NPAFP rate declined from 3.1/100,000 in 2015 to 2.1/100,000 in 2020. Less than 40% of districts met the NPAFP target rate in all years. The proportion of districts achieving the NPAFP target rate of >= 4/100,000 significantly declined from 35% in 2015 to 20% in 2020. The mean annual SA rate nationally was 88% from 2015-2020. Only 66% of districts achieved the SA target rate of >= 80% in the study period. The proportion of districts with SA rate >= 80% significantly increased from 68 to 80% between 2015 and 2020. Conclusion Most districts reported AFP cases. However, there was a decline in the NPAFP rate from 2015-2020 and few districts achieved the target rate. The suboptimal AFP surveillance system performance leaves the country at risk of missing ongoing poliovirus transmission. We recommend health worker training on active AFP searches, intensified supportive supervision, increase the number of environmental surveillance sentinel sites to boost AFP surveillance in the country, and periodic review meetings with districts to assess AFP surveillance performance.

TI  - Habitat thresholds for successful predation under landscape change
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Habitat loss and alteration affect wildlife populations worldwide. Bush encroachment alters landscapes and threatens arid and semi-arid grasslands, but its effects on predator-prey relationships and carnivore community ecology are not well understood. Predation strategies of large predators, for example high-speed pursuits versus ambush from short distances, are likely to be affected differently by bush encroachment. Objectives We assessed how bush encroachment affects overall predation success of cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) and leopards (Panthera pardus) in a savanna landscape under variable fractional woody cover (FWC). We tested if predation success remained relatively unchanged for leopards across a gradient of FWC, and whether cheetah predation was most successful at low to intermediate cover and varied seasonally. Methods Belly scores of predators were measured from camera-trap images collected over 7 years in north-central Namibia and used to index predation success. We derived predicted belly score probabilities as a function of FWC, which was measured using a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-derived satellite data layer. Results Predicted leopard predation success was highest at 0.27-0.34 FWC in the dry season, potentially due to lower prey density in highly covered areas and decreased prey catchability in low cover. Predicted cheetah predation success was highest at 0.24-0.28 FWC in the wet season, potentially due to increased landscape openness, high availability of habitat margins for visualising and stalking prey, and decreased kleptoparasitism by leopards. These results highlight optimal habitat cover thresholds that favour lower FWC for cheetah than for leopard. Conclusions The findings indicate that landscape heterogeneity is important for predation success of cheetahs and leopards, suggesting that habitat management should focus on bush control efforts to maintain intermediate levels of bush cover.

TI  - Teaching Graduate Students to Translate Nonbehavioral Treatments Into Behavioral Principles
T2  - BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS IN PRACTICE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Behavior analytic translations of nonbehavioral treatments were recommended by Brodhead in Behavior Analysis in Practice, 8(1), 70-78 (2015) as part of a decision-making framework for practitioners working on interprofessional treatment teams. Professionals from different disciplines often have overlapping scopes of practice and competence, yet each recommends interventions according to their discipline-specific worldview and training. Nonbehavioral treatment recommendations may be especially challenging for behavior analytic practitioners who are committed to the science of human behavior and who are also ethically obligated to work cooperatively and in the best interest of the client. Learning to translate nonbehavioral treatments into behavior analytic principles and procedures may function as a valuable means of improving professional judgment, thereby promoting evidence-based practice and effective collaboration. Behavioral translations may expose procedures that are, in fact, conceptually systematic, creating more opportunities for behavior analysts to partner in interprofessional care. Using a behavioral skills training package, graduate students of applied behavior analysis were taught to translate nonbehavioral treatments into behavior analytic principles and procedures. All students produced more comprehensive translations following training.

TI  - Global datasets of leaf photosynthetic capacity for ecological and earth system research
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation (V-cmax) determines leaf photosynthetic capacity and is a key parameter for estimating the terrestrial carbon cycle, but its spatial information is lacking, hindering global ecological research. Here, we convert leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) retrieved from satellite data to V-cmax, based on plants' optimal distribution of nitrogen between light harvesting and carboxylation pathways. We also derive V-cmax from satellite (GOME-2) observations of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) as a proxy of leaf photosynthesis using a data assimilation technique. These two independent global V-cmax products agree well (r(2) = 0.79; RMSE = 15.46 mu molm(-2) s(-1), P<0:001) and compare well with 3672 ground-based measurements (r(2) = 0.69; RMSE = 13.8 mu molm(-2) s(-1) and P<0.001 for SIF; r(2) = 0.55; RMSE = 18.28 mu molm(-2) s(-1) and P<0.001 for LCC). The LCC-derived V-cmax product is also used to constrain the retrieval of V-cmax from TROPical Ozone Mission (TROPOMI) SIF data to produce an optimized V-cmax product using both SIF and LCC information. The global distributions of these products are compatible with V-cmax computed from an ecological optimality theory using meteorological variables, but importantly reveal additional information on the influence of land cover, irrigation, soil pH, and leaf nitrogen on leaf photosynthetic capacity. These satellite-based approaches and spatial V-cmax products are primed to play a major role in global ecosystem research. The three remote sensing V-cmax products based on SIF, LCC, and SIF CLCC are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6466968 (Chen et al., 2022), and the code for implementing the ecological optimality theory is available at https://github.com/SmithEcophysLab/optimal_V-cmax_R and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5899564 (last access: 31 August 2022) (Smith et al., 2022).

TI  - Source apportionment based on lead isotope ratios: Could domestic dog?s blood lead be used to identify the level and sources of lead pollution in children?
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Domestic dogs have been proved to be used as "sentinel organisms" to monitor human lead exposure. However, whether dogs' blood can be used to identify the levels and pollution source of children's lead exposure still needs evidence. To evaluate the potential use of domestic dogs' blood lead as an indicator of lead exposure levels and pollution source of children, accompanying with potential environmental media samples, lead concentrations and isotope ratios (expressed as 207Pb/206Pb, 208Pb/206Pb) in blood were investigated and compared between children and dogs, who came from a Pb-Zn smelter area, a coal fired area and a control area without industrial activity. The results showed that there were significant correlations in blood lead levels (BLLs) between children and dogs in the study areas (p < 0.01). The lead isotope ratios (LIRs) in blood of children and dogs were disparate among the three areas, however, the LIRs of dogs were quite correlated with those of children in each area (p < 0.01). With the comparison of LIRs between potential pollution sources (slag, ore, coal, paint) and blood samples, the identified lead sources based on dogs' blood were found to be coincident with those based on children's blood. Ore smelting and coal combustion were the main sources of lead exposure for the dogs and children in the smelting area, and coal combustion was the predominant source for the children and dogs living in the coal burning area and control area. The results showed that dogs' BLLs might be used to estimate children's BLLs, and blood LIRs measurements of dogs' could be used as an alternative for identifying the sources of children's lead exposure. This study further provided relevant evidence for dogs to be sentinels exposed to human lead exposure and an alternative method for source apportionment of children's lead exposure.

TI  - Estimating the GPP of olive trees with variable canopy cover by the use of Sentinel-2 MSI images
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of gross primary production (GPP) is a key step towards the simulation of crop yield which can be performed by feeding the light use efficiency approach with remotely sensed estimates of absorbed photosyn-thetic active radiation (fAPAR). The application of this approach, however, is problematic for bi-layer ecosys-tems, such as olive groves, which have tree canopy cover (CC) variable in space and time due, for example, to pruning or leaf growing. The current paper investigates on this issue concerning a small olive grove in Florence (Central Italy), which, during the 2021 growing season, was monitored by standard meteorological and soil water content measurements; additionally, observations of fAPAR were taken in four plots differently affected by spring pruning. These ground observations allowed to calculate daily GPP references for the four plots, which were used to assess corresponding estimates obtained from interpolated weather data and Sentinel-2 MSI NDVI imagery. In particular, the fAPAR and GPP estimates were obtained both considering the NDVI values of the entire plots and separating the contribution of olive tree canopies from that of grasses. The results of the experiment indicated that the GPP of the most intensively pruned plots could be estimated correctly only by taking into consideration the temporally variable fAPAR contribution of olive tree canopies.

TI  - Satellite observation to assess dengue risk due to <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> in a subtropical city of Argentina
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation environmental features measured through remote sensing and models of vector mosquitoes species Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus provide an advancement with regards to dengue risk in urban environments of subtropical areas of Argentina. The authors aim to estimate the effect of landscape coverage and spectral indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI], Normalized Difference Water Index [NDWI] and Normalized Difference Built-up Index [NDBI]) on the larvae abundance of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in Eldorado, Misiones, Argentina using remote satellite sensors. Larvae of these species were collected monthly (June 2016 to April 2018), in four environments: tire repair shops, cemeteries, dwellings and an urban natural park. The proportion of landscape coverage (water, urban areas, bare soil, low vegetation and high vegetation) was determined from the supervised classification of Sentinel-2 images and spectral indices, calculated. The authors developed spatial models of both vector species by generalized linear mixed models. The model's results showed that Ae. aegypti larvae abundance was better modelled by NDVI minimum values, NDBI maximum values and the interaction between them. For Ae. albopictus proportion of bare soil, low vegetation and the interaction between both variables explained better the abundance.

TI  - A Self-Assembly ICG Nanoparticle Potentiating Targeted Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapy in NSCLC
T2  - ACS BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLC), near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging using indocyanine green (ICG) has proven to be an efficient approach for locating pulmonary nodules and pulmonary sentinel lymph nodes. However, due to a lack of tumor selectivity, ICG's use as a photosensitizer for photothermal therapy (PTT) and photo-dynamic therapy (PDT) is restricted. In the current study, we aimed to develop a type of high-performance NIR nanoparticle formulated with ICG to enhance its targeted efficacy and tumor specificity on NSCLC. An ICG-osimertinib nanoparticle (ICG-Osi) was self-assembled through pi-pi stacking, with a size of 276 nm and a surface charge of -7.4 mV. The NIR visibility and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targetability of the ICG-Osi was confirmed by its binding efficiency to EGFR-expressing NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo, regardless of EGFR mutation status. The targeted effect was further confirmed in mouse xenograft models and showed an extended tumor retention time (> 96 h). We demonstrated a significantly enhanced hyperthermia effect and a retained reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating ability of ICG-Osi, resulting in a 2-fold higher cell death rate than ICG alone. The ICG-Osi down-regulated GPX4 and p62 expression while up-regulating caspase-3 and beclin1 expression in NSCLC cells, indicating a complex network of cell death-related proteins. Considering the merits of simple assembly, EGFR binding efficacy, improved hyperthermia effect, and efficient cancer cell suppression, the ICG-Osi exhibits great potential for clinical application in EGFR-expressing NSCLC therapy.

TI  - SMETool: A web-based tool for soil moisture estimation based on Eo-Learn framework and Machine Learning methods
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) technologies have played an increasingly important role in monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These technologies often combined with Machine Learning (ML) models provide efficient means for achieving the SDGs. The great progress of this combination is also demonstrated by the large number of software, web tools and packages that have been made available for free use. In this paper, we introduce a software architecture to facilitate the generation of EO information targeted towards soil moisture that derive several challenges regarding the facilitation of satellite data processing. Thus, this paper presents a web-based tool for Soil Moisture Estimation (SMETool), designed for the soil moisture estimation using Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2A data based on Eo-learn library. SMETool implements several ML techniques such as (Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), etc.). The SMETool could be very useful for decision makers in the region in assessing the effects of drought and desertification events. Experiments were carried out on two sites in Tunisia during the period from 2016 to 2017. Although the performance of the used models is very close, it is clear that CNN and RF outperformed other ML models. The achieved results reveal that the soil moisture, was highly correlated to the in-situ measurements with high Pearson's correlation coefficient r (rRF = 0.86, rANN = 0.75, rXGBoost = 0.79, rCNN = 0.87) and low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (RMSERF = 1.09%, RMSEANN = 1.49%, RMSEXGBoost = 1.39%, RMSECNN = 1.12%), respectively.

TI  - Grassland degradation by shrub encroachment: Mapping patterns and drivers of encroachment in Kyrgyzstan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shrub encroachment is one of the major phenomena of grassland degradation throughout the world. One of the largest grassland areas is found in Central Asia. This area is playing an important role for biodiversity and food security, especially in a context of climate change. While sustainable land management is critical to avoid shrub encroachment, the dynamics of such encroachment are often unclear, especially in remote areas. We assessed the spatial and temporal dynamics of shrub encroachment in Suusamyr valley in Kyrgyzstan and analysed how these patterns relate to abiotic and social factors. To assess the extent of shrub encroachment we performed a random forest classification with Google Earth Engine to depict shrub encroachment between 2000 and 2019. By using a combination of vegetation indices and digital elevation derivatives in the classification model, the overall classification accuracy reaches above 90%. The mapping of temporal changes revealed an increase in shrub encroachment of 48% within the valley, adding up to an overall coverage of 2% of the grassland area. The spatial patterns of shrub encroachment are more strongly associated with anthropogenic factors, such as locations of roads and settlements, than with variations in precipitation and amount of organic carbon in soils. Around 45% of shrub encroachment occurs close to main roads and local paths, and within around 5 km distance from temporal settlements. This degradation is probably caused by overgrazing near settlements and the loss of grasslands in those areas puts additional pressure on local livestock farming, potentially leading to further degradation in neighboring areas. A shrub encroachment susceptibility map was created to identify areas vulnerable to further shrub expansion, affecting valuable grassland area. The identification of these areas at risk may inform sustainable grassland management by better allocating pastures according their capacity and reducing pressures on those places most susceptible to degradation.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we made use of PRISMA imaging spectroscopy data for retrieving surface snow properties in the Nansen Ice Shelf (East Antarctica). PRISMA satellite mission has been launched in 2019 and it features 239 spectral bands covering the 400-2500 nm interval. These data are promising for cryospheric applications, since several snow and ice parameters can be derived from reflectance in the Visible Near InfraRed - Short Wave InfraRed (VNIR-SWIR) wavelength interval. Here we analyze, for the first time, PRISMA data collected in Antarctica. Our scene was acquired on December 2020 over the Nansen Ice Shelf (NIS). Using PRISMA data we estimated various snow parameters (effective grain diameter, snow specific surface area, snow spectral and broadband albedo, bottom of atmosphere snow reflectance, type of impurities in snow and their concentration), and we compared them with data presented in the scientific literature.

TI  - Hourly biomass burning emissions product from blended geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites for air quality forecasting applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning influences atmospheric composition and regional air quality. The hourly biomass-burning emissions are usually required by air quality models, yet most available emission inventories provide daily or monthly estimates in 0.1 degrees or coarser grids, limiting the prediction accuracy. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites - R Series (GOES-R) observes fires across the conterminous United States (CONUS) every 5 min at a spatial resolution of 2 km, which allows for characterizing fires and emissions on diurnal scale. In this study, we developed a new operational algorithm to generate regional hourly 3 km fire emission across the CONUS by fusing temporally resolved ABI fire radiative power (FRP) and fine spatial-resolution (375 m) FRP from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) satellites. To do this, ABI FRP was first calibrated against and fused with VIIRS FRP in 3 km grids. Then, FRP diurnal cycles at an interval of 5 min were reconstructed using the fused ABI-VIIRS FRP and the land cover-ecoregion-specific FRP diurnal climatologies. The reconstructed FRP diurnal cycles were applied to estimate hourly emissions of eight species (e.g., carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter with di-ameters <2.5 mu m (PM2.5)). The accuracy was verified by comparing with CO observations from the TROPO-spheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite, and with PM2.5 emissions from eight other inventories. The results of the ABI-VIIRS estimates during one year from April 2020 to March 2021 indicate that fires burned 221 Tg dry matter and emit 2.25 Tg PM2.5 emissions across the CONUS. The seasonal and diurnal patterns of emissions vary with land cover types. The largest and smallest seasonal variations are shown in forest and agriculture fire emissions, respectively. The diurnal emission patterns of different land cover types share similar shapes but differ largely in magnitude. Moreover, the diurnal pattern of forest fire emissions suggests that emissions are dominated during daytime in the eastern U.S. but strong during both daytime and nighttime in the western U.S. The evaluation shows that the fused ABI-VIIRS based CO agrees well with the TROPOMI CO, with a difference of 11%. However, the agreement between fused ABI-VIIRS emissions and other inventories varies for different fire events.

TI  - Retrieving nighttime aerosol optical depth using combined measurements of satellite low light channels and ground-based integrating spheres
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The aerosol optical depth, as an aerosol optical property, is a key physical quantity used to characterize the degree of atmospheric turbidity. The radiance of the integrating sphere light source after radiometric calibration is relatively stable. Compared with the original use of city lights to invert the night-time aerosol optical depth (AOD), the use of the integrating sphere can effectively reduce the change of the emission source and improve the inversion accuracy. A model to retrieve night-time AOD based on combined measurements of satellite low light channels and ground-based integrating spheres was established by the night-time artificial observation experiment in the Dunhuang radiation correction field (DRCF) for 38 consecutive days from October to November 2018. After excluding cloud pollution and moonlight pollution, the calculated results are compared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and the Visible/Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) night-time aerosol data. The average root mean square error of the processed data is 0.11 and 0.23, and the correlation coefficient reaches 0.85 and 0.46, respectively. The experimental results preliminarily show that the retrieval AOD is in good agreement with the satellite data, and it is feasible to retrieve AOD based on combined measurements of satellite low light channels and ground-based integrating spheres.

TI  - Improving maize yield prediction at the county level from 2002 to 2015 in China using a novel deep learning approach
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely maize yield monitoring from satellite imagery is in great demand in developing countries. The spatial heterogeneity deprived of the large territory of China makes it a challenge. In this article, we developed a novel deep learning model for maize yield prediction at the county level based on multiple satellite data. The two-stage feature learning structure integrated data from disparate sources, enhancing feature representation. The discriminative features were optimized from two levels: the dictionary matrix learned the spatial diversity of the provinces, and the improved optimizing formulation fit the distribution of the unbalanced records. The cross-validation results showed that our approach could explain 82 % of the variation in maize yield, achieving state-of-the-art. The model was robust when predicting the future, with the average root-mean-square error of 1006 kg/ha and the mean-absolute-percentage error of 17.1 %. The ability of early maize yield prediction clarifies the tremendous application value, showing the data from the first two months can already explain 75.6 % of yield variation. It was the first effort to improve county-level maize yield prediction in China, providing a potential framework for advancing the use of multi-source datasets for maize yield estimating.

TI  - Digital mapping of soil organic carbon density using newly developed bare soil spectral indices and deep neural network
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon density (SOCD) is an important parameter of agricultural soils and is useful for the improvement of environment and agricultural production. Proximal and remote sensing techniques are effective methods for digital soil mapping of SOCD. The current study used three types of spectral data, including labo-ratory proximal spectra, airborne hyperspectral and Sentinel 2 multispectral images, to predict SOCD in an agricultural land. Bare soil spectral indices (BSSIs) were developed to predict SOCD and compared with the published vegetation indices (VIs). With 45 soil samples, the partial least square regression (PLSR), back prop-agation neural network (BPNN) and deep neural network (DNN) prediction models were established to map SOCD. The results showed that the laboratory spectra (R-2 = 0.70-0.80) had the best performance of SOCD prediction, followed by the airborne (R-2 = 0.43-0.81) and Sentinel 2 (R-2 = 0.14-0.57) spectra. The SOCD maps derived from airborne and Sentinel 2 images had similar spatial distribution trends. The BSSIs (R-2 = 0.24-0.81) obtained higher accuracy than the VIs (R-2 = 0.14-0.74) in SOCD prediction. Moreover, DNN model was the best for digital soil mapping of SOCD among three prediction models. This study offered an effective approach for mapping SOCD in bare soil areas.

TI  - How can UAV bridge the gap between ground and satellite observations for quantifying the biomass of desert shrub community?
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of the shrub above-ground biomass (AGB) is an essential basis for determining carbon storage and monitoring desertification risk in arid ecosystems. However, significant uncertainties and biases exist in large-scale monitoring of desert AGB due to the scale mismatch and spatio-temporal topological errors be-tween the coarse resolution of satellite images and the limited area that can be surveyed via ground measurements. The rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology has the prospective advantage of multi-scale vegetation observation. However, its potential to bridge the gap between satellites and the ground in desert AGB estimation has not yet been explored. This study developed a procedure to fill the gap between satellite and ground measurements based on low-cost and easy-to-use UAV visible-light technology in typical desert shrub communities in Inner Mongolia, China. First, canopy area (CA), canopy maximum height (CH), and canopy volume (CV) metrics derived from UAV-RGB (Red, Green, Blue) images, coupled with structure-from -motion photogrammetry, were used to invert the UAV-based AGB. Then, the UAV-based AGB data were aggregated to different scales to align with satellite data. Here, we focused on examining the performance of generalized additive models between the upscaled UAV-based AGB and vegetation indices (VIs) generated from PlanetScope (resolution: 3 m), Sentinel-2A MSI (resolution: 10 m, 20 m), and Landsat 8 OLI (resolution: 30 m). Finally, we investigated the effects of scale and spectra in the upscaling and modeling process. Results showed that the UAV-based AGB linear prediction models developed by the CV metric performed best for Reaumuria soongarica (R-2 = 0.749, RMSE = 65.5 g) and Salsola passerina (R-2 = 0.919, RMSE = 56.7 g), which allowed for accurately mapping the desert AGB at the individual plant level with ultra-high resolution (2 cm). The performance of satellite biomass models was excellent based on the upscaled UAV-based AGB and VIs (best-performing models for different satellites: adjusted R-2 = 0.625-0.934, RMSE = 35.1-119.1 g/m(2)). As the resolution of satellite data increases, the increase in variance is a big scale-related challenge in AGB model performance evaluation. It is worth noting that the UAV-based AGB data are unmodifiable due to their area-independent nature, which can avoid the scale-related effect. Moreover, the satellite VIs most closely related to the desert AGB were associated with Red, NIR, and Red-Edge bands. Specifically, we recommend the Red-Edge band when using Sentinel-2A data. This study proves that UAV technology can not only provide exhaustive information on vegetation biomass but also can train and validate satellite data beyond individual UAV observations, which can significantly improve large-scale biomass monitoring if widely applied in the future.

TI  - Primary invasive ductal carcinoma of axillary accessory breast
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Primary accessory breast cancer is an extremely rare pathology, representing less than 1 % of all breast cancers, and it is found in more than 90 % of cases in the axilla.The diagnosis of accessory axillary breast cancer (AABC) is often late and at an advanced stage with an average delay of 40.5 months. Histological sampling and immunohistochemical results confirm the diagnosis. Most pa-tients are diagnosed with stage II disease or higher, so it is considered to have a poor prognosis. There is no specific management for AABC; it follows the guidelines for orthotopic pectoral breast cancer.We therefore report the case of a 50-year-old woman diagnosed with grade II invasive ductal carcinoma found in accessory axillary breast, treated by wide local resection and sentinel lymph node dissection.

TI  - From cropland to cropped field: A robust algorithm for national-scale mapping by fusing time series of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed and updated maps of actively cropped fields on a national scale are vital for global food security. Unfortunately, this information is not provided in existing land cover datasets, especially lacking in smallholder farmer systems. Mapping national-scale cropped fields remains challenging due to the spectral confusion with abandoned vegetated land, and their high heterogeneity over large areas. This study proposed a large-area mapping framework for automatically identifying actively cropped fields by fusing Vegetation-Soil-Pigment indices and Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) time-series images (VSPS). Three temporal indicators were proposed and highlighted cropped fields by consistently higher values due to cropping activities. The proposed VSPS algorithm was exploited for national-scale mapping in China without regional adjustments using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 images. Agriculture in China illustrated great heterogeneity and has experienced tremendous changes such as non-grain orientation and cropland abandonment. Yet, little is known about the locations and extents of cropped fields cultivated with field crops on a national scale. Here, we produced the first national-scale 20 m updated map of cropped and fallow/abandoned land in China and found that 77 % of national cropland (151.23 million hectares) was actively cropped in 2020. We found that fallow/abandoned cropland in mountainous and hilly regions were far more than we expected, which was significantly underestimated by the commonly applied VImax-based approach based on the MODIS images. The VSPS method illustrates robust generalization capabilities, which obtained an overall accuracy of 94 % based on 4,934 widely spread reference sites. The proposed mapping framework is capable of detecting cropped fields with a full consideration of a high diversity of cropping systems and complexity of fallow/abandoned cropland. The processing codes on Google Earth Engine were provided and hoped to stimulate operational agricultural mapping on cropped fields with finer resolution from the national to the global scale.

TI  - Quantifying NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emissions in Egypt using TROPOMI observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas and industrial facilities, which concentrate the majority of human activity and industrial production, are major sources of air pollutants, with serious implications for human health and global climate. For most of these pollutants, emission inventories are often highly uncertain, especially in developing countries. Spaceborne measurements from the TROPOMI instrument, on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite, are used to retrieve nitrogen dioxide (NO2) column densities at high spatial resolution. Here, we use 2 years of TROPOMI retrievals to map nitrogen oxide (NOx = NO + NO2) emissions in Egypt with a top-down approach using the continuity equation in steady state Emissions are expressed as the sum of a transport term and a sink term representing the three-body reaction comprising NO2 and hydroxyl radical (OH). This sink term requires information on the lifetime of NO2, which is calculated with the use of the CAMS near-real-time temperature and OH concentration fields. We compare this derived lifetime with the lifetime inferred from the fitting of NO2 line density profiles in large plumes with an exponentially modified Gaussian function. This comparison, which is conducted for different samples of NO2 patterns above the city of Riyadh, provides information on the reliability of the CAMS near-real-time OH concentration fields; it also provides some hint on the vertical levels that best represent typical pollution sources in industrial areas and megacities in the Middle East region. In Egypt, total emissions of NOx are dominated by the sink term, but they can be locally dominated by wind transport, especially along the Nile where human activities are concentrated. Megacities and industrial regions clearly appear as the largest sources of NOx emissions in the country. Our top-down model infers emissions with a marked annual variability. By looking at the spatial distribution of emissions at the scale of different cities with different industrial characteristics, it appears that this variability is consistent with national electricity consumption. We detect lower emissions on Fridays, which are inherent to the social norm of the country, and quantify the drop in emissions in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, our estimations of NOx emissions for Egypt are 7.0 % higher than the CAMS-GLOB-ANT_v4.2 inventory and significantly differ in terms of seasonality.

TI  - Seeing the System from Above: The Use and Potential of Remote Sensing for Studying Ecosystem Dynamics
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques are increasingly used for studying ecosystem dynamics, delivering spatially explicit information on the properties of Earth over large spatial and multi-decadal temporal extents. Yet, there is still a gap between the more technology-driven development of novel remote sensing techniques and their applications for studying ecosystem dynamics. Here, I review the existing literature to explore how addressing these gaps might enable recent methods to overcome longstanding challenges in ecological research. First, I trace the emergence of remote sensing as a major tool for understanding ecosystem dynamics. Second, I examine recent developments in the field of remote sensing that are of particular importance for studying ecosystem dynamics. Third, I consider opportunities and challenges for emerging open data and software policies and suggest that remote sensing is at its most powerful when it is theoretically motivated and rigorously ground-truthed. I close with an outlook on four exciting new research frontiers that will define remote sensing ecology in the upcoming decade.

TI  - Diagnostic Accuracy of Radioactive Iodine Seed Placement in the Axilla With Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Node-Positive Breast Cancer
T2  - JAMA SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Several less-invasive staging procedures have been proposed to replace axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with initially clinically node-positive (cN+) breast cancer, but these procedures may fail to detect residual disease. Owing to the lack of high-level evidence, it is not yet clear which procedure is most optimal to replace ALND.OBJECTIVE To determine the diagnostic accuracy of radioactive iodine seed placement in the axilla with sentinel lymph node biopsy (RISAS), a targeted axillary dissection procedure.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a prospective, multicenter, noninferiority, diagnostic accuracy trial conducted from March 1, 2017, to December 31, 2019. Patients were included within 14 institutions (general, teaching, and academic) throughout the Netherlands. Patients with breast cancer clinical tumor categories 1 through 4 (cT1-4; tumor diameter <2 cm and up to >5 cm or extension to the chest wall or skin) and pathologically proven positive axillary lymph nodes (ie, clinical node categories cN1, metastases to movable ipsilateral level I and/or level II axillary nodes; cN2, metastases to fixed or matted ipsilateral level I and/or level II axillary nodes; cN3b, metastases to ipsilateral level I and/or level II axillary nodes with metastases to internal mammary nodes) who were treated with NAC were eligible for inclusion. Data were analyzed from July 2020 to December 2021.INTERVENTION Pre-NAC, the marking of a pathologically confirmed positive axillary lymph node with radioactive iodine seed (MARI) procedure, was performed and after NAC, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) combined with excision of the marked lymph node (ie, RISAS procedure) was performed, followed by ALND.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The identification rate, false-negative rate (FNR), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for all 3 procedures: RISAS, SLNB, and MARI. The noninferiority margin of the observed FNR was 6.25% for the RISAS procedure.RESULTS A total of 212 patients (median [range] age, 52 [22-77] years) who had cN+ breast cancer underwent the RISAS procedure and ALND. The identification rate of the RISAS procedure was 982% (223 of 227). The identification rates of SLNB and MARI were 86.4% (197 of 228) and 94.1% (224 of 238), respectively. FNR of the RISAS procedure was 3.5% (5 of 144; 90% CI, 1.38-7.16), and NPV was 92.8% (64 of 69; 90% CI, 85.37-97.10), compared with an FNR of 17.9% (22 of 123; 90% CI, 12.4%-24.5%) and NPV of 72.8% (59 of 81; 90% CI, 63.5%-80.8%) for SLNB and an FNR of 7.0% (10 of 143; 90% CI, 3.8%-11.6%) and NPV of 86.3% (63 of 73; 90% CI, 77.9%-92.4%) for the MARI procedure. In a subgroup of 174 patients in whom SLNB and the MARI procedure were successful and ALND was performed, FNR of the RISAS procedure was 2.5% (3 of 118; 90% CI, 0.7%-6.4%), compared with 18.6% (22 of 118; 90% CI, 13.0%-25.5%) for SLNB (P < .001) and 6.8% (8 of 118; 90% CI, 3.4%-11.9%) for the MARI procedure (P = .03).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this diagnostic study suggest that the RISAS procedure was the most feasible and accurate less-invasive procedure for axillary staging after NAC in patients with cN+ breast cancer.

TI  - Molecular engineering of AIE luminogens for NIR-II/IIb bioimaging and surgical navigation of lymph nodes
T2  - MATTER
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging is vital for tumor staging and treatment decision-making, and current methods for SLN imaging suffer from a short retention time, poor penetration depth, and low signal-to-noise ratio. As a cutting-edge technology, second near-infrared wavelength region (NIR-II) aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) are promising for circumventing these challenges; however, construction of such molecules with ultralong absorption wavelengths remains a significant challenge. Here we conducted molecular engineering, constructing a NIR-II AIEgen (NIR-920) with the longest maximum absorption wavelength. NIR-920 nanoparticles (NPs) presented bright fluorescence and achieved high-performance imaging of lymph nodes in the NIR-II/NIR-IIb window, Compared with the clinically used in docyanine green (ICG), NIR-920 nanoparticles have many superior advantages, including retention time, penetration depth, signal-to-noise ratio, and photostability. Utilization of NIR-920 NPs allowed fast and accurate surgical navigation of SLNs. This work provides useful insight into designing extraordinarily prominent molecular probes for high-quality lymph node imaging and surgical navigation.

TI  - Prophylactic mastectomy and occult malignancy: Surgical and imaging considerations
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) is not routinely recommended for patients undergoing prophylactic mastectomy (PM), yet omission remains a subject of debate among surgeons. A modern patient cohort was examined to determine occult malignancy (OM) incidence within PM specimens to reinforce current recommendations. Methods All PM performed over a 5-year period were retrospectively identified, including women with unilateral breast cancer who underwent synchronous or delayed contralateral PM or women with elevated cancer risk who underwent bilateral PM. Results The study population included 772 patients (598 CPM, 174 BPM) with a total of 39 OM identified: 17 invasive cancers (14 CPM, 3 BPM) and 22 DCIS (19 CPM, 3 BPM). Of the 86 patients for whom SLNB was selectively performed, 1 micrometastasis was identified. In the CPM cohort, risk of OM increased with age, presence of LCIS of either breast, or presence of a non-BRCA high-penetrance gene mutation, while preoperative magnetic resonance imaging was associated with lower likelihood of OM. Conclusions Given the low incidence of invasive OM in this updated series, routine SLNB is of low value for patients undergoing PM. For patients with indeterminate radiographic findings, discordant preoperative biopsies, LCIS, or non-BRCA high-penetrance gene mutations, selective SLNB implementation could be considered.

TI  - What if consciousness is not an emergent property of the brain? Observational and empirical challenges to materialistic models
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The nature of consciousness is considered one of science's most perplexing and persistent mysteries. We all know the subjective experience of consciousness, but where does it arise? What is its purpose? What are its full capacities? The assumption within today's neuroscience is that all aspects of consciousness arise solely from interactions among neurons in the brain. However, the origin and mechanisms of qualia (i.e., subjective or phenomenological experience) are not understood. David Chalmers coined the term "the hard problem" to describe the difficulties in elucidating the origins of subjectivity from the point of view of reductive materialism. We propose that the hard problem arises because one or more assumptions within a materialistic worldview are either wrong or incomplete. If consciousness entails more than the activity of neurons, then we can contemplate new ways of thinking about the hard problem. This review examines phenomena that apparently contradict the notion that consciousness is exclusively dependent on brain activity, including phenomena where consciousness appears to extend beyond the physical brain and body in both space and time. The mechanisms underlying these "non-local" properties are vaguely suggestive of quantum entanglement in physics, but how such effects might manifest remains highly speculative. The existence of these non-local effects appears to support the proposal that post-materialistic models of consciousness may be required to break the conceptual impasse presented by the hard problem of consciousness.

TI  - SAR Polarimetric Phase Differences in Wetlands: Information and Mis-Information
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We have previously reported anomalous polarimetric decomposition results from SAR observations of wetlands. This is caused by the abrupt change in the phase difference between the HH and VV backscatter that occurs around the Brewster angle of the emergent vegetation. We have now developed and implemented a model for backscattering from wetlands that features a cylinder emergent from a water plane. The model was used in conjunction with an extensive set of RADARSAT-2 polarimetric observations of wetlands to provide further insights into the backscattering process. We are able to show how the abrupt Brewster transition in HH-VV phase difference varies with cylinder diameter and gravimetric moisture. We find that coherent cross-pol backscatter can result from cylindrical stems being tilted. In swamps with extensive tree mortality but primarily vertical trunks, the CPD can be used to monitor the drying of the trees and thus their fire hazard. These insights may be used to identify drying trees, indicating thawing permafrost, a potentially important climate change application in the near future. We recommend that applications researchers and users choose radar wavelengths that are considerably shorter, or longer, than the diameters of the cylinders producing the dominant double-bounce backscatter to avoid resonance effects.

TI  - The current status and future prospects for molecular imaging-guided precision surgery
T2  - CANCER IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Molecular imaging technologies are increasingly used to diagnose, monitor, and guide treatment of i.e., cancer. In this review, the current status and future prospects of the use of molecular imaging as an instrument to help realize precision surgery is addressed with focus on the main components that form the conceptual basis of intraoperative molecular imaging. Paramount for successful interventions is the relevance and accessibility of surgical targets. In addition, selection of the correct combination of imaging agents and modalities is critical to visualize both microscopic and bulk disease sites with high affinity and specificity. In this context developments within engineering/imaging physics continue to drive the growth of image-guided surgery. Particularly important herein is enhancement of sensitivity through improved contrast and spatial resolution, features that are critical if sites of cancer involvement are not to be overlooked during surgery. By facilitating the connection between surgical planning and surgical execution, digital surgery technologies such as computer-aided visualization nicely complement these technologies. The complexity of image guidance, combined with the plurality of technologies that are becoming available, also drives the need for evaluation mechanisms that can objectively score the impact that technologies exert on the performance of healthcare professionals and outcome improvement for patients.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background De-escalation of axillary surgery in breast cancer has progressively taken place when appropriate. Data supporting surgical de-escalation in patients with clinically node-positive (cN+) disease remains scarce. Here, survival among patients with cN+ T1-2 tumours undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and regional nodal irradiation (RNI) was investigated and compared with that among patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) with or without RNI. Methods The National Cancer Data Base was used to identify three groups of patients with cN+ tumours according to axillary management among those treated between 2010 and 2016: patients who underwent SLNB and RNI (cN+ SLNB/RNI group); those who had ALND and RNI (cN+ ALND/RNI group); and those who had ALND alone (cN+ ALND/no RNI group). Patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and those who had stage IV breast cancer or pN2-3 disease were excluded. Results A total of 12 560 patients met the inclusion criteria: 3030 in the cN+ SLNB/RNI, 5446 in the cN+ ALND/RNI, and 4084 in the cN+ ALND/no RNI group. The sizes of cN + SLNB/RNI and cN+ ALND/RNI groups increased over the study interval, whereas the cN+ ALND/no RNI group decreased in size (P < 0.001). There was a median of one positive node in the cN+ SLNB/RNI group and two nodes in the cN+ ALND/RNI and cN+ ALND/no RNI groups. The median number of nodes examined was three, 14, and 14, respectively (P < 0.001). Median follow-up was 57.9 (range 0.8-114) months. The overall survival rate was 97, 97, and 92 per cent respectively at two years, and 88, 86, and 78 per cent at five years (P < 0.001). Conclusion Patients with limited cN+ T1-2 breast cancer undergoing upfront SLNB and RNI have favourable survival outcomes that are not inferior to those of patients undergoing ALND with or without RNI. Prospective studies are warranted to assess locoregional control and long-term outcomes.This retrospective analysis of the National Cancer Database investigated survival outcomes for patients with a limited nodal burden at surgery. The data provide an insight into the increasing trend towards de-escalation of axillary surgery among patients with a limited burden of nodal disease and has the potential to establish preliminary data for a clinical practice-changing trial.Lay Summary The surgical management of lymph node metastases in patients with breast cancer continues to change. To minimize the complications of extensive removal of axillary lymph nodes (axillary dissection), more limited surgery is now the standard of care when the cancer has not spread to the axillary lymph nodes. This study examined data from a large national cancer database in the USA. The results showed that patients with minimal lymph node metastases can also undergo less extensive axillary surgery without affecting survival, if surgery is combined with radiation therapy.

AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a diagnostic staging procedure. The procedure aims to identify the first draining lymph node(s), which are most likely to contain metastases. SLNB is applied in various cancers, but not currently in thyroid carcinoma. However, treatment strategies are changing, making SLNB clinically relevant. SLNB may lead to more accurate staging, prevent unnecessary treatment and help achieve earlier curation. Ga-68-tilmanocept positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) can better localize sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) near the primary tumor than planar scintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT. This paper describes the rationale and design of a study investigating SLNB using Ga-68-tilmanocept PET/CT and indocyanine-green-Tc-99m-nanocolloid in ten differentiated and medullary thyroid carcinoma patients. Localization and number of SLNs, pathology result, optimal scan protocol, surgical time and surgeon's experience are examined.Trial Registration Number: 2021-002470-42 (EudraCT).Plain language summary: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can detect or rule out metastases in lymph nodes. SLNB is used in various cancers but not in thyroid cancer. However, due to changing treatment strategies, SLNB might also become valuable in thyroid cancer and lead to more accurate staging, prevent unnecessary treatment and help achieve earlier curation. Ga-68-tilmanocept PET/CT, a new imaging modality, can better localize lymph nodes near the primary tumor than previous imaging modalities, which is essential for SLNB in thyroid carcinoma. This study investigates the feasibility of SLNB in thyroid carcinoma.
