TI  - CODING THE MEANING IN BRAIN ACTIVITY
T2  - ZHURNAL VYSSHEI NERVNOI DEYATELNOSTI IMENI I P PAVLOVA
M3  - Review
AB  - The question of the nature of the relationship between mental processes and brain activity is not the prerogative of philosophers. All professional scientists studying the human brain must, in one way or another, decide for themselves this question. Dominant in the modern scientific worldview is the reductionist approach, according to which mental states can, in principle, be reduced to brain states. In this article, I review some of the data obtained in recent years that shed light on the nature of the relationship between the content of mental processes and brain activity. These data, concerning the encoding of sensory and semantic linguistic information, as well as more complex information related to the content of abstract concepts, show that the brain activity accompanying the extraction of meaning has a widely distributed probabilistic nature, which does not correspond to the nature of mental content, which is usually certain and has a holistic character. Thus, based on the currently available empirical data, reductionism can hardly be regarded as a viable option, and the only option within the framework of materialism is the recognition of mentality as an emergent entity.

TI  - Characterization of Land-Cover Changes and Forest-Cover Dynamics in Togo between 1985 and 2020 from Landsat Images Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon stocks in forest ecosystems, when released as a result of forest degradation, contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To quantify and assess the rates of these changes, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends that the REDD+ mechanism use a combination of Earth observational data and field inventories. To this end, our study characterized land-cover changes and forest-cover dynamics in Togo between 1985 and 2020, using the supervised classification of Landsat 5, 7, and 8 images on the Google Earth Engine platform with the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. Overall image classification accuracies for all target years ranged from 0.91 to 0.98, with Kappa coefficients ranging between 0.86 and 0.96. Analysis indicated that all land cover classes, which were identified at the beginning of the study period, have undergone changes at several levels, with a reduction in forest area from 49.9% of the national territory in 1985, to 23.8% in 2020. These losses of forest cover have mainly been to agriculture, savannahs, and urbanization. The annual change in forest cover was estimated at -2.11% per year, with annual deforestation at 422.15 km(2) per year, which corresponds to a contraction in forest cover of 0.74% per year over the 35-year period being considered. Ecological Zone IV (mountainous, with dense semi-deciduous forests) is the one region (of five) that has best conserved its forest area over this period. This study contributes to the mission of forestry and territorial administration in Togo by providing methods and historical data regarding land cover that would help to control the factors involved in forest area reductions, reinforcing the system of measurement, notification, and verification within the REDD+ framework, and ensuring better, long-lasting management of forest ecosystems.

TI  - Effects of Shelterbelt Transformation on Soil Aggregates Characterization and Erodibility in China Black Soil Farmland
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmland shelterbelts are widely used to reduce wind erosion, maintaining the ecological and food security of the black soil plain region of northeast China. In recent years, the protective effect of shelterbelts has been reduced due to tree degeneration. Efforts have been made to transform the construction of shelterbelts to conserve the stability of soil aggregates and enhance protection against erosion, however, the results are not well understood. To evaluate the impact of shelterbelt transformation on the stability of farmland soil aggregates and soil erodibility, three transformation modes of shelterbelts were selected, including pure Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica (ZC), pure Picea asperata (YS), and mixed Populus x xiaohei-Pinus sylvestris var.mongolica (ZY), with a degraded Populus x xiaohei shelterbelt (TYC) used as a control. We set up soil sampling points at 0.5H, 1H, 1.5H, 3H, 5H, 7H, and 9H from the shelterbelts and analyzed aggregate composition, mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD), fractal dimension (D), soil erodibility (K-value), and their relationships to soil properties of the 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-40 cm soil layers and the shelterbelt structure by using dry and wet sieving and equation estimation methods. The results show that dry (d) sieved soil samples from the transformed shelterbelt-protected farmlands are mainly composed of 2-5 mm and >5 mm grain size aggregates; the sum of the two particle sizes ranged from 48.67% to 51.27%, significantly larger than in the degraded shelterbelts (15.37%), decreasing with increasing distance from the shelterbelts. The effect is most obvious in the 0-10 cm soil layer. Wet (w) sieved soil samples are all dominated by <0.25 mm and 0.25-0.5 mm grain size aggregates; the sum of the two particle sizes ranged from 78.25% to 80.82%, which do not vary significantly with the mode of shelterbelts. The dMWD and dGMD show significantly higher mean values in samples from transformed shelterbelt-protected farmland than in soil from degraded shelterbelt-protected farmland; their magnitudes differ depending on the transformation mode, showing a pattern of ZC > ZY > YS and decreasing with increasing distance from shelterbelts, while the opposite is true for D and K. The difference between wMWD and wGMD for different shelterbelts protected farmland is not significant and is significantly lower than that between dMWD and dGMD. Clay and silt content was highly significantly positively correlated with aggregates dMWD and dGMD, weakly positively correlated with wMWD, wGMD and wD, and highly significantly negatively correlated with dD and K values. This shows that particle composition parameters can be used to reflect the sensitivity of agricultural soils to wind erosion. Farmland shelterbelt porosity is the main factor driving changes in soil aggregates stability, soil erodibility, and other soil properties. The transformation of degraded farmland shelterbelts can decrease the porosity and reduce wind speed, resulting in improved stability and erosion resistance of the farmland soil aggregates by increasing the clay content of the farmland soils. These results are useful in renovating degraded shelterbelts, providing novel insights into how to regulate the stability of soil aggregates and soil erodibility characteristics at the shelterbelt network scale.

TI  - Advantage of Regional Algorithms for the Chlorophyll-a Concentration Retrieval from In Situ Optical Measurements in the Kara Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The data of the sea reflectance coefficient were obtained during the cruise of the R/V "Akademik Ioffe" (10 August-8 September 2021) in the Kara Sea beyond the Arctic Circle. A total of 28 measurements of sea reflectance were performed in different conditions ranging from estuarine zones to open ocean. In addition, at 10 stations, water samples were taken, and chlorophyll-a concentrations were determined using the fluorometric method. In situ reflectance data were compared to satellite data (MODIS Aqua/Terra, Sentinel OLCI 3A/B, VIIRS SNPP) obtained within 24 h before and after the measurement. It was shown that, in general, an overestimation of remote sensing reflectance is observed in short-wave channels (412, 443, 469 nm for MODIS; 410, 412.5, 442.5 for OLCI) and underestimation in long-wave channels (708.75, 753.75 nm for OLCI). The obtained in situ chlorophyll-a concentrations were compared with the results of standard models (GIOP, OC2, OC3, OC4), and regional algorithms (semi-analytical MHI, empirical K17) were applied to the in situ and remotely sensed reflectances. In the cases of GIOP and OC4, unrealistic concentrations of chlorophyll-a were obtained. Regional algorithms developed earlier, specifically for the Kara Sea, showed good correlation (0.6 and 0.76) with in situ measurements. Despite the approximately 20% overestimation of chlorophyll-a by both regional algorithms, they can be used to obtain chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Kara Sea in a concentration range of <1 mg/m(3).

TI  - A Prospective, Multicenter Registry Study to Evaluate the Clinical Feasibility of Targeted Axillary Dissection (TAD) in Node-positive Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of non-radioactive TLN biopsy and TAD in routine clinical practice. Background Data: TAD involves TLN biopsy (TLNB) and sentinel lymph node biopsy and was recently introduced as a new standard for less invasive axillary staging in BC patients undergoing neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST); however, clinical evidence is limited. Methods: The SenTa study is a prospective registry study conducted at 50 centers. Patients with invasive BC who nderwent clip insertion into the most suspicious axillary lymph node were eligible. Axillary surgery was performed with or without sentinel lymph node biopsy, TLNB, and/or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Main endpoints were the detection rate and FNR of TLNB and TAD after NST. Results: Between 2017 and 2018, 548 consecutive BC patients underwent clip placement into biopsy-confirmed positive lymph nodes. After NST (n = 473), the clipped TLN was intraoperatively resected in 329 of 423 patients [77.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 74.0-82.0]. TAD was successful in 199 of 229 patients (detection rate: 86.9%, 95% CI: 81.8-91.0), the SLN and TLN were identical in 129 patient (64.8%). FNRs were 7.2% (8 of 111, 95% CI: 3.1-13.6) for TLNB followed by ALND (n = 203) and 4.3% (2 of 46, 95% CI: 0.5-14.8) for TAD followed by ALND (n = 77). Conclusions: The SenTa study demonstrates the feasibility of TAD in a real-world cohort of BC patients. Our findings are of great importance for de-escalation of surgical strategies.

TI  - Microwave Monitoring of Middle Atmosphere Ozone in Apatity and Peterhof in the Winter of 2021/2022
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Results of synchronous microwave monitoring of middle atmosphere ozone in Apatity (67 degrees N, 33 degrees E) and Peterhof (60 degrees N, 30 degrees E) during the winter and spring of 2021/2022 are presented. Identical mobile microwave spectrometers with an observation frequency of 110.8 GHz were used for ozone measurements. These instruments have identical techniques for observations and estimation of ozone profiles at the altitudes of 22-60 km. The main attention was given to changes in ozone (daily variations) in the mesosphere during the polar night and dynamic disturbances. To interpret the mesospheric ozone (60 km) behavior, MLS/Aura satellite data on the vertical distribution of temperature in the middle atmosphere over Apatity were used.

TI  - Supervised Segmentation of NO<sub>2</sub> Plumes from Individual Ships Using TROPOMI Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The shipping industry is one of the strongest anthropogenic emitters of NOx-a substance harmful both to human health and the environment. The rapid growth of the industry causes societal pressure on controlling the emission levels produced by ships. All the methods currently used for ship emission monitoring are costly and require proximity to a ship, which makes global and continuous emission monitoring impossible. A promising approach is the application of remote sensing. Studies showed that some of the NO2 plumes from individual ships can visually be distinguished using the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument on board the Copernicus Sentinel 5 Precursor (TROPOMI/S5P). To deploy a remote-sensing-based global emission monitoring system, an automated procedure for the estimation of NO2 emissions from individual ships is needed. The extremely low signal-to-noise ratio of the available data, as well as the absence of the ground truth makes the task very challenging. Here, we present a methodology for the automated segmentation of NO2 plumes produced by seagoing ships using supervised machine learning on TROPOMI/S5P data. We show that the proposed approach leads to more than a 20% increase in the average precision score in comparison to the methods used in previous studies and results in a high correlation of 0.834 with the theoretically derived ship emission proxy. This work is a crucial step towards the development of an automated procedure for global ship emission monitoring using remote sensing data.

TI  - AICCA: AI-Driven Cloud Classification Atlas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds play an important role in the Earth's energy budget, and their behavior is one of the largest uncertainties in future climate projections. Satellite observations should help in understanding cloud responses, but decades and petabytes of multispectral cloud imagery have to date received only limited use. This study describes a new analysis approach that reduces the dimensionality of satellite cloud observations by grouping them via a novel automated, unsupervised cloud classification technique based on a convolutional autoencoder, an artificial intelligence (AI) method good at identifying patterns in spatial data. Our technique combines a rotation-invariant autoencoder and hierarchical agglomerative clustering to generate cloud clusters that capture meaningful distinctions among cloud textures, using only raw multispectral imagery as input. Cloud classes are therefore defined based on spectral properties and spatial textures without reliance on location, time/season, derived physical properties, or pre-designated class definitions. We use this approach to generate a unique new cloud dataset, the AI-driven cloud classification atlas (AICCA), which clusters 22 years of ocean images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Aqua and Terra instruments-198 million patches, each roughly 100 km x 100 km (128 x 128 pixels)-into 42 AI-generated cloud classes, a number determined via a newly-developed stability protocol that we use to maximize richness of information while ensuring stable groupings of patches. AICCA thereby translates 801 TB of satellite images into 54.2 GB of class labels and cloud top and optical properties, a reduction by a factor of 15,000. The 42 AICCA classes produce meaningful spatio-temporal and physical distinctions and capture a greater variety of cloud types than do the nine International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) categories-for example, multiple textures in the stratocumulus decks along the West coasts of North and South America. We conclude that our methodology has explanatory power, capturing regionally unique cloud classes and providing rich but tractable information for global analysis. AICCA delivers the information from multi-spectral images in a compact form, enables data-driven diagnosis of patterns of cloud organization, provides insight into cloud evolution on timescales of hours to decades, and helps democratize climate research by facilitating access to core data.

TI  - Sentinel-2 and AISA Airborne Hyperspectral Images for Mediterranean Shrubland Mapping in Catalonia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mediterranean ecosystem exhibits a particular geology and climate, which is characterized by mild, rainy winters and long, very hot summers with low precipitation; it has led to the emergence of resilient plant species. Such habitats contain a preponderance of shrubs, and collectively harbor 10% of the Earth's species, thus containing some of the most unique shrubby formations protecting against environmental natural degradation. Due to shrub species diversity, initial phases of forestland, heterogenous grasses, bare ground and stones, the monitoring of such areas is difficult. For this reason, the aim of this paper is to assess semi-automatic classifications of the shrubby formations based on multispectral Sentinel-2 and visible and near infrared (VINR) AISA-EAGLE II hyperspectral airborne images with a support of Canopy High Model (CHM) as a three-dimensional information and field-verified patterns, based on Match-T/DSM and aerial photos. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers have been tested on a few scenarios featuring different combinations of spectral and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformed bands and vegetation indices. Referring to the results, the average overall accuracy for the SVM and AISA images (all tested data sets) was 78.23%, and for the RF: 79.85%. In the case of Sentinel-2, the SVM classifier obtained an average value of 83.63%, while RF: 85.32%; however, in the case of the shrubland, we would like to recommend the RF classifier, because the highest mean value of F1-score achieved was 91.86% (SVM offered few-percent-point worse results), and the required training time was quicker than SVM. Commonly available Sentinel-2 data offered higher accuracies for shrubland monitoring than did the airborne VNIR data.

TI  - Lava Mapping Using Sentinel-1 Data after the Occurrence of a Volcanic Eruption-The Case of Cumbre Vieja Eruption on La Palma, Canary Islands, Spain
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic eruptions pose a great threat to humans. In this context, volcanic hazard and risk assessment constitute crucial issues with respect to mitigating the effects of volcanic activity and ensuring the health and safety of inhabitants. Lava flows directly affect communities living near active volcanoes. Nowadays, remote sensing advances make it possible to effectively monitor eruptive activity, providing immediate and accurate information concerning lava evolution. The current research focuses on the mapping of the surface deformation and the analysis of lava flow evolution occurred on the island of La Palma, during the recent (2021) eruptive phase of the volcano. Sentinel-1 data covering the island were collected throughout the entire eruptive period, i.e., September 2021 until January 2022. The processing was based on amplitude-based and phase-based detection methods, i.e., Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry (InSAR) and offset tracking. In particular, ground deformation occurred on the island, while Line-Of-Sight (LOS) displacements were derived from Sentinel-1 interferograms. Moreover, the evolution of lava flow velocity was estimated using Sentinel-1 imagery along with offset tracking technique. The maximum lava flow velocity was calculated to be 2 m/day. It was proved that both approaches can provide rapid and useful information in emergencies, especially in inaccessible areas. Although offset tracking seems a quite promising technique for the mapping of lava flows, it still requires improvement.

TI  - Epidemiology and characteristics of acral lentiginous melanoma compared to lentigo melanoma in France: a multicentric retrospective study from the French cohort RIC-Mel database
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Skin phototype, latitude and sun exposure are classic risk factors for melanomas but are not relevant to acrolentiginous melanomas (ALM). ALM is not related to chronic sun exposure because the thick stratum corneum acts as a barrier to penetration of UV rays, whereas LMM occurs in skin with high photoaging due to chronic sun exposure. Objectives: This study aimed to determine if any difference exists between "solar" melanomas and "non-solar" melanomas based on a comparison betweenLMMandALM. Materials& Methods: We extracted all data for ALM and LMM patients, from March 2012 to September 2020, from the RIC-Mel national database to perform a descriptive cohort analysis of 1,056 Caucasian cases. Conclusion: The profiles of solar-related and non-solar melanoma seem to be different, and prognostic factors of ALMat diagnosis are less favourable compared toLMM, suggesting that non-solar melanoma is more aggressive than solar-related melanoma and that sentinel lymph node biopsy should be performed.

TI  - An Extensive Field-Scale Dataset of Topsoil Organic Carbon Content Aimed to Assess Remote Sensed Datasets and Data-Derived Products from Modeling Approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geosciences suffer from a lack of large georeferenced datasets that can be used to assess and monitor the role of soil organic carbon (SOC) in plant growth, soil fertility, and CO2 sequestration. Publicly available, large field-scale georeferenced datasets are often limited in number and design to serve these purposes. This study provides the first publicly accessible dataset of georeferenced topsoil SOC measurements (n = 840) over a 26-hectare (ha) agricultural field located in southern Ontario, Canada, with a sampling density of similar to 32 points per ha. As SOC is usually influenced by site topography (i.e., slope and landscape position), each point of the database is associated with a wide range of remote sensing topographic derivatives; as well as with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based value. The NDVI data were extracted from remote sensing Sentinel-2 imagery from over a five-year period (2017-2021). In this paper, the methodology for topsoil sampling, SOC measurement in the lab, as well as producing the suite of topographic derivatives is described. We discuss the opportunities that the database offers in terms of spatially explicit and continuous soil information to support international efforts in digital soil mapping (i.e., SoilGrids250m) as well as other potential applications detailed in the discussion section. We believe that the database with very dense point location measurements can help in conducting carbon stocks and sequestration studies. Such information can be used to help bridge the gap between ground data and remotely sensed datasets or data-derived products from modeling approaches intended to evaluate field-scale rates of agricultural carbon accumulation. The generated topsoil database in this study is archived and publicly available on the Zenodo open-access repository.

TI  - Evaluating Spatiotemporal Patterns of Post-Eruption Vegetation Recovery at Unzen Volcano, Japan, from Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying vegetation responses after natural disasters helps clarify complex relationships between vegetation and surface processes such as soil erosion. The heterogenous post-disaster landscape offers a naturally stratified environment for this study. Existing research tends to be frequently monitored but small-scale or sporadically monitored but large-scale. The availability of high-quality and free satellite imagery bridges this gap by offering continuous, longer-term observations at the landscape scale. Here we take advantage of a dense Landsat time series to investigate landscape-scale vegetation response rates and factors at Unzen volcano, Japan. We do this by first investigating differences between two popular vegetation indices-The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), when applied to recovery studies. We then apply pixel-wise regressions to quantify spatio-temporal vegetation response and regression tree analyses to investigate drivers of recovery. Our findings showed that simple linear-log functions best model recovery rates reflecting primary succession trajectories caused by extreme disturbance and damage. Regression tree analyses showed that despite secondary disturbances, vegetation recovery in both the short and long-term is still dominated by eruption disturbance type and elevation. Finally, compared to NDVI, NBR is a better indicator of structural vegetation regrowth for the early years of revegetation.

TI  - Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves in a Data-Rich Era: A Review
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves are widely used in the hydrological design of hydraulic structures. This paper presents a wide review of methodologies for constructing IDF curves with a specific focus on the choice of the dataset type, highlighting the main characteristics, possible uncertainties, and benefits that can be derived from their application. A number of studies based on updating IDFs in relation to climate change are analyzed. The research was based on a comprehensive analysis of more than 100 scientific papers and reports, of which 80 were found to be suitable for the aim of this study. To classify the articles, the key was mainly intensity-duration-frequency curves in relation to the types of datasets most used for their construction, specific attention was paid to the case study area. The paper aims to answer the following research questions. (i) What is the contribution of a data-rich era? (ii) Are remotely sensed data reliable to build IDFs in ungauged or partially gauged watersheds? (ii) How is uncertainty dealt with when developing IDFs? Remotely sensed data appear to be an alternative to rain-gauge data in scarcely gauged or ungauged areas; however, rain-gauge data are still a preferred dataset in the development of IDFs. The main aim of the present work is to provide an overview of the state of the art on the use of different types of data to build IDFs. The paper is intended to support the inclusion of different data types in hydrological applications.

TI  - Intercomparison of Sentinel-5P TROPOMI cloud products for tropospheric trace gas retrievals
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds have a strong impact on satellite measurements of tropospheric trace gases in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared spectral ranges from space. Therefore, trace gas retrievals rely on information on cloud fraction, cloud albedo, and cloud height from cloud products. In this study, the cloud parameters from different cloud retrieval algorithms for the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) are compared: the Optical Cloud Recognition Algorithm (OCRA) a priori cloud fraction, the Retrieval Of Cloud Information using Neural Networks (ROCINN) CAL (Clouds-As-Layers) cloud fraction and cloud top and base height, the ROCINN CRB (Clouds-as-Reflecting-Boundaries) cloud fraction and cloud height, the Fast Retrieval Scheme for Clouds from the Oxygen A-band (FRESCO) cloud fraction, the interpolated FRESCO cloud height from the TROPOMI NO2 product, the cloud fraction from the NO2 fitting window, the O-2-O-2 cloud fraction and cloud height, the Mainz Iterative Cloud Retrieval Utilities (MICRU) cloud fraction, and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) cloud fraction. Two different versions of the TROPOMI cloud products OCRA/ROCINN, FRESCO, and the TROPOMI NO2 product are included in the comparisons (processor version 1.x and 2.x). Overall, the cloud parameters retrieved by the different algorithms show qualitative consistency in version 1.x and good agreement in version 2.x with the exception of the VIIRS cloud fraction, which cannot be directly compared to the other data. Differences between the cloud retrievals are found especially for small cloud heights with a cloud fraction threshold of 0.2, i.e. clouds that are particularly relevant for tropospheric trace gas retrievals. The cloud fractions of the different version 2 cloud products primarily differ over snow and ice-covered pixels and scenes with sun glint, for which only MICRU includes an explicit treatment. All cloud parameters show some systematic problems related to the across-track dependence, where larger values are found at the edges of the satellite view. The consistency between the cloud parameters from different algorithms depends strongly on how the data are filtered for the comparison, for example, what quality value is used or whether snow- and ice-covered pixels are excluded from the analysis. In summary, clear differences were found between the results of various algorithms, but these differences are reduced in the most recent versions of the cloud data.

TI  - A Strict Validation of MODIS Lake Surface Water Temperature on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is a key parameter in understanding the variability of lake thermal conditions and evaporation. The MODIS-derived LSWT is widely used as a reference for lake model validations and process studies in data-scarce regions. In this study, the accuracy of the MODIS LSWT was examined on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). In-situ subsurface temperatures were collected at five large lakes. Although the observation period covers from summer to winter, only the observations during the lake turnover period (from October to freeze-up), when the lakes are well mixed, can be used as ground truth. The MODIS LSWT agrees well with the selected in-situ data for the five large lakes, with root mean square error (RMSE) < 1 degrees C at nighttime and <2 degrees C in the daytime, indicating a high accuracy of the MODIS LSWT data. Before the turnover period, the water is thermally stratified and the surface water is warmer than the subsurface water, and thus the in-situ subsurface water temperature data and the MODIS LSWT have different representativeness. In this case, if the observations are used as a validation basis, the MODIS errors could be much magnified. This in turn indicates the importance of period selection for the validation.

TI  - Diffusion-weighted Breast MRI in Prediction of Upstaging in Women with Biopsy-proven Ductal Carcinoma in Situ
T2  - RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Accurate preoperative prediction of upstaging in women with biopsy-proven ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is important for surgical planning, but published models using predictive MRI features remain lacking.Purpose: To develop and validate a predictive model based on preoperative breast MRI to predict upstaging in women with biopsy-proven DCIS and to select high-risk women who may benefit from sentinel lymph node biopsy at initial surgery.Materials and Methods: Consecutive women with biopsy-proven DCIS who underwent preoperative 3.0-T breast MRI including dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and who underwent surgery between June 2019 and March 2020 were retrospectively identified (development set) from an academic medical center. The apparent diffusion coefficients of lesions from DWI, lesion size and morphologic features on DCE MRI scans, mammographic findings, age, symptoms, biopsy method, and DCIS grade at biopsy were collected. The presence of invasive cancer and axillary metastases was determined with surgical pathology. A predictive model for upstaging was developed by using multivariable logistic regression and validated in a subsequent prospective internal validation set recruited between July 2020 and April 2021.Results: Fifty-seven (41%) of 140 women (mean age, 53 years 6 11 [SD]) in the development set and 43 (41%) of 105 women (mean age, 53 years 6 10) in the validation set were upstaged after surgery. The predictive model combining DWI and clinical- pathologic factors showed the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve at 0.87 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.92) in the development set and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.84) in the validation set. The predicted probability of invasive cancer showed good interobserver agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.79); the positive predictive value was 85% (28 of 33), and the negative predictive value was 92% (22 of 24).Conclusion: A predictive model based on diffusion-weighted breast MRI identified women at high risk of upstaging.

TI  - Using Gene Expression Profiling to Personalize Skin Cancer Management.
T2  - The Journal of clinical and aesthetic dermatology
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Risk-stratification of cancer, traditionally performed through staging, directs optimal disease management decisions with the result of improved patient outcomes. Many forms of cutaneous cancer have overall excellent survival rates, but conventional staging methods are imperfect in identifying high-risk patients. Gene expression profiling (GEP) is a clinically available, objective metric that can be used in conjunction with traditional clinicopathological staging to help clinicians stratify risk in patients with skin cancer, even in those who lack traditional risk markers. For patients with melanoma, the 31-GEP test provides personalized prognostic information that can guide risk-appropriate clinical management and surveillance decisions. The i31-GEP integrates 31-GEP results with clinicopathological features to provide a risk of recurrence (i31-GEP for ROR) and likelihood of having a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) (i31-GEP for SLNB) for patients with melanoma. For patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma who have at least one risk factor, the 40-GEP test allows for better risk stratification by identifying the high-risk patients who are most likely to develop metastasis. These tests can be easily integrated into clinical practice to help guide treatment choices.

AB  - This letter proposes a generalized stabilizer-oriented design method for grid-forming virtual synchronous generator (GFVSG) attached to weak-stiffness power networks, where a rate of change of frequency feedforward control strategy (RoCoF-FCS) is put forward to improve frequency stability, enhance damping performance, and avoid aperiodic loss of synchronization (ALoS). In addition, the feedback analytical framework, which connects RoCoF and rate of change of voltage (RoCoV), is proposed to identify both wideband oscillation and ALoS. Finally, the proposed method is validated by time-domain simulations.

TI  - Identification of Typical Ecosystem Types by Integrating Active and Passive Time Series Data of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of ecosystem types is important in ecological environmental assessment. However, due to cloud and rain and complex land cover characteristics, commonly used ecosystem identification methods have always lacked accuracy in subtropical urban agglomerations. In this study, China's Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) was taken as a study area, and the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data were used as the fusion of active and passive remote sensing data with time series data to distinguish typical ecosystem types in subtropical urban agglomerations. Our results showed the following: (1) The importance of different features varies widely in different types of ecosystems. For grassland and arable land, two specific texture features (VV_dvar and VH_diss) are most important; in forest and mangrove areas, synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data for the months of October and September are most important. (2) The use of active time series remote sensing data can significantly improve the classification accuracy by 3.33%, while passive time series remote sensing data improves by 4.76%. When they are integrated, accuracy is further improved, reaching a level of 84.29%. (3) Time series passive data (NDVI) serve best to distinguish grassland from arable land, while time series active data (SAR data) are best able to distinguish mangrove from forest. The integration of active and passive time series data also improves precision in distinguishing vegetation ecosystem types, such as forest, mangrove, arable land, and, especially, grassland, where the accuracy increased by 21.88%. By obtaining real-time and more accurate land cover type change information, this study could better serve regional change detection and ecosystem service function assessment at different scales, thereby supporting decision makers in urban agglomerations.

TI  - Investigating the Long-Term Variation Trends of Absorbing Aerosols over Asia by Using Multiple Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Absorbing aerosols, consisting of smoke (black carbon (BC) and other organics) and dust (from windblown sources), can have a strong warming effect on the climate and impact atmospheric circulation due to localized heating. To investigate the spatiotemporal and vertical changes of absorbing aerosols across Asia, collocation data from OMI, MODIS, and CALIPSO were used to compare two periods: 2006-2013 and 2014-2021. This study revealed a significant temporal and spatial contrast of aerosol loading over the study region, with a drop in total aerosol concentration and anthropogenic smoke concentration recorded across the Eastern China region (all seasons) and a concurrent increase in the Indian sub-continent region (especially in autumn). The range of aerosol diffusion is affected by the height of the smoke and aerosol plumes, as well as the wind force, and is dispersed eastwards because of the Hadley circulation patterns in the Northern Hemisphere. Smoke from Southeast Asia typically rises to a height of 3 km and affects the largest area in contrast to other popular anthropogenic zones, where it is found to be around 1.5-2 km. The dust in Inner Mongolia had the lowest plume height of 2 km (typically in spring) compared to other locations across the study region where it reached 2-5 km in the summer. This study showed, by comparison with AERONET measurements, that combining data from MODIS and OMI generates more accuracy in detecting aerosol AOD from smoke than using the instruments singularly. This study has provided a comprehensive assessment of absorbing aerosol in Asia by utilizing multiplatform remote-sensed data and has summarized long-term changes in the spatiotemporal distribution and vertical structure of absorbing aerosols.

TI  - The Inversion of HY-1C-COCTS Ocean Color Remote Sensing Products from High-Latitude Seas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - China's first operational ocean color satellite sensor, named the Chinese Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (HY-1C-COCTS), was launched in September 2018 and began to provide operational data in June 2019. However, as a polar orbiting ocean color satellite sensor, HY-1C-COCTS would inevitably encounter regions impacted by large solar zenith angles when observing the high-latitude seas, especially during the winter. The current atmospheric correction algorithm used by ocean color satellite data processing software cannot effectively process observation data with solar zenith angles greater than 70 degrees. This results in a serious lack of effective ocean color product data from high-latitude seas in winter. To solve this problem, this study developed an atmospheric correction algorithm based on a neural network model for use with HY-1C-COCTS data. The new algorithm used HY-1C-COCTS satellite data collected from latitudes greater than 50 degrees N and between April 2020 and April 2021 to establish a direct relationship between the total radiance received by the satellite and the remote sensing reflectance products. The evaluation using the test dataset shows that the inversion accuracy of the new algorithm is relatively high under different solar zenith angles and different HY-1C-COCTS bands (the relative deviation is 3.37%, 7.05%, 5.10%, 5.29%, and 10.06% at 412 nm, 443 nm, 490 nm, 520 nm, and 565 nm, respectively; the relative deviation is 1.07% when the solar zenith angle is large (70 similar to 90 degrees)). Cross comparison with MODIS Aqua satellite products shows that the inversion results are consistent. After verifying the accuracy and stability of the algorithm, we reconstructed the remote sensing reflectance dataset from the Arctic Ocean and surrounding high-latitude seas (latitude greater than 50 degrees N) and successfully retrieved chlorophyll-a data and information on other marine ecological parameters.

TI  - Capability of Phenology-Based Sentinel-2 Composites for Rubber Plantation Mapping in a Large Area with Complex Vegetation Landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping rubber plantations in a large area is still challenging in high-cloud-cover and complex-vegetation landscapes. Existing studies were often confined to the discrimination of rubber trees from natural forests and rarely concerned other tropical tree species. The Sentinel-2 constellation, with improved spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution, offers new opportunities to improve previous efforts. In this paper, four Hainan Sentinel-2 composites were generated based on the detailed phenological stages delineation of rubber trees. The random forest classifier with different phenological stage combinations was utilized to discuss the capability of Sentinel-2 composites to map rubber plantations. The optimal resultant rubber plantation map had a producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and F1 score of 81%, 84.4%, and 0.83, respectively. According to the rubber plantation map in 2020, there was a total of 5473 km(2) rubber plantations in Hainan, which was 2.93% higher than the statistical data from the Hainan Statistical Yearbook. According to the Hainan Statistical Yearbook, the area-weighted accuracy at the county level was 82.47%. The mean decrease in accuracy (MDA) was used to assess the feature importance of the four phenological stages. Results showed that the recovery growth stage played the most important role, and the resting stage was the least important. Moreover, in terms of the combinations of phenological stages, any dataset group with two phenological stages was sufficient for rubber tree discrimination. These findings were instrumental in facilitating the rubber plantation mapping annually. This study has demonstrated the potential of Sentinel-2 data, with the phenology-based image-compositing technique, for mapping rubber plantations in large areas with complex vegetation landscapes.

TI  - Investigating the Impacts of Urbanization on Vegetation Net Primary Productivity: A Case Study of Chengdu-Chongqing Urban Agglomeration from the Perspective of Townships
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - As an emerging national strategic urban agglomeration in China, the changing trend of vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) and the impact of the urbanization level (UL) on carbon cycle functions in the Chengdu-Chongqing urban agglomeration (CUA) have received increasing attention. Previous studies have largely overlooked externalities and the heterogeneity of urbanization effects, and urbanization has also been analyzed in isolation (with focus being on land and population urbanization). In this study, the spatial evolution of NPP was evaluated from 2000 to 2020 at the township level (3859) using multivariate remote sensing data and a comprehensive index (UL) that included population urbanization, land urbanization, and economic urbanization. Bivariate spatial autocorrelation, spatial Durbin models, and geographically weighted regression models were used to analyze the spatial externalities of urbanization impacts and assess the global and local effects. The results show that the region's mean NPP increased by 177.25 g*c/m(2) (annual growth of 1.59%), exhibiting a distribution of "low in the middle and high in the periphery" and low-value clustering along major traffic arteries and rivers. Low-value-NPP areas were mainly located in urban centers, while the high-level areas were in the mountainous region (in the southwest and southeast) and significantly expanded over time. Negative correlation clusters were the main clustering types between the UL and NPP; the "High-Low" negative correlation clusters accelerated outward from the urban centers of Chengdu and Chongqing. Overall, urbanization had negative direct and spillover effects on NPP, exhibiting spatial non-stationarity of the negative driving effect within the urban agglomeration. The results indicate the need to strengthen regional ecological joint governance and adopt more place-based urbanization optimization strategies. This study offers new insights to help to reduce the constraining effects of urbanization on vegetation productivity and ecological functions from the perspectives of population agglomeration, land expansion, and industrial construction.

TI  - Satellite and Machine Learning Monitoring of Optically Inactive Water Quality Variability in a Tropical River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale monitoring of water quality parameters (WQPs) is one of the most critical issues for protecting and managing water resources. However, monitoring optically inactive WQPs, such as total nitrogen (TN), ammoniacal nitrogen (AN), and total phosphorus (TP) in inland waters, is still challenging. This study constructed retrieval models to explore the spatiotemporal evolution of TN, AN, and TP by Landsat 8 images, water quality sampling, and five machine learning algorithms (support vector regression, SVR; random forest regression, RFR; artificial neural networks, ANN; regression tree, RT; and gradient boosting machine, GBM) in the Nandu River downstream (NRD), a tropical river in China. The results indicated that these models can effectively monitor TN, AN, and TP concentrations at in situ sites. In particular, TN by RFR as well as AN and TP by ANN had better accuracy, in which the R-2 value ranged between 0.44 and 0.67, and the RMSE was 0.03-0.33 mg/L in the testing dataset. The spatial distribution of TN, AN, and TP was seasonal in NRD from 2013-2022. TN and AN should be paid more attention to in normal wet seasons of urban and agricultural zones, respectively. TP, however, should be focus on in the normal season of agricultural zones. Temporally, AN decreased significantly in the normal and wet seasons while the others showed little change. These results could provide a large-scale spatial overview of the water quality, find the sensitive areas and periods of water pollution, and assist in identifying and controlling the non-point source pollution in the NRD. This study demonstrated that multispectral remote sensing and machine learning algorithms have great potential for monitoring optically inactive WQPs in tropical large-scale inland rivers.

TI  - The Use of Indices and Modified U-Net Network in Improving the Classification of Planting Structures
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It was difficult to accurately obtain crop planting structure by using the spectral information of high spatial resolution and low spatial resolution multispectral images of panchromatic images at the same time. In this paper, we propose a method of planting structure extrac-tion based on indices and an improved U-Net semantic segmentation network. Based on the original band of Landsat-8, we used an image fusion algorithm to highlight the characteristics of vegetation, water, and soil respectively by three indices added, and the improved U-Net network was used to classify the type of planting structure. The results showed that the overall accuracy of classification was more than 91.6%, and the accuracy of crops was up to 93.8%. Automated water extraction index in image fusion effectively improved the classification accuracy. This method could extract a variety of information about planting structures automatically and accurately. It provided theoreti-cal support for adjusting and optimizing regional planting structures.

TI  - Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation and Response to Climate Change Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest and most important natural terrestrial ecosystem, forest plays a crucial role in reducing the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mitigating global warming, maintaining the global ecological balance, and promoting global biological evolution and community succession. The accurate and rapid assessment of forest biomass is highly significant for estimating the regional carbon budget and monitoring forest change. In this study, Landsat images and China's National Forest Continuous Inventory data of 1999, 2004, 2009, and 2014 were used to establish extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models for forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation based on forest type in the Xiangjiang River Basin, Hunan Province, China. Kriging interpolation of the AGB residuals was used to correct the error of AGB estimation. Then, a new XGBoost model was established using the final corrected AGB maps and climate data to estimate the AGB under different climate scenarios during the 2050s and 2070s. The results indicated that AGB estimation using the XGBoost model with correction via Kriging interpolation of the AGB residuals can significantly improve the accuracy of AGB estimation. The total AGB of the study area increased over time from 1999 to 2014, indicating that the forest quality improved in the study area. Under the different climate scenarios, the total AGB during the 2050s and 2070s was predicted to decline continuously with increasing of greenhouse gas emissions, indicating that greenhouse gas emissions have a negative impact on forest growth. The results of this study can provide data support for evaluating the ecological function and value of forest ecosystems, and for formulating reasonable forest management measures to mitigate the effects of climate change.

TI  - Identifying the Influencing Factors of Cooling Effect of Urban Blue Infrastructure Using the Geodetector Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect has a serious negative impact on urban ecosystems and human well-being. Mitigating UHI through nature-based methods is highly recommended. The cooling effect of urban blue infrastructure (UBI) can significantly alleviate the effects of UHI. Revealing the crucial influencing factors of the cooling effect of UBI is of great significance for mitigating the UHI effect. In this study, the water-cooling intensity (WCI) and water-cooling range (WCR) were used to quantitatively analyze the cooling effect of UBI in Hefei city in summer. Furthermore, the influencing factors and their interactions with the cooling effect of UBI were investigated based on the Geodetector model. The results revealed that: (1) The surface thermal environment of the built-up area of Hefei presented obvious spatial differentiation characteristics. (2) There were nine influencing factors that significantly influenced the WCI variation, with the greatest influencing factor of road density. In contrast, only the landscape shape index had a significant effect on WCR variation. (3) The interaction of environmental characteristics, water body characteristics, and socioeconomic characteristics had a significant influence on the cooling effect of UBI, and the interaction relationship between the influencing factors was mutually enhanced. The findings from our research can provide a theoretical reference and practical guidance for the protection, restoration, and planning of UBI as a nature-based solution to improve the urban thermal environment.

TI  - Super-Resolution of Remote Sensing Images for x4 Resolution without Reference Images
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 satellites can provide free optical remote-sensing images with a spatial resolution of up to 10 M, but the spatial details provided are not enough for many applications, so it is worth considering improving the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 satellites images through super-resolution (SR). Currently, the most effective SR models are mainly based on deep learning, especially the generative adversarial network (GAN). Models based on GAN need to be trained on LR-HR image pairs. In this paper, a two-step super-resolution generative adversarial network (TS-SRGAN) model is proposed. The first step is having the GAN train the degraded models. Without supervised HR images, only the 10 m resolution images provided by Sentinel-2 satellites are used to generate the degraded images, which are in the same domain as the real LR images, and then to construct the near-natural LR-HR image pairs. The second step is to design a super-resolution generative adversarial network with strengthened perceptual features, to enhance the perceptual effects of the generated images. Through experiments, the proposed method obtained an average NIQE as low as 2.54, and outperformed state-of-the-art models according to other two NR-IQA metrics, such as BRISQUE and PIQE. At the same time, the comparison of the intuitive visual effects of the generated images also proved the effectiveness of TS-SRGAN.

TI  - A Study on the Dynamic Relationship between Landscape Information and Heat Island Intensity of Urban Growth Patterns-A Case of Five Cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei City Cluster
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs) endanger the health of urban residents. Different urban growth patterns (UGPs) have different effects on heat islands. However, the dynamic relationship between UGP landscape information and urban surface heat island intensity (SUHII) remains unclear. This study explored the dynamic relationship between SUHII and UGP landscape information through spatial regression and landscape pattern analysis using Landsat imagery and urban construction land data from five cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration from 2010 to 2018. The results show that SUHII increase areas overlap with expansion patches, and the edge expansion and outlying areas show a warming effect. The influence of the edge expansion landscape area and pattern on SUHII changes is greater than the other two growth patterns. The relationship between UGPs' landscape information and SUHII changes varies among cities. The larger the city size, the stronger the influence of landscape information. Among the landscape patterns, the influence of the landscape area and pattern on SUHII change is large and the influence of landscape fragmentation is smaller. Exploring the dynamic relationship between UGP landscape information and SUHII is conducive to optimizing the spatial layout and pattern selection of urban development and providing a scientific reference for sustainable and livable urban development planning.

TI  - Support vector machine parallelized remote sensing image classification algorithm based on big data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of big data technology, machine learning classification methods have been widely used in the classification and recognition of remote sensing images. For remote sensing big data, how to quickly and efficiently use machine learning classification algorithms to classify remote sensing images is an urgent problem. It is a general term for the theory, method, technology, and activities of obtaining valuable information based on massive remote sensing data sets, synthesizing auxiliary data from other sources, and using big data thinking and means. The purpose of this paper is to study the support vector machine (SVM) parallelized remote sensing image classification algorithm based on big data. We propose a parallel nesting of GPU in MPI multiprocesses based on the big data framework, which can more effectively improve the calculation processing speed and build a high-performance SVM parallel computing framework based on the big data framework. The optimization problem of SVM considers both empirical risk and structural risk minimization and requires maximum edge distance when constructing hyperplane decision boundaries, so there is ample space between the interval boundaries to accommodate the test samples. Based on this framework, we improve the machine learning SVM algorithm and realize the high-performance parallel computing of SVM classification algorithm on this platform. It is an efficient hybrid parallel mode to nest GPU in MPI multiprocess in parallel. When the number of nodes is 2, 4, and 6, the speedup of the SVM classification algorithm is 1.52, 2.24, and 2.55.

TI  - A Modified Shape Model Incorporating Continuous Accumulated Growing Degree Days for Phenology Detection of Early Rice
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using a shape model (SM) is a typical method to determine the phenological phases of crops with long-time-series satellite remote sensing data. The average AGDD-based shape model (AAGDD-SM) takes temperature into account compared to SM, however, the commonly used daily average temperature is not sufficient to determine the exact AGDD owing to the possibly significant changes in temperatures throughout the day. In this paper, a modified shape model was proposed for the better estimation of phenological dates and it is incorporated into the continuous AGDD (CAGDD) which was calculated based on temperatures from a continuous 24 h within a day, different from the calendar day or the average AGDD indicators. In this study, the CAGDD replaced the abscissa of the NDVI growth curve over a 5-year period (2014 to 2018, excluding 2015) for a test site of early rice in Jiangxi province of China. Four key phenological phases, including the reviving, tillering, heading and anthesis phases, were selected and determined with reference to the field-observed phenological data. The results show that compared with the AAGDD-SM, the method proposed in this paper has basically improved the prediction of each phenological period. For those cases where the average temperature is lower than the minimum temperatures (K1) but the effective accumulated temperature is not zero, more accurate AGDD can be calculated according to the method in this paper.

TI  - 4D label-free quantitative proteomics analysis to screen potential drug targets of Jiangu Granules treatment for postmenopausal osteoporotic rats
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is a disease with a high prevalence in postmenopausal women and is characterized by an imbalance in bone metabolism, reduced bone mass, and increased risk of fracture due to estrogen deficiency. Jiangu granules (JG) is a compound prescription used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat PMOP. However, its definitive mechanism in PMOP is unclear. This study used a 4D label-free quantitative proteomics method to explore the potential therapeutic mechanism of JG in an ovariectomy (OVX) rats' model.Materials and methods: A rat model of PMOP was established by removing the ovaries bilaterally. Nine 3-month-old specific-pathogen-free female SD rats. The nine rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 3 in each group): the sham-operated group (J), the ovariectomy group (NC), and the JG treatment (ZY) group. Proteins extracted from the bone tissue of the lumbar spine (L3, L4) of three groups of rats were analyzed by 4D label-free quantitative proteomics, and proteins differentially expressed after JG treatment and proteins differentially expressed after de-ovulation were intersected to identify proteins associated with the mechanism of PMOP by JG treatment.Result: There were 104 up-regulated and 153 down-regulated differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the J group vs. NC group, 107 up-regulated and 113 down-regulated DEPs in the J group vs. ZY group, and 15 up-regulated and 32 down-regulated DEPs in the NC group vs. ZY group. Six potential target proteins for JG regulation of osteoblast differentiation in OVX rats were identified by taking intersections of differential proteins in the J group vs. NC group and NC group vs. ZY group.Conclusion: JG may exert therapeutic effects by modulating the expression levels of target proteins associated with osteoblast differentiation to enhance osteoblast differentiation in OVX rats. These results further uncovered the target proteins and specific mechanisms of JG in treating PMOP, providing an experimental basis for the clinical application of JG in treating PMOP.

TI  - Monitoring Ecological Changes on a Rapidly Urbanizing Island Using a Remote Sensing-Based Ecological Index Produced Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Island ecosystems are susceptible to the considerable impacts of increasing human activities, landscape reconstruction, and urban expansion, resulting in changes in the ecological environment and urban ecological security issues. Remote sensing techniques can achieve the near-real-time ecological environment monitoring of these rapidly changing areas. The remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI), as a comprehensive remote sensing ecological environment index, was adopted to dynamically monitor urban ecological quality (EQ) over time in this study, combined with the Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery (LandTrendr) algorithm. Annual composite images were generated using Landsat 5, Landsat 7, and Landsat 8 imagery to extract four metrics (Greenness, Moisture, Heat, and Dryness) to calculate RSEI from 1991 to 2021. The ecological quality in the study area was evaluated using a five-level classification (poor, inferior, medium, good, and excellent), and the changes in EQ on a pixel basis were identified by the LandTrendr algorithm. The results showed that (1) the average value of the RSEI ranged from 0.47 to 0.57 over 31 years, indicating that EQ was maintained at the medium level; (2) the distribution of different EQ levels had visible patterns, and an area of 47.87 km(2) was affected by a poor EQ at least once in 31 years; (3) 38.22 km(2) of this area experienced EQ poor disturbance once, and 3.05 km(2) of the area had poor disturbance twice. Urban expansion, forest degradation, and policy are the main factors causing the reduction of the RSEI. The results demonstrate that combining time series of RSEI and LandTrendr can effectively monitor the changes of EQ, which is helpful to identify the spatial-temporal variation patterns of EQ and provide valuable information for policymakers and protection.

TI  - Satellite Laser Altimetry Data-Supported High-Accuracy Mapping of GF-7 Stereo Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - GaoFen 7 (GF-7) is China's first submeter high-resolution stereo mapping satellite with dual-linear-array cameras and a laser altimeter system onboard for high-precision mapping. To further take advantage of the very high elevation accuracy of laser altimetry data and the high relative accuracy with stereo images, an innovative combined adjustment method for GF-7 stereo images with laser altimetry data is presented in this paper. In this method, two flexible and effective schemes were proposed to extract the elevation control point according to the registration of footprint images and stereo images and then utilized as vertical control in the block adjustment to improve the elevation accuracy without ground control points (GCPs). The validation experiments were conducted in Shandong, China, with different terrains. The results demonstrated that, after using the laser altimetry data, the root mean square error (RMSE) of elevation was dramatically improved from the original 2.15 m to 0.75 m, while the maximum elevation error was less than 1.6 m. Moreover, by integrating a few horizontal control points, the planar and elevation accuracy can be simultaneously improved. The results show that the method will be useful for reducing the need for field survey work and improving mapping efficiency.

TI  - Sea-Crossing Bridge Detection in Polarimetric SAR Images Based on Windowed Level Set Segmentation and Polarization Parameter Discrimination
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As sea-crossing bridges are important hubs connecting separated land areas, their detection in SAR images is of great significance. However, under complex scenarios, the sea surface conditions, the distribution of coastal terrain morphologies, and the scattering components of different structures in the bridge area are very complex and diverse, which makes the accurate and robust detection of sea-crossing bridges difficult, including the sea-land segmentation and bridge feature extraction on which the detection depends. In this paper, we propose a polarimetric SAR image detection method for sea-crossing bridges based on windowed level set segmentation and polarization parameter discrimination. Firstly, the sea and land are segmented by a proposed windowed level set segmentation method, which replaces the construction of the level set segmentation energy function based on the isolated pixel distribution with a joint distribution of pixels in a certain window region. Secondly, water regions of interest are extracted by a proposed water region merging algorithm combining the distances of the water contour and polarization similarity parameter. Finally, the bridge regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted by merging close water contours, and the ROIs are discriminated by the polarimetric parameters of the polarization entropy and scattering angle. Experimental results using multiple AirSAR, RADARSAT-2, and TerraSAR-X quad-polarization SAR data from the coastal areas of San Francisco in the USA, Singapore, and Fuzhou, Fujian, and Zhanjiang, Guangdong, in China show that the proposed method can achieve 100% detection of sea-crossing bridges in different bands for different scenes, and the accuracy of the intersection of the ground-truth (IoG) index of bridge body recognition can reach more than 85%. The proposed method can improve the detection rate and reduce the false alarm rate compared with the traditional spatial-based method.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, Python Surface Energy Balance System (PySEBS) software was developed in the Python 2.7 programming language for continuous calculation of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) at regional scales. The software is based on the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model, which uses basic meteorological data, MODIS remote sensing data, and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data as the original input data and finally outputs daily-scale ETa in the form of raster data with a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km. To verify the reliability of the PySEBS model, the ETa of spring maize during the growing season in Jilin Province, China, from 2001 to 2020 was calculated and analyzed in this study and compared with the results of similar studies by others. The findings showed that the PySEBS model has a reasonable accuracy in estimating ETa within +/- 15% and is a robust model that can achieve the continuous calculation of ETa at a regional scale. Therefore, PySEBS software is a useful tool for regional irrigation scheduling and water resources management.

After human beings eat fruits containing heavy metals through the food chain, they will cause neurasthenia of the nervous system, numbness of hands and feet, indigestion of the digestive system, blood poisoning, kidney injury and other symptoms. Then it will pollute and damage the ecological environment and personal safety, therefore, how to quickly find out the situation of soil pollution is particularly critical. With the development of remote sensing technology, multispectral remote sensing has great potential in breaking through the vegetation barrier to monitor heavy soil metals because of its high spectral resolution and real-time non-destructive and large-area monitoring advantages. This study takes peach trees, the main crop in Pinggu District, as the research object. Using hyperspectral data of peach leaves and field soil sampling data, the response characteristics of peach leaf spectral curves were analyzed. The reflectance spectra of peach leaves were transformed by first-order/second-order differentiation, standard normal transformation and continuous de unification. The characteristic variables are determined by correlation analysis and multiple linear regression model, construction of vegetation index HMSVI, the correlation between HMSVI and Cd, As and Pb content is higher than that of common vegetation index. After modeling element content and vegetation index HMSVI by linear regression method, selecting the model with good fitting, the statistical modeling of leaf hyperspectral reflectance spectrum and soil heavy metal content was realized, and the spatial distribution of heavy metal content was retrieved from sentinel-2 remote sensing image, and the results were verified. The results show that : the average spectral reflectance of leaves under heavy metal stress was higher than that of normal leaves, and the phenomenon of "blue shift" occurred. 780, 945 and 1 375 are the most sensitive to heavy metal pollution. The inversion model established by using the vegetation index constructed in three bands can be better used to predict the content of heavy metal elements in peach forest soil. The prediction models are y = 0. 44x+ 0. 193, y = 7. 4361nx +13. 161, y = - 15. 359x+ 13. 583x(2) + 23. 541 respectively. The spatial inversion results show that the high-value areas of the three heavy metals are widely distributed near the liujiadian tailings pond, Wanzhuang tailings pond and Jinhai Lake tailings pond in Pinggu District. Heavy metal pollution is more serious in the West than in the East. The mapping results can provide basic data support for preventing and treating heavy metal pollution in Taolin, Pinggu District, Beijing.

TI  - Trophic state assessment of optically diverse lakes using Sentinel-3-derived trophic level index
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate estimation of trophic state of lakes with satellite remote sensing is a challenge due to the optical complexity and variability associated with inland waters. Match-up data from 393 sampling stations that has concurrent Sentinel-3 OLCI images were acquired across Wuhan lakes. Trophic Level Index (TLI) algorithms were developed within a global Optical Water Type (OWT) classification system. The performance of algorithms with limited training data gathered by using spectral similarity of highest Sowt was not improved compared with that on basis of no classification. In contrast, using spectral similarity of Sowt > 0.9 rather than the highest Sowt to group more training data with similar traits for each OWT can help build more robust algorithms, which performance is better than that on basis of no classification. Algorithm performance statistics of the test dataset for the stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) method were the following: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) = 5.56; Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) = 11.02 %; Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 7.24 and for the back propagation neural network on the basis of the Levenberg-Marquardt-Bayesian regularization algorithm (LMBRBPNN) method MAE = 4.56; MAPE = 8.33 %; RMSE = 5.98. We detected 8 different OWTs (2,3,4,5,9,10,11,12) in Wuhan lakes and clear spatio-temporal patterns of the trophic state between 2018 and 2020.Our results revealed that the trophic state of Wuhan lakes did not decrease as expected during the COVID-19 lockdown period.

TI  - Remote Sensing Extraction of Agricultural Land in Shandong Province, China, from 2016 to 2020 Based on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and effective access to agricultural land-change information is of great significance for the government when formulating agricultural policies. Due to the vast area of Shandong Province, the current research on agricultural land use in Shandong Province is very limited. The classification accuracy of the current classification methods also needs to be improved. In this paper, with the support of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and based on Landsat 8 time series image data, a multiple machine learning algorithm was used to obtain the spatial variation distribution information of agricultural land in Shandong Province from 2016 to 2020. Firstly, a high-quality cloud-free synthetic Landsat 8 image dataset for Shandong Province from 2016 to 2020 was obtained using GEE. Secondly, the thematic index series was calculated to obtain the phenological characteristics of agricultural land, and the time periods with significant differences in terms of water, agricultural land, artificial surface, woodland and bare land were selected for classification. Feature information, such as texture features, spectral features and terrain features, was constructed, and the random forest method was used to select and optimize the features. Thirdly, the random forest, gradient boosting tree, decision tree and ensemble learning algorithms were used for classification, and the accuracy of the four classifiers was compared. The information on agricultural land changes was extracted and the causes were analyzed. The results show the following: (1) the multi-spatial index time series method is more accurate than the single thematic index time series when obtaining phenological characteristics; (2) the ensemble learning method is more accurate than the single classifier. The overall classification accuracy of the five agricultural land-extraction results in Shandong Province obtained by the ensemble learning method was above 0.9; (3) the annual decrease in agricultural land in Shandong Province from 2016 to 2020 was related to the increase in artificial land-surface area and urbanization rate.

TI  - Recent Seasonal Variations in Ecosystem Water Use Efficiency in China's Key Tropical-Subtropical Transitional Zones in Response to Climate Change
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the response of terrestrial ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) to climate change is critical to accurately represent the carbon-water cycle processes. However, how WUE dynamics are evolving under seasonal climate variations and biome-specific characteristics remains still unclear. In this study, we integrated two state-of-the-art retrieval algorithms to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) from satellite MODIS records. Such metrics served as input to quantify ecosystem WUE, expressed as the ratio of GPP to ET, and explore its dynamics during the dry and wet season from 2001 to 2018 in China's key tropical to subtropical transitional zones, that is, Yunnan Province. Results show large spatial and seasonal variability in WUE over the observational period. During the dry season, the increasing trends in GPP and ET have led to contrasting WUE patterns in forest and non-forest biomes, leading to positive and negative WUE trends, respectively. During the wet season, the declining trends in GPP occurring in combination with opposite trends in ET, have caused decreasing WUE consistently across all biomes except croplands, likely further modulated by human factors. The observed changes in WUE appear primarily driven by variations in air temperature (Ta) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) during both dry and wet seasons. Overall, these results contribute to a better understanding of the carbon-water interplay in tropical-subtropical transitional zones and provide new insights to improve our capacity to predict the terrestrial ecosystem's response to climate change.

TI  - Measuring the State Dependence Effect in Hospital Payment Adjustment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Since FY 2013, as a part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) program, the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (HVBP) program has adjusted Medicare's payments to hospitals based on the total performance score of the hospital. First, the program reduces a portion of the hospital's Medicare payments in a specific fiscal year, and then, by the end of the same fiscal year, the amount of the payment reductions will be awarded to the hospitals based on the total performance score; thus, the hospitals that do not receive the reward will lose the portion of money reduced by Medicare. In this research, we apply the theory of state dependence and use the dynamic random effect probit model to estimate this effect. The results show that the hospital payment adjustment dynamics have a very significant state dependence effect (0.341); this means that hospitals that received a reward in the previous year are 34.1% more likely to receive a reward this year than the ones that received a penalty in the previous year. Meanwhile, we also find that the state dependence effect varies significantly across hospitals with different ownership (proprietary/government owned/voluntary nonprofit), and the results show that voluntary nonprofit hospitals exhibit the largest effect of state dependence (0.370), while government-owned hospitals exhibit the lowest effect of state dependence (0.293), and proprietary hospitals are in the middle. Among the factors that influence the likelihood that a hospital receives a reward, we find that teaching hospitals with a large number of beds (>400) are less likely be rewarded; in terms of ownership, we find that voluntary nonprofit hospitals are more likely be rewarded; in terms of demographic factors, hospitals where the average household income are higher within the region are more likely be rewarded.

TI  - Contribution of the Reconstruction of the Area of Seling Co Lake Using DEM Data and Analysis of Spatio-Temporal Variations
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Seling Co Lake, located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, has been expanding rapidly since the 1980s and, in 2008, surpassed Namtso Lake to become the largest lake in Tibet. Additionally, this rapid expansion has significantly impacted the ecological environment, and human activities surround the lake. Thus, it is of great importance to reveal the expansion pattern of Seling Co Lake for a long time-series. Previous studies always contained errors when exploring this subject due to the limitations associated with the quality of remote sensing images. To overcome the existing deficiency, a method based on the SRTM1 DEM and a water frequency Landsat-series dataset is developed to reconstruct the complete inundation area of Seling Co Lake from 1987 to 2021 while taking full advantage of the relationship between the water frequency and terrain. The results show that the water frequency reconstruction model proposed in this study has a significant optimization effect on the restoration of the permanent and seasonal water areas of Seling Co Lake. In particular, the proposed method can effectively improve the underestimated water-frequency pixel values of the seasonal waters located on the southern and northern shores of Seling Co Lake. The water-inundation area of Seling Co Lake showed an overall increasing trend with a rate of 26.02 km(2)center dot year(-1) (p < 0.01), and this expansion trend was mainly concentrated in the southern and northern parts of the lake. This study cannot only provide an efficient and feasible remote sensing means of reconstructing the water-inundation area for lakes in complex terrain according to topographic conditions but also greatly refines our understanding of the annual variations in the water-inundation area of Lake Seling Co.

TI  - Stability of the Hailuogou glacier during the "9.5" Luding Earthquake: a preliminary assessment based on multi-source observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - On 5th September 2022, a magnitude Ms-6.8 earthquake occurred nearby Mt. Gongga, western Sichuan. The stability of the glaciers in east Mt. Gongga close to the epicenter was widely concerned due to the strong shake triggered by the earthquake. Using multi-source observations (including in-situ photographs, remote sensing datasets before and after the event), we carried out a preliminary assessment of the stability and hazard risks of the Hailuogou (HLG) glacier. Triggered by the earthquake, a small block of fractured ice at the lowest part of icefall collapsed. The magnitude of the coseismic ice avalanche was relatively small, which is comparable in size to most ice avalanches over the past seven years, but much less than the previous mapped largest one (03 April 2018, runout similar to 699 m). One most recent large (runout similar to 608 m) ice avalanche occurred between 01 and 04 September, just before the earthquake, likely unloaded large amount of ice mass and made a larger ice avalanche avoided during the earthquake shake. Nevertheless, the momentum of collapsed snow-ice-rock mass could be safely unloaded over a wide and gentler-slope ice tongue area, limiting its mobility and the risk of a cascading hazard. Glacier-wide surface flow dynamics monitored by Sentinel-1 satellite SAR time series (12 September 2021-19 September 2022) show that HLG glacier velocity was generally consistent before and after the earthquake. The entire HLG glacier exhibited more stable than expected, with almost no abnormal features detected in its upper accumulation part, the lower ice tongue, and its lateral paraglacial slopes. Since the glacier valley has experienced remarkable downwasting and the paraglacial environment has been strongly disturbed and destabilized, we suggested that, to efficiently evaluate glacier-related cascading hazard risks, it is also necessary to systematically combine multi-source observations (e.g., high-resolution UAV survey, radar/Lidar scan, ground investigation, monitoring and warning systems) to continuously monitor the regional glacier anomalies in the post-earthquake seismic active areas.

TI  - Dark Spot Detection from SAR Images Based on Superpixel Deeper Graph Convolutional Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is the primary equipment used to detect oil slicks on the ocean's surface. On SAR images, oil spill regions, as well as other places impacted by atmospheric and oceanic phenomena such as rain cells, upwellings, and internal waves, appear as dark spots. Dark spot detection is typically the initial stage in the identification of oil spills. Because the identified dark spots are oil slick candidates, the quality of dark spot segmentation will eventually impact the accuracy of oil slick identification. Although certain sophisticated deep learning approaches employing pixels as primary processing units work well in remote sensing image semantic segmentation, finding some dark patches with weak boundaries and small regions from noisy SAR images remains a significant difficulty. In light of the foregoing, this paper proposes a dark spot detection method based on superpixels and deeper graph convolutional networks (SGDCNs), with superpixels serving as processing units. The contours of dark spots can be better detected after superpixel segmentation, and the noise in the SAR image can also be smoothed. Furthermore, features derived from superpixel regions are more robust than those derived from fixed pixel neighborhoods. Using the support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) feature selection algorithm, we obtain an excellent subset of superpixel features for segmentation to reduce the learning task difficulty. After that, the SAR images are transformed into graphs with superpixels as nodes, which are fed into the deeper graph convolutional neural network for node classification. SGDCN leverages a differentiable aggregation function to aggregate the node and neighbor features to form more advanced features. To validate our method, we manually annotated six typical large-scale SAR images covering the Baltic Sea and constructed a dark spot detection dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SGDCN is robust and effective compared with several competitive baselines. This dataset has been made publicly available along with this paper.

TI  - Structuralization of Complicated Lotic Habitats Using Sentinel-2 Imagery and Weighted Focal Statistic Convolution
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Deriving the proper structure of lotic habitats, namely the structuralization of lotic habitats, is crucial to monitoring and modeling water quality on a large scale. How to structuralize complicated lotic habitats for practical use remains challenging. This study novelly integrates remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS), and computer vision techniques to structuralize complicated lotic habitats. A method based on Sentinel-2 imagery and weighted focal statistic convolution (WFSC) is developed to structuralize the complicated lotic habitats into discrete river links. First, aquatic habitat image objects are delineated from Sentinel-2 imagery using geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA). These lotic habitat image objects are then separated from lentic habitat image objects using a hydrologically derived river network as a reference. Second, the binary image of the lotic habitat image objects is converted to a fuzzy magnitude surface using WFSC. The ridgelines on the magnitude surface are traced as the centerlines of river links. Finally, the centerlines of river links are used to split the complicated lotic habitats into discrete river links. Essential planar geometric attributes are then numerically derived from each river link. The proposed method was successfully applied to the braided river network in the Mobile River Basin in the U.S. The results indicate that the proposed method can properly structuralize lotic habitats with high spatial accuracy and correct topological consistency. The proposed method can also derive essential attributes that are difficult to obtain from conventional methods on a large scale. With sufficient measurements, a striking width-abundance pattern has been observed in our study area, indicating a promising logarithmic law in lotic habitat abundance.

AB  - A precise distribution map of wetlands can provide basic data of wetland conservation and management for Ramsar parties in each region. In this study, based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and Sentinel-2 images, the integrated inundation dynamic, phenological, and geographical features for a multi-class tropical wetland mapping method (IPG-MTWM) was used to generate the Southeast Asia wetland cover map (SEAWeC) in 2020, which has a 10 m spatial resolution with 11 wetland types. The overall accuracy (OA) of SEAWeC was 82.52%, which, in comparison with other mappings the SEAWeC, performs well. The results of SEAWeC show that (1) in 2020, the total wetland area in Southeast Asia was 123,268.61 km(2), (2) for the category I, the coastal wetlands has the largest area, reaching 58,534.78 km(2), accounting for 47.49%, (3) for the category II, the coastal swamp has the largest area, reaching 48,002.66 km(2), accounting for 38.94% of the total wetland area in Southeast Asia, and (4) significant difference in wetland rate (WR) between countries in Southeast Asia, in which Singapore has a WR of 6.96%, ranking first in Southeast Asia. The SEAWeC can provide the detailed spatial and type distribution data as basic data for the Southeast Asia to support the Ramsar strategic plan 2016-24.

TI  - Characterizing Spatiotemporal Patterns of Land Subsidence after the South-to-North Water Diversion Project Based on Sentinel-1 InSAR Observations in the Eastern Beijing Plain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The eastern Beijing plain has been suffering severe subsidence for the last decades, mainly associated with the long-term excessive extraction of groundwater resource. Since the end of 2014, the annual water supply in Beijing plain has reached several hundred million cubic meters because of the South-to-North Water Diversion (SNWD) Project, which has reduced the groundwater exploitation and changed the status of land subsidence. In this work, we first obtain the current spatiotemporal variations of land subsidence in the eastern Beijing plain by using progressive small baseline subsets (SBAS) InSAR time series analysis method with Sentinel-1 SAR data acquired from July 2015 to December 2021. Then, we analyze the correlations between InSAR-derived subsidence and groundwater level change by applying the cross wavelet method. The results show that two major subsidence zones are successfully detected with the maximum deformation rate of -150 mm/yr and maximum cumulative deformation of -950 mm. Besides, the ground deformation at different stages from 2016 to 2021 reveal that the area and magnitude of major deformation significantly slow down, even in the regions with severe subsidence, especially in the year of 2017, which is about two years later than the start time of SNWD Project in Beijing. Further, we find the InSAR-derived subsidence lags groundwater level change with about 1-2-month lagging time, indicating that the dynamic variation of groundwater level fluctuation may be the main factor affecting the uneven subsidence in the severe subsiding zones. Last, differential subsidence rates are identified at both sides of geological faults, such as Nankou-Sunhe fault and Nanyuan-Tongxian fault, from the observed deformation map, which could be explained that the groundwater flow is blocked when a fault is encountered. These findings can provide significant information to reveal the deformation mechanisms of land subsidence, establish the hydrogeological models and assist decision-making, early warning and hazard relief in Beijing, China.

TI  - DUPnet: Water Body Segmentation with Dense Block and Multi-Scale Spatial Pyramid Pooling for Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water body segmentation is an important tool for the hydrological monitoring of the Earth. With the rapid development of convolutional neural networks, semantic segmentation techniques have been used on remote sensing images to extract water bodies. However, some difficulties need to be overcome to achieve good results in water body segmentation, such as complex background, huge scale, water connectivity, and rough edges. In this study, a water body segmentation model (DUPnet) with dense connectivity and multi-scale pyramidal pools is proposed to rapidly and accurately extract water bodies from Gaofen satellite and Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) images. The proposed method includes three parts: (1) a multi-scale spatial pyramid pooling module (MSPP) is introduced to combine shallow and deep features for small water bodies and to compensate for the feature loss caused by the sampling process; (2) dense blocks are used to extract more spatial features to DUPnet's backbone, increasing feature propagation and reuse; (3) a regression loss function is proposed to train the network to deal with the unbalanced dataset caused by small water bodies. The experimental results show that the F1, MIoU, and FWIoU of DUPnet on the 2020 Gaofen dataset are 97.67%, 88.17%, and 93.52%, respectively, and on the Landsat River dataset, they are 96.52%, 84.72%, 91.77%, respectively.

TI  - The Temporal Evolution of Coastlines in the Bohai Sea and Its Impact on Hydrodynamics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past 40 years, increasing coastal reclamation and natural sedimentation has changed coastline positions and resulted in variation in the hydrodynamic environment in the Bohai Sea (BHS), China. Based on the Landsat series images, an interpretative identifier for identifying the coastline was proposed to assess the hydrodynamic changes caused by the coastline change and was applied to a typical case of the Bohai Sea (BHS), China. We combined a grid-based coastline position with an adjoint data assimilation method to seamlessly map the distribution of the amplitude, phase lag, and tidal current of the M-2 tidal constituent along the BHS's coast from 1985 to 2018. Our findings reveal that the coastline change at long time scales dominated reclamation, and around 72.9% of the coastline of the BHS mapped in 2018 had seaward movement compared with its position in 1985. From 1985 to 2018, the BHS volume decreased by 0.17%, the sea surface area decreased by 4.54%, and the kinetic energy increased by 2.53%. The change in the coastline increased the amplitude of the M-2 tidal constituent in the Bohai Bay by 6-14 cm and increased the residual current in the eastern coast of the Liaodong Bay by up to 0.07 (0.01) m/s.

TI  - Pixel Representation Augmented through Cross-Attention for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery Segmentation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural imagery segmentation has been transferred to land cover classification in remote sensing imagery with excellent performance. However, two key issues have been overlooked in the transfer process: (1) some objects were easily overwhelmed by the complex backgrounds; (2) interclass information for indistinguishable classes was not fully utilized. The attention mechanism in the transformer is capable of modeling long-range dependencies on each sample for per-pixel context extraction. Notably, per-pixel context from the attention mechanism can aggregate category information. Therefore, we proposed a semantic segmentation method based on pixel representation augmentation. In our method, a simplified feature pyramid was designed to decode the hierarchical pixel features from the backbone, and then decode the category representations into learnable category object embedding queries by cross-attention in the transformer decoder. Finally, pixel representation is augmented by an additional cross-attention in the transformer encoder under the supervision of auxiliary segmentation heads. The results of extensive experiments on the aerial image dataset Potsdam and satellite image dataset Gaofen Image Dataset with 15 categories (GID-15) demonstrate that the cross-attention is effective, and our method achieved the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 86.2% and 62.5% on the Potsdam test set and GID-15 validation set, respectively. Additionally, we achieved an inference speed of 76 frames per second (FPS) on the Potsdam test dataset, higher than all the state-of-the-art models we tested on the same device.

TI  - Classification of Ground-Based Cloud Images by Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds have an enormous influence on the hydrological cycle, Earth's radiation budget, and climate changes. Accurate automatic recognition of cloud shape based on ground-based cloud images is beneficial to analyze the atmospheric motion state and water vapor content, and then to predict weather trends and identify severe weather processes. Cloud type classification remains challenging due to the variable and diverse appearance of clouds. Deep learning-based methods have improved the feature extraction ability and the accuracy of cloud type classification, but face the problem of lack of labeled samples. In this paper, we proposed a novel classification approach of ground-based cloud images based on contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) to reduce the dependence on the number of labeled samples. First, data augmentation is applied to the input data to obtain augmented samples. Then contrastive self-supervised learning is used to pre-train the deep model with a contrastive loss and a momentum update-based optimization. After pre-training, a supervised fine-tuning procedure is adopted on labeled data to classify ground-based cloud images. Experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method. This study can provide inspiration and technical reference for the analysis and processing of other types of meteorological remote sensing data under the scenario of insufficient labeled samples.

TI  - The influence of individualistic worldviews on severe weather preparation.
T2  - Journal of emergency management (Weston, Mass.)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - How do people think they should prepare for tornadoes? To answer this question, we surveyed 340 people in six states in tornado alley and presented eight severe weather preparation choice sets that varied short and long-term benefits and costs with benefits or to the individual or to the community. Fifty-six percent of respondents preferred tornado preparations for the long-term that benefit individuals rather than the community. Correlations between personal characteristics, future expectations, and an individual's preferred preparation strategy show that being married, expecting stronger tornados, and having an individualistic worldview significantly increased the choice of individual preparation options. Past tornado experience and one's current protection level were not significantly related to individual-minded preparation choices. Out of 18 independent variables analyzed, individual worldview was the best predictor of a person's preferences. Individual worldview by itself had better predictive power than a regression model that included an individual's socioeconomic status, past severe weather experience, expectations about future tornados, and current protective measures for severe weather by itself. These findings can inform elected officials considering public policies for natural disaster preparedness and deciding between tradeoffs for keeping government costs low or providing benefits for everyone in the community. Our results are useful for planners and emergency managers who develop strategies to encourage tornado preparation by citizens in the community. For example, emergency managers can replicate the study with options specific to their community to determine what government communications or actions could prompt individuals to put protective measures in place.

TI  - Genome Assessment of Carbapenem- and Colistin-Resistant <i>Escherichia coli</i> from Patients in a Sentinel Hospital in China
T2  - CELLS
M3  - Article
AB  - Antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) pathogens are a significant threat to public health worldwide. However, the primary carrier of AMR genes, particularly against last-resort antibiotics, is still only partially studied in Chinese hospitals. In a sentinel hospital in China, we collected 157 E. coli strains from patients between January and July 2021. One bla(NDM-1)-, nine bla(NDM-5)-, and one mcr-1-positive E. coli recovered from inpatients were identified as resistant to meropenem and colistin. There are 37 virulence genes discovered in the 11 strains, including astA in strain EC21Z-147 (O128: H4), which belongs to the enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC). The bla(NDM) gene is distributed into distinct ST types, including ST48, ST616, ST410, ST711, and ST2003, while the mcr-1 gene was identified in ST117. The conjugative plasmids IncX3, IncI1-I, and IncI2 mediated the bla(NDM-5) and mcr-1 genes detected among inpatients. Notably, the youngest age at which mcr-1-positive E. coli has been reported was at one day old, in a child in which the strain is closely related to strains with animal origins. Hospitals are major environments for the spread and dissemination of critical virulence and AMR genes, which requires active monitoring systems at the genome level to surveil the spread of virulence and AMR.

TI  - An Investigation of Symptom Clusters and Sentinel Symptoms During the First 2 Cycles of Postoperative Chemotherapy in Patients With Lung Cancer
T2  - CANCER NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Lung cancer has the highest incidence and mortality of all cancers in China. Patients after a lobectomy experience serious physical and psychological symptoms during chemotherapy. Studies are lacking about symptom clusters (SCs) and sentinel symptoms during the postoperative chemotherapy period in lung cancer patients. Objective The aim of this study was to explore SCs and sentinel symptoms during cycles 1 and 2 of postoperative chemotherapy in patients with lung cancer. Methods Using a longitudinal study design, patients in treatment for lung cancer were measured at 2 separate points following a lobectomy: chemotherapy cycle 1 and chemotherapy cycle 2. The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory lung cancer-specific module and First Appearance of Symptoms Time Sheet were completed. Results A total of 180 postoperative patients with lung cancer participated in the study. Four SCs were identified at chemotherapy cycle 1: gastrointestinal SC, respiratory tract SC, psychological SC, and somatic SC. The sentinel symptoms were nausea, cough, sadness, and fatigue. At chemotherapy cycle 2, similar SCs were identified, with the exception of merging the psychological SC and somatic SC, resulting in 3 clusters: gastrointestinal SC, respiratory tract SC, and psychological-somatic SC. The sentinel symptoms were nausea, cough, and fatigue. Conclusions Symptom clusters and sentinel symptoms were stable during the first 2 cycles of postoperative chemotherapy in patients with lung cancer. Implications for Practice The understanding of SCs and sentinel symptoms could be beneficial to assess and manage both in postoperative patients with lung cancer during chemotherapy. Nurses should pay close attention to sentinel symptoms and develop effective interventions.

TI  - Potential of L- and C- Bands Polarimetric SAR Data for Monitoring Soil Moisture over Forested Sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the potential of L- and C- bands Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data to monitor soil moisture over the forested sites of SMAP Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12). The optimal backscattering coefficients and polarimetric parameters to characterize the soil moisture were determined based on L-band Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), C-band RADARSAT-2, and ground measurements composed of soil and vegetation parameters collected during SMAPVEX12. Linear and circular backscattering coefficients (sigma(0)) and polarimetric parameters such as correlation coefficients (rho(HHVV)) and phase difference (phi(HHVV)) between HH and VV, pedestal height (PH), entropy (H), anisotropy (A), alpha angle, surface (Ps), and double bounce (Pd) powers were used to develop the relationships with soil moisture. The analysis of these relationships shows that over the forested sites of SMAPVEX12: (a) at L-band several optimal backscattering coefficients and polarimetric parameters allow the monitoring of soil moisture, particularly the linear and circular sigma(0) (r = 0.60-0.96), Ps (r = 0.59-0.84), Pd (r = 0.60-0.82), rho(HHHV)_30 degrees, rho(VVHV)_30 degrees, phi(HHHV)_30 degrees and phi(HHVV)_30 degrees (r = 0.56-0.81). However, compared to the results obtained with sigma(0), there is no added value of the polarimetric parameters for soil moisture retrievals. (b) at C-band, only a few polarimetric parameters phi(HHHV), phi(VVHV), and phi(HHVV) are correlated with soil moisture (r = similar to 0.90). They can contribute to soil moisture retrievals over forested sites when L-band data are not available.

TI  - Evaluating the Impacts of Climate Change on Irrigation Water Requirements
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and its impact on agriculture and water resources have become a global concern. The implications of extreme weather events on food production and water resource availability are starting to have social and economic effects worldwide. The present research aims at integrating the analysis of the atmospheric parameters with remote sensing, geographic information systems, and CROPWAT 8 model to evaluate the impacts of climate change on the irrigation water requirements estimates in a selected area in El-Beheira governorate, Egypt. Remote sensing and GIS are incorporated to produce land-use/land-cover maps and soil properties maps. On the other hand, the atmospheric parameters were analyzed using python analytical coding. The study utilized the Land-use/Land-cover (LU/LC) map produced from Sentinel-2 data. The agricultural area covered about 89% of the studied area and was occupied by seven crops. Wheat and berseem were the major crops in the area and covered about 67% of the studied area; therefore, their irrigation water requirements were calculated utilizing the CROPWAT 8 model. Furthermore, citrus irrigation water requirements were also included in this research, even though it only covered 10% of the studied area because it had the highest amount of irrigation water requirements. Forecasting the potential climate changes under the best-case scenario for the next thirty years revealed that the studied area will have no rain and a slight decrease in the average temperature. Accordingly, the irrigation water requirements will increase by almost 4% under current practices, and the increase will reach about 13% under no-field loss practices.

TI  - Predicting Soil Textural Classes Using Random Forest Models: Learning from Imbalanced Dataset
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil provides a key interface between the atmosphere and the lithosphere and plays an important role in food production, ecosystem services, and biodiversity. Recently, demands for applying machine learning (ML) methods to improve the knowledge and understanding of soil behavior have increased. While real-world datasets are inherently imbalanced, ML models overestimate the majority classes and underestimate the minority ones. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of imbalance in training data on the performance of a random forest model (RF). The original dataset (imbalanced) included 6100 soil texture data from the surface layer of agricultural fields in northern Iran. A synthetic resampling approach using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was employed to make a balanced dataset from the original data. Bioclimatic and remotely sensed data, distance, and terrain attributes were used as environmental covariates to model and map soil textural classes. Results showed that based on mean minimal depth (MMD), when imbalanced data was used, distance and annual mean precipitation were important, but when balanced data were employed, terrain attributes and remotely sensed data played a key role in predicting soil texture. Balanced data also improved the accuracies from 44% to 59% and 0.30 to 0.52 with regard to the overall accuracy and kappa values, respectively. Similar increasing trends were observed for the recall and F-scores. It is concluded that, in modeling soil texture classes using RF models through a digital soil mapping approach, data should be balanced before modeling.

TI  - Function and Effect Analysis of a New Gene <i>Wx410</i> Regulating Amylose Synthesis in Rice
T2  - Zhongguo Shuidao Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - [Objective] Mining new allelic variants of the Wx gene and identifying the effect of the new Wx410 allele on rice quality traits. [Method] Using Wx(lv), Wx(a) and Wx(b) alleles as templates, the A-G point mutation at base 101 of exon 10 was performed by PCR, and Wx410 sentinel mutation plant expression vectors in different Wx allelic backgrounds (pEGFC-Wx(lv)410, pEGFC-Wx(a)410 and pEGFC-Wx(b)410) were constructed respectively, and the genetic effect of the variation at this locus on rice quality was analyzed by transforming the glutinous rice variety Suyunuo. [Results] The expression level of the Wx gene in the endosperm of the transgenic plants pEGFC-Wx(lv)410, pEGFC-Wx(a)410 and pEGFC-Wx(b)410 7 and 14 days after flowering was not significantly different from that of the positive control, while the activity of GBSS I was highly significantly lower than that of the positive control. The transgenic plants had significantly lower amylose content in mature seeds compared to the wild-type. pEGFC-Wx(a)410 and pEGFC-Wx(b)410 had significantly higher gelatinous consistency and pEGFC-Wx(lv)410 had significantly lower gelatinous consistency of endosperm compared to the positive control. [Conclusion] Wx410 is a new functional allele for starch synthesis in rice. The allele explains 4%-6% of amylose content variation, which just fills the gap in the range of amylose content regulated by the currently identified complex alleles, providing a richer genetic resource for rice taste and processing-related quality improvement.

TI  - Sentinel Node Biopsy Alone or With Axillary Dissection in Breast Cancer Patients After Primary Chemotherapy: Long-Term Results of a Prospective Interventional Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To ascertain, in cN0/1 breast cancer patients given primary chemotherapy followed by sentinel node biopsy (SNB), whether SNB alone is adequate axillary treatment if the sentinel nodes (SNs) are clear (pN0). Summary Background Data: 2020 guidelines do not recommend SNB in most cN1 patients with clear SNs after primary chemotherapy because the high SNB false negative rate might lead to poorer outcomes. Methods: We prospectively assigned SNB after primary chemotherapy to 353 consecutive cT2 cN0/1 patients, median age 47 years (range 22-76) treated from 2007 to 2015. If the SNs were pN0, patients generally received no further axillary treatment (SNB only); if the SNs were pN1, completion axillary dissection (AD) (SNB + AD) was usually performed. Primary outcomes were overall (OS) and disease-free (DFS) survival in SNB only versus SNB + AD patients, assessed by Kaplan-Meier and compared using log-rank test, with use of propensity scores to account for bias due to nonrandom assignment to SNB versus SNB + AD. Results: Median follow-up was 108 months, interquartile range 66 to 136. OS and DFS did not differ significantly between the groups by propensity score- weighted comparison: 10-year OS 89% [95% confidence interval (CI): 81%- 99%] in SNB only patients versus 86% (95%CI: 78%-95%) in SNB + AD patients; 10-year DFS 79% (95%CI: 68%-92%) versus 69% (95%CI: 58%-81%). No SNB-only patient developed axillary failure. Conclusions: cT2 cN0/1 patients whose SNs are disease-free (pN0) after primary chemotherapy can be offered SNB (with no further axillary treatment if the SNs are negative), irrespective of axillary status beforehand, without affecting OS or DFS.

TI  - Evaluating BFASTMonitor Algorithm in Monitoring Deforestation Dynamics in Coniferous and Deciduous Forests with LANDSAT Time Series: A Case Study on Marmara Region, Turkey
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series analysis combined with remote sensing data allows for the study of abrupt changes in the environment due to significant and severe disturbances such as deforestation, agricultural activities, fires, and urban expansion, as well as gradual changes such as climate variability and forest degradation in the ecosystem. The precision of any change detection analysis is highly dependent upon its ability to separate actual changes and fluctuations on a seasonal scale. One of the efficient methods in this context is using the Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) set of algorithms. This study aims to perform a comprehensive and comparative evaluation of different Vis' performance in forest degradation with the Landsat 8 images and BFASTMonitor approach. Through evaluation, the study also considers the potential effects of different forest types and deforestation scales in the Marmara region of Turkey. For this purpose, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) vegetation indices (VI) were selected for a comparative evaluation. The overall accuracy of VIs in deciduous forests was around 85% for NDVI, NDMI, and NBR, and 78.80% for EVI, while in coniferous forests, the overall accuracy demonstrated higher values of about 88% for NDVI, NDMI, and EVI, and 87.28% for NBR. Consequently, water-sensitive VIs that utilize shortwave infrared bands proved to be slightly more sensitive in detecting forest disturbances while chlorophyll-sensitive VIs represented lower accuracy for both forest types. Overall, all VIs faced an underestimation error in deforested area detection that was observable through negative BIAS. The results illuminate that BFASTMonitor can be considered as a tool in monitoring forest environments due to its acceptable deforestation determination capability in deciduous and coniferous forests, with slightly higher performance for small-scale deforestation patterned regions.

TI  - Data Set for the Reporting of Endometrial Cancer: Recommendations From the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Endometrial cancer is one of the most common cancers among women. The International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR) developed a standardized endometrial cancer data set in 2011, which provided detailed recommendations for the reporting of resection specimens of these neoplasms. A new data set has been developed, which incorporates the updated 2020 World Health Organization Classification of Female Genital Tumors, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) molecular classification of endometrial cancers, and other major advances in endometrial cancer reporting, all of which necessitated a major revision of the data set. This updated data set has been produced by a panel of expert pathologists and an expert clinician and has been subject to international open consultation. The data set includes core elements which are unanimously agreed upon as essential for cancer diagnosis, clinical management, staging, or prognosis and noncore elements which are clinically important, but not essential. Explanatory notes are provided for each element. Adoption of this updated data set will result in improvements in endometrial cancer patient care.

TI  - Physical Fitness Standards to Support Readiness and Deployability: An Examination of Department of the Air Force Policies and Culture.
T2  - Rand health quarterly
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - To ensure its service members have the requisite physical fitness to serve, the Department of the Air Force (DAF) has established a variety of medical and physical standards. The DAF also recognizes that building a more comprehensive understanding of how different factors influence exercise habits, test preparation, and the perceived importance of fitness is critical to promoting a ready and deployable force. The authors evaluate Air Force (AF) data relevant to the Tier 1 fitness assessment (FA) from all AF-FAs completed by active duty officers and enlisted personnel from fiscal year (FY) 2005 to FY 2018 to examine the fitness of the AF's active component. The Tier 1 FA consists of four components: a 1.5-mile run or 2.0-kilometer walk, designed to measure cardiorespiratory fitness; an abdominal circumference (AC) measurement for body composition; and push-ups and sit-ups, which assess muscular fitness. In this study, the authors explore the relationships between component fitness scores with career and health outcomes and examine airmen's perceptions of current fitness policies and the culture of fitness across the DAF. They conclude by recommending several strategies to improve the rationale for and the validity and acceptance of the AF-FA.

TI  - Duthchas, a Scottish Gaelic Methodology to Guide Self-Decolonization and Conceptualize a Kincentric and Relational Approach to Community-Led Research
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - A researcher's worldview shapes the research methodology, design, and ensuing relationship with participants and the local environment. Western research has traditionally been carried out on, rather than in collaboration with Indigenous Peoples and has largely been conducted through eurocentric and ethnocentric knowledge systems, methods, values, and beliefs which have perpetuated extractions, racisms, and harm. To counteract harmful research, Indigenous scholarship stresses the necessity of articulating and clarifying researcher positionality and self-location prior to embarking on research with or by Indigenous communities. A fundamental component of positionality and self-location is clarifying one's own relationships with colonialism and embarking on a process of self-decolonization. With this focus in mind, this paper shares methodological insights from an Anishinaabe community-led pilot project for Indigenous language revitalization in the Great Lakes Region of Turtle Island (also known as North and Central America) with participants to whom the researcher is related by marriage or known. This paper adds to existing qualitative methodological knowledge by introducing and operationalizing Duthchas-a millennia-old Scottish Gaelic concept, worldview, and way of life-as kincentric methodology. The researcher begins the methodological inquiry with his own positionality and self-location as a Gaidheal (Scottish Gael) who is not Indigenous to Turtle Island. Following Duthchas, the researcher identifies five key methodological principles that informed a kincentric and relational approach to community-led research. The paper demonstrates how Duthchas has served as a guide for the researcher's ongoing self-decolonization processes and for emplaced ethical relations. The paper illustrates how Duthchas enabled the researcher to be in-relation to the lands and Peoples where the research project took place and to conceptualize and conduct research as part of a greater Indigenous Anishinaabe research paradigm, Mino-Bimaadiziwin (The Good Life). Duthchas has implications for Indigenous-non-Indigenous reconciliatory relations and for the conceptualization and implementation of future (qualitative) research in-relation methodologies.

TI  - High-power microwaves response characteristics of silicon and GaAs solar cells
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEMICONDUCTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The high-power microwave (HPM) effect heats solar cells, which is an important component of a satellite. This creates a serious reliability problem and affects the normal operation of a satellite. In this paper, the different HPM response characteristics of two kinds of solar cells are comparatively researched by simulation. The results show that there are similarities and differences in hot spot distribution and damage mechanisms between both kinds of solar cell, which are related to the amplitude of HPM. In addition, the duty cycle of repetition frequency contributes more to the temperature accumulation of the solar cells than the carrier frequency. These results will help future research of damage assessment technology, reliability enhancement and the selection of materials for solar cells.

TI  - The age and origin of the Balleny and Scott volcanic provinces, Ross Sea, Antarctica
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Balleny and Scott volcanic provinces are two isolated and remote volcanic occurrences located along the rifted margin of Western Antarctica in the Ross Sea. They include oceanic plateaus, seamounts, and volcanic islands. Although volcanic activity has been documented through remote sensing, there is no geochronological data based on radio-isotope methods constraining the duration of the volcanic activity in this region. As a consequence, hypotheses, based on the interpretation of chemical characteristics of the lavas, that suggested the volcanism to be either the result a deep mantle plume or a large-scale shallow melting anomaly have not yet been tested decisively. In order to tackle this issue, we have now dated lavas dredged from seamounts from both Balleny and Scott provinces using the 40Ar/39Ar technique. Our new age dates suggest that the Balleny and Scott volcanic provinces were active since at least 2.8 Ma and 2.4 Ma respectively. This suggests that these volcanic provinces were active simultaneously to the magmatism of the McMurdo volcanic group in the Western Antarctica Rift System that comprises Mount Erebus and Mount Melbourne stratovolcanoes. Our new dates suggest that there is no obvious age trend across the Balleny and Scott provinces. Combined with plate reconstructions since the end of Mesozoic, these data suggest that the Scott province does not coincide with any potential hot-spot track, thus negating a deep mantle plume origin for this volcanism. The case of the Balleny province is more ambiguous. The hypothesis of this province representing the end of the Tasman seamounts chain formed by a hot-spot track with decreasing-age trend is not confirmed by the new geochronological data, since available dates for the region are rather scarce and unreliable for the Tasman seamounts. Therefore, we suggest that the Balleny and Scott provinces originated from shallow mantle melting processes, a hypothesis that seems to be consistent with our re-interpretation of the Sr-Nd-Pb isotope data of the lavas from the Balleny and Scott provinces. We argue that these provinces were derived from a heterogeneous subcontinental lithospheric mantle metasomatized during ancient subductions and which is now scattered in the shallow mantle of the southwest Pacific realm. This scattered mantle source component has been melting since the beginning of Cenozoic, and was then progressively depleted in the most fusible components. This new working model can explain the presence of several magmatic provinces in the southwest Pacific-Antarctica realm which show similar chemical signatures.In order to tackle this issue, we have now dated lavas dredged from seamounts from both Balleny and Scott provinces using the 40Ar/39Ar technique.

TI  - Range Spectral Filtering in SAR Interferometry: Methods and Limitations
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A geometrical decorrelation constitutes one of the sources of noise present in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferograms. It comes from the different incidence angles of the two images used to form the interferograms, which cause a spectral (frequency) shift between them. A geometrical decorrelation must be compensated by a specific filtering technique known as range filtering, the goal of which is to estimate this spectral displacement and retain only the common parts of the images' spectra, reducing the noise and improving the quality of the interferograms. Multiple range filters have been proposed in the literature. The most widely used methods are an adaptive filter approach, which estimates the spectral shift directly from the data; a method based on orbital information, which assumes a constant-slope (or flat) terrain; and slope-adaptive algorithms, which consider both orbital information and auxiliary topographic data. Their advantages and limitations are analyzed in this manuscript and, additionally, a new, more refined approach is proposed. Its goal is to enhance the filtering process by automatically adapting the filter to all types of surface variations using a multi-scale strategy. A pair of RADARSAT-2 images that mapped the mountainous area around the Etna volcano (Italy) are used for the study. The results show that filtering accuracy is improved with the new method including the steepest areas and vegetation-covered regions in which the performance of the original methods is limited.

TI  - Mapping Ice Flow Velocity of Tidewater Glaciers in Hornsund Fiord Area with the Use of Autonomous Repeat Image Feature Tracking (2018-2022)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamic climate changes are particularly apparent in polar regions. Glaciers are retreatng towards the land at a very fast pace. This study demonstrates the application of the feature tracking method in the analysis of ice flow velocity in the region of the Hornsund fiord, southern Spitsbergen, in the years 2018-2022. The calculations were based on the Geogrid and autoRIFT environments and on the Sentinel 1 images. The study also employed external data, such as a numerical terrain model and reference velocity values. The input data, e.g., the chip size and the search limit, were prepared accounting for the specific character of the investigated area. The velocities were calculated for nine biggest glaciers which terminated in the fiord. The accuracy of the results was identified by calculating the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the obtained displacement velocity values from the reference value for areas identified as stable. The study also attempted a causal analysis of the influence of weather factors on the dynamics of ice mass displacement. A systematic year-to-year decrease of the velocity was observed for the entire fiord. In the case of several glaciers, changes related to the ablation season (summer) are also clearly visible. The research results are promising and fill a research gap related to the absence of permanent monitoring and analysis of the dynamics of ice flow in polar regions. It is the first complex and precise study of glacier surface velocity changes, performed on the basis of satellite radar images for the entire Hornsund fiord.

TI  - Quantifying the Effects of Drought Using the Crop Moisture Stress as an Indicator of Maize and Sunflower Yield Reduction in Serbia
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The drought in Serbia in the summer of 2017 heavily affected agricultural production, decreasing yields of maize, sunflower, soybean, and sugar beet. Monitoring moisture levels in crops can provide timely information about potential risk within a growing season, thus helping to create an early warning system for various stakeholders. The purpose of this study was to quantify the level of moisture stress in crops during summer and the consequences that it can have on yields. For that, maize and sunflower yield data provided by an agricultural company were used at specific parcels in the Backa region of Vojvodina province (Serbia) for 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. The crop moisture level was estimated at each parcel by calculating the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) from Sentinel-2 data during the summer months (June-July-August). Based on the average NDMI value in July, the new crop moisture stress (CMS) index was introduced. The results showed that the CMS values at a specific parcel could be used for within-season estimation of maize and sunflower yield and the assessment of drought effects. The CMS index was tested for the current growing season of 2022 as an early warning system for yield reduction, demonstrating the potential to be included in a platform for digital agriculture, such as AgroSens, which is operational in Serbia.

TI  - Gap-filling of ocean color over the tropical Indian Ocean using Monte-Carlo method
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous remote-sensed daily fields of ocean color now span over two decades; however, it still remains a challenge to examine the ocean ecosystem processes, e.g., phenology, at temporal frequencies of less than a month. This is due to the presence of significantly large gaps in satellite data caused by clouds, sun-glint, and hardware failure; thus, making gap-filling a prerequisite. Commonly used techniques of gap-filling are limited to single value imputation, thus ignoring the error estimates. Though convenient for datasets with fewer missing pixels, these techniques introduce potential biases in datasets having a higher percentage of gaps, such as in the tropical Indian Ocean during the summer monsoon, the satellite coverage is reduced up to 40% due to the seasonally varying cloud cover. In this study, we fill the missing values in the tropical Indian Ocean with a set of plausible values (here, 10,000) using the classical Monte-Carlo method and prepare 10,000 gap-filled datasets of ocean color. Using the Monte-Carlo method for gap-filling provides the advantage to estimate the phenological indicators with an uncertainty range, to indicate the likelihood of estimates. Quantification of uncertainty arising due to missing values is critical to address the importance of underlying datasets and hence, motivating future observations.

TI  - The Multi-Satellite Environmental and Socioeconomic Predictors of Vector-Borne Diseases in African Cities: Malaria as an Example
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has been used for decades to produce vector-borne disease risk maps aiming at better targeting control interventions. However, the coarse and climatic-driven nature of these maps largely hampered their use in the fight against malaria in highly heterogeneous African cities. Remote sensing now offers a large panel of data with the potential to greatly improve and refine malaria risk maps at the intra-urban scale. This research aims at testing the ability of different geospatial datasets exclusively derived from satellite sensors to predict malaria risk in two sub-Saharan African cities: Kampala (Uganda) and Dar es Salaam (Tanzania). Using random forest models, we predicted intra-urban malaria risk based on environmental and socioeconomic predictors using climatic, land cover and land use variables among others. The combination of these factors derived from different remote sensors showed the highest predictive power, particularly models including climatic, land cover and land use predictors. However, the predictive power remained quite low, which is suspected to be due to urban malaria complexity and malaria data limitations. While huge improvements have been made over the last decades in terms of remote sensing data acquisition and processing, the quantity and quality of epidemiological data are not yet sufficient to take full advantage of these improvements.

TI  - Monitoring and Integrating the Changes in Vegetated Areas with the Rate of Groundwater Use in Arid Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent water table measurements are crucial for sustainable groundwater management in arid regions. Such monitoring is more important in areas that are already facing an acute problem with excessive groundwater withdrawal. In the majority of these locations, continuous readings of groundwater levels are lacking. Therefore, an approximate estimate of the rate of increase or decrease in water consumption over time may serve as a proxy for the missing data. This could be achieved by tracking the changes in vegetated areas that generally correlate with changes in the rate of water use. The technique proposed in this paper is based on two remote sensing datasets: Landsat 7 and 8 from 2001 to 2021, and Sentinel 2A from 2015 to 2021, as well as five vegetation indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index (RDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Transformed Vegetation Index (TVI). The findings have shown that the datasets chosen performed best for small-scale land farms at the research location, which was chosen to be the El-Qaa plain, in the southwestern corner of the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt. Landsat 7 data with a resolution of 30 m revealed a substantial increase in land farms from 2.9 km(2) in 2001 to 23.3 km(2) in 2021. By using the five indices based on Sentinel 2A data, vegetated areas were categorized as heavy, moderate, or light. In addition, the expansion of each class area from 2015 to 2021 was tracked. Additionally, the NDVI index was modified to better reflect the arid environment (subsequently naming this new index as the Arid Vegetation Index: AVI). Rough scenarios of the increase in water consumption rate at the research site were generated by observing the increase in vegetated areas and collecting rough information from the farmers regarding the crop types.

AB  - Introduction: Hospitals are essential for the universal coverage of any health system, as well as sources of valuable information on adverse events and technical complaints of products subjects to health surveillance. Objective: To identify the potentialities and limitations of the Sentinel Network to improve post-marketing/post-use monitoring of products subject to health surveillance adopted by Anvisa. Method: A descriptive quantitative study that used data from a national administrative survey applied to the Sentinel Network, which was conducted between August 4 and September 2, 2021, by the Anvisa. Data were collected using an electronic structured questionnaire. Statistical analyzes were performed in the Gretl-2022a software, including the calculation of absolute and relative frequencies, medians, and interquartile ranges. Results: A response rate of 69.1% (181/262) was obtained. Among the potentialities, the following stand out: acting as a center for study, teaching, and research of health establishments (n = 145; 80.1%), presence of implanted electronic medical records (n = 142; 78.4%) and the development of initiatives focused on innovation involving risk management of health products (n = 94; 52.0%). As one of the limitations, health establishments that do not have any current excellence/quality certifications predominate (n = 104; 57.5%). Conclusions: The Sentinel Network has several potentialities and limitations that affect the post-marketing/post-use monitoring of products subject to health surveillance. Identifying them, as was the objective of this study, demonstrates the need to promote actions that offer the possibility of expanding the potentialities and mitigate the limiting factors to the improvement of post-marketing/post-use monitoring adopted by Anvisa.

TI  - Mitigating the Mistletoe Menace: Biotechnological and Smart Management Approaches
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary In this article, we discuss the current status of conventional management and control approaches for mistletoes, the hemiparasitic plants that have emerged as serious pests of trees in forests and commercial fruit and timber plantations. We highlight the research and implementation gaps and discuss possible newer biotechnological interventions to be made in relation to biological control agents and mistletoe-resistant tree cultivars. We also discuss the potential of smart technological alternatives that find synergies with conventional approaches. Mistletoes have been considered a keystone resource for biodiversity, as well as a remarkable source of medicinal attributes that attract pharmacologists. Due to their hemiparasitic nature, mistletoes leach water and nutrients, including primary and secondary metabolites, through the vascular systems of their plant hosts, primarily trees. As a result of intense mistletoe infection, the hosts suffer various growth and physiological detriments, which often lead to tree mortality. Because of their easy dispersal and widespread tropism, mistletoes have become serious pests for commercial fruit and timber plantations. A variety of physical and chemical treatment methods, along with silvicultural practices, have shaped conventional mistletoe management. Others, however, have either failed to circumvent the growing range and tropism of these parasitic plants or present significant environmental and public health risks. A biocontrol approach that could sidestep these issues has never achieved full proof of concept in real-field applications. Our review discusses the downsides of conventional mistletoe control techniques and explores the possibilities of biotechnological approaches using biocontrol agents and transgenic technologies. It is possible that smart management options will pave the way for technologically advanced solutions to mitigate mistletoes that are yet to be exploited.

TI  - Consistent Changes in Land-Use/Land-Cover in Semi-Arid Areas: Implications on Ecosystem Service Delivery and Adaptation in the Limpopo Basin, Botswana
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems in semi-arid areas remain essential to securing livelihoods and aiding climate change adaptation. However, land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) is the leading driver of biodiversity, ecosystem services, habitat, and ecosystem loss in most rural areas of developing countries. We evaluated LULCC in the Bobirwa sub-district of Botswana between 1995 and 2015. We employed the supervised classification's maximum likelihood algorithm on the 1995, 2005, and 2016 Landsat images to establish the implications of LULCC on the delivery of provisioning ecosystem services (ES) and ecosystem-based adaptation in the Limpopo Basin part of Botswana. Five major LULC classes-vegetation, cropland, bare land, built-up areas, and water bodies-were identified in the sub-district. The decline in vegetation by 50.67 km(2)/year between 1995 and 2016 was characterized by an increase in croplands (34.02 km(2)/year). These changes were attributed to the growing human population that induced farming households to expand croplands. Government programs also encouraged agricultural expansions by offering free inputs and compensating smallholder farmers for land preparation. Higher agricultural yields remained critically low while the loss of vegetated areas to croplands threatened biodiversity, habitats, and the sustainability of provisioning ES through impaired ecosystem functions. There is an urgent need to arrest all unnecessary agricultural expansions and enhance agricultural productivity from current land parcels. The government and other relevant stakeholders also need to strengthen the ecosystem management capacities of local communities and support them to develop and implement biodiversity-based village action plans. Engaging communities through participatory, biodiversity-based action planning promotes biodiversity conservation and the sustainable use of ecosystem resources.

TI  - Mapping Floristic Composition Using Sentinel-2A and a Case Study Evaluation of Its Application in Elephant Movement Ecology in Sagalla, Kenya
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification of vegetation structure and composition at local and global scales provides valuable information for understanding the balance of the natural and human-made environment, which is crucial for natural resource planning and management, and the sustenance of ecosystem biodiversity. In this study, we proposed using the Sentinel 2A imagery to classify vegetation cover into communities based on the floristic association of individual vegetation species. We apply traditional remote sensing techniques to process the satellite image and identify training regions of interest (ROI) which are thoroughly assessed for spectral uniqueness before using the pixel-based supervised classification algorithms for our classification. Ground truthing assessment and species dominance computations are done to determine the vegetation community composition and naming based on floristic associations. We apply the floristic compositions output in analysing elephant movement tracks in the area, to assess the potential influence the location of specific vegetation species and communities utilized by elephants has on their movement and presence, as well as on elephant bulls and family groupings. The results show that the 10 m spatial resolution Sentinel-2A is suitable for investigating and mapping vegetation species in communities for large-scale mapping operations. We determined Near-Infrared band 8 and shortwave Infrared band 11 as key for identifying and differentiating ROIs at the floristic association community vegetation mapping level. We attained an overall accuracy of 87.395%. The analysis proved the 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel 2A to be sufficient in distinguishing vegetation communities, including those with similar dominant species but variations in other contributing species. We also found a direct connection between vegetation location and elephant movement based on the summative analysis of utilised vegetation by the different elephant groupings. Bull elephants were predominantly present in areas with Combretum, family groups in areas with Commiphora, and mixed groups with both bulls and families in areas with Commiphora, and Cissus. This study shows the value that remote-sensing scientific support can offer conservationists and governments in objective evidence-based land management, policy making and governance.

TI  - From wetlands to wetlandscapes: Remote sensing calibration of process-based hydrological models in heterogeneous landscapes
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are vital components of landscapes that sustain a range of important ecosystem services. Understanding how wetland-rich landscapes-or wetlandscapes-will evolve under a changing climate and increasing anthropogenic encroachment is urgent. Wetlandscapes are highly heterogeneous, and scaling local modelling insights from individual instrumented wetlands to characterize landscape-scale dynamics has been a pervasive challenge. We investigate the potential to use water extent information from satellite imagery to calibrate landscape-scale process-based hydrological models. Applications to wetlandscapes in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) in North Dakota and the Texas Playa Lakes (TPL) shed light on two important trade-offs. First, in-situ monitoring provides accurate water extent information on an arbitrary subset of wetlands, whereas satellite imagery captures landscape-scale hydrological dynamics but suffers persistent water-detection challenges. Satellite imagery is a superior source of data for model calibration in sparsely monitored and spatially heterogeneous landscapes like the PPR, where the sampling uncertainty of monitored wetlands exceeds the water detection uncertainty of remote sensing. The two data sources are equivalent for more homogeneous landscapes like the TPL. The second tradeoff concerns the spatial resolution and temporal coverage of satellite imagery. In that regard, the 20 years of bi-weekly images captured by Landsat 7 provides unprecedented insights into the dynamic nature of the ecohydrological characteristics of wetlandscapes, such as seasonal and inter-annual changes of their metapopulation capacity. In the PPR, the amplitude of these dynamics far exceeds the bias introduced by Landsat's inability to capture ecologically important connectivity details due to its coarse spatial resolution compared to more recent imagery.

TI  - Geospatial Analysis of Abandoned Lands Based on Agroecosystems: The Distribution and Land Suitability for Agricultural Land Development in Indonesia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indonesian land area is 191.1 million ha, part of which is abandoned land in various agroecosystems that have the potential for expanding the agricultural area. The purpose of this research was to geospatially analyze abandoned land based on its agroecosystem at the national and district levels, as well as to evaluate the land suitability of the land for expanding agricultural development. The methods included: (1) geospatial analysis of the national land cover map at a scale of 1:250,000 combined with soil and climate information to identify abandoned land and examine its agroecosystem, (2) selecting representative districts in each agroecosystem for visual interpretation using high-resolution imagery, i.e., SPOT 6/7, (3) assessing the land suitability of abandoned land for agricultural development at the national and district levels, and (4) predicting national abandoned land and its land suitability. The essential finding is the identification of abandoned land at around 42.6 million ha in Indonesia distributed over six agroecosystems, with the widest being in dry lowland and wet climates. Then, 54 districts were selected to characterize abandoned land by using SPOT 6/7 high-resolution imagery and were interpreted visually. It was found that the abandoned land covered approximately 16.9 million ha. The distribution of abandoned land from the interpretation of satellite imagery was smaller than that of geospatial analysis due to differences in the map scale and the use of ancillary data. The identification of abandoned land from high-resolution imagery should be carried out for all regions of Indonesia to accurately map the distribution of the abandoned land and characterize the properties. However, it requires a large amount of time, cost, and facilities to complete the inventory. The geospatial analysis that combined imageries and ancillary data identified 27.7 million ha of abandoned land suitable for expanding the agricultural area. The largest suitable abandoned land for the purpose was found in the lowlands with a wet climate, especially in Papua, Kalimantan, and Sumatra islands. The identified suitable abandoned land of 54 districts differed by scale, in which it was 11.2 million ha at the scale of 1:250,000 and 8.5 million ha at the scale of 1:50,000, respectively. The potential land expansion for food crops, particularly paddy fields, was only 2.2 million ha, located in mineral swamp land, which was predominantly located in Papua, with inadequate accessibility. Expanding paddy fields for national food security in the future would be constrained by less suitable land resources, while the near future challenge is the competition of land allocation for agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, as well as for food crops and plantations.

TI  - An Empirical Correction Model for Remote Sensing Data of Global Horizontal Irradiance in High-Cloudiness-Index Locations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Facing the energy transition, solar energy, whether thermal or electric, is currently one of the most viable alternatives, due to its technological maturity and its ease of operation and maintenance compared to other renewable energies. However, before its implementation, it is necessary to assess its potential. Remote sensing represents one of the low-cost solutions for solar energy assessment. Nevertheless, cloud cover is a main problem when validating the data. This study identifies satellite GHI profiles that cannot be used in energy production simulation. The validation is performed using parametric and non-parametric statistical tests. From the profile identified as invalid for simulation purposes, a site-adaptation methodology is proposed based on statistical learning using the machine learning algorithms "Best subset selection" and "Forward Stepwise Selection". Linear and non-linear heuristic models are also proposed. The final AS7 model is selected through RMSE, MBE and adjusted R-2 indicators and is valid for any sky condition. The results show an increase in R-2 from 0.607 to 0.876.

TI  - Multidecadal Trend Analysis of Armenian Mountainous Grassland and Its Relationship to Climate Change Using Multi-Sensor NDVI Time-Series
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of links between satellite-measured vegetation vigor and climate variables in Armenian mountain grassland ecosystems in the years 1984-2018. NDVI is derived from MODIS and LANDSAT data, temperature and precipitation data are from meteorological stations. Two study sites were selected, representing arid and semi-arid grassland vegetation types, respectively. Various trend estimators including Mann-Kendall (MK) and derivatives were combined for vegetation change analysis at different time scales. Results suggest that temperature and precipitation had negative and positive impacts on vegetation growth, respectively, in both areas. NDVI-to-precipitation correlation was significant but with an apparent time-lag effect that was further investigated. No significant general changes were observed in vegetation along the observed period. Further comparisons between results from corrected and uncorrected data led us to conclude that MODIS and LANDSAT data with BRDF, topographic and atmospheric corrections applied are best suited for analyzing relationships between NDVI and climatic factors for the 2000-2018 period in grassland at a very local scale; however, in the absence of correction tools and information, uncorrected data can still provide meaningful results. Future refinements will include removal of anthropogenic impact, and deeper investigation of time-lag effects of climatic factors on vegetation dynamics.

TI  - The Analysis of Japanese Fairy Tales Using Propp?s Structural-typological Narratives by Japanese Language Learners
T2  - GEMA ONLINE JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fairy tales reflect the great social values of certain cultures. Individual genres and works of fairy tales represent projections of the worldview of people in the respective society. However, reading and understanding fairy tales from other countries are not enough to identify structural and typological differences between tales of the same genre that differ in origin. In literature classes, students often focus on the narrative while missing the structural features of fairy tales. In this study, the structural-typological functions of narrative proposed by Propp (1986) were used as a methodological approach to draw students' attention to the distinctive cultural features of some Japanese fairy tales. The results show that students classified Japanese tales as differing greatly in structural and typological variation compared to European tales. Students realized that in Japanese fairy tales, the ending does not always lead the hero to the typical victory of good over evil, but sometimes leaves a certain bitterness of reality where the ending is guessed by the reader, which gives the tale a debatable narrative character that is unique. This methodological approach helps students analyse fairy tales in greater depth, identify the uniqueness of the narratives, and delve into the essence of structural and functional analysis, which gives students a deep understanding of the tales and its culture. The findings of this study can be applied to the identification of the functions and roles of the characters in fairy tales, and the analysis of structured storylines.

TI  - Actual Evapotranspiration Estimation Using Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-3 SLSTR Data Combined with a Gradient Boosting Machine Model in Busia County, Western Kenya
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Kenya is dominated by a rainfed agricultural economy. Recurrent droughts influence food security. Remotely sensed data can provide high-resolution results when coupled with a suitable machine learning algorithm. Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-3 SLSTR sensors can provide the fundamental characteristics for actual evapotranspiration (AET) estimation. This study aimed to estimate the actual monthly evapotranspiration in Busia County in Western Kenya using Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-3 SLSTR data with the application of the gradient boosting machine (GBM) model. The descriptive analysis provided by the model showed that the estimated mean, minimum, and maximum AET values were 116, 70, and 151 mm/month, respectively. The model performance was assessed using the correlation coefficient (r) and root mean square error (RMSE). The results revealed a correlation coefficient of 0.81 and an RMSE of 10.7 mm for the training dataset (80%), and a correlation coefficient of 0.47 and an RMSE of 14.1 mm for the testing data (20%). The results are of great importance scientifically, as they are a conduit for exploring alternative methodologies in areas with scarce meteorological data. The study proves the efficiency of high-resolution data retrieved from Sentinel sensors coupled with machine learning algorithms, focusing on GBM as an alternative to accurately estimate AET. However, the optimal solution would be to obtain direct evapotranspiration measurements.

TI  - Beamforming and Band Allocation for Satellite and High-Altitude Platforms Cognitive Systems
T2  - IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we consider a cognitive radio network consisting of broadcast satellite service (BSS), high-density fixed-satellite service (HDFSS), and high-altitude platforms (HAPs) systems. The spectrum utilization within a satellite beam coverage is increased by deploying extra HAPs in the pre-determined hot-spot regions to existing cognitive systems in which the BSS and HDFSS share frequency bands. Since the multiple network nodes simultaneously employ the same frequency band, there exists a challenge to efficiently mitigate the interference between them. Therefore, we propose an iterative precoding and band allocation algorithm for multi-antenna HAPs to maximize the network data rate. In addition, we present other low-complexity techniques and compare them through simulation results.

TI  - Hydraulic Modeling and Remote Sensing Monitoring of Floodhazard in Arid Environments-A Case Study of Laayoune City in Saquia El Hamra Watershed Southern Morocco
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Morocco often faces significant intense rainfall periods that can generate flash floods and raging torrents, causing serious damage in a very short period of time. This study aims to monitor wetland areas after a flash-flood event in an arid region, Saquia El hamra Saharan of Morocco, using a technique that combines hydraulic modeling and remote sensing technology, namely satellite images. The hydrological parameters of the watershed were determined by the WMS software. Flood flow was modeled and simulated using HEC HMS and HEC-RAS software. To map the flooded areas, two satellite images (Sentinel-2 optical images) taken before and after the event were used. Three classifications were carried out using two powerful classifiers: support vector machines and decision tree. The first classifier was applied on both dates' images, and the resulting maps were used as input for a constructed decision tree model as a post-classification change detection process.

TI  - Direct Detection of Severe Biomass Burning Aerosols from Satellite Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The boundary between high-concentration aerosols (haze) and clouds is ambiguous and the mixing of aerosols and clouds is complex in terms of composition and structure. In particular, the contribution of biomass burning aerosols (BBAs) to global warming is a source of uncertainty in the global radiation budget. In a previous study, we proposed a method to detect absorption aerosols such as BBAs and dust using a simple indicator based on the ratio of violet to near-ultraviolet wavelengths from the Global Change Observation Mission-Climate/Second-Generation Global Imager (GCOM-C/SGLI) satellite data. This study adds newly obtained SGLI data and proposes a method for the direct detection of severe biomass burning aerosols (SBBAs). Moreover, polarization data derived from polarization remote sensing was incorporated to improve the detection accuracy. This is possible because the SGLI is a multi-wavelength sensor consisting of 19 channels from 380 nm in the near-ultraviolet to thermal infrared, including red (674 nm) and near-infrared (869 nm) polarization channels. This method demonstrated fast SBBA detection directly from satellite data by using two types of wavelength ratio indices that take advantage of the characteristics of the SGLI data. The SBBA detection algorithm derived from the SGLI observation data was validated by using the polarized reflectance calculated by radiative transfer simulations and a regional numerical model-scalable computing for advanced library and environment (SCALE). Our algorithm can be applied to the detection of dust storms and high-concentration air pollution particles, and identifying the type of high-concentration aerosol facilitates the subsequent detailed characterization of the aerosol. This work demonstrates the usefulness of polarization remote sensing beyond the SGLI data.

TI  - Evaluating Optical Remote Sensing Methods for Estimating Leaf Area Index for Corn and Soybean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a key crop biophysical variable influencing many vegetation processes. Spatial LAI estimates are essential to develop and improve spatial modeling tools to monitor vegetation conditions at large regional scales. Numerous optical remote sensing methods have been explored to retrieve crop-specific LAI at a regional scale using satellite observations. However, a major challenge is selecting a method that performance well under various conditions without local scale calibration. As such, we assessed the performance of existing statistical and physical approaches, developed based on parametric, non-parametric and radiative transfer model (RTM)-look-up-table based inversion, using field observations from two geographically distant locations and Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellite observations. These methods were implemented for corn and soybeans cultivated at two locations in the U.S (i.e., Mead, Nebraska, and Bushland, Texas). The evaluation metrics (i.e., Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Coefficient of Determination (R-2)) were used to study the performance of each method, and then the methods were ranked based on these metrics. Our study showed that overall parametric methods outperformed other methods. The RMSE (MAE) for the top five methods was less than 1.3 (0.95) for corn and 1.0 (0.8) for soybeans, irrespective of location. Even though they outperformed, parametric methods exhibited inconsistency in their performance. For instance, the SR_CA_cross method ranked 1 for corn, however, it performed poorly for soybean (ranked 15). The non-parametric methods showed moderate accuracy partly due to the availability of a smaller number of observations for training. The RTM-LUT inversion physical-based approach was found to perform reasonably well RMSE (MAE) less than 1.5 (1.0) consistently irrespective of location and crop, implying that this approach is more suitable for regional-scale LAI estimation. The results of this study highlighted the drawbacks and advantages of available optical remote sensing approaches to estimate LAI for corn and soybean crops using Landsat imagery. These results are of interest for remote sensing and modeling communities developing spatial-scale approaches to model and monitor agricultural vegetation.

TI  - Biography and work of M.Yu. Lermontov in the poetic reflection of G.V. Ivanova (on the material of emigrant lyrics)
T2  - FILOLOGICHESKIE NAUKI-NAUCHNYE DOKLADY VYSSHEI SHKOLY-PHILOLOGICAL SCIENCES-SCIENTIFIC ESSAYS OF HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the material of G.V. Ivanov's emigrant lyrics, the author examines some content-formal features of his poetic reflection aimed at compre- hending the biography and creativity of Lermon- tov. Its evolution, functions and methods of artistic embodiment are characterized. It is shown that this creative reflection forms the Lermontov code of Iva- nov's poetics, which participates in the process of Ivanov's cultural self-identification and ensures the creation of a special "ensemble unity " in his diary lyrics. The interpretation of images and motifs per- ceived from Lermontov in Ivanov's foreign poetry is invariably accompanied by the leitmotifofa plucked and withering rose, which plays the role of a kind of semantic accompaniment. The archetype of the rose is interpreted by Ivanov in the key of the Dante tradition: as a sign of involvement in the world of creative choice and beauty. At the same time, the image of a withering rose in Ivanov's "Lermontov " poems, as well as in the space of all his emigrant poetry, symbolizes beauty broken by the elements of evil. Most often, Ivanov's poetic reflection results in a lyrical dialogue with Lermontov, expressed in an intertextual game. The specificity ofIvanov's artistic reflection is largely determined by his ecphrastic worldview. The phenomenon of Lermontov is re- vealed to Ivanov through the prism of the creative individuality of his favorite painters: Watteau and Vrubel, who are perceived as spiritual and creative counterparts of the great Russian poet of the 19th nineteenth century. The evolution ofIvanov's poetic reflection, focused on understanding Lermontov's biography and creativity, is generally subject to ex- istential intention and is associated with the trend ofironic and parodic development ofthe Lermontov tradition.

TI  - A Low-Cost Web Application System for Monitoring Geometrical Impacts of Surface Subsidence
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper develops a low-cost web application system for monitoring geometrical impacts of surface subsidence. In many of the developing countries, the method of extraction of minerals such as coal is often impractical and uneconomical, especially with surface mining. With global warming, rapid population growth, and fast-growing urbanization with a disregard for sustainability, the overall subsidence risk has significantly increased. Despite the maturity of Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) for timely monitoring of subsidence hazards, the potential of SAR constellations has been under-exploited, as most applications focus mainly on mapping unstable areas. The developed web application system exploits Sentinel-1 SAR constellation and Small-BAseline Subset (SBAS-DInSAR) technique, to provide new streamlines of information for monitoring solutions and improve disaster risk decision making. We illustrate the model by investigating and measuring potential surface subsidence caused by underground hard coal mining activities and exponential urban population growth within a major coalmine in Nigeria. Results of the yearly cumulative amount of horizontal and vertical deformation between 2016 and 2020 range from -25.487 mm to -50.945 mm and -24.532 mm to -57.161 mm, for high and low risks, respectively. Under the influence of external factors such as rising poverty and fast-growing urbanization, the destruction of in situ stress distributions will likely increase nonlinear deformations.

TI  - Mapping Burned Areas with Multitemporal-Multispectral Data and Probabilistic Unsupervised Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of forest fires has increased significantly in recent years across the planet. Events of this nature have resulted in the leveraging of new automated methodologies to identify and map burned areas. In this paper, we introduce a unified data-driven framework capable of mapping areas damaged by fire by integrating time series of remotely sensed multispectral images, statistical modeling, and unsupervised classification. We collect and analyze multiple remote-sensing images acquired by the Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Terra satellites between August-October 2020, validating our proposal with three case studies in Brazil and Bolivia whose affected regions have suffered from recurrent forest fires. Besides providing less noisy mappings, our methodology outperforms other evaluated methods in terms of average scores of 90%, 0.71, and 0.65 for overall accuracy, F1-score, and kappa coefficient, respectively. The proposed method provides spatial-adherence mappings of the burned areas whose segments match the estimates reported by the MODIS Burn Area product.

T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the remote sensing data obtained by the Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B satellites in the years 2016-2021, a local accumulation of oil slicks in the Barents Sea in 53 synthetic aperture radar images is delineated in the area with coordinates 75.2 degrees-75.3 degrees N and 31.5 degrees-31.8 degrees E. The study of an undisturbed core in this area (station 7105, 84th cruise of the R/V Akademik Mstislav Keldysh) has shown an anomalous distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs, the concentrations of which increased at the lower horizons of the column, and 2-methylnaphthalene, a marker of oil genesis, dominated in their composition; at the same time, the share of light homologs in the composition of alkanes increased. All this points to the natural formation of hydrocarbons in the sea bottom sediments, and it is definite that the group of oil slicks detected from the satellite radar data is a natural oil seep.

TI  - Dual State-Parameter Assimilation of SAR-Derived Wet Surface Ratio for Improving Fluvial Flood Reanalysis
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is one of the most devastating natural hazards to which our society worldwide must adapt, especially as its severity and occurrence tend to increase with climate changes. This research work focuses on the assimilation of two-dimensional (2D) flood observations derived from remote-sensing images acquired during overflowing events. To do so, the resulting binary wet/dry maps are expressed in terms of wet surface ratios (WSR) over a number of floodplain subdomains. This ratio is assimilated jointly with in-situ water-level gauge observations to improve the flow dynamics within the floodplain. An Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) with a dual state-parameter analysis approach is implemented on top of a TELEMAC-2D hydrodynamic model. The EnKF control vector is composed of spatially-distributed friction coefficients and a corrective parameter of the inflow discharge. It is extended with the hydraulic states within the floodplain subdomains. This data assimilation strategy was validated and evaluated over a reach of the Garonne river. The observation operator associated with the WSR observations, as well as the dual state-parameter sequential correction, was first validated in the context of Observing System Simulation Experiments. It was then applied to two real flood events that occurred in 2019 and 2021. The merits of assimilating synthetic aperture radar-derived WSR observations, in complement to the in-situ water-level observations, are shown in the parameter and observation spaces with assessment metrics computed over the entire flood events. It is also shown that the hydraulic state correction within the dual state-parameter analysis approach significantly improves the flood dynamics, especially during the flood recess.

TI  - Assessing Sea Surface Temperatures Estimated from Fused Infrared and Microwave Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST), a critical parameter of the global ocean-atmosphere system, is an essential element in the study and in the application of marine science. Satellite-infrared observations currently represent the only available method for continuous, large-scale observation of SST. Although passive microwave observations are not blocked by clouds, allowing for data collection in all weather conditions, this technological tool is characterized by low spatial resolution. Conversely, infrared observations offer high resolution but are susceptible to cloud obscuration. Accordingly, a technique that effectively fuses microwave and infrared satellite observations into a high-resolution SST field with global coverage close to the actual distribution is of practical significance. This paper describes fusing MODIS infrared remote sensing and AMSR-2 microwave remote sensing SST data with an optimal interpolation (OI) approach to produce a high-resolution SST data. The study chose the coastal Kuroshio region of China to establish an appropriate scale for examining the spatial structure of SST and attaining a more realistic picture of SST observations and impacts. The included discussion of the sources of error in the fusion process provides a reference for improving the accuracy of fused marine remote sensing data. The study also compared the fused SST results and the current international mainstream multi-temporal resolution of the three using the OI algorithm. We compared the fusion product with ARGO data with and without typhoon impact to explore and practice the OI in SST fusion when evaluating the accuracy of different data in the case of external disturbance being present. The research results have great significance for improving regional SST forecast accuracy while ensuring the applicability of various approaches to fusing SST data by incorporating the influence of typhoons in the offshore region of the East China Sea (ECS). Implications for the future development of SST fusion data are also included in the discussion.

TI  - Retrieving the Motion of Beaufort Sea Ice Using Brightness Temperature Data from FY-3D Microwave Radiometer Imager
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice is an important marine phenomenon in the Arctic region, and it is of great importance to study the motion of Arctic sea ice in the present day when its melting is accelerated by global warming. This study proposes a method to retrieve the motion of sea ice based on the maximum cross-correlation (MCC) and the successive correction method (SCM). The proposed method can apply different scales of search ranges to template matching according to the location of sea ice in the Arctic area. In addition, the data assimilation method can assign different weights to different data. We used 36.5 GHz and 89 GHz brightness temperature (T-b) data from the microwave radiometer imager (MWRI) aboard the Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) satellite, for the first time in the literature, to retrieve the sea ice motion in the Beaufort Sea from January to April 2019. The retrieved sea ice motion results were in good agreement with those obtained from the motion of the buoys. Compared with the data from the buoys, the root mean-squared error (RMSE) of the sea ice motion retrieved from FY-3D/MWRI Tb data was 1.1418 cm/s in the zonal direction and 1.0481 cm/s in the meridional direction, and the mean absolute error (MAE) between them was 0.7166 cm/s in the zonal direction and 0.6777 cm/s in the meridional direction. The RMSE between the sea ice motion obtained from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and the motion of the buoys was 0.9515 cm/s in the zonal direction and 0.67003 cm/s in the meridional direction, and the MAE between them was 0.6576 cm/s in the zonal direction and 0.4922 cm/s in the meridional direction. The RMSE of daily average velocity from the FY-3D/MWRI results and NSIDC data product was 2.2726 cm/s in zonal and 1.9270 cm/s in meridional, and the MAE was 1.5103 cm/s in zonal and 1.1071 cm/s in zonal. The density of the merged data was higher than that obtained from a single polarization or frequency in this paper. The results indicate that FY-3D/MWRI T-b data can retrieve the sea ice motion successfully.

TI  - "Gateway, This Moment." On Fink's Interpretation of Nietzsche
T2  - PHAINOMENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Nietzsche interests Fink as a thinker in whom a new "experience of the world" emerges through the historical trajectories, the narrative, and the language of metaphysics-in its question horizon and yet at the same time beyond it. This, however, does not simply replace the metaphysical worldview, but is fought out in the playing field of that difference which, according to Fink, is the "metaphor of all metaphysics": the ontological comparative. On the one hand, Nietzsche takes this playing field into account by absolutizing it in the thought of the "will to power" as the movement of all being in time; on the other hand, he undermines it in the thought of the "eternal return of the same" as time as such and thus leads it to its limit. This is narrowly brought about in the image of the "gateway, This Moment" from Zarathustra, which Fink interprets as a "bumping into each other's heads" of ontology (being) and cosmology (time) or as a breakthrough of the post-metaphysical thought of the "world wholeness" in the sense of the "all-encompassing, all-bringing, and all-erasing play-time of the world" into the historical world. In this antagonistic in-between, this "self-reflection," Nietzsche's confrontation with metaphysics takes place-and equally Fink's interpretation of this confrontation.

TI  - Use of a MODIS Satellite-Based Aridity Index to Monitor Drought Conditions in the Pearl River Basin from 2001 to 2021
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, global climate change has made natural hazards increasingly prevalent. Droughts, as a common natural hazard, have been a hot study topic for years. Most studies conducted drought monitoring in arid and semi-arid regions. In humid and sub-humid regions, due to climate change, seasonal droughts and seasonal water shortages were often observed too, but have not been well studied. This study, using a MODIS satellite-based aridity index (SbAI), investigated spatiotemporal changes in drought conditions in the subtropical Pearl River Basin. The study results indicated that the inter-annual SbAI exhibited a significant decreasing trend, illustrating a wetter trend observed in the basin in the past two decades. The decreasing trend in the SbAI was statistically significant in the dry season, but not in the monsoon season. The drought conditions displayed an insignificant expansion in the monsoon season, but exhibited statistically significant shrinking in the dry season. The Pearl River Basin has become wetter over past two decades, probably due to the results of natural impacts and human activities. The areas with increased drought conditions are more likely impacted by human activities such as water withdrawal for irrigation and industrial uses, and fast urbanization and increased impervious surfaces and resultant reduction in water storage capacity. This study provided a valuable reference for drought assessment across the Pearl River Basin.

TI  - Triangle Water Index (TWI): An Advanced Approach for More Accurate Detection and Delineation of Water Surfaces in Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most basic classification tasks in remote sensing is to distinguish between water bodies and other surface types. Although there are numerous techniques for extracting surface water from satellite imagery, there is still a need for research to more accurately identify water bodies with a view to efficient water maintenance in the future. Delineation accuracy is limited by varying amounts of suspended matter and different background land covers, especially those with low albedo. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop an advanced index that improves the accuracy of extracting water bodies characterized by varying amounts of water constituents, especially in mountainous regions with highly rugged terrain, urban areas with cast shadows, and snow- and ice-covered areas. In this context, we propose a triangle water index (TWI) based on Sentinel-2 data. The principle of the TWI is that it first analyzes the reflectance values of water bodies in different wavelength bands to determine specific types. Then, triangles are constructed in a cartesian coordinate system according to the reflectance values of different water bodies in the respective wavelength bands. Finally, the TWI is achieved by using the triangle similarity theorem. We tested the accuracy and robustness of the TWI method using Sentinel-2 data of several water bodies in Mongolia, Canada, Sweden, the United States, and China and determined kappa coefficients and the overall precision. The performance of the classifier was compared with methods such as the normalized difference water index (NDWI), the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), the enhanced water index (EWI), the automated water extraction index (AWEI), and the land surface water index (LSWI). The classification accuracy of the TWI for all test sites is significantly higher than that of these indices that are commonly used classification methods. The overall precision of the TWI ranges between 95% and 97%. Moreover, the TWI is also effective in extracting flooded areas. Hence, the TWI can automatically extract different water bodies from Sentinel-2 data with high accuracy, which provides also a favorable analysis method for the study of droughts and flood disasters and for the general maintenance of water bodies in the future.

TI  - The assessment of ecological restoration effects on Beijing-Tianjin Sandstorm Source Control Project area during 2000-2019
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - To halt the trend of desertification and improve the ecological environment in Beijing, Tianjin and surrounding areas, China establishes the ecological engineering of Beijing-Tianjin Sandstorm Source Control Project. The assessment of ecological restoration after the implementation of ecological engineering is conducive to the ensuing management of ecological engineering. Based on a large number of remote sensing data and calculation models, this study selected land use/cover, vegetation ecological quality indicators such as vegetation coverage and NPP, and other ecological service indicators such as water retention calculated by the InVEST model, soil retention by the RUSLE model, and sand fixing services by RWEQ model to comprehensively assess the degree of restoration and trend of ecological engineering implementation. The contributions of climate change and human activities to NPP and soil retention services are also assessed. We found that from 2000 to 2019, the land cover pattern is optimized, with desert and farmland turning to grassland and forest. The vegetation ecological quality has been improved, sand-fixing service have been significantly improved, and water retention and soil retention service are degraded in some areas. The areas with a high-degree restoration are mainly located in the water source protection areas in the Yanshan mountainous region and in some areas in the south-eastern Horqin Sandy Land, while the areas with a low-degree restoration are mainly located in the desert grassland. The ecological improvement areas are mainly distributed in the mountains in norther Shanxi Province, the water source pro-tection area in the Yanshan mountainous region, the Southern Great Hinggnan Mountains and part of the agro-pastoral transitional grassland. The highly degraded areas are mainly concentrated in the middle of Horqin and Otindag Sandy Lands. Ecological engineering plays an important role in promoting ecological restoration by changing land use types. The contribution proportion of climate change to NPP and soil retention services are significantly higher than those of human activities. The degree of ecological restoration depends on the climax ecological background determined by the climate.

TI  - A Framework for Satellite-Based 3D Cloud Data: An Overview of the VIIRS Cloud Base Height Retrieval and User Engagement for Aviation Applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellites have provided decades of valuable cloud observations, but the data from conventional passive radiometers are biased toward information from at or near cloud top. Tied with the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Cloud Calibration/Validation research, we developed a statistical Cloud Base Height (CBH) algorithm using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) A-Train satellite data. This retrieval, which is currently part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Enterprise Cloud Algorithms, provides key information needed to display clouds in a manner that goes beyond the typical top-down plan view. The goal of this study is to provide users with high-quality three-dimensional (3D) cloud structure information which can maximize the benefits and performance of JPSS cloud products. In support of the JPSS Proving Ground Aviation Initiative, we introduced Cloud Vertical Cross-sections (CVCs) along flight routes over Alaska where satellite data are extremely helpful in filling significant observational gaps. Valuable feedback and insights from interactions with aviation users allowed us to explore a new approach to provide satellite-based 3D cloud data. The CVC is obtained from multiple cloud retrieval products with supplementary data such as temperatures, Pilot Reports (PIREPs), and terrain information. We continue to improve the product demonstrations based on user feedback, extending the domain to the contiguous United States with the addition of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI). Concurrently, we have refined the underlying science algorithms for improved nighttime and multilayered cloud retrievals by utilizing Day/Night Band (DNB) data and exploring machine learning approaches. The products are evaluated using multiple satellite data sources and surface measurements. This paper presents our accomplishments and continuing efforts in both scientific and user-engagement improvements since the beginning of the VIIRS era.

TI  - Merging Historical Archives with Remote Sensing Data: A Methodology to Improve Rockfall Mitigation Strategy for Small Communities
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Both in the literature and in practical applications, several works have dealt with rockfall analysis and the planning of mitigation measures. It is also possible to find inventories and papers that describe historical events. However, it is challenging to find methodologies or studies about inventorying rockfall mitigation or their efficiency over time. In Italy, many rockfall barriers and other mitigation solutions have been built in the last decades, and one of the most urgent problems is their correct management and maintenance. Lauria, a small town in southern Italy, can be considered an example of this common condition exacerbated by a wildfire in 2017. This work presents a methodology for assessing rockfall risk and creating a geodatabase of mitigation structures focused on small communities. We used digitalization of archival sources to reconstruct and geocode the record of mitigation works. An available database of historical landslides was used to reconstruct the most relevant rockfall events. Moreover, we coupled this with Sentinel-2 images and high-resolution orthophotos to map the wildfire area. Data obtained from the UAV-LiDAR survey were used to map the mitigation structures. The aim was to create a reliable state-of-the-art method, described in an operational monograph, to be used by experts for the design of new rockfall mitigation structures in both an affordable and efficient way. Moreover, we created a simple webGIS and a 3-D interactive view, helpful in disseminating rockfall hazards and mitigation strategies among the population at risk.

TI  - Augmenting agroecosystem models with remote sensing data and machine learning increases overall estimates of nitrate-nitrogen leaching
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Process-based agroecosystem models are powerful tools to assess performance of managed landscapes, but their ability to accurately represent reality is limited by the types of input data they can use. Ensuring these models can represent cropping field heterogeneity and environmental impact is important, especially given the growing interest in using agroecosystem models to quantify ecosystem services from best management practices and land use change. We posited that augmenting process-based agroecosystem models with additional field-specific information such as topography, hydrologic processes, or independent indicators of yield could help limit simulation artifacts that obscure mechanisms driving observed variations. To test this, we augmented the agroecosystem model Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) with field-specific topography and satellite imagery in a simulation framework we call Foresite. We used Foresite to optimize APSIM yield predictions to match those created from a machine learning model built on remotely sensed indicators of hydrology and plant productivity. Using these improved subfield yield predictions to guide APSIM optimization, total NO3-N loss estimates increased by 39% in maize and 20% in soybeans when summed across all years. In addition, we found a disproportionate total amount of leaching in the lowest yielding field areas vs the highest yielding areas in maize (42% vs 15%) and a similar effect in soybeans (31% vs 20%). Overall, we found that augmenting process-based models with now-common subfield remotely sensed data significantly increased values of predicted nutrient loss from fields, indicating opportunities to improve field-scale agroecosystem simulations, particularly if used to calculate nutrient credits in ecosystem service markets.

TI  - An Insider-Outsider Approach to Understanding the Prevalence of Female Genital Mutilation in Pusiga in the Upper East Region of Ghana
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) as a form of gender-related violence continues to thrive within communities and across borders, with (under)reported prevalence among communities in the diaspora. Reports of FGM/C among communities in the diaspora speak to the socio-cultural and religious factors which promote its prevalence. Successful interventions offer alternatives such as rites of passage to the socio-cultural-religious prospects offered by FGM/C to practicing communities. This suggests the need for a critical approach to research methods that engage intimately with the worldview of communities practicing FGM/C while inferring implications for designing health-promotion interventions in specific contexts. This paper draws on the insider and outsider approach to positionality to assess the factors accounting for the prevalence of FGM/C in Pusiga (3.8% nationally and 27.8% in Pusiga) in the Upper East Region of Ghana while inferring lessons for designing health promotion interventions. Applying a phenomenological qualitative design guided by focus groups and interviews, we draw on the insider approach to present a contextually and culturally sensitive report of five survivors, five non-survivors, and ten religious leaders on factors that account for the prevalence of FGM/C. Next, we assume an outsider approach to infer implications based on participants' perspectives for designing health promotion interventions to curb FGM/C. The findings suggest shifting from socio-cultural-religious factors to economic undertones underpinning FGM/C. Inter-generational differences also vary attitudes toward FGM/C. We recommend a systematic approach to health promotion that addresses FGM/C's deep socio-cultural and economic, religious underpinnings of FGM/C in Pusiga. The insider-outsider continuum in feminist research provides a powerful approach to producing knowledge on contextual factors that account for FGM/C in particular settings.

TI  - Use of Methylene Blue Dye for Lymphatic Basin Mapping and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer Patients in Enugu, Nigeria
T2  - NIGERIAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the current standard of care for axillary staging and further treatment planning in patients with clinical axillary node-negative breast cancer. Sentinel node (SN) biopsy was designed to accurately stage the axilla and minimize the side effects of conventional axillary-lymph-node dissection without sacrificing oncologic outcomes. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is normally performed with nuclear scan and patent blue violet or isosulfan blue. These are expensive and not commonly available in resource-poor regions such as West Africa. Methylene blue dye is a commonly used agent in a wide range of clinical diagnostic procedures and has been used by other investigators to perform this procedure. This study was designed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of SN biopsy in the management of axillary node-negative breast cancer in resource-limited populations using methylene blue dye. Aim: To determine the efficacy of methylene blue dye as a single tracer in lymphatic basin mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with clinical axillary node-negative breast cancer. Methods: This was a prospective, case-controlled study involving 28 consecutively presenting female patients with clinical axillary node-negative breast cancer at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu. Each of the patients had lymphatic basin mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy with a sub-areola-subdermal injection of methylene blue dye. The SN (s) were then removed using the dye as the marker. Each patient then had a mastectomy or wide local excision as appropriately planned and conventional levels I and II axillary dissection was performed in the same sitting. The SNs and other axillary nodes were reviewed independently by our institution's pathologist. Each patient's axillary dissection specimen acted as her control for the study. Results: The SNs were identified in 24 (85.7%) patients. There was a demonstrable learning curve with an improvement in identification rate in the later half of the cases (92.9%) compared to the earlier half of the cases (78.6%). A range of 1-3 nodes and a mean of 1.78 nodes were obtained. A sensitivity of 90.9%, specificity of 79.6%, false-positive rate of 28.6%, false-negative rate of 9.1%, and accuracy of 95.8% were obtained. There was no incidence of allergic/hypersensitivity reaction. Conclusion: Sentinel lymph node biopsy with methylene blue dye can be applied with high accuracy within resource-limited environments. However, there is a definite short learning curve that must be overcome and the procedure validated before clinical application in decision-making.

TI  - Plant functional type aboveground biomass change within Alaska and northwest Canada mapped using a 35-year satellite time series from 1985 to 2020
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in vegetation distribution are underway in Arctic and boreal regions due to climate warming and associated fire disturbance. These changes have wide ranging downstream impacts-affecting wildlife habitat, nutrient cycling, climate feedbacks and fire regimes. It is thus critical to understand where these changes are occurring and what types of vegetation are affected, and to quantify the magnitude of the changes. In this study, we mapped live aboveground biomass for five common plant functional types (PFTs; deciduous shrubs, evergreen shrubs, forbs, graminoids and lichens) within Alaska and northwest Canada, every five years from 1985 to 2020. We employed a multi-scale approach, scaling from field harvest data and unmanned aerial vehicle-based biomass predictions to produce wall-to-wall maps based on climatological, topographic, phenological and Landsat spectral predictors. We found deciduous shrub and graminoid biomass were predicted best among PFTs. Our time-series analyses show increases in deciduous (37%) and evergreen shrub (7%) biomass, and decreases in graminoid (14%) and lichen (13%) biomass over a study area of approximately 500 000 km(2). Fire was an important driver of recent changes in the study area, with the largest changes in biomass associated with historic fire perimeters. Decreases in lichen and graminoid biomass often corresponded with increasing shrub biomass. These findings illustrate the driving trends in vegetation change within the Arctic/boreal region. Understanding these changes and the impacts they in turn will have on Arctic and boreal ecosystems will be critical to understanding the trajectory of climate change in the region.

TI  - Contribution of Sentinel-3A Radar Altimetry Data to the Study of the Water Level Variations in Lake Buyo (West of Cote d'Ivoire)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The artificial Lake Buyo is an important water reservoir that ensures the availability of water for multiple purposes: drinking water supply, fishing, and energy. In the last five years, this lake has experienced extreme variations in its surface area and water levels, including very significant declines, which has impacted the supply of electricity. This study aimed to assess temporal variations in the water levels of Lake Buyo using radar altimetry. Altimetric data from the Sentinel-3A satellite on Lake Buyo (tracks 16 (orbit 8) and 743 (orbit 372)) were selected over the period from 31 May 2016 to 12 June 2021 and compared to the in situ measurements provided by the Direction de la Production de l'Electricite de Cote d'Ivoire (DPE-CI). The extraction of the time series of the Sentinel-3A altimetric water levels and their corrections (geophysical and environmental corrections) were carried out with the ALTiS software. The results showed an overall agreement between the altimetric water levels and the in situ measurements, with a correlation coefficient (R-2) ranging from 0.98 to 0.99 obtained, as well as a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficient also between 0.98 and 0.99. Further, the bias (0.12 m and 0.13 m) and root mean square error (RMSE) (0.38 and 0.67 m) values showed that the results were acceptable. The analysis of the water levels time series allowed for the identification of two main periods: March to October and November to February. The first period corresponded to a high level period, recording a maximum level of 200.06 m. The second period, from November to March, was characterized by a drop in the water level, recording a minimum level of 187.42 m. The water levels time series provided by Sentinel-3 allowed us to appreciate the respective influences of seasonal and interannual variations on rainfall and the contributions of the Sassandra River tributaries to the water levels of Lake Buyo.

TI  - Science vs. Conspiracy Theory about COVID-19: Need for Cognition and Openness to Experience Increased Belief in Conspiracy-Theoretical Postings on Social Media
T2  - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of COVID-19 virus containment, there is a lack of acceptance of preventive measures in the population. The present work investigated which factors influence the belief in scientific propositions compared with belief in conspiracy theories. The focus here was on the determinants of conspiracy beliefs in the context of COVID-19 related media content. Using an online questionnaire (N = 175), results indicate that scientific compared to conspiracy-theoretical media content led to higher acceptance. Furthermore, need for cognition (NFC-K), a conspiracy-theoretical worldview (CMQ), and openness to experience (NEO-FFI) were positively associated with conspiracy beliefs derived from Facebook postings. In addition, a conspiracy-theoretical worldview was negatively associated with belief in scientific media content. Furthermore, agreeableness was unrelated to conspiracy beliefs, although it was positively associated with conspiracy-theoretical worldview. The results imply promising persuasion strategies for reducing conspiracy-theoretical beliefs and to increase the acceptance of preventive measures.

TI  - A Leap of Faith: Regenerative Agriculture as a Contested Worldview Rather Than as a Practice Change Issue
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Regenerative agriculture (RA) is emerging as one alternative model for agricultural production. However, RA has not matured sufficiently for a clear definition to have emerged, or for claimed benefits to be rigorously tested. Thus, numerous competing discourses have emerged around what RA is, and its potential role in the future of farming, leading to a level of contention about is value. This research aimed to better understand RA as a social phenomenon by using Q methodology to explore and evaluate how common discourses around agricultural sustainability, the goals of farming, and RA resonated with different Australian beef farmers. Three perspectives emerged from the data, labelled as the regenerative, environmentally conscious, and productive perspectives and represented diverse views around the goals of agriculture, the role of RA in the future of Australian agriculture, and comfort level producers have with the term and approach to farming it represents. As RA continues to grow as a movement, worldview, and farming approach, understanding the differences in thinking and worldview of proponents will be important for better understanding the goals of RA, how to reach them and measure their impact, and improve communication around RA. This is important to avoid and resolve unnecessary or destructive tensions between the range of agricultural sustainability discourses.

TI  - Google Earth Engine as Multi-Sensor Open-Source Tool for Monitoring Stream Flow in the Transboundary River Basin: Doosti River Dam
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the effects of global change and human activities on water supplies depends greatly on surface water dynamics. A comprehensive examination of the hydroclimatic variations at the transboundary level is essential for the development of any adaptation or mitigation plans to deal with the negative effects of climate change. This research paper examines the hydroclimatic factors that contribute to the desiccation of the Doosti Dam's basin in the transboundary area using multisensor satellite data from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The Mann-Kendall and Sens slope estimator test was applied to the satellite datasets to analyse the spatial and temporal variation of the hydroclimate variables and their trend over the transboundary area for 18 years from 2004 to 2021 (as the dam began operating in 2005). Statistical analysis results showed decreasing trends in temperature and an increase in rainfall with respect to station-observed available data. Evapotranspiration and irrigated area development followed the increasing pattern and a slight decrease in snow cover. The results confirmed a large expansion of the irrigated area, especially during the winter growing season. The increase in irrigated cultivated areas during both winter and summer seasons is possibly the main reason for the diversion of water to meet the irrigation requirements of the developed agriculture areas. The approach followed in this study could be applied to any location around the globe to evaluate the hydrological conditions and spatiotemporal changes in response to climate change, trend analysis and human activities.

TI  - Very high-resolution satellite image segmentation using variable-length multi-objective genetic clustering for multi-class change detection
T2  - JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The baseline approaches on satellite image segmentation problem suffer from issues like sensitivity towards initialization, local optima solutions, a predefined number of output clusters, single-objective optimization, etc. To solve these challenges, this study proposes a unique pixel-level Multi-Spectral (MS) very high resolution (VHR) image segmentation algorithm based on variable-length multiobjective genetic clustering. We propose a new approach to update solutions by retaining variable length property throughout the optimization process. The resulting clustering algorithm contains a set of nearPareto-optimal solutions. A map that has a scale of less than 1/10000 is called a large-scale map. We propose a large-scale change detection technique as an application of the proposed image segmentation algorithm. Solving Land-use/Land-Cover (LULC) change detection problems in a congested area is a complex task. This study considers the dataset from Pleiades-HR 1B, and Landsat 5 TM sensors in the experimental study. An extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis is performed to validate the superior performance of the proposed method with different state-of-the-art techniques.

TI  - Evaluation of MODIS Dark Target AOD Product with 3 and 10 km Resolution in Amazonia
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The techniques and analyses employed by remote sensing provide key information about atmospheric particle properties at regional and global scales. However, limitations in optical spectral models used to represent the different types of aerosols in the atmosphere and their effects (direct and indirect) are still one of the major causes of sources of uncertainties and substantial impacts in climate prediction. There are no studies yet in South America, especially in the Amazon Basin, that have evaluated the advantages, disadvantages, inconsistencies, applicability, and suitability of the MODIS sensor (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) destined for monitoring the ambient aerosol optical thickness over rivers and continents. In this study, the results of the DT (Dark Target) algorithm for products with 3 km and 10 km resolutions were systematically evaluated for six sites in the Amazon rainforest. The comparisons between the products were carried out with the AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) measurements, which were used as reference. Statistical parameters between AERONET vs. MODIS were also evaluated based on biomass burning records in the site regions. Here, the DT 10 km product showed satisfactory performance for the Amazon region, with observations between the expected error (EE) limits above 66%, in addition to R > 0.8 and RMSE < 0.3. However, the regional analysis for the two sites in the central and southern regions of the Amazon basin did not have the same performance, where the results showed an EE of 24 and 47%, respectively. The DT 3 km product did not perform well in any site, with an EE below 50%. Both products overestimated the AOD, but the 3 km product overestimated it approximately four times more due to its algorithm setup. Thus, we recommend the 10 km product for general analysis in Amazonia. Regional biomass burning records showed a direct relationship with the AERONET vs. MODIS DT with overestimation of both products. All variations between products and sites were justified based on the difficulty of retrieving surface reflectance and the model selected for local aerosols. Improvements in the optical spectral model currently implemented in the algorithms, with more realistic representations of the main types of the aerosol present in the Amazon Basin, may contribute to better performance among the evaluated products.

TI  - Quantifying the Effect of River Ice Surface Roughness on Sentinel-1 SAR Backscatter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is an effective tool to map and monitor river ice on regional scales because the SAR backscatter is affected by various physical properties of the ice, including roughness, thickness, and structure. Validation of SAR-based river ice classification maps is typically performed using expert interpretation of aerial or ground reference images of the river ice surface, using visually apparent changes in surface roughness to delineate different ice classes. Although many studies achieve high classification accuracies using this qualitative technique, it is not possible to determine if the river ice information contained within the SAR backscatter data originates from the changes in surface roughness used to create the validation data, or from some other ice property that may be more relevant for ice jam forecasting. In this study, we present the first systematic, quantitative investigation of the effect of river ice surface roughness on C-band Sentinel-1 backscatter. We use uncrewed aerial vehicle-based Structure from Motion photogrammetry to generate high-resolution (0.03 m) digital elevation models of river ice surfaces, from which we derive measurements of surface roughness. We employ Random Forest models first to repeat previous ice classification studies, and then as regression models to explore quantitative relationships between ice surface roughness and Sentinel-1 backscatter. Classification accuracies are similar to those reported in previous studies (77-96%) but poor regression performance for many surface roughness metrics (5-113% mean absolute percentage errors) indicates a weak relationship between river ice surface roughness and Sentinel-1 backscatter. Additional work is necessary to determine which physical ice properties are strong controls on C-band SAR backscatter.

TI  - Different characteristics of two surges in Weigeledangxiong Glacier, northeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier surge is a special form of glacier displacement caused by the instability of the glacial dynamic system. It is a quasi-periodic oscillation behavior, which affects the estimation of the overall change of glaciers in the region and potentially threatens the infrastructure and human life in the downstream regions. Most glaciers experience a mass loss with rising air temperatures in recent decades, but little attention has been paid to the influence of climate change on glacial surges. This study identified two surges, triggered in 1992 and 2015 in Weigeledangxiong Glacier, anyemaqen Mountains, northeastern Tibetan Plateau, using multi-source remote sensing data (Landsat images, Sentinel-2 images, topographic map, shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model [SRTM DEM], and the elevation change database). The 1992 surge accelerated abruptly with the maximum velocity of 350 +/- 9 m a(-1), and a large volume of ice transported downward, causing a sudden advance of 392 +/- 42 m from 1992 to 1994, and clear thickening of the ice tongue. The recent surge is still in the active phase, exhibiting a gentler process of slower advance speed and lower peak velocity, as well as a smaller expansion zone than the previous one. These phenomena may be associated with the reduced glacier basal resistance and energy caused by rising temperatures in recent decades. Higher temperatures may cause the discharge of subglacial water through a more developed drainage system, leading to a longer active phase duration. Similar phenomena may exist widely in the Tibetan Plateau and its surrounding areas. Meanwhile, the frontal position of Weigeledangxiong Glacier advancing in the recent surge is not expected to threaten roads near the ice tongue.

TI  - Change detection of wetland restoration in China's Sanjiang National Nature Reserve using STANet method based on GF-1 and GF-6 images
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are important ecosystems, and detecting changes in wetlands plays a very important role in the management of wetland resources. Therefore, we selected Sanjiang National Nature Reserve as the study area and proposed a method in which bi-temporal GaoFen (GF) remote sensing data was combined with a spa-tial-temporal attention neural network (STANet) model, coupled with the selection of spectral variables. We used the bi-temporal images from GF-1 and GF-6 and compared three band selection methods, Relief F, principal component analysis, and RGB combination, and two STANet-based change detection methods (BAM: basic spatial-temporal attention module and PAM: pyramid spatial-temporal attention module) to improve the change detection of the wetland restoration. The results show that the accuracy of wetland change detection is related to different combinations of spectral variable selection and STANet models. The combination of Relief F feature selection and the BAM model led to the highest accuracy of the wetland change detection, 71.72 % for F1-Score and 76.92 % for MIou. The vector results of the change detection statistics show that the area of the Sanjiang National Nature Reserve cultivated lands converted to wetlands is 46.05 km2. This study implies that the STANet method has the capacity of detecting complex wetland restoration. Red, Bule, NIR and Red Edge1 bands of GaoFen data can provide effective information in the detection of changes in wetlands. The results of the study can be used as a reference for rational planning of wetland restoration, seeking a balance between cultivated lands and wetlands, which is important for the sustainable development of wetland.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability in bio-optical characteristics of the southwestern tropical Indian Ocean during boreal summer: Biophysical influences
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - The bio-optical characteristics of the surface ocean play a pivotal role in radiative transfer and photosynthetic carbon fixation. To examine spatiotemporal variability of bio-optical properties in the tropical Indian Ocean, a 10-day time-series comparative study was made at one fixed and 3 variable stations in the southwestern tropical Indian Ocean (SWTIO), and 4-stations in the Equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO) during June 2014. A total of 24 hyperspectral radiometer profiles were collected along with physicochemical parameters and phytoplankton pigments analysis. A negative sea level anomaly (SLA), higher precipitation, a more stable mixed layer, and higher buoyancy frequency (N2) were observed in SWTIO compared to EIO. The deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) in SWTIO were characterised by deep biomass maxima (DBM) whereas in the EIO it was due to deep photo -acclimation maxima (DAM). The photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) profiles were obtained by inte-grating downwelling irradiance from 400 to 700 nm suggesting that the SWTIO had a greater abundance of optically active substances (OAS) than the EIO. Surface chlorophyll a (Chl-a) was found to have significant re-lationships with phytoplankton absorption coefficient (aph(443)). Chl-a-specific phytoplankton absorption co-efficients (a*ph(443)), total absorption coefficient (at(443)), and particulate backscattering (bbp(555)) were also related to Chl-a implying that the phytoplankton was in growth/active phase. The time-series variability of the phytoplankton and changes in the photosynthetic pigments (PSP) to photoprotective pigments (PPP) ratio at SWTIO suggested phytoplankton community shift during 5th to 7th days. Microplankton percent-abundances showed distinct linear relationships with Chl-a and bbp(555) implying that carbon fixation per unit Chl-a was higher in microplankton than in nano and picoplankton at SWTIO. The in situ Chl-a, aph(443), adg(443), Kd(490) and C pd were used to validate the various empirical algorithms available as well as the satellite-retrieved data. The MODIS and VIIRS data correlated moderately. This study would help towards improving regional optimized algorithms for OAS and provide a baseline understanding of the scale of variability of primary production and carbon flux from space. In addition, this would contribute valuable bio-optical data from an under-sampled geographical area.

TI  - Characterization of Hydrologic Sand and Dust Storm Sources in the Middle East
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to diverse hydroclimatic conditions and human interventions, the Middle East hosts a variety of active sources of sand and dust storms (SDS). Discrimination of different types of SDS sources is the most important factor for adopting optimal mitigation measures to combat SDS. This study employed a binary mask-based modeling framework to identify Middle East SDS sources. Accordingly, using time series of remotely sensed data of land surface and atmospheric aerosol parameters, SDS sources covering an area of 1 million Km(2) were identified with an overall accuracy of 82.6%. Considering the type of land use and spatial-temporal changes in water bodies, SDS sources were categorized into seven types in terms of origin. Desert sources have the largest share (>79%), whereas hydrologic sources accounted for about 8.4%. The results showed that water bodies had a declining trend after 2000. The occurrence of two severe drought periods in 2000-2001 and 2007-2012 led to a 52% decrease in water bodies and a 14-37% increase in SDS emission compared to the pre-2000 period. The latter drought period also led to a sharp decrease in groundwater resources across the region. Our results revealed that natural circumstances and drought actively contribute to the depletion of water resources that led to the formation of SDS sources in the Middle East, while the role of anthropogenic factors is predominant in the case of hydrologic SDS sources.

TI  - Changes in the Duration of the Navigation Period in Arctic Seas along the Northern Sea Route in the Twenty-First Century: Bayesian Estimates Based on Calculations with the Ensemble of Climate Models
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The duration of the navigation period (DNP) on the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and in some parts of it in the twenty-first century has been analyzed based on the models of the CMIP5 ensemble (Coupled Models Intercomparison project, phase 5) under the RCP 8.5 scenario using Bayesian averaging methods. According to the study results, differences in the quality of the DNP models and in DNP variations are greater in the western part of the NSR than in the eastern part. The DNP ensemble average was obtained in the range of 3-4 months in the middle of the twenty-first century and increasing to about six months by the end of the century. The ensemble average estimates of variations in DNP are generally robust for the choice of assumptions used for calculating the Bayesian weights. The joint consideration of the quality of modeled climate characteristics on all time scales (long-term average, interannual variations, and linear trend) in comparison with the satellite data makes it possible to reduce the intermodel standard deviation by two times for the western part of the NSR and one and a half times for the eastern part.

TI  - Dataset for the Reporting of Carcinoma of the Cervix: Recommendations From the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Cervical carcinoma remains one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide, despite effective screening programs being implemented in many countries for several decades. The International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR) dataset for cervical carcinoma was first developed in 2017 with the aim of developing evidence-based standardized, consistent and comprehensive surgical pathology reports for resection specimens. This 4th edition update to the ICCR dataset on cervical cancer was undertaken to incorporate major changes based upon the updated International Federation of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (FIGO) staging for carcinoma of the cervix published in 2018 and the 5th Edition World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Female Genital Tumors published in 2020 and other significant developments in pathologic aspects of cervical cancer. This updated dataset was developed by a panel of expert gynecological pathologists and an expert gynecological oncologist, with a period of open consultation. The revised dataset includes "core" and "noncore" elements to be reported; these are accompanied by detailed explanatory notes and references providing the rationale for the updates. Standardized reporting using datasets such as this helps facilitate consistency and accuracy, data collection across different sites and comparison of epidemiological and pathologic parameters for quality and research purposes.

TI  - Mapping Soil Organic Carbon Content in Patagonian Forests Based on Climate, Topography and Vegetation Metrics from Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) content supports several ecosystem services. Quantifying SOC requires: (i) accurate C estimates of forest components, and (ii) soil estimates. However, SOC is difficult to measure, so predictive models are needed. Our objective was to model SOC stocks within 30 cm depth in Patagonian forests based on climatic, topographic and vegetation productivity measures from satellite images, including Dynamic Habitat Indices and Land Surface Temperature derived from Landsat-8. We used data from 1320 stands of different forest types in Patagonia, and random forest regression to map SOC. The model captured SOC variability well (R-2 = 0.60, RMSE = 22.1%), considering the huge latitudinal extension (36.4 degrees to 55.1 degrees SL) and the great diversity of forest types. Mean SOC was 134.4 ton C ha(-1) +/- 25.2, totaling 404.2 million ton C across Patagonia. Overall, SOC values were highest in valleys of the Andes mountains and in southern Tierra del Fuego, ranging from 53.5 to 277.8 ton C ha(-1) for the whole Patagonia region. Soil organic carbon is a metric relevant to many applications, connecting major issues such as forest management, conservation, and livestock production, and having spatially explicit estimates of SOC enables managers to fulfil the international agreements that Argentina has joined.

TI  - A Comparison of Random Forest Algorithm-Based Forest Extraction with GF-1 WFV, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are an essential part of the ecosystem and play an irreplaceable role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem and protecting biodiversity. The monitoring of forest distribution plays an important role in the conservation and management of forests. This paper analyzes and compares the performance of imagery from GF-1 WFV, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 satellites with respect to forest/non-forest classification tasks using the random forest algorithm (RF). The results show that in the classification task of this paper, although the differences in classification accuracy among the three satellite datasets are not remarkable, the Sentinel-2 data have the highest accuracy, GF-1 WFV the second highest, and Landsat 8 the lowest. In addition, it was found that remotely sensed data of different processing levels show little influence on the classification accuracy with respect to the forest/non-forest classification task. However, the classification accuracy of the top of the atmosphere reflectance product was the most stable, and the vegetation index has a marginal effect on the distinction between forest and non-forest areas.

TI  - Combining Proximal and Remote Sensors in Spatial Prediction of Five Micronutrients and Soil Texture in a Case Study at Farmland Scale in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the increasing adoption of proximal sensors worldwide, rare works have coupled proximal with remotely sensed data to spatially predict soil properties. This study evaluated the contribution of proximal and remotely sensed data to predict soil texture and available contents of micronutrients using portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry, magnetic susceptibility (MS), and terrain attributes (TA) via random forest algorithm. Samples were collected in Brazil from soils with high, moderate, and low weathering degrees (Oxisols, Ultisols, Inceptisols, respectively), and analyzed by pXRF and MS and for texture and available micronutrients. Seventeen TA were generated from a digital elevation model of 12.5 m spatial resolution. Predictions were made via: (i) TA; (ii) TA + pXRF; (iii) TA + MS; (iv) TA + MS + pXRF; (v) MS + pXRF; and (vi) pXRF; and validated via root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2). The best predictions were achieved by: pXRF dataset alone for available Cu (R-2 = 0.80) and clay (R-2 = 0.67) content; MS + pXRF dataset for available Fe (R-2 = 0.68) and sand (R-2 = 0.69) content; TA + pXRF + MS dataset for available Mn (R-2 = 0.87) content. PXRF data were key to the best predictions. Soil property maps created from these predictions supported the adoption of sustainable soil management practices.

TI  - Supervised Classifications of Optical Water Types in Spanish Inland Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of lake water quality assumes there is no universal method or algorithm that can be applied in a general way on all inland waters, which usually have different in-water components affecting their optical properties. Depending on the place and time of year, the lake dynamics, and the particular components of the water, non-tailor-designed algorithms can lead to large errors or lags in the quantification of the water quality parameters, such as the suspended mineral sediments, dissolved organic matter, and chlorophyll-a concentration. Selecting the most suitable algorithm for each type of water is not a simple matter. One way to make selecting the most suitable water quality algorithm easier on each occasion is by knowing ahead of time the type of water being handled. This approach is used, for instance, in the Lake Water Quality production chain of the Copernicus Global Land Service. The objective of this work is to determine which supervised classification approach might give the most accurate results. We use a dataset of manually labeled pixels on lakes and reservoirs in Eastern Spain. High-resolution images from the Multispectral Instrument sensor on board the ESA Sentinel-2 satellite, atmospherically corrected with the Case 2 Regional Coast Colour algorithm, are used as the basis for extracting the pixels for the dataset. Three families of different supervised classifiers have been implemented and compared: the K-nearest neighbor, decision trees, and support vector machine. Based on the results, the most appropriate for our study area is the random forest classifier, which was selected and applied on a series of images to derive the temporal series of the optical water types per lake. An evaluation of the results is presented, and an analysis is made using expert knowledge.

TI  - Water Balance in Alpine Catchments by Sentinel Data
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive and reliable water balance of snow-dominated alpine catchments is required for a holistic analysis of the hydrological and hydrogeological processes. A major limitation to the elaboration of this balance in alpine terrain is the difficulty of data acquisition as well as the limited presence of meteorological stations. Remotely sensed data can provide valuable information for the water balance assessment on a regional scale. We exploited Sentinel-satellite data to estimate the groundwater storage for one hydrologic year in an extensive Alpine catchment located in northern Italy by means of the residual water balance approach. In particular, Evapotranspiration (ET) and Snow Water Equivalent were estimated with the combined use of Sentinel data, at a spatial resolution of 20 and 30 m, respectively. The results show that the adopted satellite-based methods allow obtaining consistent and physically realistic values to describe the groundwater storage dynamics. In the period 2018-2020, a positive storage occurred only during the snowmelt period and the overall storage was negative, leading to a net lowering of the groundwater level in the floodplain. In addition, the influence of physiographic parameters (altitude, slope, and aspect) and seasonality on the estimates of ET and snow-depth were investigated.

TI  - Seeing the broader picture: Stakeholder contributions to understanding infrastructure impacts of the Interoceanic Highway in the southwestern Amazon
T2  - WORLD DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a large research literature on the impacts of roads and other infrastructure, which highlights the economic benefits, environmental harms and social problems. Most previous research on infrastructure impacts adopts a top-down approach, such as via the use of governmental or remotely-sensed data. This paper argues that a bottom-up approach that features stakeholder perspectives offers complementary advantages to understanding infrastructure impacts that can support improved planning and governance. We conducted stakeholder workshops about impacts of the Interoceanic Highway in the tri-national "MAP" frontier of the southwestern Amazon. The findings confirm previous research in several respects, but also indicate several contrasts. The range of impacts is much broader than topics featured in previous research, and some of the most commonly reported problems, such as diverse forms of crime, have been rarely studied as infrastructure impacts. We conclude by discussing the implications, in terms of criminological research on infrastructure impacts, synergies among diverse impacts of infrastructure, and improved planning of infrastructure for better governance of impacts.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the foremost global forcings, tidal circulation exerts a pervasive influence on biological and physical processes occurring in the world's oceans on hourly to decadal time scales. This research identified the 18.6-year periodic variation in the lunar orbital plane within an annually resolved 140-year (1875 to 2015) shell growth master chronology measured from 21 live collected Arctica islandica, a bivalve known to be one of the longest lived non-colonial animals. The potential ecological implications of this result warranted detailed inventory of underlying physical processes. The absence of long-term in situ hydrological data for the bivalve's habitat was circumvented by the use of satellite data and numerical modeling which show that coastal regions of the Northwest Atlantic shelf clearly record diurnal tidal currents influenced by the 18.6-year nodal lunar cycle. The approach described here demonstrates that combining physical and biological data can help to identify subtle ecological processes over long time-scales for accurately disentangling the latter from variation introduced by anthropogenic climate change.

AB  - Vegetation, precipitation, and surface temperature are three important elements of the environment. By increasing the concerns about climate change and global warming, monitoring vegetation dynamics are considered to be crucial. In this study, the cross-relationship between vegetation, surface temperature, and precipitation, and their fluctuations over the past 21 years are evaluated. Day time LST from Terra sensor of MODIS, nir and red bands of Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI, and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) are used in this research. Data were evaluated and processed using the google earth engine cloud processing platform. According to the results, it was concluded that the correlations between the annual average of normalized difference vegetation index and precipitation are not significant. Evaluation of the cross-seasonal correlations exhibited the availability of the strong and significant correlation with a value of r(2) = 0.82 between vegetation thickness and precipitation, during the spring and summer, especially from April to August. Moreover, surface temperature exposed an inverse correlation with precipitation and NDVI with the values of r(2) = 0.776 and r(2) = 0.68 respectively, these relationships are highly significant. According to the results of this study, vegetation declined sharply in particular years, and this decrease occurred due to insufficient rainfalls.

TI  - Dynamic evolution and the mechanism of modern gully agriculture regional function in the Loess Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural regional type and function are the key theoretical issues in agricultural geography research. Gully agriculture in the Loess Plateau is a new regional type of agricultural system with the coupling development of the modern gully human-earth relationship. The study of its functional changes is of great practical significance for food security, rural revitalization and sustainable development of regional agriculture in the region of interest. This paper analyses the multifunctional change of gully agriculture in the Loess Plateau and its dynamic mechanism by using large-scale remote sensing data, topographic relief amplitude model, and spatial econometric model to understand internal implications for evolution differentiation at the basin level. The results show that: (1) The spatial concentration of production and supply function of agricultural products (APF) in the gully of the Loess Plateau gully is high, while the ecological conservation and maintenance function (ECF), employment and social security function (ESF), cultural heritage and leisure function (CRF) are relatively low. The four functions' spatial distribution has revealed an apparent regularity. (2) APF has been significantly enhanced, which is mainly distributed in point clusters and strips in the farming and pastoral areas in northern Shaanxi to the Yanhe river basin. The high-value areas of ESF are clustered around the urbanized metropolitan circles and urban-rural staggered areas along the Great Wall. ECF is concentrated in areas with significant natural endowments and excellent ecological conditions. CRF is significantly higher in the municipal districts and the surrounding regional central cities. (3) There are noticeable differences in the gully agriculture regional function (GARF) evolution process due to the geographical environment and socio-economic development stages. In this regard, natural factors have tremendously affected APF, ESF, and ECF, while socio-economic factors greatly differ in the four functions. There are still differences in the driving mechanisms of modern gully agriculture evolution types; hence many critical policies in the Loess Plateau can directly affect the function evolution paths. The dynamic evolution of GARF can reflect the general law of rural human-earth system transition in gully areas, thereby providing policy ideas for high-quality development of agriculture in the Loess Plateau.

TI  - Wealthy, educated, and ... non-millennial? Variable patterns of distributional inequity in 31 Canadian cities ...
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article assesses the distribution of urban vegetation in 31 Canadian cities to determine whether certain social-economic/demographic factors are associated with increased proximity to greenness. Using spatial lag models, Canadian census data, and urban 'greenness fractions' derived from Landsat imagery, we find diversity between cities in the factors associated with increased urban vegetation. This makes it difficult to establish a single overarching narrative about the state of environmental justice and green equity as it pertains to proximity to vegetation in Canadian cities. Factors such as greater household income and educational attainment were positively associated with proximity to vegetation in numerous cities, while the proportion of millennials was often negatively associated. Variables including the proportion of visible minorities, Indigenous people, and recent immigrants infrequently had significant associations with urban vegetation. These results highlight the need for planning and management actions tailored to individual Canadian cities to improve green equity for marginalized and underserved groups. We discuss the need for funding for greening initiatives and maintenance; democratic participation, engagement, and education opportunities for residents; urban planning that considers the challenge of greening dense environments; and consideration of potential negative outcomes of greening, such as gentrification, to improve green equity in Canadian cities.

TI  - Evaluation of Wildfire Occurrences in Pakistan with Global Gridded Soil Properties Derived from Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are predicted to occur more frequently and intensely as a result of global warming, posing a greater threat to human society, terrestrial ecosystems, and the atmosphere. Most existing methods for monitoring wildfire occurrences are based either on static topographical information or weather-based indices. This work explored the advantages of a new machine learning-based 'soil properties' attribute in monitoring wildfire occurrence in Pakistan. Specifically, we used satellite observations during 2001-2020 to investigate the correlation at different temporal and spatial scales between wildfire properties (fire count, FC) and soil properties and classes (SoilGrids1km) derived from combination with local covariates using machine learning. The correlations were compared to that obtained with the static topographic index elevation to determine whether soil properties, such as soil bulk density, taxonomy, and texture, provide new independent information about wildfires. Finally, soil properties and the topographical indices were combined to establish multivariate linear regression models to estimate FC. Results show that: (1) the temporal variations of FC are negatively correlated with soil properties using the monthly observations at 1 degrees grid and regional scales; and overall opposite annual cycles and interannual variations between and soil properties are observed in Pakistan; (2) compared to the other static variables such as elevation, soil properties shows stronger correlation with the temperate wildfire count in Northern Pakistan but weaker correlation with the wildfire properties in Southern Pakistan; and it is found that combining both types of indices enhances the explained variance for fire attributes in the two regions; (3) In comparison to linear regression models based solely on elevation, multivariate linear regression models based on soil properties offer superior estimates of FC.

TI  - A Multidisciplinary Approach to Evaluate the Environmental Impacts of Hydrocarbon Production in Khuzestan Province, Iran
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - From the late 1900s onward, hydrocarbon exploitation has led to severe environmental footprints in the Khuzestan province, Iran. However, no comprehensive study has been conducted to evaluate such issues. In this research, an inclusive analysis was performed to investigate these environmental impacts. To do this, first, two datasets related to a 15-year period (2006-2021) were collated: the satellite data from the Sentinel-1 mission and the seismic data recorded by the National Iranian Geophysics Institute as well as the catalog of the global Centroid Moment Tensor project (CMT). These datasets were processed using generic mapping tools (GMT), differential synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR) techniques, and multiple processing algorithms using a specific toolbox for oil spill application in the sentinel application platform (SNAP) programming, respectively. The results revealed three critical footprints, including regional earthquakes, land subsidence, and oil spill issues in the area. The most frequent earthquakes originated from depths less than 15 km, indicating the disturbance of the crustal tectonics by the regional hydrocarbons. Furthermore, an annual rate of land subsidence equal to 10-15 cm was observed in the coastal areas of the Khuzestan province. Moreover, two regions located in the north and west of the Persian Gulf were detected as the permanently oil-spilled areas. The applied methodology and results are quite applicable to restrict the harmful consequences of hydrocarbon production in the study area. This research will benefit not only government officials and policymakers, but also those looking to understand the environmental challenges related to oil and gas production, especially in terms of sustainable goals for the management of natural resources.

TI  - Influence of Vegetation on Simulation of the Water Balance and Hydrological Response to El Nino-Southern Oscillation in Western Tropical South America
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface models (LSMs) rely on vegetation parameters for use in hydrological and energy balance analysis, monitoring, and forecasting. This study examines the influence that vegetation representation in the Noah-Multiparameterization (Noah-MP) LSM has on hydrological simulations across the diverse climate zones of western tropical South America (WTSA), with specific consideration of hydrological variability associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The influence of model representation of vegetation on simulated hydrology is evaluated through three simulation experiments that use 1) satellite-derived constant MODIS; 2) satellite-derived time-varying MODIS; and 3) the Noah-MP dynamic leaf model. We find substantial differences in vegetation fields between these simulations, with the Noah-MP dynamic leaf model diverging significantly from satellite-derived vegetation fields in many ecoregions. Impacts on simulated hydrology were, however, found to be modest across climate zones, except for select extreme events. Also, although impacts on hydrology under ENSO-induced variability were small, we find that the Noah-MP dynamic leaf model simulates a positive relationship between rainfall and vegetation in humid ecoregions of WTSA, where satellite observations may indicate the opposite. The relatively small sensitivity of simulated hydrology to vegetation scheme suggests that the performance of hydrological monitoring and forecasting in WTSA that uses Noah-MP is largely unaffected by the choice of vegetation scheme, such that using a simple climatological default is generally no worse than adopting more complicated options. The presence of some differences between the time-varying and constant MODIS simulations for hydrologic extremes, however, indicates that time-varying MODIS configuration might be more suitable for hydrological hazards applications.

TI  - Twenty Years of Abdominal Wall Allotransplantation: A Systematic Review of the Short- and Long-Term Outcomes
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Abdominal wall allotransplantation following intestinal and multivisceral transplant procedures has proven to be successful in achieving adequate closure in patients in whom other techniques have proven inadequate. Thus far, the focus of these abdominal wall allotransplants has been on graft and overall patient survival following surgery and the implementation of immunosuppression. The purpose of this study was to review the outcomes of abdominal wall allotransplantation reported in the literature.Methods: The PubMed database was queried, and 2595 articles were found. Search criteria used were "abdominal wall transplant" and "abdominal wall allotransplant." Of these, eight met inclusion/exclusion criteria.Results: In the present study, eight publications were identified reporting abdominal wall allotransplants, for a total of 38 full-thickness abdominal wall allotransplantations performed worldwide. All studies reported abdominal wall allotransplantation in combination with visceral organ allotransplantation. Abdominal wall allotransplantations reported thus far have been nonneurotized. Abdominal wall allotransplantations have proven to be beneficial both in terms of abdominal wall closure and acting as a sentinel marker for rejection for underlying visceral organ allotransplantation. The success of abdominal wall allotransplants and their long-term survival has introduced the question of functionality and long-term durability. Cadaveric studies have shown that it is possible to neurotize abdominal wall allotransplants, and future direction toward neurotized abdominal wall allotransplantation requires tools to assess functional outcomes of these transplants.Conclusions: Abdominal wall allotransplantation is an important reconstructive option when abdominal wall closure is challenging and should be considered in combination with visceral organ allotransplantations. There may be potential benefit in neurotizing the abdominal wall allotransplant for functional use, and future studies should aim to include functional outcomes.

TI  - Application of Remote Sensing Methodology for Vehicle Emission Inspection
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing detection of vehicle emissions is an effective supplement to the statutory periodic inspection of in-use vehicle emissions and it is a convenient technical method for real-time screening of high-emission vehicles. The principle of remote sensing detection is to inversely calculate the absolute concentrations of gaseous pollutants in vehicle exhaust according to the relative volume concentration ratio of each exhaust component to carbon dioxide (CO2) in the vehicle exhaust plume. Because the combustion mechanisms of gasoline engines and diesel engines are different, different inversion calculation methods of remote sensing data must be applied. The absolute concentrations of gasoline vehicle gaseous emissions measured by remote sensing can be calculated by the inversion calculation method based on the theoretical air-fuel ratio combustion mechanism. However, the absolute concentrations of diesel vehicle nitrogen oxide (NOx) measured by remote sensing must be calculated by the inversion calculation method based on the correction of the excess air coefficient. For the integrated remote sensing test system of gasoline and diesel vehicles, it is necessary to determine the vehicle category according to the vehicle type and license plate and adopt different inversion calculation methods to obtain the correct remote sensing results of vehicle emissions. The big data statistical analysis method for vehicle emission remote sensing results can quickly screen high-emission vehicles and dynamically determine the remote sensing emission screening threshold of high-emission vehicles as the composition of in-use vehicles changes and the overall emission of vehicles declines, so as to achieve dynamic and accurate screening of high-emission vehicles.

M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In 2019 the opportunity to add a nurse within the radioguided surgery (RGS) team was generated. The referent nurse model was adapted to, the sentinel node (SN) preoperative approaches.Objectives: To describe the process performed to define the sentinel node referent nurse (SNRN) profile, to validate its practical application and to establish its clinical implementation.Material and methods: Methodology of analysis and continuous improvement in the management of processes (cycle PDCA): Definition and planning of the SNRN functions in the breast cancer protocol, performance of a pilot test with 20 patients and analysis of the data in order to validate the circuit and establish its final clinical implementation.Results: New procedure flows-charts were elaborated, adding the figure of the SNRN, its function and nursing interventions during the process. In the pilot test a 58.3% reduction in subjective anxiety, a 75% decrease of the overall anxiety level, a 100% knowledge of the test and an acceptable patient perception of pain's level during the radiotracer administration were obtained. Regarding technical quality, 8/10 items assessed reached the level previously established by the RGS team.Conclusions: The increasing complexity of the SN biopsy technique has created the opportunity to imple-ment nursing care in the presurgical SN localization process. The profile of the SNRN is ideal for carrying it out and has led to improvements in the nursing diagnoses and assessed items.(c) 2021 Sociedad Espanola de Medicina Nuclear e Imagen Molecular.

TI  - Development of Snow Cover Frequency Maps from MODIS Snow Cover Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With a decade scale record of global snow cover extent (SCE) at up to 500 m from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the dynamics of snow cover can be mapped at local to global scales. We developed daily snow cover frequency maps from 2001-2020 using a similar to 5 km resolution MODIS snow cover map. For each day of the year the maps show the frequency of snow cover for the 20-year period on a per-grid cell basis. Following on from other work to develop snow frequency maps using MODIS snow cover products, we include spatial filtering to reduce errors caused by 'false snow' that occurs primarily due to cloud-snow confusion. On our snow frequency maps, there were no regions or time periods with a noticeable absence of snow where snow was expected. In one example, the MODIS derived frequency of snow cover on 25 December compares well with NOAA's historical probability of snow on the same day. Though the MODIS derived snow frequency and NOAA probabilities are computed from very different data sources, they compare well. Though this preliminary research is promising, much future evaluation is needed.

TI  - Comparison of evaporation estimates from the REEM and EEFlux models in a shallow water body. Case: Bustillos Lake, Chihuahua, Mexico
T2  - TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA
M3  - Article
AB  - Waterbody evaporation (E) within endorheic basins in semiarid areas is critical in determining the water balance. Accurate E measurements can provide valuable information for the sustainable management of water resources in the face of climate change scenarios. However, evaporation can be estimated through methods as efficient as Penman using variables from agroclimatic stations, such as wind velocity, net radiation, relative humidity, and air temperature, which have spatiotemporal variability. Within the evaporation models based on remote sensing (RS) is the surface energy balance model (SEB), which has been applied to different methodologies and extends the measurements of evapotranspiration (ET) at a regional level. SEB-based methodologies use physical principles with minimal weather data requirements to estimate ET. Hence, this article compares two RS methodologies that estimate evaporation: The Regional Evapotranspiration Estimate Model (REEM) and the Earth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux (EEFlux). Comparing ET measurements obtained from REEM and EEFlux for seven Landsat OLI scenes in the agriculture cycle of April to September applied against the simplified Penman equation showed that the REEM performed better (d = 94 %) than the EEFlux (d = 68 %) for the indicated period. Although the comparison of REEM and EEFlux shows accurate E measurements (REEM), gridded weather data (EEFlux) needs to improve, increasing the scale using local information.

TI  - The Oncological Implication of Sentinel Lymph Node in Early Cervical Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Oncological Outcomes and Type of Recurrences
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Background and Objectives: Pelvic lymphadenectomy has been associated with radical hysterectomy for the treatment of early Cervical Cancer (ECC) since 1905. However, some complications are related to this technique, such as lymphedema and nerve damage. In addition, its clinical role is controversial. For this reason, the sentinel lymph node (SLN) has found increasing use in clinical practice over time. Oncologic safety, however, is debated, and there is no clear evidence in the literature regarding this. Therefore, our meta-analysis aims to schematically analyze the current scientific evidence to investigate the non-inferiority of SLN versus PLND regarding oncologic outcomes. Materials and Methods: Following the recommendations in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, we systematically searched the PubMed and Scopus databases in June 2022 since their early first publications. We made no restrictions on the country. We considered only studies entirely published in English. We included studies containing Disease-Free Survival (DFS), Overall Survival (OS), Recurrence Rate (RR), and site of recurrence data. We used comparative studies for meta-analysis. We registered this meta-analysis to the PROSPERO site for meta-analysis with protocol number CRD42022316650. Results: Twelve studies fulfilled inclusion criteria. The four comparative studies were enrolled in meta-analysis. Patients were analyzed concerning Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLN) and compared with Bilateral Pelvic Systematic Lymphadenectomy (PLND) in early-stage Cervical Cancer (ECC). Meta-analysis highlighted no differences in oncological safety between these two techniques, both in DFS and OS. Moreover, most of the sites of recurrences in the SLN group seemed not to be correlated with missed lymphadenectomy. Conclusions: Data in the literature do not seem to show clear oncologic inferiority of SLN over PLND. On the contrary, the higher detection rate of positive lymph nodes and the predominance of no lymph node recurrences give hope that this technique may equal PLND in oncologic terms, improving its morbidity profile.

T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Gastric cancer remains the sixth most prevalent malignant tumor worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer-related death. Surgery is the pillar of its treatment at all stages, but the importance of endoscopic treatments and multimodal therapy is growing. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive description of the role of surgery for gastric cancer in the modern era. Surgery still represents the mainstay of treatment of all stages of gastric cancer (GC). Surgical resections represent potentially curative options in the case of early GC with a low risk of node metastasis. Sentinel lymph node biopsy and indocyanine green fluorescence are novel techniques which may improve the employment of stomach-sparing procedures, ameliorating quality of life without compromising oncological radicality. Nonetheless, the diffusion of these techniques is limited in Western countries. Conversely, radical gastrectomy with extensive lymphadenectomy and multimodal treatment represents a valid option in the case of advanced GC. Differences between Eastern and Western recommendations still exist, and the optimal multimodal strategy is still a matter of investigation. Recent chemotherapy protocols have made surgery available for patients with oligometastatic disease. In this context, intraperitoneal administration of chemotherapy via HIPEC or PIPAC has emerged as an alternative weapon for patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. In conclusion, the surgical management of GC is still evolving together with the multimodal strategy. It is mandatory for surgeons to be conscious of the current evolution of the surgical management of GC in the era of multidisciplinary and tailored medicine.

TI  - Unbiasing the Estimation of Chlorophyll from Hyperspectral Images: A Benchmark Dataset, Validation Procedure and Baseline Results
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advancements in hyperspectral remote sensing bring exciting opportunities for various domains. Precision agriculture is one of the most widely-researched examples here, as it can benefit from the non-invasiveness and enormous scalability of the Earth observation solutions. In this paper, we focus on estimating the chlorophyll level in leaves using hyperspectral images-capturing this information may help farmers optimize their agricultural practices and is pivotal in planning the plants' treatment procedures. Although there are machine learning algorithms for this task, they are often validated over private datasets; therefore, their performance and generalization capabilities are virtually impossible to compare. We tackle this issue and introduce an open dataset including the hyperspectral and in situ ground-truth data, together with a validation procedure which is suggested to follow while investigating the emerging approaches for chlorophyll analysis with the use of our dataset. The experiments not only provided the solid baseline results obtained using 15 machine learning models over the introduced training-test dataset splits but also showed that it is possible to substantially improve the capabilities of the basic data-driven models. We believe that our work can become an important step toward standardizing the way the community validates algorithms for estimating chlorophyll-related parameters, and may be pivotal in consolidating the state of the art in the field by providing a clear and fair way of comparing new techniques over real data.

TI  - Cellular Automata-Based Artificial Neural Network Model for Assessing Past, Present, and Future Land Use/Land Cover Dynamics
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover change (LULCC) is among the most apparent natural landscape processes impacted by anthropogenic activities, particularly in fast-growing regions. In India, at present, due to the impacts of anthropogenic climate change, supplemented by the fast pace of developmental activities, the areas providing the highest agricultural yields are facing the threat of either extinction or change in land use. This study assesses the LULCC in the fastest-changing landscape region of the Indian state of Bihar, District Muzaffarpur. This district is known for its litchi cultivation, which, over the last few years, has been observed to be increasing in acreage at the behest of a decrease in natural vegetation. In this study, we aim to assess the past, present and future changes in LULC of the Muzaffarpur district using support vector classification and CA-ANN (cellular automata-artificial neural network) algorithms. For assessing the present and past LULC of the study area, we used Landsat Satellite data for 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. It was observed that between 1990 and 2020, the area under vegetation, wetlands, water body, and fallow land decreased by 44.28%, 34.82%, 25.56%, and 5.63%, respectively. At the same time, the area under built-up, litchi plantation, and cropland increased by 1451.30%, 181.91%, and 5.66%, respectively. Extensive ground truthing was carried out to assess the accuracy of the LULC for 2020, whereas historical google earth images were used for 1990, 2000, and 2010, through the use of overall accuracy and kappa coefficient indices. The kappa coefficients for the final LULC for the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 were 0.79, 0.75, 0.87, and 0.85, respectively. For forecasting the future LULC, first, the LULC of 1990 and 2010 were used to predict the landscape for 2020 using the CA-ANN model. After calibrating and validating the CA-ANN outputs, LULC for 2030 and 2050 were generated. The generated future LULC scenarios were validated using kappa index statistics by comparing the forecast outcomes with the original LULC data for 2020. It was observed that in both 2030 and 2050, built-up and vegetation would be the major transitioning LULC. In 2030 and 2050, built-up will increase by 13.15% and 108.69%, respectively, compared to its area in 2020; whereas vegetation is expected to decrease by 14.30% in 2030 and 32.84% in 2050 compared to its area in 2020. Overall, this study depicted a decline in the natural landscape and a sudden increase in the built-up and cash-crop area. If such trends continue, the future scenario of LULC will also demonstrate the same pattern. This study will help formulate better land use management policy in the study area, and the overall state of Bihar, which is considered to be the poorest state of India and the most vulnerable to natural calamities. It also demonstrates the ability of the CA-ANN model to forecast future events and comprehend spatiotemporal LULC dynamics.

TI  - COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is associated with beliefs on the origin of the novel coronavirus in the UK and Turkey
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Letter
AB  - Background. Much research effort is focused on developing an effective vaccine for combatting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Vaccine development itself, however, will not be enough given that a sufficient amount of people will need to be vaccinated for widespread immunity. Vaccine hesitancy is on the rise, varies across countries, and is associated with conspiratorial worldview. Given the rise in COVID-19-related conspiracy theories, we aimed to examine the levels of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its association with beliefs on the origin of the novel coronavirus in a cross-cultural study.Methods. We conducted an online survey in the UK (N = 1088) and Turkey (N = 3936), and gathered information on participants' willingness to vaccinate for a potential COVID-19 vaccine, beliefs on the origin of the novel coronavirus, and several behavioural and demographic predictors (such as anxiety, risk perception, government satisfaction levels) that influence vaccination and origin beliefs.Results. In all, 31% of the participants in Turkey and 14% in the UK were unsure about getting themselves vaccinated for a COVID-19 vaccine. In both countries, 3% of the participants rejected to be vaccinated. Also, 54% of the participants in Turkey and 63% in the UK believed in the natural origin of the novel coronavirus. Believing in the natural origin significantly increased the odds of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance.Conclusions. Our results point at a concerning level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, especially in Turkey, and suggest that wider communication of the scientific consensus on the origin of the novel coronavirus with the public may help future campaigns targeting COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.

TI  - SEG-ESRGAN: A Multi-Task Network for Super-Resolution and Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The production of highly accurate land cover maps is one of the primary challenges in remote sensing, which depends on the spatial resolution of the input images. Sometimes, high-resolution imagery is not available or is too expensive to cover large areas or to perform multitemporal analysis. In this context, we propose a multi-task network to take advantage of the freely available Sentinel-2 imagery to produce a super-resolution image, with a scaling factor of 5, and the corresponding high-resolution land cover map. Our proposal, named SEG-ESRGAN, consists of two branches: the super-resolution branch, that produces Sentinel-2 multispectral images at 2 m resolution, and an encoder-decoder architecture for the semantic segmentation branch, that generates the enhanced land cover map. From the super-resolution branch, several skip connections are retrieved and concatenated with features from the different stages of the encoder part of the segmentation branch, promoting the flow of meaningful information to boost the accuracy in the segmentation task. Our model is trained with a multi-loss approach using a novel dataset to train and test the super-resolution stage, which is developed from Sentinel-2 and WorldView-2 image pairs. In addition, we generated a dataset with ground-truth labels for the segmentation task. To assess the super-resolution improvement, the PSNR, SSIM, ERGAS, and SAM metrics were considered, while to measure the classification performance, we used the IoU, confusion matrix and the F1-score. Experimental results demonstrate that the SEG-ESRGAN model outperforms different full segmentation and dual network models (U-Net, DeepLabV3+, HRNet and Dual_DeepLab), allowing the generation of high-resolution land cover maps in challenging scenarios using Sentinel-2 10 m bands.

TI  - Developing and Using Empirical Bio-Optical Algorithms in the Western Part of the Bering Sea in the Late Summer Season
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to assess the applicability of global bio-optical algorithms for the estimation of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration (C) and develop regional empirical bio-optical algorithms for estimating C and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) content (D) from ocean remote sensing reflectance spectra in the western part of the Bering Sea in the late summer period. The analysis took into account possible problems with the different relative contributions of phytoplankton and CDOM to water-leaving radiance and possible errors associated with the atmosphere correction procedure for ocean color satellite data. Shipborne remote sensing measurements obtained using an above-water hyperspectral ASD HandHeld spectroradiometer, satellite measurements collected via MODIS and VIIRS radiometers, and in situ measurements of C and D in seawater were used. The simulated values of the different multispectral satellite radiometers with daily or 2-day global coverage, obtained by applying the corresponding spectral response functions to ship hyperspectral data, were also analyzed. In this paper, a list of recommended regional bio-optical algorithms is presented. Recommendations are given depending on the possible quality of atmospheric correction and the purpose of use. To obtain more precise estimations of C, OC3/OC4-like algorithms should be used. If the atmosphere correction is poor, then use OC2-like algorithms in which spectral bands in the 476-539 nm range should be used to estimate C and bands near 443 nm to estimate D; however, in the last case, this will provide only the order of magnitude. To estimate more independent fields of C and D, it is necessary to use a spectral range of 501-539 nm for chl-a and bands near 412 nm in the case of modern satellite radiometers (e.g., OLCI or SGLI), for which this band is not the first. Additionally, we showed that global bio-optical algorithms can be applied with acceptable accuracy and similar recommendations.

TI  - Early-Stage Oral Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma and a Positive Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy: Description of a Prognostic Correlation between Pre-Treatment Inflammatory Biomarkers, the Depth of Invasion and the Worst Pattern of Invasion
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between pre-treatment inflammatory biomarkers and the post-operative depth of invasion (DOI) and worst pattern of invasion (WPOI) in early-stage oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) by means of positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). A retrospective analysis of patients affected by cN0 T1-T2 OTSCC who had undergone an SLNB at the National Cancer Institute of Naples was performed. The patients were studied using an evaluation of the pre-treatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII), and a histopathological analysis of the DOI and WPOI. The statistical analysis showed that among the prognostic biomarkers, the NLR was a significant predictor of high WPOI values (p = 0.002). The cut-off NLR value was 2.52 with a probability of developing a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) of 30.3%. In contrast, the DOI value was 5.20 with a probability of developing a positive SLNB of 31.82%. Regarding the WPOI, increasing the WPOI class increased the likelihood of a positive SLNB occurrence, and a positive significant correlation was found between the WPOI and SLNB (C-sp = 0.342; p < 0.001). Pre-treatment NLR, together with post-surgical DOI and WPOI, can be a reliable predictor of occult neck metastasis in patients affected by early-stage OTSCC with a clinically negative neck. Further prospective studies with a larger series will be needed to confirm the results obtained and to better define the NLR, WPOI and DOI cut-off values in order for elective neck dissection to be recommended in relation to a clinically negative neck.

TI  - Short-Lived Aggregations of <i>Filograna</i>/<i>Salmacina</i> Tube Worms in the Gulf of Oman
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Dense aggregations of serpulid worms were encountered in the Daymaniyat Islands (Gulf of Oman) from 10 to 20 m depth, over the period January-March, 2021. The species responsible for these aggregations belongs to the Filograna/Salmacina-complex (Annelida: Serpulidae). This species has been present in the area and observed along the Oman coastline, but high-density aggregates like this have not been reported before. The most probable cause of the aggregations, supported by field observations and Aqua-MODIS satellite data, was natural eutrophication with a subsequent algal bloom linked to the local winter monsoon. This observation emphasises the importance of documenting biodiversity and dynamics of reef communities along the Oman coastline.

TI  - Classification from Sky: A Robust Remote Sensing Time Series Image Classification Using Spatial Encoder and Multi -Fast Channel Attention
T2  - JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The unparalleled availability of Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) for crop phenology classification unravels agricultural parcel observation and monitoring with applications of both economic and ecological importance. Moreover, the need for distinct classification of agricultural parcels into individual crop types falls on state-of-the-art deep learning models for this extrinsic task. However, most existing approaches implemented are complex and ineffective attention incorporated models, which in turn lack the resilience to recognize useful bands in achieving greater accuracy. We propose a Multi-Fast Channel Attention module for deep CNNs based on a Spatial Encoder (SE-MFCA) that requires a few parameters while enhancing the performance-complexity trade-off dilemma. Hence, we leverage on spatial encoder module to extract the images as disorderly sets of pixels to enhance the coarse spatial resolution features. We empirically show that appropriate parameter sharing in the cross channel interaction can preserve performance while significantly reducing model complexity. The proposed multi-channel attention module can efficiently be implemented via an encoder-decoder network to prevent the loss of detailed spatial information. Again, we parallelly distributed the input channel into multiple heads in our network to recover the specialized input features, which will concatenate with the residual to form a rich single feature representation. The extensive experiment has shown that our model SE-MFCA is efficient and effective compared with the previous state-of-the-art time series classification algorithm on a publicly available dataset of Sentinel -2 images for agricultural parcels. Performance-wise SE-MFCA achieves the highest overall accuracy of 94.50% and the highest mean intersection over union score of 51.92%, besides the least trainable params of 131 K and fewer floating point operations of 0.16 M.

TI  - Comparison of TROPOMI NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, HCHO, and SO<sub>2</sub> data against ground-level measurements in close proximity to large anthropogenic emission sources in the example of Ukraine
T2  - METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) significantly improved the quality of air pollution monitoring. The comparison against other data sources showed acceptable results and good correlation. However, highly polluted areas remain the reason for large uncertainties. In our study, we compared TROPOMI NO2, CO, HCHO, and SO2 data against ground-level measurements from Ukrainian monitoring sites, which could be considered rather unusual due to their close location to large anthropogenic emission sources. These sites were established in the former USSR to reflect the maximal air pollution levels. TROPOMI detected all cities with huge anthropogenic emissions in 2019-2020 and qualitatively reflected air pollution in Ukraine. However, direct comparison against individual monitoring sites showed mainly insignificant correlation, which was not much improved with cloudiness filtering, spatial averaging, and considering boundary layer height. We show that on an hour-to-daily scale, differences appear when remote sensing at a particular time cannot catch the elevated pollution levels in the boundary layer after air mass transportation. On a seasonal scale, the correlation decreases because of the differences in seasonality between near-surface and column pollutants' content. We discuss that the relationship between TROPOMI and ground-level measurements depends on the season, the continuance of industrial emissions, and the features of individual emission sources.

TI  - Association between Land Surface Temperature and Green Volume in Bochum, Germany
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Average temperatures continue to rise throughout the world due to climate change and, thus, also in Europe, often occurring as heat waves. The negative effects of climate change-related heat waves can be observed, especially in urban areas where land sealing is the greatest and so is population density. Past studies have indicated that green volume can provide climate improvement by balancing humidity and regulating temperature. This study aims to estimate the distribution of surface heat islands and green volume and test the relationship between these variables in a case study of Bochum, Germany. A method to develop a temporally longitudinal 30-m Landsat 8-based land surface temperature (LST) analysis and 30-m LiDAR-based green volume dataset are presented, and their relationship is tested using Pearson's correlation (n = 148,204). The results show that heat islands are moderately negatively correlated with green volume (r = -0.482; p < 0.05), LST can vary as much as 28 degrees degrees C between heat islands and densely vegetated areas, and the distribution is heterogeneous across Bochum.

TI  - Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Cloud Radiative Swath (CRS) Edition 4 Data Product
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations from Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) radiometers have produced over two decades of world-class data documenting time-space variations in Earth's top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiation budget. In addition to energy exchanges among Earth and space, climate studies require accurate information on radiant energy exchanges at the surface and within the atmosphere. The CERES Cloud Radiative Swath (CRS) data product extends the standard Single Scanner Footprint (SSF) data product by calculating a suite of radiative fluxes from the surface to TOA at the instantaneous CERES footprint scale using the NASA Langley Fu-Liou radiative transfer model. Here, we describe the CRS flux algorithm and evaluate its performance against a network of ground-based measurements and CERES TOA observations. CRS all-sky downwelling broadband fluxes show significant improvements in surface validation statistics relative to the parameterized fluxes on the SSF product, including a similar to 30%-40% (similar to 20%) reduction in SW down arrow (LW down arrow) root-mean-square error (RMS Delta), improved correlation coefficients, and the lowest SW down arrow bias over most surface types. RMS Delta and correlation statistics improve over five different surface types under both overcast and clear-sky conditions. The global mean computed TOA outgoing LW radiation (OLR) remains within <1% (2-3 W m(-2)) of CERES observations, while the global mean reflected SW radiation (RSW) is excessive by similar to 3.5% (similar to 9 W m(-2)) owing to cloudy-sky computation errors. As we highlight using data from two remote field campaigns, the CRS data product provides many benefits for studies requiring advanced surface radiative fluxes.

TI  - Improved Lithological Map of Large Complex Semi-Arid Regions Using Spectral and Textural Datasets within Google Earth Engine and Fused Machine Learning Multi-Classifiers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this era of free and open-access satellite and spatial data, modern innovations in cloud computing and machine-learning algorithms (MLAs) are transforming how Earth-observation (EO) datasets are utilized for geological mapping. This study aims to exploit the potentialities of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform using powerful MLAs. The proposed method is implemented in three steps: (1) Based on GEE and Sentinel 2A imagery (spectral and textural features), that cover 1283 km(2) area, a variety of lithological maps are generated using five supervised classifiers (random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression tree (CART), minimum distance (MD), naive Bayes (NB)); (2) the accuracy assessments for each class are performed, by estimating overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (K) for each classifier; (3) finally, the fusion of classification maps is performed using Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) for mapping lithological units of the northern part of the complex Paleozoic massif of Rehamna, a large semi-arid region located in the SW of the western Moroccan Meseta. The results were quantitatively compared with existing geological maps, enhanced color composite and validated by field survey investigation. In comparison of individual classifiers, the SVM yields better accuracy of nearly 88%, which was 12% higher than the RF MLA; otherwise, the parametric MLAs produce the weakest lithological maps among other classifiers, with a lower OA of approximately 67%, 54% and 52% for CART, MD and NB, respectively. Noticeably, the highest OA value of 96% is achieved for the proposed approach. Therefore, we conclude that this method allows geoscientists to update previous geological maps and rapidly produce more precise lithological maps, especially for hard-to-reach regions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Distribution Characteristics of Fire Scars Further Prove the Correlation between Permafrost Swamp Wildfires and Methane Geological Emissions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Affected by global warming, methane gas released by permafrost degradation may increase the frequency of wildfires, and there are few studies on wildfires in permafrost regions and their correlation with climate and regional methane emissions. The northwestern section of the Xiaoxing'an Mountains in China was selected as the study area, and the spatial relationship between permafrost and spring wildfires was studied based on Landsat TM and Sentinel-2 data. Combined with monitoring data of air temperature, humidity, and methane concentration, the impact of methane emissions on spring wildfires was analyzed. The study shows that the spatial distribution of fire scars in spring is highly consistent with permafrost, and the change trend of fire scars is in line with the law of permafrost degradation. Wildfires occur intensively during the snow melting period in spring, and the temporal variation pattern is basically consistent with the methane concentration. The number of fire points was positively correlated with air temperature and methane concentration in March and April, and spring wildfires in permafrost regions are the result of a combination of rising seasonal temperatures, surface snow melting, and concentrated methane emissions. Larger areas of discontinuous permafrost are more prone to recurring wildfires.

TI  - Prospectivity Mapping of Heavy Mineral Ore Deposits Based upon Machine-Learning Algorithms: Columbite-Tantalite Deposits in West- Central Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to model the prospectivity for placer deposits using geomorphic and landscape parameters. Within a geographic information system (GIS), spatial autocorrelation analysis of 3709 geochemical samples was used to identify prospective and non-prospective targets for columbite-tantalite (Nb-Ta) placer deposits of Hana-Lobo (H-L) Geological Complex (West- Central Cote d'Ivoire, West Africa). Based on mineralization system analysis, hydrologic, geomorphologic and landscape parameters were extracted at the locations of the identified targets. Supervised automatic classification approaches were applied, including Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to find a prospectivity model complex enough to capture the nature of the data. Metrics such as cross-validation accuracy (CVA), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, Area Under Curve (AUC) values and F-score values were used to evaluate the performance and robustness of output models. Results of applying machine-learning algorithms demonstrated that predictions provided by the final RF and KNN models were very close (kappa = 0.56 and CVA = 0.69; kappa = 0.54 and CVA = 0.68, respectively) and those provided by the SVM models were slightly lower with kappa = 0.46 and CVA = 0.63. Independent validation results confirmed the slightly higher performance of both KNN and RF prospectivity models, compared to final SVM. Sensitivity analyses of both KNN and RF prospectivity models for medium and high-grade Nb-Ta deposits show a prediction rate of up to 90%.

TI  - A qualitative study of early career Australian midwives' encounters with perinatal grief, loss and trauma.
T2  - Women and birth : journal of the Australian College of Midwives
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PROBLEM: The health of women is dependent on midwifery workforce stability. Retaining new midwives is paramount, however without support, the early career can be a vulnerable time for midwives.BACKGROUND: Midwives care for women who experience poor perinatal outcomes like stillbirth and neonatal death. Midwifery care in these sentinel events is complex. There is limited understanding of early career midwives' experiences within these encounters.AIM: To understand the experiences of Australian early career midwives' clinical encounters with perinatal grief, loss and trauma.METHODS: A qualitative descriptive/exploratory study using in-depth interviews.FINDINGS: Four themes were identified from interview data: (1) all eyes on the skills; (2) support is of the essence; (3) enduring an emotional toll; (4) at all times, the woman. Most participants had minimal exposure to perinatal loss as a student. As a result, most felt unskilled and unprepared for this as a new midwife.DISCUSSION: Types and degrees of support varied in these encounters. Early career midwives who were well supported reflected positively on working with grief and loss. In contrast, inadequate or absent support had detrimental effects on participant wellbeing. Poorly supported encounters with death (intrapartum fetal, early neonatal, and maternal) in the early career period were significantly distressful, giving rise to mental and emotional distress.CONCLUSION: Pre-registration perinatal loss skill development and supported experiences are necessary for preparedness. Continued education, formalised debriefing and mentoring, institutional philosophies which promote collegial ethics of care, and the expansion of continuity of midwifery care models will improve new midwives' experiences.

TI  - Natural and human activities driving the spatiotemporal variability of water clarity in lakes across Eastern China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity, indexed by Secchi disk depth (Zsd), comprehensively reflects water quality and can be monitored by satellite. Zsd may vary across lakes globally, driven by natural and human activities (climate, land use/land cover, lake morphological characteristics, etc.). Based on Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) imagery, we explored the driving factors of Zsd spatiotemporal patterns in lakes across Eastern China (including the Northeast Plain and Mountain Lake (NPML) Zone and the Eastern Plain Lake (EPL) Zone). Spatially, the responses of driving factors were assessed using feature importance and partial dependence in the random forest model. The results showed that the impacts of natural factors on the spatial variations of Zsd (accounting for 52.00 % of contributions) are comparable to that of human activities (accounting for 48.00 % of contributions). The dynamic sediment ratio (DSR = the square root of the surface area divided by the average depth) showed the highest impact (accounting for 19.64 % of contributions). Thus, small lakes have relatively small DSR indices, making them less susceptible to wind-and wave-induced sediment resuspension, leading to higher Zsd than large lakes. Seasonally, the variations could be linked with the East Asian monsoon climate, characterized by hot and rainy summers. Moreover, the month with the highest Zsd was postponed from June-July in EPL lakes (south) to August-September in NPML lakes (north), consistent with the movement of the rainfall belt of the East Asian monsoon. This study could facilitate the knowledge of water quality in Eastern China as well as other developed areas and provide support for the sustainable development and management of lakes.

TI  - Assimilation of Deep Learning and Machine Learning Schemes into a Remote Sensing-Incorporated Crop Model to Simulate Barley and Wheat Productivities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) procedures are prevailing data-driven schemes capable of advancing crop-modelling practices that assimilate these techniques into a mathematical crop model. A DL or ML modelling scheme can effectively represent complicated algorithms. This study reports on an advanced fusion methodology for evaluating the leaf area index (LAI) of barley and wheat that employs remotely sensed information based on deep neural network (DNN) and ML regression approaches. We investigated the most appropriate ML regressors for exploring LAI estimations of barley and wheat through the relationships between the LAI values and four vegetation indices. After analysing ten ML regression models, we concluded that the gradient boost (GB) regressor most effectively estimated the LAI for both barley and wheat. Furthermore, the GB regressor outperformed the DNN regressor, with model efficiencies of 0.89 for barley and 0.45 for wheat. Additionally, we verified that it would be possible to simulate LAI using proximal and remote sensing data based on assimilating the DNN and ML regressors into a process-based mathematical crop model. In summary, we have demonstrated that if DNN and ML schemes are integrated into a crop model, they can facilitate crop growth and boost productivity monitoring.

TI  - Simulating land surface temperature using biophysical variables related to building density and height in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Land use and land cover dynamics are pivotal to communicating land surface temperature (LST) scenarios. This study characterises the influence of biophysical variables on LSTs in the Dar es Salaam Metropolitan City (DMC). Landsat images were analysed using geographically weighted regression (GWR) and ordinary least square (OLS) models to determine biophysical variables (soil adjusted vegetation index, normalized difference built-up index, and normalised difference bareness index) and LST relationships. The GWR analysis resultsrevealed that LST had a weak to strong negative correlation with the soil adjusted vegetation index, a moderate positive correlation with normalized difference built-up index, and a low positive correlation with the normalised difference bareness index. GWR predicted LST better than OLS, with coefficient of determination -R-2 values of 55%, 80%, and 62% for 1995, 2009, and 2017, respectively. In addition, higher model residuals values were observed in high building density compared to low building density areas. This study provides a broad understanding of the biophysical variables' impact on LST in DMC and provides reference for site-specific urban land-use planning and designing strategies for LST mitigation.

TI  - Convolutional Neural Networks for Agricultural Land Use Classification from Sentinel-2 Image Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use classification (LUC) is the process of providing information on land cover and the types of human activity involved in land use. In this study, we perform agricultural LUC using sequences of multispectral reflectance Sentinel-2 images taken in 2018. LUC can be carried out using machine or deep learning techniques. Some existing models process data at the pixel level, performing LUC successfully with a reduced number of images. Part of the pixel information corresponds to multispectral temporal patterns that, despite not being especially complex, might remain undetected by models such as random forests or multilayer perceptrons. Thus, we propose to arrange pixel information as 2D yearly fingerprints so as to render such patterns explicit and make use of a CNN to model and capture them. The results show that our proposal reaches a 91% weighted accuracy in classifying pixels among 19 classes, outperforming random forest by 8%, or a specifically tuned multilayer perceptron by 4%. Furthermore, models were also used to perform a ternary classification in order to detect irrigated fields, reaching a 97% global accuracy. We can conclude that this is a promising operational tool for monitoring crops and water use over large areas.

TI  - SPECT/CT Lymphoscintigraphy Guidance Simplifies and Improves Targeted Axillary Dissection of the Clipped Nodes After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Initially Node-Positive Breast Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose We assessed the feasibility of SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy ((99m) Tc-nanocolloid) method to simplify and improve targeted axillary dissection of clipped axillary lymph node (axLN) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in initially node-positive breast cancer. Patients and Methods Fifteen patients who had clip placement to biopsy-confirmed axLN metastasis due to clinically node-positive breast cancer before NAC and underwent SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy for surgery after NAC were included into the study. SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy was performed to localize the clipped node and to assess if the clipped lymph node (LN) had Tc-99m-nanocolloid uptake or not. In case the clipped node had no uptake on SPECT/CT, the patient was referred to wire-guided localization procedure. Blue dye was also injected for dual mapping of sentinel LN biopsy. Results All patients had only ipsilateral axLN metastasis. SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy showed that clipped LNs were radioavid in 12 of 15 patients (80%). Clipped LNs were not blue-stained in 5 patients (33.3%), and in 2 of them, clipped LNs were radioavid in SPECT/CT. Wire-guided localization was required in only 3 patients (20%) for nonradioavid/blue-stained clipped LNs. Removal of the clipped nodes was confirmed in all cases with a success rate of 100% by specimen graphy. Conclusion SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy seems feasible to determine the clipped LNs intraoperatively without requiring additional invasive methods in most of the patients. This technique simplifies and improves targeted axillary dissection of the clipped axLNs after NAC in initially node-positive breast cancer and can be adapted to clinical practice with further investigations.

TI  - EMCS: An Energy-Efficient Makespan Cost-Aware Scheduling Algorithm Using Evolutionary Learning Approach for Cloud-Fog-Based IoT Applications
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The tremendous expansion of the Internet of Things (IoTs) has generated an enormous volume of near and remote sensing data, which is increasing with the emergence of new solutions for sustainable environments. Cloud computing is typically used to help resource-constrained IoT sensing devices. However, the cloud servers are placed deep within the core network, a long way from the IoT, introducing immense data transactions. These transactions require heavy electricity consumption and release harmful CO2 to the environment. A distributed computing environment located at the edge of the network named fog computing has been promoted to reduce the limitation of cloud computing for IoT applications. Fog computing potentially processes real-time and delay-sensitive data, and it reduces the traffic, which minimizes the energy consumption. The additional energy consumption can be reduced by implementing an energy-aware task scheduling, which decides on the execution of tasks at cloud or fog nodes on the basis of minimum completion time, cost, and energy consumption. In this paper, an algorithm called energy-efficient makespan cost-aware scheduling (EMCS) is proposed using an evolutionary strategy to optimize the execution time, cost, and energy consumption. The performance of this work is evaluated using extensive simulations. Results show that EMCS is 67.1% better than cost makespan-aware scheduling (CMaS), 58.79% better than Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT), 54.68% better than Bees Life Algorithm (BLA) and 47.81% better than Evolutionary Task Scheduling (ETS) in terms of makespan. Comparing the cost of the EMCS model, it uses 62.4% less cost than CMaS, 26.41% less than BLA, and 6.7% less than ETS. When comparing energy consumption, EMCS consumes 11.55% less than CMaS, 4.75% less than BLA and 3.19% less than ETS. Results also show that with an increase in the number of fog and cloud nodes, the balance between cloud and fog nodes gives better performance in terms of makespan, cost, and energy consumption.

TI  - Climatology and model prediction of aerosol optical properties over the Indo-Gangetic Basin in north India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The current research focuses on the use of different simulation techniques in the future prediction of the crucial aerosol optical properties over the highly polluted Indo-Gangetic Basin in the northern part of India. The time series model was used to make an accurate forecast of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and angstrom exponent (AE), and the statistical variability of both cases was compared in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the model (training and validation). For this, different models were used to simulate the monthly average AOD and AE over Jaipur, Kanpur and Ballia during the period from 2003 to 2018. Further, the study was aimed to construct a comparative model that will be used for time series statistical analysis of MODIS-derived AOD(550) and AE(412-470). This will provide a more comprehensive information about the levels of AOD and AE that will exist in the future. To test the validity and applicability of the developed models, root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percent error (MAPE), fractional bias (FB), and Pearson coefficient (r) were used to show adequate accuracy in model performance. From the observation, the monthly mean values of AOD and AE were found to be nearly similar at Kanpur and Ballia (0.62 and 1.26) and different at Jaipur (0.25 and 1.14). Jaipur indicates that during the pre-monsoon season, the AOD mean value was found to be highest (0.32 +/- 0.15), while Kanpur and Ballia display higher AOD mean values during the winter season (0.72 +/- 0.26 and 0.83 +/- 0.32, respectively). Among the different methods, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was found to be the best-suited model for AOD prediction at Ballia based on fitted error (RMSE (0.22), MAE (0.15), MAPE (24.55), FB (0.05)) and Pearson coefficient r (0.83). However, for AE, best prediction was found at Kanpur based on RMSE (0.24), MAE (0.21), MAPE (22.54), FB (-0.09) and Pearson coefficient r (0.82).

TI  - Estimation and validation of standalone SCATSAT-1 derived snow cover area using different MODIS products
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present work, the scatterometer satellite (SCATSAT-1) has been implemented and validated to provide the near-real-time estimation of snow cover area (SCA) in the Western Himalayas, India. The SCA derived from standalone SCATSAT-1 L4 (Level-4 India) products, i.e. sigma-nought (sigma degrees), and gamma-nought (gamma degrees) has been validated with different MODIS products individually, i.e. MOD02 L1B (calibrated-radiances) derived NDSI (normalized difference snow index), MOD10A1 L3 (daily composite snow cover), and MOD10A2 L3 (8-Day composite snow cover). The experimental outcomes confirm the potential of SCATSAT-1 in estimating the SCA with respect to other MODIS products and also, suggested the utilization of the different MODIS products for referencing/validation in different scenarios. The findings of this paper suggest that SCATSAT-1 offers the near real-time mapping and monitoring of large-scale snow extent at the global level even under cloudy conditions.

TI  - Water Accounting Using Satellite Products and Water Accounting Plus Framework in a Semi-Arid Betwa River Basin, India
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The emerging water crisis in India can be preempted by improving watershed management. The data scare regions need open access satellite observations to mitigate watershed problems. The water accounting plus (WA+) and open access earth observation datasets were applied to quantify the beneficial and non-beneficial water consumption in the Betwa River basin, Central India. The PERSIANN and CHIRPS precipitations were evaluated. Based on significant statistical relations with IMD rainfall, CHIRPS was found to be the best precipitation product. The seasonal water yield from PERSIANN depicts that the high water yield in the basin is associated with the July and August months of the monsoon season, with water yields of 240 mm/month and 120 mm/month, respectively, while CHIRPS showed higher water yields during the monsoon season, especially in July and August, with water yield amounts of 290 mm/month and 200 mm/month, respectively. The largest water consuming land use class is irrigated crops-cereals, which cover 62.06% of the total area of the basin. The amount of non-beneficial ET is almost twice the beneficial ET. The outcomes of this research will be helpful for sustainable water management, strategy development, and policy making.

AB  - In patients with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and clinically positive nodes (cN1) who demonstrate an axillary clinical response to neoadjuvant-chemotherapy (NAC), the outcomes of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) compared to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) are not well studied. We sought to evaluate axillary surgery practice patterns and the resultant impact on overall survival (OS) in cN1 ILC. The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried (2012-2017) for women with cN1 ILC who were treated with NAC followed by surgery. Propensity-score matching was performed between SLNB and ALND cohorts. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of OS. Of 1390 patients, 1192 were luminal A ILCs (85.8%). 143 patients (10.3%) had a complete axillary clinical response, while 1247 (89.7%) had a partial clinical response in the axilla. Definitive axillary surgery was SLNB in 211 patients (15.2%). Utilization of SLNB for definitive axillary management increased from 8% to 16% during the study period. Among 201 propensity-score matched patients stratified by SLNB vs. ALND, mean OS did not significantly differ (81.6 +/- 1.8 vs. 81.4 +/- 2.0 months; p = 0.56). Cox regression analysis of the entire cohort demonstrated that increasing age, grade, HER2+ and triple-negative tumors, and partial clinical response were unfavorable OS predictors (p < 0.02 each). The definitive axillary operation and administration of adjuvant axillary radiation did not influence OS. In cN1 ILC patients with a clinical response to NAC in the axilla, SLNB vs. ALND did not affect OS. Further axillary therapy may be warranted with ypN+ disease.

TI  - Assessing Changes in Boreal Vegetation of Kola Peninsula via Large-Scale Land Cover Classification between 1985 and 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The effective monitoring of boreal and tundra vegetation at different scales and environmental management at latitudes above 50 degrees North relies heavily on remote sensing. The vastness, remoteness and, in the case of Russia, the difficulty of access to boreal-tundra vegetation make it an ideal technique for vegetation monitoring in the Kola peninsula, located predominantly beyond the Arctic circle in the European part of Russia. Since the 1930s, this area has been highly urbanised and exposed to strong influence by a number of different types of human impact, such as toxic pollutions, fires, mineral excavation, grazing, logging, etc. Extensive open archives of remote sensing imagery as well as recent advances in machine learning further enable the efficient use of remote sensing methods for assessing land cover changes. Here, we present the results of mapping northern vegetation land cover and changes in it over a large territory, in time and under human impact based on remote imagery from Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI. We study the area of about 37,000 km2 located in the central part of the Kola peninsula in the boreal, pre-tundra and tundra between 1985 and 2021 with a time interval of approximately 5 years and confirm the correlations between the human pressure and the level of vegetation changes. We put those into the perspective of year-on-year changes in the temperature and precipitation regimes and describe the recovery of the damaged original boreal vegetation (dominated by spruce) through pine and deciduous vegetation. As a by-product of this study, we develop and test an approach for the semi-automated processing and classification of Landsat images using the novel TensorFlow machine learning technique (widely spread across other disciplines) that enables high-throughput classification, even on conventional hardware.

TI  - The Sentinel 2 MSI Spectral Mixing Space
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A composite spectral feature space is used to characterize the spectral mixing properties of Sentinel 2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) spectra over a wide diversity of landscapes. Characterizing the linearity of spectral mixing and identifying bounding spectral endmembers allows the Substrate Vegetation Dark (SVD) spectral mixture model previously developed for the Landsat and MODIS sensors to be extended to the Sentinel 2 MSI sensors. The utility of the SVD model is its ability to represent a wide variety of landscapes in terms of the areal abundance of their most spectrally and physically distinct components. Combining the benefits of location-specific spectral mixture models with standardized spectral indices, the physically based SVD model offers simplicity, consistency, inclusivity and applicability for a wide variety of land cover mapping applications. In this study, a set of 110 image tiles compiled from spectral diversity hotspots worldwide provide a basis for this characterization, and for identification of spectral endmembers that span the feature space. The resulting spectral mixing space of these 13,000,000,000 spectra is effectively 3D, with 99% of variance in 3 low order principal component dimensions. Four physically distinct spectral mixing continua are identified: Snow:Firn:Ice, Reef:Water, Evaporite:Water and Substrate:Vegetation:Dark (water or shadow). The first 3 continua exhibit complex nonlinearities, but the geographically dominant Substrate:Vegetation:Dark (SVD) continuum is conspicuous in the linearity of its spectral mixing. Bounding endmember spectra are identified for the SVD continuum. In a subset of 80 landscapes, excluding the 3 nonlinear mixing continua (reefs, evaporites, cryosphere), a 3 endmember (SVD) linear mixture model produces endmember fraction estimates that represent 99% of modeled spectra with <6% RMS misfit. Two sets of SVD endmembers are identified for the Sentinel 2 MSI sensors, allowing Sentinel 2 spectra to be unmixed globally and compared across time and space. In light of the apparent disparity between the 11D spectral feature space and the statistically 3D spectral mixing space, the relative contribution of 11 Sentinel 2 MSI spectral bands to the information content of this space is quantified using both parametric (Pearson Correlation) and nonparametric (Mutual Information) metrics. Comparison of linear (principal component) and nonlinear (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) projections of the SVD mixing space reveal both physically interpretable spectral mixing continua and geographically distinct spectral properties not resolved in the linear projection.

TI  - Costs and Factors Associated with Hospitalizations Due to Severe Influenza in Catalonia (2017-2020)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to estimate the cost and factors associated with severe hospitalized patients due to influenza in unvaccinated and vaccinated cases. The study had a cross-sectional design and included three influenza seasons in 16 sentinel hospitals in Catalonia, Spain. Data were collected from a surveillance system of influenza and other acute respiratory infections. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to analyze mean costs stratified by comorbidities and pregnancy. Multivariate logistic models were used to analyze bacterial coinfection, multi-organ failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, death and ICU admission by season and by vaccination status. Costs of ICU, hospitalization and total mean costs were analyzed using GLM, by season and by vaccination status. All models were adjusted for age and sex. A total of 2742 hospitalized cases were included in the analyses. Cases were mostly aged >= 60 years (70.17%), with recommended vaccination (86.14%) and unvaccinated (68.05%). The ICU admission level was statistically significant higher in unvaccinated compared to vaccinated cases. Costs of cases with more than or equal to two comorbidities (Diff = EUR - 1881.32), diabetes (Diff = EUR - 1953.21), chronic kidney disease (Diff = EUR - 2260.88), chronic cardiovascular disease (Diff = EUR - 1964.86), chronic liver disease (Diff = EUR - 3595.60), hospitalization (EUR 9419.42 vs. EUR 9055.45), and total mean costs (EUR 11,540.04 vs. 10,221.34) were statistically significant higher in unvaccinated compared to vaccinated patients. The influenza vaccine reduces the costs of hospitalization. There is a need to focus strategies in recommended vaccination groups.

TI  - HA-Unet: A Modified Unet Based on Hybrid Attention for Urban Water Extraction in SAR Images
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban water plays a significant role in the urban ecosystem, but urban water extraction is still a challenging task in automatic interpretation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The influence of radar shadows and strong scatters in urban areas may lead to misclassification in urban water extraction. Nevertheless, the local features captured by convolutional layers in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are generally redundant and cannot make effective use of global information to guide the prediction of water pixels. To effectively emphasize the identifiable water characteristics and fully exploit the global information of SAR images, a modified Unet based on hybrid attention mechanism is proposed to improve the performance of urban water extraction in this paper. Considering the feature extraction ability and the global modeling capability in SAR image segmentation, the Channel and Spatial Attention Module (CSAM) and the Multi-head Self-Attention Block (MSAB) are both introduced into the proposed Hybrid Attention Unet (HA-Unet). In this work, Resnet50 is adopted as the backbone of HA-Unet to extract multi-level features of SAR images. During the feature extraction process, CSAM based on local attention is adopted to enhance the meaningful water features and ignore unnecessary features adaptively in feature maps of two shallow layers. In the last two layers of the backbone, MSAB is introduced to capture the global information of SAR images to generate global attention. In addition, two global attention maps generated by MSAB are aggregated together to reconstruct the spatial feature relationship of SAR images from high-resolution feature maps. The experimental results on Sentinel-1A SAR images show that the proposed urban water extraction method has a strong ability to extract water bodies in the complex urban areas. The ablation experiment and visualization results vividly indicate that both CSAM and MSAB contribute significantly to extracting urban water accurately and effectively.

TI  - E-MPSPNet: Ice-Water SAR Scene Segmentation Based on Multi-Scale Semantic Features and Edge Supervision
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Distinguishing sea ice and water is crucial for safe navigation and carrying out offshore activities in ice zones. However, due to the complexity and dynamics of the ice-water boundary, it is difficult for many deep learning-based segmentation algorithms to achieve accurate ice-water segmentation in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. In this paper, we propose an ice-water SAR segmentation network, E-MPSPNet, which can provide effective ice-water segmentation by fusing semantic features and edge information. The E-MPSPNet introduces a multi-scale attention mechanism to better fuse the ice-water semantic features and designs an edge supervision module (ESM) to learn ice-water edge features. The ESM not only provides ice-water edge prediction but also imposes constraints on the semantic feature extraction to better express the edge information. We also design a loss function that focuses on both ice-water edges and semantic segmentations of ice and water for overall network optimization. With the AI4Arctic/ASIP Sea Ice Dataset as the benchmark, experimental results show our E-MPSPNet achieves the best performance compared with other commonly used segmentation models, reaching 94.2% for accuracy, 93.0% for F-score, and 89.2% for MIoU. Moreover, our E-MPSPNet shows a relatively smaller model size and faster processing speed. The application of the E-MPSPNet for processing a SAR scene demonstrates its potential for operational use in drawing near real-time navigation charts of sea ice.

TI  - Flooded Extent and Depth Analysis Using Optical and SAR Remote Sensing with Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recurrent flooding occurs in most years along different parts of the Gulf of Mexico coastline and the central and southeastern parts of Mexico. These events cause significant economic losses in the agricultural, livestock, and infrastructure sectors, and frequently involve loss of human life. Climate change has contributed to flooding events and their more frequent occurrence, even in areas where such events were previously rare. Satellite images have become valuable information sources to identify, precisely locate, and monitor flooding events. The machine learning models use remote sensing images pixels as input feature. In this paper, we report a study involving 16 combinations of Sentinel-1 SAR images, Sentinel-2 optical images, and digital elevation model (DEM) data, which were analyzed to evaluate the performance of two widely used machine learning algorithms, gradient boosting (GB) and random forest (RF), for providing information about flooding events. With machine learning models GB and RF, the input dataset (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and DEM) was used to establish rules and classify the set in the categories specified by previous tags. Monitoring of flooding was performed by tracking the evolution of water bodies during the dry season (before the event) through to the occurrence of floods during the rainy season (during the event). For detection of bodies of water in the dry season, the metrics indicate that the best algorithm is GB with combination 15 (F1m = 0.997, AUC = 0.999, K = 0.994). In the rainy season, the GB algorithm had better metrics with combination 16 (F1m = 0.995, AUC = 0.999, Kappa = 0.994), and detected an extent of flooded areas of 1113.36 ha with depths of <1 m. The high classification performance shown by machine learning algorithms, particularly the so-called assembly algorithms, means that they should be considered capable of improving satellite image classification for detection of flooding over traditional methods, in turn leading to better monitoring of flooding at local, regional, and continental scales.

TI  - Joint Characterization of Sentinel-2 Reflectance: Insights from Manifold Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most applications of multispectral imaging are explicitly or implicitly dependent on the dimensionality and topology of the spectral mixing space. Mixing space characterization refers to the identification of salient properties of the set of pixel reflectance spectra comprising an image (or compilation of images). The underlying premise is that this set of spectra may be described as a low dimensional manifold embedded in a high dimensional vector space. Traditional mixing space characterization uses the linear dimensionality reduction offered by Principal Component Analysis to find projections of pixel spectra onto orthogonal linear subspaces, prioritized by variance. Here, we consider the potential for recent advances in nonlinear dimensionality reduction (specifically, manifold learning) to contribute additional useful information for multispectral mixing space characterization. We integrate linear and nonlinear methods through a novel approach called Joint Characterization (JC). JC is comprised of two components. First, spectral mixture analysis (SMA) linearly projects the high-dimensional reflectance vectors onto a 2D subspace comprising the primary mixing continuum of substrates, vegetation, and dark features (e.g., shadow and water). Second, manifold learning nonlinearly maps the high-dimensional reflectance vectors into a low-D embedding space while preserving manifold topology. The SMA output is physically interpretable in terms of material abundances. The manifold learning output is not generally physically interpretable, but more faithfully preserves high dimensional connectivity and clustering within the mixing space. Used together, the strengths of SMA may compensate for the limitations of manifold learning, and vice versa. Here, we illustrate JC through application to thematic compilations of 90 Sentinel-2 reflectance images selected from a diverse set of biomes and land cover categories. Specifically, we use globally standardized Substrate, Vegetation, and Dark (S, V, D) endmembers (EMs) for SMA, and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for manifold learning. The value of each (SVD and UMAP) model is illustrated, both separately and jointly. JC is shown to successfully characterize both continuous gradations (spectral mixing trends) and discrete clusters (land cover class distinctions) within the spectral mixing space of each land cover category. These features are not clearly identifiable from SVD fractions alone, and not physically interpretable from UMAP alone. Implications are discussed for the design of models which can reliably extract and explainably use high-dimensional spectral information in spatially mixed pixels-a principal challenge in optical remote sensing.

TI  - Synergistic Use of Sentinel-2 and UAV Multispectral Data to Improve and Optimize Viticulture Management
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing use of geospatial information from satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been contributing to significant growth in the availability of instruments and methodologies for data acquisition and analysis. For better management of vineyards (and most crops), it is crucial to access the spatial-temporal variability. This knowledge throughout the vegetative cycle of any crop is crucial for more efficient management, but in the specific case of viticulture, this knowledge is even more relevant. Some research studies have been carried out in recent years, exploiting the advantage of satellite and UAV data, used individually or in combination, for crop management purposes. However, only a few studies explore the multi-temporal use of these two types of data, isolated or synergistically. This research aims to clearly identify the most suitable data and strategies to be adopted in specific stages of the vineyard phenological cycle. Sentinel-2 data from two vineyard plots, located in the Douro Demarcated Region (Portugal), are compared with UAV multispectral data under three distinct conditions: considering the whole vineyard plot; considering only the grapevine canopy; and considering inter-row areas (excluding all grapevine vegetation). The results show that data from both platforms are able to describe the vineyards' variability throughout the vegetative growth but at different levels of detail. Sentinel-2 data can be used to map vineyard soil variability, whilst the higher spatial resolution of UAV-based data allows diverse types of applications. In conclusion, it should be noted that, depending on the intended use, each type of data, individually, is capable of providing important information for vineyard management.

TI  - Simulated Signatures of Greenland Melting in the North Atlantic: A Model Comparison With Argo Floats, Satellite Observations, and Ocean Reanalysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased Greenland ice sheet melting has an impact on global mean and regional sea level rise and the ocean circulation. In this study, we explore whether Greenland melting signatures found in ocean model simulations are visible in observations from radar altimetry, satellite gravimetry and Argo floats. We have included Greenland freshwater flux (GF) in the global Finite-Element-Sea ice-Ocean Model (FESOM) for the years 1993-2016. The reference run is computed by excluding Greenland freshwater input. These experiments are performed on a low resolution (ca. 24 km) and a high resolution (ca. 6 km) eddy-permitting mesh. For comparison with the model experiments, we use different observational data, such as Argo floats, satellite observations, and reanalyses. We find that surface GF maps into signatures in temperature and salinity down to about 100 m in the surroundings of Greenland. The simulated melting signatures are particularly visible in steric heights in Baffin Bay and Davis Strait. Here, we find an improvement of the mean square error of up to 30% when including GF. For the Nordic part of the Nordic Seas, however, we find no improvement when including GF. We compare steric heights with reanalysis data and a new setup of the inversion method from gravimetric and altimetric satellite data. We cannot confirm that the GF signatures on variables such as temperature and salinity are visible in the observations on the time scales considered. However, we find that increased model resolution often causes larger improvements than occur due to including the simulated melting effect.

TI  - Econometric Approaches That Consider Farmers' Adaptation in Estimating the Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture: A Review
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - The question of whether and to what extent farmers can adapt to climate change has recently gained academic interest. This paper reviews contemporary econometric approaches that assess the impacts of climate change on agriculture and consider farmer adaptation, complementing previous methodological reviews with this distinctive adaptation perspective. The value of adaptation can be measured by comparing the differences between the long-term climate change effect and the short-term weather shock effect. However, this theoretical model has not yet been well supported by empirical evidence, as it is difficult to identify true adaptation, incorporating adaptation cost, and estimated adaptation rate. Quasi-natural experiments, cost-benefit analysis, and Bayesian models are effective tools to address these methodological drawbacks. Two methods dominate in the estimation of climate effects, but each has its own advantages. A good estimate provides a trade-off between the incorporation of farmers' adaptive behavior and the reduction in omitted variables bias. Cross-sectional data models based on climate variability can capture farmers' long-term adaptations but are prone to bias due to omitted variables. Panel data models are more effective at mitigating omitted variable bias by applying fixed effects, but do not consider farmers' adaptative behavior to long-term climate change. To address this dilemma, several cutting-edge approaches have been developed, including integration with the weather and climate model, the long differences approach, and the long- and short-term hybrid approach. We found three key challenges, namely: (1) exploring adaptation mechanisms, (2) the CO2 fertilization effect, and (3) estimating the distributional effects of climate impacts. We also recommend future empirical studies to incorporate satellite remote sensing data, examine the relationship between different adaptation measures, model farmers' future climate expectations, and include adaptation costs.

TI  - Land in Water: The Study of Land Reclamation and Artificial Islands Formation in the UAE Coastal Zone: A Remote Sensing and GIS Perspective
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The United Arab Emirate's rapid population growth is coupled with an increase in the consumption of natural resources such as fresh air, sunlight, land, and water. In the past two decades, the demand for land has augmented both away from the coast and significantly near the coast. Within coastal zones, artificial reclamation of land in the sea is the most desirable way to meet the demand for land necessary for the development of the most modern urban areas. Seaward reclamation (land in the water) necessitates the construction of artificially reclaimed areas that are extended into the sea using innovative modern construction techniques. The majority of these building requirements are necessitated by a number of key factors and have diverse outcomes. Even though this type of urban expansion is not new, the scale and motivations of land reclamation have been drastically altered due to geological and human-induced factors. The purpose of this paper is to assess the increase in seaward land expansion, particularly in the seven UAE coastal emirates. Using satellite data, particularly from 1990 to 2021, the total increase in land due to newly developed reclaimed areas in all UAE coastal emirates is calculated. Satellite images from the Landsat series are used to analyze the tremendous growth since the early 2000s. In addition, the study of shoreline maps of 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2021 for the seven emirates revealed that the 22 km long Ajman and UAQ front coast experienced a notable shoreline retreat with a net erosion area of 300 m(2) and an annual rate of 30 my(-1) over the past 21 years (2000-2021). Depending on the type of construction design used to describe the process, a methodical sorting is also recommended. The impacts of the Dubai offshore reclaimed islands on the adjacent coastlines in Ajman and Umm Al Quwain (UAQ), as well as the potential impact of earthquake tremors along the Zagros fold belt region, are the subjects of this study. In this study, all seven coastal emirates are considered, and the largest reclamation projects are located in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Ras-Al Khaimah (RAK), and Fujairah, with Dubai leading the way; it has expanded its coastal areas by more than 68 km(2) at present, and another 35 km(2) will be reclaimed soon to finish Palm Deira.

TI  - Detection of Massive Oil Spills in Sun Glint Optical Imagery through Super-Pixel Segmentation
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large volumes of crude oil accidentally released into the sea may cause irreversible adverse impacts on marine and coastal environments. Large swath optical imagery, acquired using platforms such as the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), is frequently used for massive oil spill detection, attributing to its large coverage and short global revisit, providing rich data for oil spill monitoring. The aim of this study was to develop a suitable approach for massive oil spill detection in sun glint optical imagery. Specifically, preprocessing procedures were conducted to mitigate the inhomogeneous light field over the spilled area caused by sun glint, enhance the target boundary contrast, and maintain the internal homogeneity within the target. The image was then segmented into super-pixels based on a simple linear clustering method with similar characteristics of color, brightness, and texture. The neighborhood super-pixels were merged into target objects through the region adjacency graph method based on the Euclidean distance of their colors with an adaptive termination threshold. Oil slicks from the generated bright/dark objects were discriminated through a decision tree with parameters based on spectral and spatial characteristics. The proposed approach was applied to oil spill detection in MODIS images acquired during the Montara oil spill in 2009, with an overall extraction precision of 0.8, recall of 0.838, and F1-score of 0.818. Such an approach is expected to provide timely and accurate oil spill detection for disaster emergency response and ecological impact assessment.

TI  - Accessible Remote Sensing Data Mining Based Dew Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dew has been considered a supplementary water resource as it constitutes an important water supply in many ecosystems, especially in arid and semiarid areas. Remote sensing allows large-scale surface observations, offering the possibility to estimate dew in such arid and semiarid regions. In this study, by screening and combining different remote sensing variables, we obtained a well-performing monthly scale dew yield estimation model based on the support vector machine (SVM) learning method. Using daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures (LST), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and three emissivity bands (3.929-3.989 mu m, 10.780-11.280 mu m, and 11.770-12.270 mu m) as the model inputs, the simulated site-scale monthly dew yield achieved a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.89 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.30 (mm) for the training set, and CC = 0.59 and RMSE = 0.55 (mm) for the test set. Applying the model to the Heihe River Basin (HRB), the results showed that the annual dew yield ranged from 8.83 to 20.28 mm/year, accounting for 2.12 to 66.88% of the total precipitation, with 74.81% of the area having an annual dew amount of 16 to 19 mm/year. We expanded the model application to Northwest China and obtained a dew yield of 5 similar to 30 mm/year from 2011 to 2020, indicating that dew is a non-negligible part of the water balance in this arid area. As a non-negligible part of the water cycle, the use of remote sensing to estimate dew can provide better support for future water resource assessment and analysis.

TI  - Two-Phase Stratified Random Forest for Paddy Growth Phase Classification: A Case of Imbalanced Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have had a considerable impact on Indonesia's national development policies for the period 2015 to 2030. The agricultural industry is one of the world's most important industries, and it is critical to the achievement of the SDGs. The second major aspect of the SDGs, i.e., zero hunger, addresses food security (SDG 2). To measure the status of food security, accurate statistics on paddy production must be accessible. Paddy phenological classification is a way to determine a food plant's growth phase. Imbalanced data are a common occurrence in agricultural data, and machine learning is frequently utilized as a technique for classification issues. The current trend in agriculture is to use remote sensing data to classify crops. This paper proposes a new approach-one that uses two phases in the bootstrap stage of the random forest method-called a two-phase stratified random forest (TPSRF). The simulation scenario shows that the proposed TPSRF outperforms CART, SVM, and RF. Furthermore, in its application to paddy growth phase data for 2019 in Lamongan Regency, East Java, Indonesia, the proposed TPSRF showed higher overall accuracy (OA) than the compared methods.

TI  - Quantifying a Reliable Framework to Estimate Hydro-Climatic Conditions via a Three-Way Interaction between Land Surface Temperature, Evapotranspiration, Soil Moisture
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Distributed hydrological models can be suitable choices for predicting the spatial distribution of water and energy fluxes if the conceptual relationships between the components are defined appropriately. Therefore, an innovative approach has been developed using a simultaneous formulation of bulk heat transfer theory, energy budgeting, and water balance as an integrated hydrological model, i.e., the Monthly Continuous Semi-Distributed Energy Water Balance (MCSD-EWB) model, to estimate land surface hydrological components. The connection between water and energy balances is established by evapotranspiration (ET), which is a function of soil moisture and land surface temperature (LST). Thus, the developed structure is based on a three-way coupling between ET, soil moisture, and LST. The LST is obtained via the direct solution of the energy balance equation, and the spatiotemporal distribution of ET is presented using the computed LST and soil moisture through the bulk transfer method and water balance. In addition to the LST computed using the MCSD-EWB model, the LST products of ERA5-Land and MODIS are also utilized as inputs. The results indicate the adequate performance of the model in simulating LST, ET, streamflow, and groundwater level. Furthermore, the developed model performs better by employing the ERA5-Land LST than by using the MODIS LST in estimating the components.

TI  - Assessment of land use change in riverine ecosystem and utilizing it for socioeconomic benefit
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing urbanization has led to diminished agricultural mainland for food production worldwide. Riverine sandbars could be viewed as prospective landmasses which could act as additional agricultural lands. The present study emphasizes sandbar area availability and the scope of utilizing these landmasses through geospatial techniques, modelling studies and questionnaire surveys. Satellite images were derived at decadal scales to determine the change in the land-use land cover (LULC) within the Brahmaputra River in Assam, India. The fluctuations in the landmasses under different streamflow conditions were derived using a hydrodynamic model. The results showed that the percentage of vegetated sandbars has increased from similar to 27.36% in 1976-1980 to similar to 44.67% in 2016-2017, and consecutively, the percentage of non-vegetated sandbars has decreased from similar to 51.18 to similar to 30.93%. Furthermore, it was found that the area under cropland and vegetated sandbar varied seasonally. To further understand the utilization of these resources, a socioeconomic survey with a structured set of questions was conducted at various sandbars. The survey revealed various aspects of economic benefits, practices of sandbar cultivation, beneficial produce, difficulties faced, and willingness among farmers to expand sandbar cultivation. Coupling the prevailing traditional knowledge of cultivation among the farmers with scientifically derived information obtained from satellite data and mathematical model simulations can lead to a more systematic utilization of the ecosystem. Thus, the study shows the immense potential of utilizing the sandbars of large rivers to sustain food demands, alongside developing links between land-use change, ecosystem behavior, and socio-economic development.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A 49-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain. A computed tomography scan revealed a left breast mass with suspected peritoneal dissemination. She had no notable family history of the disease. Following a detailed examination, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer(Stage ⅢC)and left breast cancer(Stage Ⅰ). After confirming the diagnosis of ovarian cancer with a laparoscopic biopsy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was scheduled. Due to its efficiency in reducing tumor burden, debulking surgery was also performed. While receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, concomitant anastrozole was administered for breast cancer. A pathogenic variant of BRCA2 was subsequently identified. Once adjuvant chemotherapy for ovarian cancer had been completed, a left mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed as management for breast cancer. The patient will continue treatment with anastrozole for breast cancer and olaparib for ovarian cancer and will be followed up appropriately.

TI  - Characterizing Live Fuel Moisture Content from Active and Passive Sensors in a Mediterranean Environment
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Live fuel moisture content (LFMC) influences many fire-related aspects, including flammability, ignition, and combustion. In addition, fire spread models are highly sensitive to LFMC values. Despite its importance, LFMC estimation is still elusive due to its dependence on plant species traits, local conditions, and weather patterns. Although LFMC mapping from active synthetic aperture radar has increased over the past years, their utility for LFMC estimation needs further analysis to include additional areas characterized by different vegetation species and fire regimes. This study extended the current knowledge using medium spatial resolution (20 m) time series acquired by active (Sentinel-1) and passive (Sentinel-2) sensors. Our results show that optical-based LFMC estimation may achieve acceptable accuracy (R-2 = 0.55, MAE = 15.1%, RMSE = 19.7%) at moderate (20 m) spatial resolution. When ancillary information (e.g., vegetation cover) was added, LFMC estimation improved (R-2 = 0.63, MAE = 13.4%). Contrary to other studies, incorporating Sentinel-1 radar data did not provide for improved LFMC estimates, while the use of SAR data alone resulted in increased estimation errors (R-2 = 0.28, MAE = 19%, RMSE = 25%). For increased fire risk scenarios (LFMC < 120%), estimation errors improved (MAE = 9.1%, RMSE = 11.8%), suggesting that direct LFMC retrieval from satellite data may be achieved with high temporal and spatial detail.

TI  - Mapping Coastal Aquaculture Ponds of China Using Sentinel SAR Images in 2020 and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture has enormous potential for ensuring global food security and has experienced rapid growth globally. Thus, the accurate monitoring and mapping of coastal aquaculture ponds is necessary for the sustainable development and efficient management of the aquaculture industry. Here, we developed a map of coastal aquaculture ponds in China using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the ArcGIS platform, Sentinel-1 SAR image data for 2020, the Sentinel-1 Dual-Polarized Water Index (SDWI), and water frequency obtained by identifying the special object features of aquaculture ponds and postprocessing interpretation. Our map had an overall accuracy of 93%, and we found that the coastal aquaculture pond area in China reached 6937 km(2) in 2020. The aquaculture pond area was highest in Shandong, Guangdong, and Jiangsu Provinces, and at the city level, Dongying, Binzhou, Tangshan, and Dalian had the most aquaculture pond area. Aquaculture ponds had spatial heterogeneity; the aquaculture pond area in north China was larger than in south China and seaside areas had more pond area than inland regions. In addition, aquaculture ponds were concentrated near river estuaries, coastal plains, and gulfs, and were most dense in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain and Pearl River Delta. We showed that GEE cloud processing and ArcGIS local processing could facilitate the classification of coastal aquaculture ponds, which can be used to inform and improve decision-making for the spatial optimization and intelligent monitoring of coastal aquaculture, with certain potential for spatial migration.

TI  - Mapping urban-rural differences in the worldwide achievement of sustainable development goals: land-energy-air nexus
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use efficiency (LUE), energy efficiency (EE), and air quality are key indicators when assessing urban-related Sustainable Development Goals, yet recent trends and trade-offs in and around urban areas worldwide remain largely unknown. We use an Earth Observation approach to map the land-energy-air sustainability nexus and highlight distinct urban-rural gradients worldwide (2000-2015). In the Global South, urban areas perform relatively better in land-energy-air sustainability trends than rural areas, which are the least sustainable in our global comparative analysis. Comparatively, urban areas in the Global North tend to be less sustainable than surrounding rural regions. Trade-offs among land-energy-air change directions are mostly related to EE versus air quality in urban areas, while spatial and temporal trade-offs between LUE and EE are more pronounced in suburban and rural areas. Integrating satellite data is crucial for tracking the progress of the land-energy-air nexus and can guide context-specific strategies to account for urban-rural differences in achieving sustainability and creating more livable environments.

TI  - A Comparison of Machine Learning and Geostatistical Approaches for Mapping Forest Canopy Height over the Southeastern US Using ICESat-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of canopy height information in the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2's (ICESat-2's) land and vegetation product, or ATL08, presents opportunities for developing full-coverage products over broad spatial scales. The primary goal of this study was to develop a 30-meter canopy height map over the southeastern US, for the Southeastern Plains ecoregion and the Middle Atlantic Coastal Plains ecoregion. More specifically, this work served to compare well-known modeling approaches for upscaling canopy information from ATL08 to develop a wall-to-wall product. Focusing on only strong beams from nighttime acquisitions, the h_canopy parameter was extracted from ATL08 data. Landsat-8 bands and derived vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, and modified soil-adjusted vegetation index) along with National Land Cover Database's canopy cover and digital elevation models were used to extrapolate ICESat-2 canopy height from tracks to the regional level. Two different modeling techniques, random forest (RF) and regression kriging (RK), were applied for estimating canopy height. The RF model estimated canopy height with a coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.48, root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 4.58 m, mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.47 and bias of 0.23 for independent validation, and an R-2 value of 0.38, RMSE of 6.39 m, MAE of 5.04 and bias of -1.39 when compared with airborne lidar-derived canopy heights. The RK model estimated canopy heights with an R-2 value of 0.69, RMSE of 3.49 m, MAE of 2.61 and bias of 0.03 for independent validation, and an R value of 0.68, R-2 value of 0.47, RMSE of 5.96m, MAE of 4.52 and bias of -1.81 when compared with airborne lidar-derived canopy heights. The results suggest feasibility for the implementation of the RK method over a larger spatial extent and potential for combining other remote sensing and satellite data for future monitoring of canopy height dynamics.

TI  - Correlation Analysis of Evapotranspiration, Emissivity Contrast and Water Deficit Indices: A Case Study in Four Eddy Covariance Sites in Italy with Different Environmental Habitats
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) represents one of the essential processes controlling the exchange of energy by terrestrial vegetation, providing a strong connection between energy and water fluxes. Different methodologies have been developed in order to measure it at different spatial scales, ranging from individual plants to an entire watershed. In the last few years, several methods and approaches based on remotely sensed data have been developed over different ecosystems for the estimation of ET. In the present work, we outline the correlation between ET measured at four eddy covariance (EC) sites in Italy (situated either in forest or in grassland ecosystems) and (1) the emissivity contrast index (ECI) based on emissivity data from thermal infrared spectral channels of the MODIS and ASTER satellite sensors (CAMEL data-set); (2) the water deficit index (WDI), defined as the difference between the surface and dew point temperature modeled by the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) data. The analysis covers a time-series of 1 to 7 years depending on the site. The results showed that both the ECI and WDI correlate to the ET calculated through EC. In the relationship WDI-ET, the coefficient of determination ranges, depending on the study area, between 0.5 and 0.9, whereas it ranges between 0.5 and 0.7 when ET was correlated to the ECI. The slope and the sign of the latter relationship is influenced by the vegetation habitat, the snow cover (particularly in winter months) and the environmental heterogeneity of the area (calculated in this study through the concept of the spectral variation hypothesis using Rao's Q heterogeneity index).

TI  - The Role of Surgical Drainage on Complications after Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Melanoma
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The real benefit of using drains for reducing the risk of complications in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has not been investigated yet. We aimed to evaluate the role of drain after SLNB and to determine if a correlation exists between drains and early complications.Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients who underwent SLNB for melanoma from 2016 to 2021. Patients were dichotomized into two groups according to the use of drain. The between-group comparison (drainage group versus no drainage group) was performed by using Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test. A regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors of complications.Results: Of 218 individuals analyzed, 18 (8.4%) had postoperative complications. The most common complications were seroma (5.1%) and wound dehiscence (1.4%). The between-group analysis showed no significant differences in complication rate, whereas the operative time was significantly higher in the drainage group (P = 0.007), as well as the hospital stay (P <= 0.0001) and the duration of postoperative antibiotic therapy (P = 0.02). The regression analysis found body mass index and multiple basins of SLNB (axilla with groin) to be significant predictors of having a complication (P = 0.03 and P = 0.05, respectively). The operative time was found to be a predictor of seroma (P = 0.04).Conclusions: Drainage use in SLNB prolonged hospital stays and duration of postoperative antibiotic therapy, thus resulting in higher costs. The preemptive use of drainage is suggested in selected settings of patients.

TI  - Surface Water Mapping and Flood Monitoring in the Mekong Delta Using Sentinel-1 SAR Time Series and Otsu Threshold
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The annual flood and the alteration in hydrological regimes are the most vital concerns in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). Although synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 imagery is widely used for water management, only a few studies have used Sentinel-1 data for mapping surface water and monitoring flood events in the VMD. This study developed an algorithm to implement (i) automatic Otsu threshold on a series of Sentinel-1 images to extract surface water and (ii) time series analyses on the derived surface water maps to detect flood water extent in near-real-time (NRT). Specifically, only cross-polarized VH was selected after an assessment of different Sentinel-1 polarizations. The dynamic Otsu thresholding algorithm was applied to identify an optimal threshold for each pre-processed Sentinel-1 VH image to separate water from non-water pixels for producing a time series of surface water maps. The derived Sentinel-1 surface water maps were visually compared with the Sentinel-2 Full Resolution Browse (FRB) and statistically examined with the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) surface water maps, which were generated by applying the Otsu threshold on the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) images. The visual comparison showed a strong correspondence between the Sentinel-1 surface water maps and Sentinel-2 FRB images in three periods, including rice's sowing season, flood period, and rice's maturation stage. A good statistical agreement suggested that the performance of the dynamic Otsu thresholding algorithm on Sentinel-1 image time series to map surface water is effective in river areas (R-2 = 0.97 and RMSE = 1.18%), while it is somewhat lower in paddy field areas (R-2 = 0.88 and RMSE = 3.88%). Afterward, a flood mapping algorithm in NRT was developed by applying the change-detection-based time series analyses on the derived Sentinel-1 surface water maps. Every single pixel at the time t is respectively referred to its state in the water/non-water and flooded/non-flooded maps at the previous time t - 1 to be classified into a flooded or non-flooded pixel. The flood mapping algorithm enables updates at each time step to generate temporal flood maps in NRT for monitoring flood water extent in large-scale areas. This study provides a tool to rapidly generate surface water and flood maps to support water management and risk reduction in the VMD. The future improvement of the current algorithm is discussed.

TI  - Changes in surface water dynamics across northwestern Canada are influenced by wildfire and permafrost thaw
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The abundance and distribution of surface water at high latitudes is shifting rapidly in response to both climate change and permafrost thaw. In particular, the expansion and drainage of lakes and ponds is widespread but spatially variable, and more research is needed to understand factors driving these processes. In this study we used medium resolution (30 m) remote sensing data to analyse changes in lake area in permafrost-rich lowland regions across northwestern Canada. First, we used the Global Surface Water Dataset developed by the GLAD research group to map the absolute area of different land-water transitions across a 1.4 million km(2) study domain. Next, we selected six regional study areas representing a range of climatic, geologic and hydrologic conditions. Within these regional study areas, we used the Landsat satellite archive to map annual trends in the area of 27 755 lakes between 1985 and 2020. We trained a random forests model to classify lakes exhibiting significant increasing or decreasing trends in area, and assessed the relative importance of climate, disturbance and environmental variables in determining the direction of change. Our analysis shows that significant increases in lake area were 5.6 times more frequent than decreases during the study period. Wildfire and ground ice abundance were the most important predictors of the direction of change. Greater ground ice content was associated with regions that experienced increases in lake area, while wildfire was associated with regions that experienced decreases in lake area. The effects of climate, including trends in mean annual temperature and total annual precipitation were smaller than disturbance and environmental factors, indicating that climate has likely had indirect effects on lake area changes over our period of study.

TI  - Status of the Sentinel Lymph Node in Patients with Endometrial Cancer Stage I-II
T2  - CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecological cancer in developed countries. In literature, there are discordant data regarding the therapeutic value of systematic lymphadenectomy whereas the importance of lymph node status for determining prognosis and the need for adjuvant treatment is undoubted. Given the low risk of lymph node metastases in stage I-II of EC and the significant surgical and postoperative risks when performing a complete pelvic lymphadenectomy, the surgical approach in these patients is controversial, ranging from no nodal evaluation to comprehensive pelvic and aortic lymphadenectomy. The recent introduction of sentinel node detection represents the mid-way between the execution and omission of node dissection in EC patients. Indeed, the sentinel node mapping has rapidly emerged as an alternative to complete lymphadenectomy to reduce morbidity. In the present research, we discuss the role of sentinel node mapping in the surgical management of EC in early stage. Results of study on SLN in EC in early stages seem to be promising, but only a small series have been published so far.

TI  - Interoperability of <i>C</i>-Band Sentinel-1 SAR and GRACE Satellite Sensors on PSInSAR-Based Urban Surface Subsidence Mapping of Varanasi, India
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1 is an active synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite with a C- band SAR sensor operating at a center frequency of 5.405 GHz and a wavelength of 5.55 cm. With the availability of freely available SAR datasets from Sentinel-1, the persistent scatterer SAR interferometry (PSInSAR)-based urban surface subsidence mapping has become easy. However, apart from geological causes, the major cause of urban surface subsidence is the overexploitation of groundwater that results in piezometric pressure loss in the aquifers resulting in net subsidence. With the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite sensor, the groundwater level fluctuations can be very easily studied temporally. But the coarse spatial resolution of GRACE data makes the study of groundwater fluctuations difficult to study for smaller watersheds. This study aims to correlate the PSInSAR average surface line of sight (LOS) displacement from Sentinel-1, with the average groundwater fluctuations from the GRACE sensor temporally from May 2017 to February 2022. The study also compared the correlation between PSInSAR displacement in both VV and VH polarizations and observed the R-2 values to be 0.63 and 0.65 for VV and VH polarizations, respectively, with GRACE data. After that, using the displacement and groundwater level fluctuation data, an estimation of a gravimetric anomaly due to a decrease in groundwater level was carried out for Varanasi city. The R-2, mean absolute error ( MAE), and root- meansquare error (RMSE) were observed to be 0.84, 1.23, and 2.4, respectively, in gravimetric anomaly estimation, thus giving sufficient acceptance for interoperability of the two sensors.

TI  - Are Climate-Dependent Impacts of Soil Constraints on Crop Growth Evident in Remote-Sensing Data?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil constraints limit plant growth and grain yield in Australia's grain-cropping regions, with the nature of the impact dependent on climate. In seasons with low in-crop (short for "during the crop growing season") rainfall, soil constraints can reduce yield by limiting soil water infiltration, storage, and crop water uptake. Conversely, soil constraints can exacerbate waterlogging in seasons with high in-crop rainfall. When average in-crop rainfall is experienced, soil constraints may only have a limited impact on yields. To investigate the relationship between climate and the impact of soil constraints on crop growth, long-term time series yield information is crucial but often not available. Vegetation indices calculated from remote-sensing imagery provide a useful proxy for yield data and offer the advantages of consistent spatial coverage and long history, which are vital for assessing patterns of spatial variation that repeat over many years. This study aimed to use an index of crop growth based on the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to assess whether and how the within-field spatial variation of crop growth differed between years with different climates (dry, moderate, and wet years, as classified based on in-crop rainfall). Five fields from the grain-growing region of eastern Australia were selected and used to assess the consistency of the spatial variation of the index for years in the same in-crop rainfall category. For four of the five fields, no evidence of patterns of climate-dependent spatial variation was found, while for the other field, there was marginal evidence of spatial variation attributable to wet years. The correlation between measured data on soil sodicity (a soil constraint that might be expected to impact crop growth most in wetter years) and average EVI was investigated for this field. The results showed a stronger negative correlation between average EVI and sodicity in wet years than in dry years, suggesting that sodicity-through its impacts on soil structure and water movement-might be a driver of the spatial variation of crop growth in wet years for this field. Our results suggest that although there may be cases when climate-dependent within-field spatial variation of crop growth is detectable through remote-sensing data (through the multi-year consistency of the within-field variation), we should not expect this to be evident for fields as a matter of course.

TI  - From a Lose-Lose to a Win-Win Situation: User-Friendly Biomass Models for <i>Acacia longifolia</i> to Aid Research, Management and Valorisation
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Woody invasive species pose a big threat to ecosystems worldwide. Among them, Acacia longifolia is especially aggressive, fundamentally changing ecosystem structure through massive biomass input. This biomass is rarely harvested for usage; thus, these plants constitute a nuisance for stakeholders who invest time and money for control without monetary return. Simultaneously, there is an increased effort to valorise its biomass, e.g., for compost, growth substrate or as biofuel. However, to incentivise A. longifolia harvest and usage, stakeholders need to be able to estimate what can be obtained from management actions. Thus, the total biomass and its quality (C/N ratio) need to be predicted to perform cost-benefit analyses for usage and determine the level of invasion that has already occurred. Here, we report allometric biomass models for major biomass pools, as well as give an overview of biomass quality. Subsequently, we derive a simplified volume-based model (BM similar to 6.297 + 0.982 x Vol; BM = total dry biomass and Vol = plant volume), which can be applied to remote sensing data or with in situ manual measurements. This toolkit will help local stakeholders, forest managers or municipalities to predict the impact and valorisation potential of this invasive species and could ultimately encourage its management.

TI  - Application and Evaluation of a Simple Crop Modelling Framework: A Case Study for Spring Barley, Winter Wheat and Winter Oilseed Rape over Ireland
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, croplands represent a significant contributor to climate change, through both greenhouse gas emissions and land use changes associated with cropland expansion. They also represent locations with significant potential to contribute to mitigating climate change through alternative land use management practices that lead to increased soil carbon sequestration. In spite of their global importance, there is a relative paucity of tools available to support field- or farm-level crop land decision making that could inform more effective climate mitigation practices. In recognition of this shortcoming, the Simple Algorithm for Yield Estimate (SAFY) model was developed to estimate crop growth, biomass, and yield at a range of scales from field to region. While the original SAFY model was developed and evaluated for winter wheat in Morocco, a key advantage to utilizing SAFY is that it presents a modular architecture which can be readily adapted. This has led to numerous modifications and alterations of specific modules which enable the model to be refined for new crops and locations. Here, we adapted the SAFY model for use with spring barley, winter wheat and winter oilseed rape at selected sites in Ireland. These crops were chosen as they represent the dominant crop types grown in Ireland. We modified the soil-water balance and carbon modules in SAFY to simulate components of water and carbon budgets in addition to crop growth and production. Results from the modified model were evaluated against available in situ data collected from previous studies. Spring barley biomass was estimated with high accuracy (R-2 = 0.97, RMSE = 95.8 g center dot m(-2), RRMSE = 11.7%) in comparison to GAI (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 0.44 m(2)center dot m(-2), RRMSE = 10.6%), across the three years for which the in situ data was available (2011-2013). The winter wheat module was evaluated against measured biomass and yield data obtained for the period 2013-2015 and from three sites located across Ireland. While the model was found to be capable of simulating winter wheat biomass (R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 1.81 t center dot ha(-1), RRMSE = 8.0%), the model was found to be less capable of reproducing the associated yields (R-2 = 0.09, RMSE = 2.3 t center dot ha(-1), RRMSE = 18.6%). In spite of the low R-2 obtained for yield, the simulated crop growth stage 61 (GS61) closely matched those observed in field data. Finally, winter oilseed rape (WOSR) was evaluated against a single growing season for which in situ data was available. WOSR biomass was also simulated with high accuracy (R-2 = 0.99 and RMSE = 0.52 t center dot ha(-1)) in comparison to GAI (R-2 = 0.3 and RMSE = 0.98 m(2)center dot m(-2)). In terms of the carbon fluxes, the model was found to be capable of estimating heterotrophic respiration (R-2 = 0.52 and RMSE = 0.28 g center dot C center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1)), but less so the ecosystem respiration (R-2 = 0.18 and RMSE = 1.01 g center dot C center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1)). Overall, the results indicate that the modified model can simulate GAI and biomass, for the chosen crops for which data were available, and yield, for winter wheat. However, the simulations of the carbon budgets and water budgets need to be further evaluated-a key limitation here was the lack of available in situ data.Another challenge is how to address the issue of parameter specification; in spite of the fact that the model has only six variable crop-related parameters, these need to be calibrated prior to application (e.g., date of emergence, effective light use efficiency etc.). While existing published values can be readily employed in the model, the availability of regionally derived values would likely lead to model improvements. This limitation could be overcome through the integration of available remote sensing data using a data assimilation procedure within the model to update the initial parameter values and adjust model estimates during the simulation.

TI  - Lineament Extraction from Digital Terrain Derivate Model: A Case Study in the Giron-Santa Isabel Basin, South Ecuador
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geological lineaments are linear or curvilinear surfaces that are considered a superficial expression of discontinuities on the earth's surface. The extraction of lineaments from remotely sensed satellite data is one of the most frequently used applications of remote sensing in geology. This study focuses on the semi-automatic extraction of lineaments in the Giron-Santa Isabel basin using a Topographic Position Index (TPI). The lineaments were extracted in the PCI Geomatics 2016 software and analyzed in the ArcGIS and Rockworks software. Statistical and density map analyses of the lineaments were performed; then, these results were interpreted to obtain the geological lineaments. Finally, a bibliographic verification was carried out, and structures such as faults and folds were defined. The total number of geological lineaments was 76, and 71 of them were defined as faults, the longest with a length of 33 km. It was determined that the preferential orientation of the lineaments is NE-SW, which is consistent with the axis of the Giron-Santa Isabel basin. This methodology can be useful to optimize time and reduce costs when gathering the structural information of the study area in the first stage of geological and mining prospecting or the educational field.

TI  - Reciprocity of grassland conservation and pastoralist livelihoods: Evidence from comparison between developed and developing regions
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands provide important livestock products such as beef and milk, the main source of daily nutrients for human beings. However, ecological degradation has occurred in nearly 50% of global grasslands, which seriously restricts livestock product supply and impairs human well-beings. Sustainable management measures are explored both in developed and developing regions to curb grassland degradation trend and achieve economic -ecological coordination. We focused on the differences of grassland management measures and their economic -ecological effects between developed regions (US, New Zealand and Western Europe) and developing regions (Inner Mongolia, China) along the "global gold pastures" in middle-latitude zone, by analyzing human-induced grassland productivity changes based on satellite remote sensing, and livestock carrying pressure based on forage-livestock relationship. The results showed the human-induced GPP on grasslands were higher in those developed regions than Inner Mongolia, while the livestock carrying pressures of grasslands were lower, which indicated that the ecological effect of grassland management measures was more positive in the developed re-gions. Although strict grassland-livestock balance policies had effectively altered the degradation trends in Inner Mongolia grassland, the economic growth still strongly relies on increasing livestock quantity within the grazing limitation, while those developed regions increased the economic benefits and also reduce the ecological pres-sure caused by livestock grazing in the meantime. Artificial pastures construction together with improved pro-duction efficiency effectively mitigated the ecological pressure on grasslands and also brought more economic benefits in those developed regions, which could also enlighten other developing regions to promoting sus-tainable utilization of grasslands and development of animal husbandry.

TI  - Impact Assessment of the M<sub>s</sub>7.0 Earthquake on Jiuzhaigou Valley from the Perspective of Vegetation Net Primary Productivity
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to assess the impact of the M(s)7.0 Jiuzhaigou earthquake that occurred on 8 August 2017 on vegetation, the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model was adopted to estimate the vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) of Jiuzhaigou Valley, one of the World Heritage Sites, in July, August and September from 2015 to 2019. Then the characteristics of the impact of different earthquake-induced geohazards on vegetation were discussed, and a vulnerability-resilience assessment system concerning the seismic intensity was proposed. The results show that the NPPmax and NPPmean values in Jiuzhaigou Valley first decreased and then increased and were 151.5-261.9 gC/m(2) and 54.6-116.3 gC/m(2), respectively. The NPP value of more than 70% area was 90-150 gC/m(2) in July. In August, the NPPmean values decreased, and the areas with lower values became larger; the NPPmean values of most areas affected by geohazards were 60-150 gC/m(2). During the earthquake, the NPPmean values of areas hit by geohazards sharply declined by 27.2% (landslide), 22.4% (debris flow) and 15.7% (collapse) compared with those in the same month in 2016. Vegetation in debris flow zones showed a stronger recovery, with a maximum NPP value increase of about 23.0% in September 2017. The vegetation gradually recovered after the earthquake, as indicated by the uptrend of the NPP values in the corresponding period in 2018 and 2019. In general, the reduction magnitude of NPP values decreased year by year in comparison to that in 2015 and 2016, and the decrease slowed down after the earthquake. The vulnerability and resilience index corresponding to the three seismic intensity ranges were 0.470-0.669 and 0.642-0.693, respectively, and those of Jiuzhaigou Valley were 0.473 and 0.671, respectively. The impact coefficient defined to represent the impact of the earthquake on NPP was 0.146-0.213. This paper provides a theoretical reference and guidance for the impact assessment of earthquakes on the ecosystem.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Aboveground Biomass and Its Influencing Factors in Xinjiang's Desert Grasslands
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland biomass is a significant parameter for measuring grassland productivity and the ability to sequester carbon. Estimating desert grassland biomass using the best remote sensing inversion model is essential for understanding grassland carbon stocks in arid and semi-arid regions. The present study constructed an optimal inversion model of desert grassland biomass based on actual biomass measurement data and various remote-sensing product data. This model was used to analyze the spatiotemporal variation in desert grassland biomass and climate factor correlation in Xinjiang from 2000 to 2019. The results showed that (1) among the established inversion models of desert grasslands aboveground biomass (AGB), the exponential function model with the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) as the independent variable was the best. Furthermore, (2) the NDVI of desert grasslands in Xinjiang showed a highly significant increasing trend from 2000 to 2019 with a spatially concentrated distribution in the north and a more dispersed distribution in the south. In addition, (3) the average AGB value was 52.35 g center dot m(-2) in Xinjiang from 2000 to 2019 and showed a spatial distribution with low values in the southeast and high values in the northwest. Moreover, (4) the low fluctuation in the coefficient of desert grassland variation accounted for 65.26% of overall AGB fluctuation (<0.10) from 2000 to 2019. Desert grassland AGB in most areas (88.65%) showed a significant increase over the last 20 years. Lastly, (5) the correlation between desert grassland precipitation and AGB was stronger than that between temperature and AGB from 2000 to 2019. This study provides a scientific basis and technical support for grassland livestock management and carbon storage assessments in Xinjiang.

TI  - Distributed Scatterer Processing Based on Binary Partition Trees with Multi-Baseline PolInSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Distributed scatterers (DSs) are necessary to increase point density in multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) monitoring. The identification of homogeneous pixels (HPs) is the first and key step for DS processing to overcome the low signal-to-noise ratio condition. Since multi-polarization data are good at describing geometrical structures and dielectric properties of ground objects, they have been applied for HP identification. However, polarimetric information is not enough for identifying areas with similar ground objects but different deformation. We propose a novel DS preprocessing algorithm based on polarimetric interferometric homogeneous pixel (PIHP) identification. Firstly, a novel Polarimetric InSAR (PolInSAR) similarity that combines polarimetric intensity, interferometric coherence, and phase is proposed, which is readily available in multi-baseline and multi-polarization data and flexible by controlling weighting factors. Secondly, based on the binary partition tree (BPT) framework, object-orientated multi-scale PIHP identification is achieved, which is suitable for complex deformation scenes. Tested with simulated quad-polarization data, our method shows improvement in phase quality and point density, especially in the deformed areas, compared with the traditional HP identification method based on the polarimetric homogeneity (PolHom) test and the method with ground object type map. Tested with 30 quad-polarization Radarsat-2 images over Kilauea Volcano, the point density of our method is three times higher than that of the PolHom test in vegetation areas. Our method is proven to be more sensitive and mechanically more advanced to homogeneous pixels identification than the traditional ones, which is helpful for phase optimization, spatial enlargement of monitoring points, and stability of the MT-InSAR algorithm.

This study proposes a general parsimonious methodology to obtain the frequency of snowfall in mountainous areas. The methodology employed is easily transferable to any other mountain region. Utilizing daily MODIS observations from June 2000 to May 2020 and the snowfall event detection algorithm, we monitored the frequency of snowfall in a long time series in the Kaidu river basin. The results are as follows: (1) The method for detecting the frequency of snowfall has high accuracy. The annual detected results agreed with surface observations, with an R-2 of 0.65 and RMSE of 3.39. (2) The frequency of snowfall events increased monotonically with elevation. The influence of slope angle on snowfall gradually decreased with increasing elevation. (3) The frequency of snowfall events in the Kaidu river basin was dominated by an increasing trend. The trends showed a pronounced topographic dependence. This study reveals the distribution characteristics and changing snowfall trends in mountain regions. The results provide a reference for snowfall research in mountainous areas.

TI  - The Dawn-Dusk Asymmetrical Distribution of Earthward Poynting Flux in the Dayside Polar Cap From DMSP
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the dawn-dusk asymmetrical distribution of quasi-dc earthward Poynting flux (EPF) in the dayside polar cap of the Northern Hemisphere based on 3 years of observations at similar to 850 km made by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F17. The satellite data have been sorted by low (Kp <= 2) and high (Kp > 2) geomagnetic activity, as well as the orientation and strength of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) By and Bz components, binned by magnetic latitude, and magnetic local time. Statistical results show that the enhanced convection electric field favors the asymmetrical EPF distribution. Asymmetrical distribution characteristics are summarized as (a) there are mainly two enhanced EPF regions, near dawn and cusp and the mean EPF is 28% larger on the dawn than on the dusk for all IMF and Kp conditions. (b) The mean EPF for high Kp is 3 times greater than that for low Kp in the dayside polar cap. The enhanced EPF shifted from near the dawn for low Kp to near the cusp for high Kp. The EPF is also larger on the dawn than on the dusk for high Kp. (c) The EPF of the dayside polar cap is significantly enhanced as the IMF strength increases. Under IMF By+, EPF is greater on the dawn than on the dusk. The opposite is true under IMF By-. The IMF Bz- favors enhanced EPF and the EPF on the dawn (dusk) reaches its maximum for IMF By+ and Bz- (IMF By- and Bz-).

TI  - Automatic-Detection Method for Mining Subsidence Basins Based on InSAR and CNN-AFSA-SVM
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining subsidence disasters are common geological disasters. Accurate and effective identification of their deformation position is significant in preventing and controlling geological disasters and monitoring illegal mining. In this study, deep learning, combined with a support vector machine (SVM), has been used to establish an automatic-detection method for mining subsidence basins using Sentinel-1A data. The Huainan mining area was selected as the experimental area to verify the method. The interferogram was obtained using differential radar interferometry (D-InSAR) to process the Sentinel-1A radar data of seven landscapes, and the mining subsidence basin and other targets were extracted manually as training samples. Subsequently, AlexNet, VGG19, and ResNet50 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used to extract feature vectors of mining subsidence basins for the SVM classifier, and mining subsidence basins were detected in a large-area InSAR interferogram. Non-maximum suppression was used to remove the repeated search box to improve the detection accuracy of mining subsidence basins; the artificial fish swarm algorithm with strong optimization ability and good global convergence is introduced into SVM parameter optimization to construct an improved ResNet50_SVM model. The experimental results show that: (1) the three CNN_SVM methods can accurately detect dry-mining subsidence basins automatically in large regional interference maps, providing an essential scientific basis for the government to monitor illegal mining activities and prevent and control geological disasters in mining areas; (2) the accuracy of the CNN_SVM automatic-detection methods for mining subsidence basins is approximately 80%, and that of ResNet50_SVM for mining subsidence basin detection is 83.7%, superior to that of AlexNet_SVM and VGG19_SVM; (3) the accuracy of the improved ResNet50_SVM based on AFSA algorithm is 88.3%, which is better than the unimproved Resnet50_SVM model.

TI  - Response of Vegetation to Different Climate Extremes on a Monthly Scale in Guangdong, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate extremes, particularly drought, often affect the ecosystem. Guangdong Province is one of the most vulnerable areas in China. Using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to capture vegetation dynamics, this study investigated vegetation responses to drought, temperature, and precipitation extremes on a monthly scale in the vegetation area of Guangdong without vegetation type changes from 1982 to 2015. As extreme temperatures rose, a drought trend occurred in most months, with a higher rate in February and April. The vegetation evenly showed a significant greening trend in all months except June and October. The vegetation activity was significantly positively correlated with the increased extreme temperatures in most months. However, it exerted a negative correlation with drought in February, April, May, June, and September, as well as precipitation extremes in February, April, and June. The response of vegetation to drought was the most sensitive in June. The vegetation tended to be more sensitive to short-term droughts (1-2 months) and had no time lag in response to drought. The results are helpful to provide references for ecological management and ecosystem protection.

TI  - Hardware Acceleration and Implementation of YOLOX-s for On-Orbit FPGA
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of remote sensing technology has brought about a sharp increase in the amount of remote sensing image data. However, due to the satellite's limited hardware resources, space, and power consumption constraints, it is difficult to process massive remote sensing images efficiently and robustly using the traditional remote sensing image processing methods. Additionally, the task of satellite-to-ground target detection has higher requirements for speed and accuracy under the conditions of more and more remote sensing data. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an extremely efficient and reliable acceleration architecture for forward inference of the YOLOX-s detection network an on-orbit FPGA. Considering the limited onboard resources, the design strategy of the parallel loop unrolling of the input channels and output channels is adopted to build the largest DSP computing array to ensure a reliable and full utilization of the limited computing resources, thus reducing the inference delay of the entire network. Meanwhile, a three-path cache queue and a small-scale cascaded pooling array are designed, which maximize the reuse of on-chip cache data, effectively reduce the bandwidth bottleneck of the external memory, and ensure an efficient computing of the entire computing array. The experimental results show that at the 200 MHz operating frequency of the VC709, the overall inference performance of the FPGA acceleration can reach 399.62 GOPS, the peak performance can reach 408.4 GOPS, and the overall computing efficiency of the DSP array can reach 97.56%. Compared with the previous work, our architecture design further improves the computing efficiency under limited hardware resources.

TI  - Monitoring Wetland Landscape Evolution Using Landsat Time-Series Data: A Case Study of the Nantong Coast, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands not only have rich biodiversity and high productivity but also provide important ecological services. The monitoring of landscape changes can provide important support for the sustainable development of coastal zones. Landsat images from 1986 to 2017 were used to interpret the types of coastal wetlands in Nantong. A single dynamic degree and multiple landscape indices were calculated to analyze the rate of change and characteristics of each wetland type. The results demonstrate the following: (1) A Nantong wetland type system was established, which was divided into three major categories and eleven subcategories. (2) In general, natural wetlands, such as thatched and Suaeda salsa marshes, were extremely reduced, while artificial wetlands and non-wetlands with high human activity, such as breeding ponds, farmland, and construction land, increased significantly. (3) In the past 30 years, due to the influence of environmental pressures, such as population growth, land demand, and economic development, the major influencing factors of local landscape change have shifted from natural geographical factors to human activities and economic as well as social factors. Remote sensing wetland interpretation can be very helpful in monitoring the dynamic changes in coastal wetlands and can provide scientific support for the sustainable management of coastal zones.

TI  - Validation and Analysis of MAIAC AOD Aerosol Products in East Asia from 2011 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - East Asia is one of the most important sources of aerosols in the world. The distribution of aerosols varies across time and space. Accurate aerosol data is crucial to identify its spatiotemporal dynamics; thus, it is of great significance to obtain and verify new aerosol data for this region. Based on the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) program for 17 stations from 2011 to 2020, this study comprehensively verified the accuracy and applicability of the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD 1 km products among different seasons, elevations, and climate zones over entire East Asia. The results showed that: (1) The overall accuracy of MAIAC AOD was high in East Asia, and the accuracy of Terra was slightly better than that of Aqua. MAIAC AOD showed significant heterogeneity among sites. MAIAC AOD performed well in areas with high vegetation cover and flat terrain, while the inversion accuracy was relatively low in areas with low vegetation cover and high terrain. (2) In general, MAIAC AOD and AERONET AOD showed good agreement in different seasons, presenting as winter > spring > autumn > summer. Yet the accuracy and consistency of Terra AOD product were better than Aqua product. (3) MAIAC AOD showed different accuracy at different elevations and climate zones. It had a high correlation and best inversion accuracy with AERONET AOD at low and medium elevations. MAIAC AOD had better inversion accuracy in the arid and warm temperate zones than that in the equatorial and cold temperate zones. (4) AOD distribution and its trend showed significant spatial differences in East Asia. The high AOD values were dominant in the Sichuan basin and the eastern plains of China, as well as in India and Bangladesh, while the relatively low AOD values were distributed in southwestern China and the areas north of 40 degrees N. AOD in most parts of East Asia showed a negative trend, indicating a great improvement in air quality in these regions.

TI  - The Extraction Method of Alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i> L.) Mapping Using Different Remote Sensing Data Sources Based on Vegetation Growth Properties
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is one of the most widely planted forages due to its useful characteristics. Although alfalfa spatial distribution is an important source of basic data, manual surveys incur high survey costs, require large workloads and confront difficulties in collecting data over large areas; remote sensing compensates for these shortcomings. In this study, the time-series variation characteristics of different vegetation types were analyzed, and the extraction method of alfalfa mapping was established according to different spatial- and temporal-resolution remote sensing data. The results provided the following conclusions: (1) when using the wave peak and valley number of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) curves, in the study area, the number of wave peak needed to be greater than 2 and the number of wave valley needed to be greater than 1; (2) 91.6% of alfalfa sampling points were extracted by moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data using the wave peak and valley method, and 5.0% of oats sampling points were extracted as alfalfa, while no other vegetation types met these conditions; (3) 85.3% of alfalfa sampling points were identified from Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) data using the wave peak and valley method; 6.0% of grassland vegetation and 8.7% of oats satisfied the conditions, while other vegetation types did not satisfy this rule; and (4) the temporal phase selection was very important for alfalfa extraction using single-time phase remote sensing images; alfalfa was easily separated from other vegetation at the pre-wintering stage and was more difficult to separate at the spring regreening stage due to the variability in the alfalfa overwintering rate; the overall classification accuracy was 92.9% with the supervised classification method using support vector machine (SVM) at the pre-wintering stage. These findings provide a promising approach to alfalfa mapping using different remote sensing data.

TI  - Unlocking Large-Scale Crop Field Delineation in Smallholder Farming Systems with Transfer Learning and Weak Supervision
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop field boundaries aid in mapping crop types, predicting yields, and delivering field-scale analytics to farmers. Recent years have seen the successful application of deep learning to delineating field boundaries in industrial agricultural systems, but field boundary datasets remain missing in smallholder systems due to (1) small fields that require high resolution satellite imagery to delineate and (2) a lack of ground labels for model training and validation. In this work, we use newly-accessible high-resolution satellite imagery and combine transfer learning with weak supervision to address these challenges in India. Our best model uses 1.5 m resolution Airbus SPOT imagery as input, pre-trains a state-of-the-art neural network on France field boundaries, and fine-tunes on India labels to achieve a median Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.85 in India. When we decouple field delineation from cropland classification, a model trained in France and applied as-is to India Airbus SPOT imagery delineates fields with a mIoU of 0.74. If using 4.8 m resolution PlanetScope imagery instead, high average performance (mIoU > 0.8) is only achievable for fields larger than 1 hectare. Experiments also show that pre-training in France reduces the number of India field labels needed to achieve a given performance level by as much as 10x when datasets are small. These findings suggest our method is a scalable approach for delineating crop fields in regions of the world that currently lack field boundary datasets. We publicly release 10,000 Indian field boundary labels and our delineation model to facilitate the creation of field boundary maps and new methods by the community.

TI  - Aerosol Retrieval over Land from the Directional Polarimetric Camera Aboard on GF-5
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The DPC (Directional Polarization Camera) onboard the Chinese GaoFen-5 (GF-5) satellite is the first operational aerosol monitoring instrument capable of performing multi-angle polarized measurements in China. Compared with POLDER (Polarization and Directionality of Earth's Reflectance) which ended its mission in December 2013, DPC has similar band design, with a maximum of 12 imaging angles and a relatively higher spatial resolution of 3.3 km. The global aerosol optical depth (AOD) over land from October to December in 2018 was retrieved with multi-angle polarization measurements of DPC. Comparisons with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) AOD products show relatively good agreement over fine-aerosol-particle-dominated areas such as northern China and Huanghuai areas in eastern China, the southern foothills of the Himalayas and India. AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) measurements over Beijing, Xianghe and Kanpur were used to evaluate the accuracy of DPC AOD retrievals. The correlation coefficients are greater than 0.9 and the RMSE are lower than 0.08 for Beijing and Xianghe stations. For Kanpur, a relatively lower correlation of 0.772 and larger RMSE of 0.082 are found.

TI  - An Investigation of the Fengyun-4A/B GIIRS Performance on Temperature and Humidity Retrievals
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Fengyun-4A/B (FY-4A/B) geostationary satellite carries the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS). The instrument parameters of the GIIRS on FY-4A and FY-4B are not exactly the same, which is crucial for the atmospheric temperature and humidity measurements. The objective of this paper is to discuss the influence of spectral range on the retrieval for the FY-4A/B GIIRS. Firstly, we performed channel selection to choose the appropriate channels for retrieval. Then, the multiple cycling utilization of the physical retrieval method is proposed and conducted for improving the accuracy, and the retrieval results of FY-4A/B GIIRS are compared. Finally, perturbation analysis is performed to discuss the sensitivity of the retrieval to temperature perturbations due to the difference in spectral range between the two GIIRS. The results show the retrieval method can realize the improvement of the average accuracy by more than 0.9 K for temperature and 3.0% for humidity. As the spectral range widens, the retrieval accuracy of FY-4B GIIRS is superior to that of FY-4A GIIRS from 130 hPa to 400 hPa. Furthermore, perturbation analysis also shows the extension of the spectral range is beneficial to the retrieval. This study could offer the usefulness of current GIIRS instruments with observed on-orbit bias, and a reference for the parameter design of the subsequent instruments.

TI  - Effect of Snow Cover on Detecting Spring Phenology from Satellite-Derived Vegetation Indices in Alpine Grasslands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate estimation of phenological metrics from satellite data, especially the start of season (SOS), is of great significance to enhance our understanding of trends in vegetation phenology under climate change at regional or global scales. However, for regions with winter snow cover, such as the alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau, the presence of snow inevitably contaminates satellite signals and introduces bias into the detection of the SOS. Despite recent progress in eliminating the effect of snow cover on SOS detection, the mechanism of how snow cover affects the satellite-derived vegetation index (VI) and the detected SOS remains unclear. This study investigated the effect of snow cover on both VI and SOS detection by combining simulation experiments and real satellite data. Five different VIs were used and compared in this study, including four structure-based (i.e., NDVI, EVI2, NDPI, NDGI) VIs and one physiological-based (i.e., NIRv) VI. Both simulation experiments and satellite data analysis revealed that the presence of snow can significantly reduce the VI values and increase the local gradient of the growth curve, allowing the SOS to be detected. The bias in the detected SOS caused by snow cover depends on the end of the snow season (ESS), snow duration parameters, and the snow-free SOS. An earlier ESS results in an earlier estimate of the SOS, a later ESS results in a later estimate of the SOS, and an ESS close to the snow-free SOS results in small bias in the detected SOS. The sensitivity of the five VIs to snow cover in SOS detection is NDPI/NDGI < NIRv < EVI2 < NDVI, which has been verified in both simulation experiments and satellite data analysis. These findings will significantly advance our research on the feedback mechanisms between vegetation, snow, and climate change for alpine ecosystems.

TI  - Characterizing Forest Cover and Landscape Pattern Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data with Ensemble Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on forest distribution is an essential basis for the protection of forest resources. Recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning have contributed to the monitoring of forest-cover distribution cost-effectively, but reliable methods for rapid forest-cover mapping over mountainous areas are still lacking. In addition, the forest landscape pattern has proven to be closely related to the functioning of forest ecosystems, yet few studies have explicitly measured the forest landscape pattern or revealed its driving forces in mountainous areas. To address these challenges, we developed a framework for forest-cover mapping with multi-source remote sensing data (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2) and an automated ensemble learning method. We also designed a scheme for forest landscape pattern evaluation and driver attribution based on landscape metrics and random forest regression. Results in the Qilian Mountains showed that the proposed framework and scheme could accurately depict the distribution and pattern of forest cover. The overall accuracy of the obtained level-1 and level-2 forest-cover maps reached 95.49% and 78.05%, respectively. The multi-classifier comparison revealed that for forest classification, the ensemble learning method outperformed base classifiers such as LightGBM, random forests, CatBoost, XGBoost, and neural networks. Integrating multi-dimensional features, including spectral, phenological, topographic, and geographic information, helped distinguish forest cover. Compared with other land-cover products, our mapping results demonstrated high quality and rich spatial details. Furthermore, we found that forest patches in the Qilian Mountains were concentrated in the eastern regions with low-to-medium elevations and shady aspects. We also identified that climate was the critical environmental determent of the forest landscape pattern in the Qilian Mountains. Overall, the proposed framework and scheme have strong application potential for characterizing forest cover and landscape patterns. The mapping and evaluation results can further support forest resource management, ecological assessment, and regional sustainable development.

TI  - Modelling Permafrost Characteristics and Its Relationship with Environmental Constraints in the Gaize Area, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of environmental constraints on permafrost distribution and characteristics of the remote western Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) were seldom reported. Using augmented Noah land surface model, this study aims to elaborate the permafrost characteristics and their relationship with key environmental constraints in the Gaize, a transitional area with mosaic distribution of permafrost and seasonally frozen ground in the western QTP. There were two soil parameter schemes, two thermal roughness schemes, and three vegetation parameter schemes with optimal minimum stomatal resistance established using MODIS NDVI, turbulent flux, and field survey data. Forcing data were extracted from the China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD) and downscaled to 5 km x 5 km resolution. Results show that the error of simulated mean annual ground temperatures (MAGT) were less than 1.0 degrees C for nine boreholes. The Kappa coefficiency between three types of permafrost and three types of vegetation is 0.654, which indicates the close relationship between the presence of certain vegetation types and the occurrence of certain permafrost types in the Gaize. Permafrost distribution and characteristics of the Gaize are jointly influenced by both altitude and vegetation. The relationship of permafrost with environmental constraints over the Gaize is significantly different from that of the West Kunlun, a western, predominantly permafrost-distributed area.

TI  - Long-term trends of ozone and precursors from 2013 to 2020 in a megacity (Chengdu), China: Evidence of changing emissions and chemistry
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Elevated ozone (O3) pollution in the warm season is an emerging environmental concern affecting global highly urbanized megacities. In southwestern China, full characterization of causes for O3 pollution has been stymied by limited observations and the dominant factors that influence O3 variability on a long-term basis still lack un-derstanding. Herein, we identified O3 variations and inferred trends in precursor emissions in Chengdu over 2013-2020 based on extensive ambient measurements, emission inventory, and satellite data. Numerical models were used to investigate the changes in meteorological variability and biogenic emissions. Trends of O3 in urban areas show deterioration (+14.0% yr -1) between 2013 and 2016 followed by a slight decrease over 2017-2020, while O3 levels in rural areas generally show a downward trend (-2.9% yr -1) during 2014-2020. Both emission inventory (-3.7% yr -1) and OMI satellite columns (-4.5% yr -1) depict strong decline trends in NOx emissions, while satellite HCHO columns exhibit a flattened downward trend of VOC emissions (-1.8% yr -1), which caused rural areas shifted from VOCs-limited to transitional or NOx-limited regime since 2016. Considering metropolitan Chengdu remains VOCs-limited regime over time, the existing regulatory framework involving simultaneous NOx and VOCs control would result in evident O3 improvements in the near future. Despite benefits from anthro-pogenic emission reductions, we demonstrate that meteorological conditions and enhanced biogenic emissions over the warm season could partially or even fully offset effects attributed to emission changes, making the net effects obscure. This finding provides robust evidence of reductions in NOx and VOCs emission and informs effective O3 mitigation policies for megacities which undergo similar emission pathways in Chengdu.

TI  - A Spatial-Temporal Depth-Wise Residual Network for Crop Sub-Pixel Mapping from MODIS Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To address the problem caused by mixed pixels in MODIS images for high-resolution crop mapping, this paper presents a novel spatial-temporal deep learning-based approach for sub-pixel mapping (SPM) of different crop types within mixed pixels from MODIS images. High-resolution cropland data layer (CDL) data were used as ground references. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. First, we designed a novel spatial-temporal depth-wise residual network (ST-DRes) model that can simultaneously address both spatial and temporal data in MODIS images in efficient and effective manners for improving SPM accuracy. Second, we systematically compared different ST-DRes architecture variations with fine-tuned parameters for identifying and utilizing the best neural network architecture and hyperparameters. We also compared the proposed method with several classical SPM methods and state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning approaches. Third, we evaluated feature importance by comparing model performances with inputs of different satellite-derived metrics and different combinations of reflectance bands in MODIS. Last, we conducted spatial and temporal transfer experiments to evaluate model generalization abilities across different regions and years. Our experiments show that the ST-DRes outperforms the other classical SPM methods and SOTA backbone-based methods, particularly in fragmented categories, with the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 0.8639 and overall accuracy (OA) of 0.8894 in Sherman County. Experiments in the datasets of transfer areas and transfer years also demonstrate better spatial-temporal generalization capabilities of the proposed method.

TI  - Dynamic Task Scheduling in Remote Sensing Data Acquisition from Open-Access Data Using CloudSim
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of cloud computing and network technologies, large-scale remote sensing data collection tasks are receiving more interest from individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises. Large-scale remote sensing data collection has its challenges, including less available node resources, short collection time, and lower collection efficiency. Moreover, public remote data sources have restrictions on user settings, such as access to IP, frequency, and bandwidth. In order to satisfy users' demand for accessing public remote sensing data collection nodes and effectively increase the data collection speed, this paper proposes a TSCD-TSA dynamic task scheduling algorithm that combines the BP neural network prediction algorithm with PSO-based task scheduling algorithms. Comparative experiments were carried out using the proposed task scheduling algorithms on an acquisition task using data from Sentinel2. The experimental results show that the MAX-MAX-PSO dynamic task scheduling algorithm has a smaller fitness value and a faster convergence speed.

TI  - Generating Daily Land Surface Temperature Downscaling Data Based on Sentinel-3 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface temperature (LST) images obtained by thermal infrared remote sensing sensors are of great significance for numerous fields of research. However, the low spatial resolution is a drawback of LST images. Downscaling is an effective way to solve this problem. The traditional downscaling methods, however, have various drawbacks, including their low temporal and spectral resolutions, difficult processes, numerous errors, and single downscaling factor. They also rely on two or more separate satellite platforms. These drawbacks can be partially compensated for by the Sentinel-3 satellite's ability to acquire LST and multispectral images simultaneously. This paper proposes a downscaling model based on Sentinel-3 satellite and ASTER GDEM images-D-DisTrad-and compares the effects of the D-DisTrad model with DisTrad model and TsHARP model over four sites and four seasons. The mean bias (MB) range of the D-DisTrad model is -0.001-0.017 K, the mean absolute error (MAE) range is 0.103-0.891 K, and the root mean square error (RMSE) range is 0.220-1.235 K. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and R-2 ranges are 0.938-0.994 and 0.889-0.989, respectively. The D-DisTrad model has the smallest error, the highest correlation, and the best visual effect, and can eliminate some "mosaic" effects in the original image. This paper shows that the D-DisTrad model can improve the spatial resolution and visual effects of LST images while maintaining high temporal resolution, and discusses the influence of the terrain and land cover on LST data.

TI  - Analyzing Satellite-Derived 3D Building Inventories and Quantifying Urban Growth towards Active Faults: A Case Study of Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation (EO) data can provide large scale, high-resolution, and transferable methodologies to quantify the sprawl and vertical development of cities and are required to inform disaster risk reduction strategies for current and future populations. We synthesize the evolution of Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, which experiences high seismic hazard, and derive new datasets relevant for seismic risk modeling. First, the urban sprawl of Bishkek (1979-2021) was quantified using built-up area land cover classifications. Second, a change detection methodology was applied to a declassified KeyHole Hexagon (KH-9) and Sentinel-2 satellite image to detect areas of redevelopment within Bishkek. Finally, vertical development was quantified using multi-temporal high-resolution stereo and tri-stereo satellite imagery, which were used in a deep learning workflow to extract buildings footprints and assign building heights. Our results revealed urban growth of 139 km(2) (92%) and redevelopment of similar to 26% (59 km(2)) of the city (1979-2021). The trends of urban growth were not reflected in all the open access global settlement footprint products that were evaluated. Building polygons that were extracted using a deep learning workflow applied to high-resolution tri-stereo (Pleiades) satellite imagery were most accurate (F1 score = 0.70) compared to stereo (WorldView-2) imagery (F1 score = 0.61). Similarly, building heights extracted using a Pleiades-derived digital elevation model were most comparable to independent measurements obtained using ICESat-2 altimetry data and field-measurements (normalized absolute median deviation < 1 m). Across different areas of the city, our analysis suggested rates of building growth in the region of 2000-10,700 buildings per year, which when combined with a trend of urban growth towards active faults highlights the importance of up-to-date building stock exposure data in areas of seismic hazard. Deep learning methodologies applied to high-resolution imagery are a valuable monitoring tool for building stock, especially where country-level or open-source datasets are lacking or incomplete.

TI  - Time-Series FY4A Datasets for Super-Resolution Benchmarking of Meteorological Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorological satellites are usually operated at high temporal resolutions, but the spatial resolutions are too poor to identify ground content. Super-resolution is an economic way to enhance spatial details, but the feasibility is not validated for meteorological images due to the absence of benchmarking data. In this work, we propose the FY4ASRgray and FY4ASRcolor datasets to assess super-resolution algorithms on meteorological applications. The features of cloud sensitivity and temporal continuity are linked to the proposed datasets. To test the usability of the new datasets, five state-of-the-art super-resolution algorithms are gathered for contest. Shift learning is used to shorten the training time and improve the parameters. Methods are modified to deal with the 16-bit challenge. The reconstruction results are demonstrated and evaluated regarding the radiometric, structural, and spectral loss, which gives the baseline performance for detail enhancement of the FY4A satellite images. Additional experiments are made on FY4ASRcolor for sequence super-resolution, spatiotemporal fusion, and generalization test for further performance test.

TI  - Hydrodynamic Modeling of Inundation Patterns of a Large African Floodplain Indicates Sensitivity to Waterway Restoration
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale floodplains are important features of the African continent. Regular inundation provides the means to support large populations but can also present problems such as access to health facilities and water body formation that sustain malaria vectors. Modeling of these floodplains is therefore important, but complex. In this research, we develop, calibrate, and validate a hydrodynamic model of the Barotse Floodplain, of the Upper Zambezi, Zambia. The floodplain has seen recent infrastructure developments including the restoration of the canal network and construction of a cross floodplain causeway. In order to create a robust model, a multiobjective calibration uses a time slice approach based on available Landsat satellite image overpasses. An emulator-based sensitivity analysis indicates the significance of hydrological processes in the model. Model evaluation is undertaken for two events in the gauge record (2009 and 2018), of similar magnitude that occur before and after modifications to the floodplain. Results indicate a complex impact of infrastructure development on the hydrodynamics of the floodplain, with a higher peak flow, but with a redistribution of water throughout the floodplain. Deeper flooding is observed in some areas while others experience lower water levels. The sensitivity results also reflect a change in processes, where floodplain flows dominate the 2009 event, whilst channel process dominate the 2018 event. Overall, we show that relatively modest modifications to the floodplain have impacted flood water levels, which in turn will influence access route availability and alter malaria transmission rates.

TI  - Forest Burned Area Detection Using a Novel Spectral Index Based on Multi-Objective Optimization
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires cause environmental and economic damage, destroy large areas of land and displace entire communities. Accurate extraction of fire-affected areas is of vital importance to support post-fire management strategies and account for the environmental impact of fires. In this paper, an analytical burned area index, called ABAI, was proposed to map burned areas from the newly launched Sentinel-2 images. The innovation of this method is to separate the fire scars from other typical land covers by formulating different objective functions, which involved three main components: First, spectral differences between the burned land and other land covers were characterized by analyzing the spectral features of the existing burned area indices. Then, for each type of land cover, we formed an objective function by linear combination of bands with the values of band ratios. Second, all the objective functions and possible constraints were formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, and then it was solved using a linear programming approach. Finally, the ABAI spectral index was achieved with the optimizing coefficients derived from the multi-objective problem. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed spectral index, three experimental datasets, clipped from Sentinel-2 images at different places, were tested and compared with baseline indices, such as normalized burned area (NBR) and burned area index (BAI) methods. Experimental results demonstrated that the injection of a green band to the spectral index has led to good applicability in burned area detection, where the ABAI can avoid most of the confusion presented by shadows or shallow water. Compared to other burned area indices, the proposed ABAI achieved the best classification accuracy, with the overall accuracy being over 90%. Visually, our approach significantly outperforms other spectral indexed methods, especially in confused areas covered by water bodies and shadows.

TI  - Variation and comparison of cloud cover in MODIS and four reanalysis datasets of ERA-interim, ERA5, MERRA-2 and NCEP
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud plays an important role in climate change and radiative forcing. Atmospheric reanalysis datasets provide an economical and efficient way to explore the worldwide cloud variation. This study compares the monthly total cloud cover (TCC) and high cloud cover (HCC) of the four commonly used atmospheric reanalysis datasets, including European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Reanalysis (ERA-Interim), ECMWF's Fifth-generation Reanalysis (ERA5), Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP: only TCC), with MODIS re-trievals during 2001-2018. The spatial and temporal distributions of TCC for the four reanalyses are generally consistent with MODIS results, while showing better consistency over land than over ocean. The largest TCC discrepancy between MODIS and the reanalysis appears over the polar regions. Among the four reanalysis datasets, ERA5 presents the highest correlation and the smallest mean bias compared with MODIS, while NCEP shows the lowest and the largest. Although all the three reanalyses (ERA-Interim, ERA5 and MERRA-2) generally give an overestimation of HCC compared with MODIS, the ERA-Interim shows the closest to MODIS. The largest difference of HCCs between MODIS and the reanalysis is located over the Tibet Plateau. To the annual change of global means, ERA-Interim and MERRA-2 appear a significant increasing trend of TCC over both land and ocean. ERA5 and MERRA-2 show a significant decreasing trend of HCC over ocean, and MODIS gives a reduce over land. Furthermore, During the ENSO events, a positive anomaly of TCC, which is positively correlated with the ENSO intensity over the eastern equatorial Pacific, is captured by all the four reanalyses, among which ERA5 and ERA -Interim appear more distinct.

TI  - Analyzing the Spatially Heterogeneous Relationships between Nighttime Light Intensity and Human Activities across Chongqing, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime light (NTL) intensity is highly associated with the unique footprint of human activities, reflecting the development of socioeconomic and urbanization. Therefore, better understanding of the relationship between NTL intensity and human activities can help extend the applications of NTL remote sensing data. Different from the global effect of human activities on NTL intensity discussed in previous studies, we focused more attention to the local effect caused by the spatial heterogeneity of human activities with the support of the multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model in this study. In particular, the Suomi National Polar Orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP/VIIRS) NTL data within Chongqing, China were taken as example, and the point of interest (POI) data and road network data were adopted to characterize the intensity of human activity type. Our results show that there is significant spatial variation in the effect of human activities to the NTL intensity, since the accuracy of fitted MGWR (adj.R-2: 0.86 and 0.87 in 2018 and 2020, respectively; AICc: 4844.63 and 4623.27 in 2018 and 2020, respectively) is better than that of both the traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) model and the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. Moreover, we found that almost all human activity features show strong spatial heterogeneity and their contribution to NTL intensity varies widely across different regions. For instance, the contribution of road network density is more homogeneous, while residential areas have an obviously heterogeneous distribution which is associated with house vacancy. In addition, the contributions of the commercial event and business also have a significant spatial heterogeneity distribution, but show a distinct decrement when facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study successfully explores the relationship between NTL intensity and human activity features considering the spatial heterogeneity, which aims to provide further insights into the future applications of NTL data.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Pattern and Influencing Factors of Vegetation Phenology and Net Primary Productivity in the Qilian Mountains of Northwest China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how vegetation growth responds to climate change is a critical requirement for predicting future ecosystem dynamics. Global warming causes significant changes in the vegetation characteristics of mountain ecosystems, particularly affecting vegetation phenology and net primary productivity (NPP). The Qilian Mountains are located in an arid and semiarid region, and the mechanisms of vegetation phenology in response to climate change still need to be further explored. We used MODIS data (2001-2020) to extract vegetation phenology and NPP, quantitatively evaluated their spatial-temporal dynamics, and analyzed the response mechanism of vegetation phenology-climate and vegetation phenology-NPP combined with meteorological data. The results showed that from southeast to northwest, the vegetation phenology changes significantly with the change in vegetation type, with SOS (start of the growing season) advancing at a rate of -0.415 d/year, EOS (end of the growing season) and LOS (length of the growing season) delaying at a rate of 0.20 d/year and 0.374 d/year, respectively, and NPP continues to increase. There was also an elevation gradient effect, with SOS delayed by 15.6 d/km, EOS advanced by 12.02 d/km and LOS shortened by 19.24 d/km. We found that the preseason temperature and SPEI (standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index) have a strong influence on the SOS and EOS, with the mean minimum temperature being the most significant and requiring attention, while the influence of precipitation cannot be ignored. We also found that the vegetation phenology is closely related to NPP, and SOS has the most significant effect. This study will provide a scientific basis for the response mechanisms of vegetation phenology in arid and semiarid regions under climate change. It will provide a reference for the implementation of effective ecosystem management.

TI  - In Vivo Oral Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping by Near-Infrared Fluorescent Methylene Blue in Rats
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging using methylene blue (MB) for detecting oral sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in rats and compared MB's tracer effects with those of indocyanine green (ICG) in SLN mapping. Different concentrations of MB were injected into the rats' left lingual submucosa to determine the optimal concentration by using a continuous (1 h) MI-1 fluorescence imaging system. To compare the tracer effects of the optimal MB concentration with ICG in oral SLN mapping, MI-1 imaging was continuously monitored for 12 h. The mean signal-to-background ratio (SBR) of the SLNs and SLN fluorescence area fraction were analyzed. SLNs and lymphatic vessels were clearly visible in all rats. The optimal injection dose of MB infected into lingual submucosa for NIR fluorescence imaging was 0.2 mL of 6.68 mM MB. During continuous monitoring for 12 h, the mean SBR of the SLNs was significantly higher in the ICG groups than in the MB groups (p < 0.001). However, the area fraction of SLN fluorescence in the ICG groups increased continuously, owing to strong fluorescent contamination. This study examined the feasibility of detection of draining lymph nodes in the oral cavity of rats using MB NIR fluorescence imaging.

TI  - Impacts of FY-4A Atmospheric Motion Vectors on the Henan 7.20 Rainstorm Forecast in 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) derived from images of the geostationary satellite, Fengyun-4A (FY-4A), can provide high-spatiotemporal-resolution wind observations in the atmospheric middle and upper levels. To explore the potential benefits of these data for the numerical forecasting of severe weather events, the characteristics of FY-4A AMVs in different channels were analyzed and three groups of assimilation experiments were conducted in this study. The impacts of FY-4A AMVs on the forecasts of the rainstorm that occurred in Henan province in China on 20 July 2021, were investigated based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The results show that FY-4A AMVs with a higher quality indicator (QI) exhibited a lower error characteristic at the cost of a reduced sample size. The assimilation of FY-4A AMVs reduced the error of the upper-level wind fields in 24 h forecasts. A positive impact could also be obtained for 10 m wind in 24 h forecasts, with an improvement of up to 9.74% for the mean bias and 3.0% for the root-mean-square error due to the inclusion of FY-4A AMVs with a QI > 70. Assimilating the AMVs with a QI > 80, there was an overall positive impact on the CSI score skills of 6 h accumulated precipitation above 1.0 mm in the 24 h forecast. A significant improvement could be found in the forecasting of heavy rainfall above 25.0 mm after 6 h of the forecast. The spatial distribution of the 24 h accumulated heavy rainfall zone was closer to the observations with the assimilation of the FY-4A AMVs. The adjustment of the initial wind fields resulting from the FY-4A AMVs brought a clear benefit to the quantitative precipitation forecasting skills in the event of the Henan 7.20 rainstorm; however, the AMV data assimilation still had difficulty in capturing the hourly maximum rainfall and intensity well.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Wetland in Dongting Lake Based on Multi-Source Satellite Observation Data during Last Two Decades
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the dynamics of wetland resources has practical value for wetland protection, restoration and sustainable utilization. Dongting Lake wetland reserves are well known for both their intra-annual and inter-annual dynamic changes due to the effects of natural or human factors. However, most wetland monitoring research has failed to consider the seasonal wetlands, which is the most fragile wetland type, requiring more attention. In this study, we used multi-source time series remote sensing data to monitor three Dongting Lake wetland reserves between 2000 and 2020, and the seasonal wetlands were separated from permanent wetlands. Multispectral and indices time series were generated at 30 m resolution using a two-month composition strategy; the optimal features were then selected using the extension of the Jeffries-Matusita distance (J(Bh)) and random forest (RF) importance score; yearly wetland maps were identified using the optimal features and the RF classifier. Results showed that (1) the yearly wetland maps had good accuracy, and the overall accuracy and kappa coefficients of all wetland maps from 2000 to 2020 were above 89.6% and 0.86, respectively. Optimal features selected by J(Bh) can improve both computational efficiency and classification accuracy. (2) The acreage of seasonal wetlands varies greatly among multiple years due to inter-annual differences in precipitation and evaporation. (3) Although the total wetland area of the three Dongting Lake wetland reserves remained relatively stable between 2000 and 2020, the acreage of the natural wetland types still decreased by 197.0 km(2), and the change from natural wetland to human-made wetland (paddy field) contributed the most to this decrease. From the perspective of the ecological community, the human-made wetland has lower ecological function value than natural wetlands, so the balance between economic development and ecological protection in the three Dongting Lake wetland reserves requires further evaluation. The outcomes of this study could improve the understanding of the trends and driving mechanisms of wetland dynamics, which has important scientific significance and application value for the protection and restoration of Dongting Lake wetland reserves.

TI  - A new method for interpolation of missing air quality data at monitor stations
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies in environmental fields often suffer from air quality datasets incomplete at certain places and times. Here, a Spatial-Temporal Point Interpolation based on Biased Sentinel Hospitals Areal Disease Estimation (STPI-BSHADE) interpolation method was introduced to address this issue. The method was based on the spatial statistic trinity theory, where the statistical error is determined by the population properties, the condition of the sample, and the method of estimation. In our study, the spatial association of the variables was quantified by the covariance and the ratio of air quality data between stations, resulting in linear unbiased estimates of the missing data. STPI-BSHADE was compared with two widely used statistical methods, inverse distance weighting (IDW) and Kriging. Theoretically, IDW and Kriging are short of the capacity of using the heterogeneous characteristics of the population and remedying the sample bias. Empirically, the accuracy of the STPI-BSHADE method was assessed using hourly particulate matter 2.5 data, collected from May 13 to December 31, 2014, in the Beijing -Tianjin-Hebei areas, where air quality presents spatial heterogeneity. The experimental results also demonstrated that STPI-BSHADE significantly outperformed the traditional methods.

TI  - Evaluation and Comparison of Spatio-Temporal Relationship between Multiple Satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Near-Surface PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentration over China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the advantages of remote sensing, an increasing number of satellite aerosol optical depths (AOD) have been utilized to evaluate near-ground PM2.5. However, the spatiotemporal relationship between AODs and PM2.5 still lacks a comprehensive investigation, especially in some regions with severe pollution within China. Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal relationships between several satellite AODs and the near-surface PM2.5 concentration across China and its 14 representative regions during 2016-2018 using the correlation coefficient (R), the PM2.5/AOD ratio (eta), the geo-detector (q), and the different aerosol-dominated regimes. The results showed that the MODIS AOD from the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm strongly correlates with PM2.5 (R > 0.6) in China, particularly in the Chengyu (CY), Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) regions. The close correlations (R = 0.7) exist between PM2.5 and MODIS and VIIRS AOD from the deep blue (DB) algorithm in the CY, BTH, and YRD regions. Under the key aerosols affecting China (e.g., sulfate and dust), there is a strong correlation (R > 0.5) between the PM2.5 and MODIS and VIIRS AODs from the MAIAC and DB algorithms, with the higher concentration of ground-level PM2.5 per unit of these AODs (eta > 130). The MAIAC AOD (Terra/Aqua) can better explain the spatial distribution (q > 0.4) of PM2.5 than those of AODs from the dark target (DT) and DB algorithms applied to the MODIS over China and its specific regions across seasons. The performance of the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) AOD (R > 0.5, q > 0.3) was close to that of the MAIAC AOD during the spring and summer; however, it was far less than the MAIAC AOD in the autumn and winter seasons. The investigation provides instructions for estimating the near-surface PM2.5 concentration based on AOD in different regions of China.

TI  - Study of the Buried Basin C-H, Based on the Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We use multi-source remote sensing data to identify the details of a mascon south-east of the lunar Copernicus crater. Studies of the topography, gravity, geochronology and mineral are combined to prove that the mascon is a buried peak-ring basin with diameters of about 130 km and 260 km. The underground structure is covered by 890 m thick mare basalts, as determined by analyzing the spectral features of the impact crater, Copernicus H. The determination of the crater size-frequency distribution (CSFD) suggests that the impact that created the C-H basin occurred earlier than 3.9 Ga. Then, a Hawaiian-style eruption in the late Imbrian period formed the Sinus Aestuum-I dark mantling deposit (DMD). Soon, mare basalts covered the basin several times from 3.8 Ga. Finally, the ejecta from the Copernicus impact event at about 800 Ma, and the weathering processes caused the disappearance of the C-H basin rim from the lunar surface.

TI  - Limb Sounders Tracking Tsunami-Induced Perturbations from the Stratosphere to the Ionosphere
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we employ three types of satellite data from two different limb sounders: the FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC (F3/C) radio occultation (RO) technique and the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument to study the vertical coupling of the 16-09-2015 Chile tsunami-induced perturbations from the stratosphere to the ionosphere. All three types of datasets, including temperature profiles from 10 to 55 km and 16 to 107 km, and electron density profiles from 120 to 550 km, recognized perturbations of different scales at different heights after the Chile tsunami. The vertical scales identified by the wavelet analysis are from 1-2 km, 5-9 km, and 25-50 km in the stratosphere, mesosphere, and ionosphere, respectively. Meanwhile, as a comparison and validation of the reliability, we also revisited the 11-03-2011 Tohoku earthquake/tsunami-related perturbations from the stratosphere to the ionosphere using the same data. It is believed that the two tsunamis both disturbed the whole atmosphere space, and the scale of these signals gradually increases with the increase in altitude but decreases with time. In addition, the tsunami-related ionospheric gravity wavefronts are examined by the F3/C observations. Another interesting point is that the temperature perturbations recorded by the SABER from 70-100 km altitude are found to arrive earlier than the 2015 tsunami wavefront. The findings in this study suggest that the limb-sounding technique is a useful instrument for detecting the tsunami-coupling gravity wave and benefits the tsunami warning system.

TI  - Ship Classification in Synthetic Aperture Radar Images Based on Multiple Classifiers Ensemble Learning and Automatic Identification System Data Transfer Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous development of earth observation technology, space-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has become an important source of information for maritime surveillance, and ship classification in SAR images has also become a hot research direction in the field of maritime ship monitoring. In recent years, the remote sensing community has proposed several solutions to the problem of ship object classification in SAR images. However, it is difficult to obtain an adequate amount of labeled SAR samples for training classifiers, which limits the application of machine learning, particularly deep learning methods, in SAR image ship object classification. In contrast, as a real-time automatic tracking system for monitoring ships at sea, a ship automatic identification system (AIS) can provide a large amount of relatively easy-to-obtain labeled ship samples. Therefore, to solve the problem of SAR image ship classification and improve the classification performance of learning models with limited samples, we proposed a SAR image ship classification method based on multiple classifiers ensemble learning (MCEL) and AIS data transfer learning. The core idea of our method is to transfer the MCEL model trained on AIS data to SAR image ship classification, which mainly includes three steps: first, we use the acquired global space-based AIS data to build a dataset for ship object classification models training; then, the ensemble learning model is constructed by combining multiple base classifiers; and finally, the trained classification model is transferred to SAR images for ship type prediction. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 85.00% for the SAR ship classification, which is better than the performance of each base classifier. This proves that AIS data transfer learning can effectively solve the problem of SAR ship classification with limited samples, and has important application value in maritime surveillance.

TI  - DPAFNet: A Multistage Dense-Parallel Attention Fusion Network for Pansharpening
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is the technology to fuse a low spatial resolution MS image with its associated high spatial full resolution PAN image. However, primary methods have the insufficiency of the feature expression and do not explore both the intrinsic features of the images and correlation between images, which may lead to limited integration of valuable information in the pansharpening results. To this end, we propose a novel multistage Dense-Parallel attention fusion network (DPAFNet). The proposed parallel attention residual dense block (PARDB) module can focus on the intrinsic features of MS images and PAN images while exploring the correlation between the source images. To fuse more complementary information as much as possible, the features extracted from each PARDB are fused at multistage levels, which allows the network to better focus on and exploit different information. Additionally, we propose a new loss, where it calculates the L2-norm between the pansharpening results and PAN images to constrain the spatial structures. Experiments were conducted on simulated and real datasets and the evaluation results verified the superiority of the DPAFNet.

TI  - A Prediction Model for the Outbreak Date of Spring Pollen Allergy in Beijing Based on Satellite-Derived Phenological Characteristics of Vegetation Greenness
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pollen allergies have a serious impact on people's physical and mental health. Accurate and efficient prediction of the outbreak date of pollen allergies plays an important role in the conservation of people sensitive to allergenic pollen. It is a frontier research to combine new social media data and satellite data to develop a model to forecast the outbreak date of pollen allergies. This study extracted the real outbreak dates of spring pollen allergies from Sina Weibo records from 2011 to 2021 in Beijing and calculated five vegetation indices of three vegetation types as phenological characteristics within the 30 days before the average outbreak date. The sensitivity coefficients and correlation coefficients were used to screen the phenological characteristics that best reflected the outbreak date of spring pollen allergy. Based on the best characteristic, two kinds of prediction models for the outbreak date of spring pollen allergy in Beijing were established (the linear fit prediction model and the cumulative linear fit prediction model), and the root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated as the prediction accuracy. The results showed that (1) the date of EVI2 (2-band enhanced vegetation index) in evergreen forest first reaching 0.138 can best reflect the outbreak date of pollen allergies in spring, and (2) the cumulative linear fit prediction model based on EVI2 in evergreen forests can obtain a high accuracy with an average RMSE of 3.6 days, which can predict the outbreak date of spring pollen allergies 30 days in advance. Compared with the existing indirect prediction models (which predict pollen concentrations rather than pollen allergies), this model provides a new direct way to predict pollen allergy outbreaks by using only remote sensing time-series data before pollen allergy outbreaks. The new prediction model also has better representativeness and operability and is capable of assisting public health management.

TI  - The Impact of Urbanization on the Relationship between Carbon Storage Supply and Demand in Mega-Urban Agglomerations and Response Measures: A Case of Yangtze River Delta Region, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization in mega-urban agglomerations disturbs the balance of carbon storage supply and demand (CSD) and constrains the achievement of sustainable development goals. Here, we developed a socio-ecological system (SES) framework coupled with ecosystem services (ES) cascade and DPSIR model to systematically analyze the impacts and responses of urbanization affecting CSD. We quantified urbanization and CSD using multi-source remote sensing data, such as land use and night lighting, together with related socio-economic data, such as total energy consumption, population and GDP. We found that from 2000 to 2020, the urbanization of Yangtze River Delta region (YRD) led to a decrease of 2.75% in carbon storage supply and an increase of 226.45% in carbon storage demand. However, carbon storage supply was still larger than carbon storage demand, and the spatial mismatch of CSD is the most important problem at present. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the response measures from the comprehensive perspective of SES. We identified key ecological conservation areas using a Marxan model to protect the carbon storage capacity in ecological subsystems, and promoted a carbon compensation scheme based on both the grandfather principle and the carbon efficiency principle, reconciling the contradiction between ecological conservation and socio-economic development in the social subsystem. Finally, this study quantified the threshold of urbanization based on the carbon neutrality target at which CSD reaches an equilibrium state. This study proposed a SES framework, and a set of methodologies to quantify the relationship between urbanization and CSD, which will help mega-urban agglomerations to promote harmonious development of urbanization and ecological conservation and to achieve the carbon peak and carbon neutrality targets proposed by the Chinese government.

TI  - Source Model and Triggered Aseismic Faulting of the 2021 Mw 7.3 Maduo Earthquake Revealed by the UAV-Lidar/Photogrammetry, InSAR, and Field Investigation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-source datasets, including the UAV-Lidar/Photogrammetry, InSAR, and field investigation data, have been used for revealing the complex surface displacement pattern and focal mechanism of the 2021 Maduo Mw 7.3 earthquake. First, a co-seismic surface deformation field was extracted from the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images captured by ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 satellites. Second, the SAR pixel offset tracking results were adopted to detect the initial location of the seismogenic fault. Then, the Lidar digital elevation model with high spatial resolution and field investigation were employed to refine and verify the location of the seismogenic fault. It was found that bifurcated strike-slip rupture should account for the 2021 Maduo earthquake. As indicated by the estimated faulting model based on the InSAR data, the maximal fault slip was similar to 6.2 m, occurring in the southeast of the main seismogenic fault, and five remarkable slip concentrations controlled the surface displacement of the 2021 Maduo earthquake. Furthermore, the co- and post-seismic InSAR deformation, dilatation, shear strain, Coulomb failure stress, and aftershock sequence suggest that the co-seismic rupture of the two main seismogenic faults have triggered the aseismic slip along the Changmahe fault. Lastly, according to the Coulomb failure stress change due to the historical earthquakes and the 2021 Maduo earthquake, the 1937 M 7.8 earthquake predominantly controlled the Coulomb failure stress change along the Kunlun fault, and the Xidatan-Alake Lake and Maqin segments had a higher risk of future earthquake than the other segments.

TI  - Multi-Timescale Analysis of the Evolution of Sandy Coastline: A Case Study in South China
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal zone is essential to economic and social development. However, coastline evolution is a complex research topic, owing to the intersection and coupling of different fields such as wind, wave, and current. Research is further complicated by variations in these fields' temporal and spatial scales. This study acquired and preprocessed multi-phase Landsat remote sensing satellite images of the eastern coast, from Wailuo to Zhuzi, from 1987 to 2021. Then, the decoded and extracted instantaneous coastline images were corrected, and quantitative analysis was carried out through the Digital Coastline Analysis System (DSAS). The results showed that trends of coastline evolution in the study area in the medium-long term were overall balanced. All the transects manifested temporal and spatial differences, and erosional hot spots were mainly concentrated on the coastal cape and its vicinity. To investigate storm-induced beach erosion in the short term, the 400 m coastline of Baimao in the area was selected as a field site, and the field survey was conducted during two storms. The distribution of the dynamic parameters of sediment deposition was also investigated. The results showed that the beach in the field site had an excellent ability to resist storm erosion and that the topographic change was greatly affected by geological conditions in the area, such as reef masking and a typical headland beach. The grain size parameters of the beach sediments were sensitive to storms, reflecting the adjustment of the beach surface during typhoons. This study shows how a multi-timescale analysis could represent an efficient approach to understanding the dynamic evolution of the coastline. It showed a detailed description of the historical coastline evolution of the eastern coast of the Leizhou Peninsula after 1987. Additionally, the coastline evolution and sediment distribution for the sedimentation dynamic environment of Baimao tourist area in the short term were also investigated. In conclusion, this study can contribute to the rational utilization of coastal resources, to coastal disaster prevention, and the mitigation of local coastal areas.

TI  - Improving Typical Urban Land-Use Classification with Active-Passive Remote Sensing and Multi-Attention Modules Hybrid Network: A Case Study of Qibin District, Henan, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of high-precision land-use classification is essential for the sustainable development of land resources. This study addresses the problem of classification errors in optical remote-sensing images under high surface humidity, cloud cover, and hazy weather. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are sensitive to soil moisture, and the microwave can penetrate clouds, haze, and smoke. By using both the active and passive remote-sensing data, the Sentinel-1A SAR and Sentinel-2B multispectral (MS) images are combined synergistically. The full-band data combining the SAR + MS + spectral indexes is thus constructed. Based on the high dimensionality and heterogeneity of this data set, a new framework (MAM-HybridNet) based on two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) hybrid convolutional neural networks combined with multi-attention modules (MAMs) is proposed for improving the accuracy of land-use classification in cities with high surface humidity. In addition, the same training samples supported by All bands data (SAR + MS + spectral index) are selected and compared with k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), 2D convolutional neural networks, 3D convolutional neural networks, and hybridSN classification models to verify the accuracy of the proposed classification model. The results show that (1) fusion classification based on Sentinel-2B MSI and Sentinel-1A SAR data produce an overall accuracy (OA) of 95.10%, a kappa coefficient (KC) of 0.93, and an average accuracy (AA) of 92.86%, which is better than the classification results using Sentinel-2B MSI and Sentinel-1A SAR images separately. (2) The classification accuracy improves upon adding the spectral index, and the OA, KC, and AA improve by 3.77%, 0.05, and 5.5%, respectively. (3) With the support of full-band data, the algorithm proposed herein produces better results than other classification algorithms, with an OA of 98.87%, a KC of 0.98, and an AA of 98.36%. These results indicate that the synergistic effect of active-passive remote-sensing data improves land-use classification. Additionally, the results verify the effectiveness of the proposed deep-learning classification model for land-use classification.

TI  - Combination of Hyperspectral and Quad-Polarization SAR Images to Classify Marsh Vegetation Using Stacking Ensemble Learning Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Combinations of multi-sensor remote sensing images and machine learning have attracted much attention in recent years due to the spectral similarity of wetland plant canopy. However, the integration of hyperspectral and quad-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images for classifying marsh vegetation has still been faced with the challenges of using machine learning algorithms. To resolve this issue, this study proposed an approach to classifying marsh vegetation in the Honghe National Nature Reserve, northeast China, by combining backscattering coefficient and polarimetric decomposition parameters of C-band and L-band quad-polarization SAR data with hyperspectral images. We further developed an ensemble learning model by stacking Random Forest (RF), CatBoost and XGBoost algorithms for marsh vegetation mapping and evaluated its classification performance of marsh vegetation between combinations of hyperspectral and full-polarization SAR data and any of the lone sensor images. Finally, this paper explored the effect of different polarimetric decomposition methods and wavelengths of radar on classifying wetland vegetation. We found that a combination of ZH-1 hyperspectral images, C-band GF-3, and L-band ALOS-2 quad-polarization SAR images achieved the highest overall classification accuracy (93.13%), which was 5.58-9.01% higher than that only using C-band or L-band quad-polarization SAR images. This study confirmed that stacking ensemble learning provided better performance than a single machine learning model using multi-source images in most of the classification schemes, with the overall accuracy ranging from 77.02% to 92.27%. The CatBoost algorithm was capable of identifying forests and deep-water marsh vegetation. We further found that L-band ALOS-2 SAR images achieved higher classification accuracy when compared to C-band GF-3 polarimetric SAR data. ALOS-2 was more sensitive to deep-water marsh vegetation classification, while GF-3 was more sensitive to shallow-water marsh vegetation mapping. Finally, scattering model-based decomposition provided important polarimetric parameters from ALOS-2 SAR images for marsh vegetation classification, while eigenvector/eigenvalue-based and two-component decompositions produced a great contribution when using GF-3 SAR images.

TI  - Mapping Irregular Local Climate Zones from Sentinel-2 Images Using Deep Learning with Sequential Virtual Scenes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the local climate zone (LCZ) system has been presented to establish the connection between urban landscape and local thermal environment. However, LCZ entities are very difficult to be identified by pixel-based classifiers or object-oriented image analysis, as they are often a complicated combination of multiple ground objects (e.g., buildings, roads, grassland, etc.). Scene classifiers, especially deep learning methods can exploit the structure or contextual information of image scenes and then improve the performance of LCZ classification. However, the square and uniform-sized image patches often bring about extra challenges, as they cannot exactly match LCZ entities of diverse sizes and shapes in most cases. In this study, a sequential virtual scene method is presented to identify LCZ entities of diverse shapes and sizes, which consists of a small "core patch" for scanning diverse entities and sequential virtual scenes for providing abundant context. Specifically, the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) were used to learn the spatial relationship among virtual scenes, respectively. Importantly, a "self-attention" mechanism is designed to weigh the contribution of every virtual scene for alleviating the influences of mixed patches, according to the similarity between its hidden state and the final hidden state. Experiments prove SVS achieves better accuracies than random forest and ResNet and has the outstanding capacity of identifying irregular LCZ entities. It is a promising way to carry out LCZ mapping in cities of different types due to its flexibility and adaptability.

TI  - Satellite-Observed Time and Length Scales of Global Sea Surface Salinity Variability: A Comparison of Three Satellite Missions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface salinity (SSS) observations from Aquarius, Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite missions are compared to characterize the time and length scales of SSS variability globally. Overall, there is general agreement between the global patterns of the time and length scales of SSS variability estimated from the three satellite missions. The temporal scales of SSS variability vary from more than 90 days in the tropics to similar to 15 days in the Southern Ocean. The very short temporal scales (close to the Nyquist period) in some parts of the ocean are probably due to the high level of noise in the satellite data or the high noise-to-signal ratio. The longest temporal scales are observed along the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) and in the central and western tropical Pacific. These areas are also related to the strongest ENSO-related signal in SSS. The processes governing the SSS variability and distribution are also non-stationary, such that the scales determined over different observation periods may differ. Dominant spatial scales of SSS variability are generally the longest (up to 150 km) in the tropics and the shortest (<60 km) in the subpolar regions. The distribution of the dominant spatial scales is not simply latitudinal but exhibits a more complex spatial pattern. In the tropics, there is slight east-west and inter-hemispheric asymmetry observed in the Pacific but absent in the other two oceans. The analysis also reveals that the length scales of SSS variability are highly anisotropic in the tropics (the zonal scales are generally shorter than the meridional ones) and become more isotropic towards higher latitudes. Regional differences in the estimates of the scales from the three satellite SSS datasets may arise due to differences in the observation duration, spatial resolution and/or different level of noise.

TI  - Early-Season Crop Identification in the Shiyang River Basin Using a Deep Learning Algorithm and Time-Series Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate crop identification and mapping are of great significance for crop yield estimation, disaster warning, and food security. Early-season crop identification places higher demands on the quality and mining of time-series information than post-season mapping. In recent years, great strides have been made in the development of deep-learning algorithms, and the emergence of Sentinel-2 data with a higher temporal resolution has provided new opportunities for early-season crop identification. In this study, we aimed to fully exploit the potential of deep-learning algorithms and time-series Sentinel-2 data for early-season crop identification and early-season crop mapping. In this study, four classifiers, i.e., two deep-learning algorithms (one-dimensional convolutional networks and long and short-term memory networks) and two shallow machine-learning algorithms (a random forest algorithm and a support vector machine), were trained using early-season Sentinel-2 images and field samples collected in 2019. Then, these algorithms were applied to images and field samples for 2020 in the Shiyang River Basin. Twelve scenarios with different classifiers and time intervals were compared to determine the optimal combination for the earliest crop identification. The results show that: (1) the two deep-learning algorithms outperformed the two shallow machine-learning algorithms in early-season crop identification; (2) the combination of a one-dimensional convolutional network and 5-day interval time-series Sentinel-2 data outperformed the other schemes in obtaining the early-season crop identification time and achieving early mapping; and (3) the early-season crop identification mapping time in the Shiyang River Basin was identified as the end of July, and the overall classification accuracy reached 0.83. In addition, the early identification time for each crop was as follows: the wheat was in the flowering stage (mid-late June); the alfalfa was in the first harvest (mid-late June); the corn was in the early tassel stage (mid-July); the fennel and sunflower were in the flowering stage (late July); and the melons were in the fruiting stage (around late July). This study demonstrates the potential of using Sentinel-2 time-series data and deep-learning algorithms to achieve early-season crop identification, and this method is expected to provide new solutions and ideas for addressing early-season crop identification monitoring.

TI  - Impacts of FY-4A GIIRS Water Vapor Channels Data Assimilation on the Forecast of "21•7" Extreme Rainstorm in Henan, China with CMA-MESO
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A record-breaking extreme rainstorm occurred in Henan Province of China on 20 July 2021. To investigate the impacts of the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) data assimilation on model analysis and forecasts of this rainfall event, the high temporal resolution GIIRS water vapor (WV) channel data were assimilated in the high-resolution CMA-MESO (Mesoscale Weather Numerical Forecast System of China Meteorological Administration) in this study. The results showed that the GIIRS WV radiance assimilation could improve the model WV analysis, which in turn adjusted the distributions of hydrometeors (radar composite reflectivities) and wind field, and finally improved the precipitation forecast. Additionally, although barely any GIIRS observations were assimilated over the cloudy area, the precipitation forecast errors of "21 center dot 7" extreme rainstorm events could be reduced by improving the structure of atmospheric circulations through the assimilation of neighboring data around Henan, especially over the upstream region. With the GIIRS WV data assimilation, the location error of maximum 24-h accumulated precipitation forecasts decreased from 128.48 km to 28.97 km (improved by 77.45%) for the cold start at 0000 UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) on 19 July 2021, and it was also reduced by about 60.52% for the warm start experiment at 0600 UTC on 19 July 2021. In addition, the GIIRS assimilation experiment showed an extraordinarily heavy rainfall area (above 250 mm/24 h) around Zhengzhou station, which did not appear in the control experiment, and was closer to the observed extreme precipitation. This study demonstrates the potential value of geostationary hyperspectral infrared sounders data assimilation in extreme weather early warning and forecasting.

TI  - Dynamics of Spatiotemporal Variation of Groundwater Arsenic Due to Salt-Leaching Irrigation and Saline-Alkali Land
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the link between the evolution of salt-leaching irrigation, saline-alkali land, and groundwater arsenic (As) is essential to prevent groundwater arsenic pollution and implement appropriate soil salinization control projects. The objectives of our study were to explore the spatiotemporal correlation of saline-alkali land and salt-leaching irrigation with groundwater As in the Hetao Plain. Therefore, groundwater As concentrations during Period I (2006-2010) and Period II (2016-2020) were collected by historical data and chemical measurements. Salt-leaching irrigation area and saline-alkali land area in Period I and Period II were extracted through remote sensing data. With the increase of the salt-leaching irrigation area level (SLIAL) and saline-alkali land area level (SALAL), the variation trend in groundwater As concentration slightly fluctuated, with an increase in the SLIAL at the low SALAL, which may be because short-term flooding may not considerably enhance As mobilization. Lower groundwater As concentrations appeared in regions with higher SLIAL and lower SALAL. A larger saline-alkali land area (higher SALAL) increased the groundwater As concentration. The path analysis model confirmed that salt-leaching irrigation may increase groundwater salinity to affect groundwater As levels and to decrease the saline-alkali land area. From Periods I to II, the difference in path analysis results may imply that the decrease in the saline-alkali land area may have influenced As mobilization due to competitive adsorption caused by the increase in total dissolved solids (TDS) in groundwater. Our results provide new insights for the impacts of saline-alkali land and salt-leaching irrigation both on groundwater As concentration and the geochemical processes of As enrichment in arid and semi-arid areas with more serious salinization.

TI  - Fire Severity in Reburns Depends on Vegetation Type in Arizona and New Mexico, USA
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - After more than a century of low fire activity in the western United States, wildfires are now becoming more common. Reburns, which are areas burned in two or more fires, are also increasing. How fires interact over time is of interest ecologically as well as for management. Wildfires may act as fuel treatments, reducing subsequent fire severity, or they may increase subsequent fire severity by leaving high fuel loads behind. Our goal was to assess whether previous wildfire severity influenced subsequent fire severity across vegetation types and over time in the Southwest U.S. using remotely sensed fire severity data in 2275 fires that burned between 1984 and 2019. Points that reburned tended to be those that burned with lower severity initially. Shrublands burned predominantly at moderate to high severity in initial fires and in reburns. Pinyon-juniper-oak systems burned with mixed severity, and fire severity was consistent from fire to fire. In ponderosa pine and aspen-mixed conifer, fire severity tended to decrease with each fire. Initial and subsequent fire severity was lower in points that reburned after a short interval. These remotely sensed observations of reburn severity need verification through field work to understand specific effects caused by reburns in different ecosystems. However, in ponderosa pine and aspen-mixed conifer forests, it may be beneficial to consider wildfires as fuel treatments and work to maintain the fuel reduction effects they have on forested ecosystems.

TI  - A Study on the Difference of LULC Classification Results Based on Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat 9 enhances the radiation resolution of the operational land imager from the 12 bits of Landsat 8 to 14 bits. The higher radiation resolution improves the sensitivity of the sensor to detect many subtler differences, especially in the case of dense forests or water. However, it remains unclear whether the difference in radiation resolution between Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 actually affects the classification results of water and tree species. Accordingly, the spectral reflectance and vegetation indices were extracted in this study, based on Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 images. Then, the classification models of land use and land cover (LULC) and tree species were developed by using a gradient tree boosting algorithm. Subsequently, the results were analyzed to further investigate how the differences in radiation resolution affect the classification results of LULC and tree species. It is shown that the LULC classification results of Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 are relatively favorable in most cases. However, the LULC classification results are relatively poor in test areas with a lower classification accuracy of water. Further analysis, in the case of test areas with poor classification results, indicates that there are significant differences in the water classification results between the two datasets. In other words, Landsat 9 produces better water classification results than Landsat 8 in most test areas. However, a temperature close to zero may lead to inverse water classification results. In addition, it indicates that the difference in forest classification results between the two datasets is small, but the results of forest tree species classification based on Landsat 9 are superior to those based on Landsat 8, with an improvement in overall accuracy of 6.01%. The results demonstrate that the difference in radiation resolution between Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 has little impact on the results of LULC classification in most cases. Nevertheless, in the case of some test areas, Landsat 9 is better suited for enhancing the classification accuracy of water and tree species.

TI  - Study of Sea Surface Geophysical Parameter Changes Due to Internal Solitary Waves Using a Sentinel-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a high-resolution Sentinel-3 synthetic aperture radar altimeter is used to observe ISWs in the Sulu Sea. Based on the advantages of the simultaneous observation of Sentinel-3 OLCI and SRAL, the changes in sigma(0), SWH, and SSHA caused by the ISWs are quantitatively analyzed. The results show that sigma(0) decreases and then increases after being modulated by the ISWs in the altimeter operation direction; SWH shows a large change; and the change trend of SSHA is the same as that of sigma(0). Because of the angle between the propagation direction of the ISWs and the SRAL trajectory, the actual position corresponding to the peak power in the waveform detects the ISWs before the nadir, at which time sigma(0) is already modulated by ISWs, resulting in the deviation of sigma(0). In addition, the sea surface roughness within the SRAL footprint in this case is no longer uniform, which violates the assumption of retracking and leads to the incorrect estimation of geophysical parameters such as SWH and SSHA. With a view to correcting these errors, the effect of ISWs on the retracker must therefore be considered and the model for waveform modified accordingly.

TI  - Vegetation Landscape Changes and Driving Factors of Typical Karst Region in the Anthropocene
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation degeneration has become a serious ecological problem for karst regions in the Anthropocene. According to the deficiency of long serial and high-resolution analysis of karst vegetation, this paper reconstructed the variation of vegetation landscape changes from 1987 to 2020 in a typical karst region of China. Using Landsat time series data, the dynamic changes and driving factors of natural karst vegetation were identified at the landscape scale. On the premise of considering the time-lag effect, the main climatic factors that influence vegetation growth were presented at the interannual timescale. Then, the approach of residual analysis was adopted to distinguish the dominant factors affecting vegetation growth. Results of trend analysis revealed that 21.5% of the forestland showed an overall significant decline in vegetation growth, while only 1.5% showed an increase in vegetation growth during the study period. Precipitation and radiation were the dominant meteorological factors influencing vegetation at the interannual timescale, as opposed to temperature. More than 70% of the natural vegetation growth was dominated by climatic factors. The area percentage of negative human impact has increased gradually since 2009 and reached 18.5% in 2020, indicating the currently serious situation of vegetation protection; fortunately, in recent years, human disturbances on vegetation have been mitigated in karst areas with the promotion of ecological conservation and restoration projects.

TI  - Study on the Elimination Method of Wind Field Influence in Retrieving a Sea Surface Current Field
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - An along-the-track interferometric synthetic aperture radar (ATI-SAR) system can estimate the radial velocity of a moving target on the ground and on a sea surface current. This acquires the interference phase by combining two composite SAR images obtained by two antennas spatially separated along the direction of movement of the platform. The key to retrieving the sea surface current is to remove the interference of sea surface waves, wind-generated current, and Bragg phase velocity in the interference Doppler velocity. Previous methods removed the surface waves, Bragg phase velocity, and other interferences based on externally-assisted wind fields (e.g., ECMWF), using the M4S or other models. However, the wind fields obtained from ECMWF and other external information are often average results of a large temporal and spatial scale, while the images obtained from SAR are high-resolution images of sea surface transients, which are quite different in time and space. This paper takes the SAR image data of the Gaofen-3 satellite as the research object and employs an SAR-based wind field retrieval method to obtain an SAR-observed transient wind field. Combined with the CDOP model, the interference of Doppler velocities, such as the sea surface wave, wind-generated current, and Bragg wave phase velocity, was calculated and subtracted from the Doppler velocity, to obtain the sea surface velocity result. Then, the current field measured by the shore-based HF radar was compared with that obtained by correcting the ATI Doppler velocity based on the SAR retrieved wind field and the ECMWF wind field. The comparison of results indicated that the wind field correction result based on the SAR retrieved wind field was closer to the current field measured by the shore-based HF radar than the wind field correction result based on the ECMWF wind field.

TI  - Validation of Cloud-Gap-Filled Snow Cover of MODIS Daily Cloud-Free Snow Cover Products on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate daily snow cover extent is a significant input for hydrological applications in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Although several Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily cloud-free snow cover products over the QTP are openly accessible, the cloud-gap-filled snow cover from these products has not yet been validated. This study assessed the accuracy of cloud-gap-filled snow cover from three open accessible MODIS daily products based on snow maps retrieved from Landsat TM images. The F1-score (FS) from daily cloud-free MODIS snow cover for the combined MOD10A1F and MYD10A1F (SC1) was 64.4%, which was 7.4% points and 5.3% points higher than the other two commonly used products (SC2 and SC3), respectively. The superior accuracies from SC1 were more evident in regions with altitudes lower than 5000 m, with a weighted average FS by the area percentage of the altitude regions of 58.3%, which was 6.9% points and 9.1% points higher than SC2 and SC3. The improved SC1 accuracies also indicated regional clustering characteristics with higher FS values compared to SC2 and SC3. The lower accuracies of cloud-gap-filled snow cover from SC2 and SC3 were mainly due to the limitation in determining snow cover based on the method of the inferred snow line and the overestimation of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) snow water equivalent (SWE). These results indicate that the temporal filter approach used in SC1 is a good solution to produce daily cloud-gap-filled snow cover data for the QTP because of its higher accuracy and simple computation. The findings can be helpful for the selection of cloud-removal algorithms for determining snow cover dynamics and phenological parameters on the QTP.

TI  - Exploring the geothermal potential of Peut Sagoe volcano using Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images
T2  - GEOTHERMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared remote sensing is an emerging technique to determine thermal anomalies in geothermal and volcanic areas. This study investigates the potential of thermal infrared imaging to observe geothermal prospecting and thermal activity in the Peut Sagoe volcano. The volcano has not been completely studied because it is located in a remote frontier area surrounded by dense rainforest and high terrain conditions. We used operational land imager (OLI)/thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) images of Landsat 8 acquired from 2014 to 2020 to get the actual hydrothermal mineral alteration, vegetation changes (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; NDVI), and land surface temperature (LST) of the volcanic areas, which correlate with geothermal characteristics, such as fumarole and warm ground that exist on the surface of Peut Sagoe volcano. The combination of band ratios such as 7/5, 5/4, and 6/7 effectively estimates the hydrothermal mineral alteration in the volcanic area, which is dominated by several minerals, such as clay, iron oxide, and OH/H2O-, SO4-, and CO-bearing minerals. Result analyses of low NDVI and high LST values are related to the vegetation changes and thermal status of the crater area, the top of the volcano, and the warm ground on the western side of the mountain. These identities demonstrate the geothermal potential of the Peut Sagoe volcano. The LST data of OLI/TIRS images indicate increased thermal activity of the volcano from 22-26 degrees C in 2014 to 30-35 degrees C in 2017. However, the temperature of the volcano relatively decreased to 25 degrees C in 2015 and 2020. In order to reduce the solar effects, the LST data from Landsat were also validated with ASTER data using a combination of night and daytime images. The results show a pattern of high thermal anomalies from 2014 - 2020 in several areas suspected of having geothermal manifestations, such as craters and hot springs, the distribution of these anomalies corresponds to LST in Landsat 8 data. Moreover, NDVI values at the potential geothermal location also reduced in 2014 and 2017 due to an increasing underground volcanic activity. Results revealed that remote sense imagery is an effective approach to identifying the geothermal potential and monitoring the thermal status of volcanos in frontier areas.

TI  - Assessing Spatial-Temporal Changes in Monetary Values of Urban Ecosystem Services through Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reckless urbanization in developing regions is leading to the deterioration of the urban environment. The ensuing impacts can place a burden on urban ecology, urban infrastructure, and residents. This scenario requires a combination of avoidance measures and a detailed assessment of the ecological sustainability of the city. While monetary assessments are certainly conceivable, in this study, the contributions of urban environmental infrastructure are weighed financially. Semi-planned (Jhang) and planned (Faisalabad) urban settlements provided the context for this survey. The study uses the Benefit Transfer Method (BTM) to assess changes in the monetary value of urban ecosystem services (UES) from remote sensing data. This finding suggests that urbanization in Pakistan is devouring productive ecological land in urban areas. The assessment shows that between 1989 and 2019, the agricultural area in Faisalabad shrank (-17.38%), and the built-up area increased (16.05%). Likewise, in Jhang City, the built-up area (4.44%) and wasteland (3.10%) swelled. However, during this period (1989-2019), the proportion of agricultural land in Jhang City decreased (-8.93%). As a result, prime areas of UES are falling back into low-return areas. It also found that provisioning ecosystem services (PES) accounted for a significant portion (68.12%) of the UES produced in Faisalabad and Jhang (69.72%), respectively. In contrast, Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES) contributed the smallest share of UES in Faisalabad (1.63%) and Jhang (1.65%). However, the remaining two services, regulatory and support services, made significant contributions. The assessment shows the role of incoherence, inconsistency, resource constraints, and neglect in compromising the urban environmental integrity of these cities. This situation requires a comprehensive assessment and coordinated effort. For this, it is feasible and useful to combine socioeconomic information with land cover data through computerized equipment.

TI  - Classification of Aquaculture Waters through Remote Sensing on the Basis of a Time-Series Water Index
T2  - Journal of Coastal Research
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatial distribution information on aquaculture is crucial for scientific aquaculture management, postdisaster evaluation, and water environment protection. At present, large-scale aquaculture areas can be quickly and accurately monitored using remote-sensing technology. However, most previous studies gave importance only to extracting aquaculture areas and ignored the classification of aquiculture types. Although several researchers classified aquaculture modes, the waters in aquaculture areas were unclassified. Moreover, classification of the aquaculture target is usually performed on a single remote-sensing image, which lacks time-series information. To examine existing issues, the current study selected the coastal marine aquaculture areas in the southern Lvushunkou District of Dalian. First, a normalized difference aquaculture water index (NDAWI) was constructed on the basis of the measured data through a spectral feature analysis. Second, NDAWI was extracted from Sentinel-2 images to construct a time-series data set, and the random forest classification method was applied to classify kelp and wakame aquaculture waters. Last, the experimental outcomes of the NDAWI data set were compared with those of other time-series data sets. Results showed that the overall accuracy of the NDAWI time-series data set was 92.11%, which showed an improvement of 7.68%, 17.66%, 4.50%, and 11.50% compared with the values for normalized difference chlorophyll index, normalized difference vegetation index, and greenness component of tasseled cap transformation data sets and single-phase images, respectively. The NDAWI time-series data set constructed in this study exhibited a dramatically improved classification accuracy compared with other time-series data sets. It has a high application value for identifying relevant aquaculture areas.

TI  - An Operational Atmospheric Correction Framework for Multi-Source Medium-High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface reflectance (LSR) data form the basis of quantitatively remotely sensed applications. For accurate LSR retrieval, atmospheric correction has been investigated by many researchers and implemented in typical processing systems, including common atmospheric correction software for various types of datasets and automatic operating systems for application to certain individual data sources. In recent years, China has launched multiple medium-high-resolution satellites but has not provided standard LSR products partly because of the lack of an appropriate operational system. In this paper, a multi-source remote sensing LSR product system for medium- and high-resolution data is proposed, called the "Operational Atmospheric Correction Framework for multi-source Medium-high-resolution Remote Sensing data of China" (ACFrC). The AC algorithm, processing flow, and design of the multi-source LSR system were described in detail. A practical atmospheric correction algorithm was proposed specially for data in only the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) bands. The entire processing chain was divided into modules for multi-source data ingestion, apparent reflectance calculation, cloud and water identification, atmospheric correction, and standard LSR product generation. To date, most types of multi-source data have been tested using the ACFrC system, with reasonable results being obtained. From the preliminary results, the 313 scenes of LSR products from the GaoFen-2 (GF-2) satellite over China for the period from 2015 to 2018 were cross-compared with Landsat-8 LSR acquired on the same day, showing an overall uncertainty less than 0.112 x LSR + 0.0112. Further, the ACFrC data processing efficiency was found to be suitable for automatic operation. System improvement is ongoing and future refinements will include online cloud parallel computing functionality and services, more robust algorithms, and other radiometric processing functions.

TI  - Performance Analysis of the Temperature and Humidity Profiles Retrieval for FY-3D/MWTHS in Arctic Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The special geographical location of the polar regions increases the difficulty of modeling surface emissivity, thus the physical retrieval algorithms of the temperature and humidity profiles for microwave radiometers mainly focus on the regions between 60 degrees S and 60 degrees N. In this paper, the deep neural networks (DNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models are first implemented to retrieve atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles in real time from FY-3D/MWHTS in Arctic regions and are compared with the physical retrieval algorithm. The hyperparameters of the machine learning models are determined using the grid search and 10-fold cross-validation. Results show that, compared with the physical retrieval algorithm, the retrieval accuracies of the atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles of the DNN and LSTM models in June 2021 are higher over sea ice, and the maximum retrieval accuracies are improved by about 3.5 K and 42%. Over land, the retrieval accuracies of the atmospheric temperature profiles for the DNN and LSTM models in June 2021 are improved by about 5 K. The retrieved humidity results for these two models are not compared with the physical retrieval algorithm, which fails for the humidity profile retrieval over land. In addition, the retrieval results of the DNN-based and LSTM-based models using the independent validation data in February, April, and September are also evaluated over different surface types. The RMSEs of the retrieved temperature profiles for the two models are within 4 K, except for the near-surface, and the humidity profiles are within 25%, except for in February. The temperature profiles in September and the humidity profiles in February are somewhat reduced compared to other months because of the highly variable emissivity properties in autumn and winter. Overall results show that the machine learning method can well-evaluate the retrieval capability of FY-3D/MWHTS of the atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles in Arctic regions.

TI  - Co- and Postseismic Deformation of the 2020 Mw 6.3 Nima (Tibet, China) Earthquake Revealed by InSAR Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 22 July 2020, an Mw 6.3 earthquake occurred in Nima County, central Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. We used the synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) technique with Sentinel-1 images to retrieve the line of sight (LOS) coseismic deformation fields which indicate that the maximum surface displacement reached similar to 30 cm. We then processed a series of interferograms spanning one year after the Nima earthquake with the Small Baseline Subset Interferometric SAR (SBAS-InSAR) technique. The maximum cumulative postseismic LOS surface displacement reached similar to 8 cm and approximately followed a logarithmic function over time. The inversion of the fault geometry and co-and afterslip distribution shows that the epicenter location was (33.18 degrees N, 86.88 degrees F) at a depth of 7.4 km, and the causative fault had an N29.1 degrees E strike and 50.2 degrees dip. The most coseismic slip was concentrated at depths between 3 to 12 km with a peak value of 2.0 m at 7.4 km, whilst most afterslips were concentrated at depths between 0 to 12 km with a peak value of 0.2 m at 5 km. The postseismic moment energy was about 5.04 x 10(17) N.m 308 days after the event, which was approximately 13.8% of the coseismic moment energy. By analyzing the contribution of afterslip and poroelastic rebound to postseismic deformation, it was concluded that afterslip was the main early postseismic deformation mechanism. Future attention should be paid to the northern segment of the West Yibug Caka fault and East Yibug Caka fault.

TI  - Multisource Remote Sensing Data-Based Flood Monitoring and Crop Damage Assessment: A Case Study on the 20 July 2021 Extraordinary Rainfall Event in Henan, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 20 July 2021, an extraordinary rainfall event occurred in Henan Province, China, resulting in heavy waterlogging, flooding, and hundreds of fatalities and causing considerable property damage. Because the damaged region was a major grain-producing region of China, assessing crop food production losses following this event is very important. Because the crop rotation production system is utilized in the region to accommodate two crops per year, it is very valuable to accurately identify the types of crops affected by the event and to assess the crop production losses separately; however, the results obtained using these methods are still inadequate. In this study, we used China's first commercial synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data source, named Hisea-1, together with other open-source and widely used remote sensing data (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel 2), to monitor this catastrophic flood. Both the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and Sentinel-1 dual-polarized water index (SDWI) were calculated, and an unsupervised classification (k-means) method was adopted for rapid water body extraction. Based on time-series datasets synthesized from multiple sources, we obtained four flooding characteristics, including the flooded area, flood duration, and start and end times of flooding. Then, according to these characteristics, we conducted a more precise analysis of the damages to flooded farmlands. We used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to obtain normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series data for the disaster year and normal years and overlaid the flooded areas to extract the effects of flooding on crop species. According to the statistics from previous years, we calculated the areas and types of damaged crops and the yield reduction amounts. Our results showed that (1) the study area endured two floods in July and September of 2021; (2) the maximum areas affected by these two flooding events were 380.2 km(2) and 215.6 km(2), respectively; (3) the floods significantly affected winter wheat and summer grain (maize or soybean), affecting areas of 106.4 km(2) and 263.3 km(2), respectively; and (4) the crop production reductions in the affected area were 18,708 t for winter wheat and 160,000 t for maize or soybean. These findings indicate that the temporal-dimension information, as opposed to the traditional use of the affected area and the yield per unit area when estimating food losses, is very important for accurately estimating damaged crop types and yield reductions. Time-series remote sensing data, especially SAR remote sensing data, which have the advantage of penetrating clouds and rain, play an important role in remotely sensed disaster monitoring. Hisea-1 data, with a high spatial resolution and first flood-monitoring capabilities, show their value in this study and have the potential for increased usage in further studies, such as urban flooding research. As such, the approach proposed herein is worth expanding to other applications, such as studies of water resource management and lake/wetland hydrological changes.

TI  - Distribution Characteristics and Influencing Factors of Rural Settlements in Metropolitan Fringe Area: A Case Study of Nanjing, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Rural settlement is the core content of rural geography research. Exploring the spatial distribution characteristics and influencing factors of rural settlements can provide reference for the optimization of rural settlements. This paper selected Nanjing as a typical case, based on remote sensing image, using R statistics, kernel density analysis, hot spot detection analysis and semi variogram function; the paper analyzed the spatial, scale and morphological distribution characteristics of rural settlements; and preliminarily analyzed the influencing factors of rural settlements distribution in the metropolitan fringe area. The results showed that: (1) The spatial distribution of rural settlements generally presented a "multi-core" center, and a spatial distribution trend of stepwise decline from the core to the periphery, showing a typical "core-edge" structure. (2) There was a significant spatial difference in the scale distribution of rural settlements, which was characterized by a gradual decrease in the scale of rural settlements with the increase in the distance from the central urban area. (3) The morphological distribution of rural settlements showed spatial differentiation, and the morphological types of settlements mainly included strip, arcbelt, cluster and scatter. (4) The distribution of rural settlements was affected by such factors as terrain, river system, traffic, economic and social development, cultural and policy. The distribution of rural settlements had the location orientation of "low altitude, water affinity and road affinity". The increase in agricultural population, rural economic development, cultural and policy factors played an important role in the distribution of rural settlements in the metropolitan fringe area.

TI  - Rice and Greenhouse Identification in Plateau Areas Incorporating Sentinel-1/2 Optical and Radar Remote Sensing Data from Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Affected by geographical location and climatic conditions, crop classification in the Yunnan Plateau of China is greatly restricted by the low utilization rate of annual optical data, complex crop planting structure, and broken cultivated land. This paper combines monthly Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data with Sentinel-1 radar data to minimize cloud interference to conduct crop classification for plateau areas. However, pixel classification will inevitably produce a "different spectrum of the same object, foreign objects in the same spectrum". A principal component feature synthesis method is developed for multi-source remote sensing data (PCA-MR) to improve classification accuracy. In order to compare and analyze the classification effect of PCA-MR combined with multi-source remote sensing data, we constructed 11 classification scenarios using the Google Earth Engine platform and random forest algorithm (RF). The results show that: (1) the classification accuracy is 79.98% by using Sentinel-1 data and 91.18% when using Sentinel-2 data. When integrating Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data, the accuracy is 92.31%. By analyzing the influence of texture features on classification under different feature combinations, it was found that optical texture features affected the recognition accuracy of rice to a lesser extent. (2) The errors will be reduced if the PCA-MR feature is involved in the classification, and the classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient are improved to 93.47% and 0.92, respectively.

TI  - Analysis and Research on Temporal and Spatial Variation of Color Steel Tile Roof of Munyaka Region in Kenya, Africa
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Africa, the distribution of color steel tile roof (CSTR) can reflect the living standard of residents, and the analysis of its temporal and spatial changes can reflect the local changes in local living conditions. It is helpful to analyze the change of the local economic level. By using the satellite remote sensing image processing method to obtain the temporal and spatial change characteristics of CSTR and to analyze the changes in residents' living conditions in Munyaka, Eldoret, Kenya, Africa, the model of multifeature decision tree method (DTM) extraction was established. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Building Index (NDBI) were used to remove farmland from the difference of the CSTR. The Normalized Difference Surface Index (NCSI) was constructed, and the texture features were analyzed to eliminate wasteland and bare land, respectively. The research results show that the Kappa coefficient is 0.9223, and the user precision and mapping precision are 97.79% and 91.10%, respectively. At the same time, combined with the Erdoret municipal road project, the changes of CSTR before and after the project in 2016-2020 are studied. Compared the area change of CSTR in 2016-2018 with that in 2018-2020, the annual growth rate before the construction of the municipal road project is about 3.47%. After the completion of the project, the annual growth rate is 7.29%, more than twice the rate before the construction. This method can realize the dynamic monitoring of CSTR, reflect the changes of the residents' living environment in the region, help analyze the improvement of poverty in Africa, and help understand the changes of African economic conditions.

TI  - Granular Content Distribution for IoT Remote Sensing Data Supporting Privacy Preservation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Facilitated by the Internet of Things (IoT) and diverse IoT devices, remote sensing data are evolving into the multimedia era with an expanding data scale. Massive remote sensing data are collected by IoT devices to monitor environments and human activities. Because IoT devices are involved in the data collection, there are probably private data contained in the collected remote sensing data, such as the device owner information and the precise location. Therefore, when data analysts, researchers, and other stakeholders require remote sensing data from numerous IoT devices for different analyses and investigations, how to distribute massive remote sensing data efficiently and regulate different people to view different parts of the distributed remote sensing data is a challenge to be addressed. Many general solutions rely on granular access control for content distribution but do not consider the low computational efficiency caused by the huge file size of the remote sensing data or certain IoT devices only have a constrained computational performance. Therefore, we propose a new granular content distribution scheme, which is more lightweight and practical for the distribution of multimedia remote sensing data with the consideration of the large data size to avoid complicated operations to the data. Furthermore, a dual data integrity check (hash summary and watermark) designed in our scheme can detect tampering or forgery from encrypted remote sensing data before decrypting it and validate it again after decryption. The security analyses and experimental results manifest that our new scheme can maintain high computational efficiency and block tampering and forgery during the granular content distribution for IoT remote sensing data.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Differentiation of Ecosystem Service Value and Its Drivers in the Jiangsu Coastal Zone, Eastern China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing the spatial and temporal evolution of ecosystem service value (ESV) and the driving mechanisms of spatial differentiation are fundamental to exploring the sustainable development of regional ecosystems. This article selected a coastal region in southeastern China with rapid economic development as the study object. Based on the five land-use remote sensing data sets from 2000 to 2019, the benefit transfer method was used to evaluate the ESV in the coastal zone of Jiangsu Province, revealing the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of ESV more accurately. Meanwhile, using the panel data regression model delved into the driving mechanisms of ESV spatial heterogeneity. The results showed the following: (1) There was a marked change in land use types from 2000 to 2019, with significant reductions in cropland and water areas and continued urban land expansion. The overall ESV in the study area exhibited a downward trend (8.41%), with regulation and support services being its core functions. (2) The ESV distribution had a distinct spatial differentiation, with hotspots mainly located near the coastal zone and cold spots in towns and surrounding areas. (3) There were considerable differences in the degree of impact of each influencing factor on different types of ESVs. On the whole, land use intensity had the most significant impact and was the first driver, followed by climate change and socioeconomic factors. The findings indicate that future ecosystem management decision-making should involve the conservation and intensive use of land resources and guide human livelihood and production activities toward ESV preservation and appreciation.

TI  - Sea Surface Salinity Inversion Model for Changjiang Estuary and Adjoining Sea Area with SMAP and MODIS Data Based on Machine Learning and Preliminary Application
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface salinity (SSS) is one of the most important basic parameters for studying the oceanographic processes and is of great significance in identifying oceanic currents. However, for a long time, the salinity observation in the estuary and coastal waters has not been well resolved due to the technology limitation. In this study, the SSS inversion models for the Changjiang Estuary and the adjacent sea waters were established based on machine learning methods, using SMAP (Soil Moisture Active and Passive) salinity data combined with the specific bands and bands ratios of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The performance of the three machine learning methods (Random Forest, Particle Swarm Optimization Support Vector Regression (PSO-SVR) and Automatic Machine Learning (TPOT)) are compared with accuracy verification by the in-situ measured SSS. Random Forest is proven to be effective for the SSS inversion in flood season, whereas TPOP performs the best for the dry season. The machine learning-based models effectively solve the problem of insufficient time span of SSS observation from salinity satellites. At the same time, an empirical algorithm was established for the SSS inversion for the sea areas with low salinity (<30 psu) where the machine learning based model fails with great errors. The average deviation of the complex SSS inversion models is -0.86 psu, validated with Copernicus Global Ocean Reanalysis Data. The long term series SSS dataset of March and August from 2003 to 2020 was then constructed to observe the salinity distribution characteristics of the flood season and the dry season, respectively. It is indicated that the distribution pattern of CDW can be divided into three categories: northeast-oriented expansion pattern, multi direction isotropic expansion pattern, and a turn pattern of which CDW shows changing direction, namely the northeast-southeast expansion pattern. The pattern of CDW expansion is indicated to be the comprehensive effect of the interaction of different currents. In addition, it is noteworthy that CDW shows increasing expansion with decreasing SSS in the front plume, especially in the flood season. This study not only gives a feasible solution for effective SSS observation, but also provides a dataset of basic oceanographic parameters for studying the coastal biogeochemical processes, evolution of land-sea interaction, and changing trend of material and energy transport by the CDW in the west Pacific boundary.

TI  - Adversarial Patch Attack on Multi-Scale Object Detection for UAV Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although deep learning has received extensive attention and achieved excellent performance in various scenarios, it suffers from adversarial examples to some extent. In particular, physical attack poses a greater threat than digital attack. However, existing research has paid less attention to the physical attack of object detection in UAV remote sensing images (RSIs). In this work, we carefully analyze the universal adversarial patch attack for multi-scale objects in the field of remote sensing. There are two challenges faced by an adversarial attack in RSIs. On one hand, the number of objects in remote sensing images is more than that of natural images. Therefore, it is difficult for an adversarial patch to show an adversarial effect on all objects when attacking a detector of RSIs. On the other hand, the wide height range of the photography platform causes the size of objects to vary a great deal, which presents challenges for the generation of universal adversarial perturbation for multi-scale objects. To this end, we propose an adversarial attack method of object detection for remote sensing data. One of the key ideas of the proposed method is the novel optimization of the adversarial patch. We aim to attack as many objects as possible by formulating a joint optimization problem. Furthermore, we raise the scale factor to generate a universal adversarial patch that adapts to multi-scale objects, which ensures that the adversarial patch is valid for multi-scale objects in the real world. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method against state-of-the-art methods on YOLO-v3 and YOLO-v5. In addition, we also validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world applications.

TI  - Spatial Effects of Landscape Patterns of Urban Patches with Different Vegetation Fractions on Urban Thermal Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The landscape patterns of urban green spaces have been proven to be important factors that affect urban thermal environments. However, the spatial effect of the landscape patterns of urban patches with different vegetation densities on land surface temperature (LST) has not been investigated in detail. In this study, the built-up area of Xuzhou City was taken as the study region, and the four phases of Landsat 8 images and their corresponding ground observations from 2014 to 2020 were selected as the basic data. Normalized spectral mixture analysis and an improved mono-window algorithm were used to invert the vegetation component fraction (VF) and LST maps of the study area, respectively, and the surface patches were classified into five levels according to the VF values, from low to high. Four landscape-level and five class-level metrics were then selected to represent the landscape characteristics of each VF-level patch. The tested values of 60 and 780 m were regarded as the best grain size and spatial extent, respectively, in the calculation of all landscape metrics of ALL VF-level patches (VFLM) using the moving-window method. The results of bivariate Moran's I for VFLM and LST showed the following: (1) for landscape-level metrics, only the Shannon diversity index and patch diversity have substantial negative spatial correlations with LST (with average |Moran's I| < 0.2), indicating that the types of VF levels and the number of patches exert weak negative effects on the thermal environment for a certain area; (2) for class-level metrics such as percentage of landscape, patch cohesion index, largest patch index, landscape shape index, and aggregation index, only the class-level metrics of sub-high VF (LV4) and extreme-high (LV5) VF levels patches have significant negative spatial correlations with LST (with high Moran's I value, and high-high and low-high distributions in local indications of spatial association cluster maps), indicating that only the patches of high VF levels can effectively alleviate LST and that patch proportion, natural connectivity degree, predominance degree, shape complexity, and aggregation degree are important landscape factors for regulating the thermal environment. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regression were applied to determine the impact weights of the class-level VFLMs of LV4 and LV5 patches on LST, which revealed the contributions of these landscape metrics to mitigating the urban heat island effect (UHI). These results signify the importance of and differences in the spatial patterns of various VF-level patches for UHI regulation; these patterns can provide new perspectives and references for urban green space planning and climate management.

TI  - Total Phosphorus and Nitrogen Dynamics and Influencing Factors in Dongting Lake Using Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) reflect the state of eutrophication. However, traditional point-based water quality monitoring methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and insufficient to estimate and assess water quality at a large scale. In this paper, we constructed machine learning models for TP and TN inversion using measured data and satellite imagery band reflectance, and verified it by in situ data. Atmospheric correction was performed on the Landsat Top of Atmosphere (TOP) data by removing the effect of the adjacency effect and correcting differences between Landsat sensors. Then, using the established model, the TP and TN patterns in Dongting Lake with a spatial resolution of 30 m from 1996 to 2021 were derived for the first time. The annual and monthly spatio-temporal variation characteristics of TP and TN in Dongting Lake were investigated in details, and the influences of hydrometeorological elements on water quality variations were analyzed. The results show that the established empirical model can accurately estimate TP with coefficient (R-2) >= 0.70, root mean square error (RMSE) <= 0.057 mg/L, mean relative error (MRE) <= 0.23 and TN with R-2 >= 0.73, RMSE <= 0.48 mg/L and MRE <= 0.20. From 1996 to 2021, TP in Dongting Lake showed a downward trend and TN showed an upward trend, while the summer value was much higher than the other seasons. Furthermore, the influencing factors on TP and TN variations were investigated and discussed. Between 1996 and 2003, the main contributors to the change of water quality in Dongting Lake were external inputs such as water level and flow. The significant changes in water quantity and sediment characteristics following the operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in 2003 also had an impact on the water quality in Dongting Lake.

TI  - Agricultural Productive Carrying Capacity Improve and Water Optimal Allocation under Uncertainty Based on Remote Sensing Data in Lancang County, Southwest China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Through the reasonable calculation of water resources, evaluating the irrigation carrying capacity of farmland under the constraints of water resources is crucial for optimizing the spatial distribution of agricultural production and ecology and rationally adjusting the scale of agricultural production. This paper proposes an optimization framework based on Type 2 fuzzy chance-constrained programming (T2FCCP) to solve the problem of regional water resources optimal allocation and evaluation of farmland irrigation carrying capacity under uncertain conditions. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework, this paper conducts a case study on Lancang County, Puer City, Yunnan Province. Methods, such as watershed harmony evaluation method, remote sensing data, and shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), are applied and integrated into the proposed optimization framework to systematically deal with uncertainties in water resource systems and agricultural systems. The results include the costs and benefits of regional water and soil resources systems, water resources optimal allocation, and crop planting structure results under different SSPs in Lancang County, Puer City. The results also show that the total cost under T2FCCP is about 5% lower than that under fuzzy chance-constrained programming (FCCP) and about 17% lower than that under chance-constrained programming (CCP). By 2025, the water resources carrying capacity of different tributaries in Lancang County, Puer City will increase, and based on the evaluation results of agricultural production irrigation carrying capacity, suggestions are given to ensure agricultural production carrying capacity.

TI  - Discrimination of Oceanic Whitecaps Derived by Sea Surface Wind Using Sentinel-2 MSI Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oceanic whitecaps, as a manifestation of the wind-wave breaking process and the medium of air-sea exchange, play an important role in sea surface research. The observational data of oceanic whitecap coverage are generally in situ photographs or videos. The use of spaceborne optical sensors to capture oceanic whitecaps could provide more spatial distribution and dynamic marine environment information. In this study, more than 100 Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) images and corresponding synchronous buoy wind speed data were collected to investigate oceanic whitecaps. A curvature image processing method was employed to successfully identify oceanic whitecaps in MSI images and the whitecap coverage was estimated based on the whitecap recognition results. We established a power-law model of MSI-estimated whitecap coverage (W) and whitecap number density with buoy-measured wind speed at a height of 10 m above the sea surface (U-10). In addition, the differences between the MSI-derived model and in situ measurement-derived models which are mainly caused by the scale effect of optical remote sensing, are discussed. The whitecap-wind model demonstrates that MSI images can improve the quantification of sea surface wind speed with high spatial resolution. MSI images were used to estimate regional high-spatial resolution (4 km) wind speeds, and the merged results (0.25 degrees) were verified with the hourly wind products of the fifth generation European ECMWF (Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5). Moreover, the influence of sunglint on whitecap recognition and whitecap coverage was also analyzed. The reflectance of whitecap-affected pixels in MSI images increased obviously with wind speed compared with background seawater in weak sunglint reflection area. These results indicated that the parameters of oceanic whitecaps derived from high-spatial resolution optical images can be used to estimate wind speed and provide a new approach for monitoring marine dynamic environments in the future.

TI  - Eco-water diversion project is not a simply measure to improve the ecological environment
T2  - GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Heihe River is the second longest inland river in China, which is one of the most important inland river basins in the northwest area. The effect of drought on ecological environment can be exacerbated by climate change. Eco-water diversion project was implemented since 2000 to solve the increasingly serious problem of ecological environment deterioration in the lower reaches of Heihe River Basin. In order to reveal whether the eco-water diversion project solve the ecological environment deterioration thoroughly, the change of hydrology and vegetation were investigated and compared by using the remote sensing data, field surveys, monitoring and statistics data. Our results showed that the soil water content, groundwater level and vegetation coverage increased after eco-water diversion, especially in 0-20cm, the value increased 30.05%, which results vegetation restoration in some area. However, the seasonal distribution of eco-water diversion is extremely uneven, 70% of the runoff is mainly concentrated in January to March, and September to October. Water was seriously insufficient in the critical water demand period of plants such as germination and fruit period due to river cutout. Moreover, some areas were degraded due to salinization. In addition, the extreme change of soil water is not conducive to plant growth, but will increase the waste of water resources due to the increasing of ineffective surface evaporation. It is difficult to improve the quantity of discharged water in the upper reaches of Heihe River, so the distribution time and mode is very important for stable and healthy development of vegetation in the downstream. Therefore, eco-water diversion project is not a simply measure to improve the ecological environment. We suggested that hydrological processes should be consistent with ecological processes in the lower reaches of Heihe River, otherwise, the most important significance of eco-water diversion project will be lost. Exploring this will be helpful in formulate scientific and reasonable water dispatching scheme, achieve water resources allocation and water demand matching, improve ecological benefits.

TI  - A Deep Learning Method Based on Two-Stage CNN Framework for Recognition of Chinese Reservoirs with Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of effective and comprehensive methods for mapping and monitoring reservoirs is essential for the utilization of water resources and flood control. Remote sensing has the great advantages of broad spatial coverage and regular revisit to meet the demand of large-scale and long-term tasks of earth observation. Although there already exist some methods for coarse-grained identification of reservoirs at region-level in remote sensing images, it remains a challenge to recognize and localize reservoirs accurately with insufficiency of object details and samples annotated. This study focuses on the fine-grained identification and location of reservoirs with a two-stage CNN framework method, which is comprised of a coarse classification between aquatic and land areas of image patches and a fine detection of reservoirs in aquatic patches with precise geographical coordinates. Moreover, a NIR RCNN detection network is proposed to make use of the multi-spectral characteristics of Sentinel-2 images. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we construct a reservoir and dam dataset of 36 Sentinel-2 images which are sampled in various provinces across China and annotated at the instance level by manual work. The experimental results in the test set show that the two-stage CNN method achieves an average recall of 80.83% nationwide, and the comparison between reservoirs recognized by the proposed model and those provided by the China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research verifies that the model reaches a recall of about 90%. Both the indicator evaluation and visualization of identification results have shown the applicability of the proposed method to reservoir recognition in remote sensing images. Being the first attempt to make a fine-grained identification of reservoirs at the instance level, the two-stage CNN framework, which can automatically identify and localize reservoirs in remote sensing images precisely, shows the prospect to be a useful tool for large-scale and long-term reservoir monitoring.

TI  - Improvement of the SWAT Model for Snowmelt Runoff Simulation in Seasonal Snowmelt Area Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The SWAT model has been widely used to simulate snowmelt runoff in cold regions thanks to its ability of representing the effects of snowmelt and permafrost on runoff generation and confluence. However, a core method used in the SWAT model, the temperature index method, assumes both the dates for maximum and minimum snowmelt factors and the snowmelt temperature threshold, which leads to inaccuracies in simulating snowmelt runoff in seasonal snowmelt regions. In this paper, we present the development and application of an improved temperature index method for SWAT (SWAT+) in simulating the daily snowmelt runoff in a seasonal snowmelt area of Northeast China. The improvements include the introduction of total radiation to the temperature index method, modification of the snowmelt factor seasonal variation formula, and changing the snowmelt temperature threshold according to the snow depth derived from passive microwave remote sensing data and temperature in the seasonal snowmelt area. Further, the SWAT+ model is applied to study climate change impact on future snowmelt runoff (2025-2054) under the climate change scenarios including SSP2.6, SSP4.5, and SSP8.5. Much improved snowmelt runoff simulation is obtained as a result, supported by several metrics, such as MAE, RE, RMSE, R-2, and NSE for both the calibration and validation. Compared with the baseline period (1980-2019), the March-April ensemble average snowmelt runoff is shown to decrease under the SSP2.6, SSP4.5, and SSP8.5 scenario during 2025-2054. This study provides a valuable insight into the efficient development and utilization of spring water resources in seasonal snowmelt areas.

TI  - Mapping of Level I Axillary Lymph Nodes in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer: Optimal Target Delineation and Treatment Techniques for Breast and Level I Axilla Irradiation
T2  - PRACTICAL RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To map the locations of level I axilla (Ax-L1) lymph nodes (LNs), evaluate the clinical target volume (CTV) coverage defined by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Breast Cancer Atlas, and assess the optimal techniques for whole-breast and Ax-L1 irradiation (WBI + Ax-L1).Methods and Materials: We identified 76 patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer with 1 to 4 positive LNs confirmed by axillary dissection. The locations of 116 involved Ax-L1 LNs on diagnostic computed tomography (CT) were mapped onto simulated CT images of a standard patient. Ax-L1 LN coverage by the RTOG atlas was evaluated, and a modified Ax-L1 CTV with better coverage was proposed. Treatment plans were designed for WBI + Ax-L1 with high tangential simplified intensity modulated radiation therapy (HT-sIMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and for WBI + RTOG Ax-L1 with VMAT with a prescription dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions, respectively. The differences in dosimetric parameters were compared.Results: The RTOG Atlas missed 29.3% of LNs. Modification by extending 1 cm caudal and 0.5 cm anterior to the RTOG-defined CTV borders allowed the modified Ax-L1 CTV to encompass 90.5% of LNs. All plans met the required prescription dose to WBI and Ax-L1. The mean dose and the V20 and V5 (percentage volume receiving 20 Gy and 5 Gy) of the ipsilateral lung were 11.7 Gy, 23.0%, and 38.1% for HT-sIMRT WBI + Ax-L1 and 8.9 Gy, 16.4%, and 32.5% for VMAT WBI + Ax-L1 plans, respectively. The mean heart doses in the left-sided plans were 3.2 Gy and 3.0 Gy, respectively. The V30 of the humeral head and the minimum dose to the axillary-lateral thoracic vessel junction were 2.0% versus 1.8% and 45.5 Gy versus 45.7 Gy for VMAT WBI + Ax-L1 and VMAT WBI + RTOG Ax-L1 plans, respectively.Conclusions: A modified Ax-L1 CTV with expansion of the caudal and anterior borders might provide better coverage. Compared with HT-sIMRT WBI + Ax-L1, VMAT WBI + Ax-L1 provided an adequate dose to the Ax-L1 while decreasing the doses to most normal tissues. Coverage of the modified Ax-L1 did not increase the dose to organs at risk compared with coverage of RTOG Ax-L1.

TI  - Analyzing Sensitive Aerosol Regimes and Active Geolocations of Aerosol Effects on Deep Convective Clouds over the Global Oceans by Using Long-Term Operational Satellite Observations
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term satellite climate data records of aerosol and cloud along with meteorological reanalysis data have been used to study the aerosol effects on deep convective clouds (DCCs) over the global oceans from a climatology perspective. Our focus is on identifying sensitive aerosol regimes and active geolocations of the aerosol effects on DCCs by using statistical analyses on long-term averaged aerosol and cloud variables. We found the aerosol effect tends to manifest relatively easily on the long-term mean values of observed cloud microphysical variables (e.g., cloud particle size and ice water amount) compared to observed cloud macrophysical variables (e.g., cloud cover and cloud top height). An increase of aerosol loading tends to increase DCC particle size and ice water amount in the tropical convergence zones but decrease them in the subtropical subsidence regions. The aerosol effect on the cloud microphysical variables is also likely to manifest over the northwestern Pacific Ocean and central and eastern subtropical Pacific Ocean. The aerosol effect manifested on the microphysical cloud variables may also propagate to cloud cover but weakly to cloud top height since the latter is more susceptible to the influence of cloud dynamical and thermodynamic processes. Our results, based on the long-term averaged operational satellite observation, are valuable for the evaluation and improvement of aerosol-cloud interactions in global climate models.

TI  - Comprehensive Validation and Calibration of MODIS PWV over Mainland China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although ground-based precipitable water vapor (PWV) can be obtained with a high temporal resolution and spatial resolution of tens of kilometers in an urban area using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observation, it remains fairly sparse in the vast regions over Mainland China. Satellite-derived PWV has a high spatial resolution, thereby enabling the accurate investigation of regional climate change. However, understanding the quality of satellite-derived PWV products is a prerequisite before use, which has become the focus of this study. PWV products, namely, MOD05_L2 and MYD05_L2, over the entirety of Mainland China derived from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra and Aqua satellites are validated over the period 2000-2017 using multiple sources, including GNSS, radiosonde, AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET), and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-Interim (ECMWF). The accuracy of MODIS PWV products is less than 4.3 mm over the entirety of Mainland China; however, it varies in four areas of South China (SC), North China (NC), Northwest China (NWC), and Tibetan Plateau (TP), separately with values ranging from 3 mm to 6 mm. A linear fit model is applied to calibrate the MODIS PWV products, and the accuracies of the corrected PWV from MODIS infrared (IR) and near-infrared (NIR) products have been improved by approximately 7.5% and 50.6%, respectively. The MODIS PWV is compared and calibrated in the four areas, and the improved accuracies vary widely. The root mean square error (RMSE) of IR PWV is approximately less than 4 mm over China except for the SC area with a value of approximately 5.3 mm after calibration, whereas the values of NIR PWV are approximately 2 mm over the entirety of Mainland China, except for the TP area, with a value of approximately 2.6 mm. The MODIS NIR PWV performs better than that of IR PWV data in most areas of Mainland China regardless of whether with calibration. The validation and calibration of MODIS water vapor products over Mainland China also indicate their capability to investigate the seasonal and annual variations as well as long-term trend changes in water vapor in China.

AB  - Nitrogen(N) is one of the most important elements for crop growth and yield formation. Insufficient or excessive application of N fertilizers can limit crop yield and quality, especially as excessive N fertilizers can damage the environment and proper fertilizer application is essential for agricultural production. Efficient monitoring of crop N content is the basis of precise fertilizer management, and therefore to increase crop yields and improve crop quality. Remote sensing has gradually replaced traditional destructive methods such as field surveys and laboratory testing for crop N diagnosis. With the rapid advancement of remote sensing, a review on crop N monitoring is badly in need of better summary and discussion. The purpose of this study was to identify current research trends and key issues related to N monitoring. It begins with a comprehensive statistical analysis of the literature on remote sensing monitoring of N in rice and wheat over the past 20 years. The study then elucidates the physiological mechanisms and spectral response characteristics of remote sensing monitoring of canopy N. The following section summarizes the techniques and methods applied in remote sensing monitoring of canopy N from three aspects: remote sensing platforms for N monitoring; correlation between remotely sensed data and N status; and the retrieval methods of N status. The influential factors of N retrieval were then discussed with detailed classification. However, there remain challenges and problems that need to be addressed in the future studies, including the fusion of multisource data from different platforms, and the uncertainty of canopy N inversion in the presence of background factors. The newly developed hybrid model integrates the flexibility of machine learning with the mechanism of physical models. It could be problem solving, which has the advantages of processing multi-source data and reducing the interference of confounding factors. It could be the future development direction of crop N inversion with both high precision and universality.

TI  - Rapid Glacier Shrinkage in the Gongga Mountains in the Last 27 Years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are an important part of the cryosphere and important reservoirs of fresh water on Earth. Glaciers in the Gongga Mountains, located in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, have been experiencing dramatic changes and substantially shrinking over the past two decades. We analyzed the glacier change over the Gongga Mountains using the Landsat data from 1994 to 2021 (interval of 4 or 5 years), with Gaofen-1 (GF-1) data to evaluate the uncertainty. The glacier shrinkage under different terrain conditions, including altitudes, slope, and slope direction, was further explored. Finally, we evaluated the response of glacier shrinkage to climate change using precipitation and temperature data for nearly 30 years. Results show that the glaciers in the Gongga Mountains are experiencing an accelerating ablation, with a glacier area of similar to 240 km(2) in 1994 and similar to 212 km(2) in 2021 (an average annual shrinkage rate of 1.04 km(2)/a). The shrinkage mainly occurs in areas with altitudes of 5000-5300 m and a slope of 30-40 degrees. Moreover, the shrinkage is strongly related to the recent warming of the climate, with the warming rate being 0.19 degrees C/10a, while precipitation remains almost constant during 1978-2019. The results provide a scientific basis for water resources management, ecological environmental protection, and natural disaster protection in southeast Tibet for decision making.

TI  - Exploring the Influencing Factors in Identifying Soil Texture Classes Using Multitemporal Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil texture is a key soil property driving physical, chemical, biological, and hydrological processes in soils. The rapid development of remote sensing techniques shows great potential for mapping soil properties. This study highlights the effectiveness of multitemporal remote sensing data in identifying soil textural class by using retrieved vegetation properties as proxies of soil properties. The impacts of sensors, modeling resolutions, and modeling techniques on the accuracy of soil texture classification were explored. Multitemporal Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images were individually acquired at the same time periods. Three satellite-based experiments with different inputs, i.e., Landsat-8 data, Sentinel-2 data (excluding red-edge parameters), and Sentinel-2 data (including red-edge parameters) were conducted. Modeling was carried out at three spatial resolutions (10, 30, 60 m) using five machine-learning (ML) methods: random forest, support vector machine, gradient-boosting decision tree, categorical boosting, and super learner that combined the four former classifiers based on the stacking concept. In addition, a novel SHapley Addictive Explanation (SHAP) technique was introduced to explain the outputs of the ML model. The results showed that the sensors, modeling resolutions, and modeling techniques significantly affected the prediction accuracy. The models using Sentinel-2 data with red-edge parameters performed consistently best. The models usually gave better results at fine (10 m) and medium (30 m) modeling resolutions than at a coarse (60 m) resolution. The super learner provided higher accuracies than other modeling techniques and gave the highest values of overall accuracy (0.8429), kappa (0.7611), precision (0.8378), recall rate (0.8393), and F1-score (0.8398) at 30 m with Sentinel-2 data involving red-edge parameters. The SHAP technique quantified the contribution of each variable for different soil textural classes, revealing the critical roles of red-edge parameters in separating loamy soils. This study provides comprehensive insights into the effective modeling of soil properties on various scales using multitemporal optical images.

TI  - UltraHi-PrNet: An Ultra-High Precision Deep Learning Network for Dense Multi-Scale Target Detection in SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-scale target detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is one of the key techniques of SAR image interpretation, which is widely used in national defense and security. However, multi-scale targets include several types. For example, targets with similar-scale, large-scale, and ultra-large-scale differences coexist in SAR images. In particular, it is difficult for existing target detection methods to detect both ultra-large-scale targets and ultra-small-scale targets in SAR images, resulting in poor detection results for these two types of targets. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an ultra-high precision deep learning network (UltraHi-PrNet) to detect dense multi-scale targets. Firstly, a novel scale transfer layer is constructed to transfer the features of targets of different scales from bottom networks to top networks, ensuring that the features of ultra-small-scale, small-scale, and medium-scale targets in SAR images can be extracted more easily. Then, a novel scale expansion layer is constructed to increase the range of the receptive field of feature extraction without increasing the feature resolution, ensuring that the features of large-scale and ultra-large-scale targets in SAR images can be extracted more easily. Next, the scale expansion layers with different expansion rates are densely connected to different stages of the backbone network, and the features of the target with ultra-large-scale differences are extracted. Finally, the classification and regression of targets were achieved based on Faster R-CNN. Based on the SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD), AIR-SARShip-1.0, high-resolution SAR ship detection dataset-2.0 (high-resolution SSDD-2.0), the SAR-ship-dataset, and the Gaofen-3 airport dataset, the experimental results showed that this method can detect similar-scale, large-scale, and ultra-large-scale targets more easily. At the same time, compared with other advanced SAR target detection methods, the proposed method can achieve higher accuracy.

TI  - Retrieval of High-Resolution Vegetation Optical Depth from Sentinel-1 Data over a Grassland Region in the Heihe River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation optical depth (VOD), as a microwave-based estimate of vegetation water and biomass content, is increasingly used to study the impact of global climate and environmental changes on vegetation. However, current global operational VOD products have a coarse spatial resolution (similar to 25 km), which limits their use for agriculture management and vegetation dynamics monitoring at regional scales (1-5 km). This study aims to retrieve high-resolution VOD from the C-band Sentinel-1 backscatter data over a grassland of the Heihe River Basin in northwestern China. The proposed approach used an analytical solution of a simplified Water Cloud Model (WCM), constrained by given soil moisture estimates, to invert VOD over grassland with 1 km spatial resolution during the 2018-2020 period. Our results showed that the VOD estimates exhibited large spatial variability and strong seasonal variations. Furthermore, the dynamics of VOD estimates agreed well with optical vegetation indices, i.e., the mean temporal correlations with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and leaf area index (LAI) were 0.76, 0.75, and 0.75, respectively, suggesting that the VOD retrievals could precisely capture the dynamics of grassland.

TI  - Urban Flood-Related Remote Sensing: Research Trends, Gaps and Opportunities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a result of urbanization and climate change, urban areas are increasingly vulnerable to flooding, which can have devastating effects on the loss of life and property. Remote sensing technology can provide practical help for urban flood disaster management. This research presents a review of urban flood-related remote sensing to identify research trends and gaps, and reveal new research opportunities. Based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), the systematic literature search resulted in 347 documents classified as geography, disaster management application, and remote sensing data utilization. The main results include 1. most of the studies are located in high-income countries and territories and inland areas; 2. remote sensing for observing the environment was more popular than observing the building; 3. the most often applied disaster management activities were vulnerability assessment and risk modeling (mitigation) and rapid damage assessment (response); 4. DEM is often applied to simulate urban floods as software inputs. We suggest that future research directions include 1. coastal urban study areas in non-high-income countries/territories to help vulnerable populations; 2. understudied disaster management activities, which often need to observe the buildings in more urban areas; 3. data standardization will facilitate integration with international standard methods for assessing urban floods.

TI  - Reconstruction of land surface temperature under cloudy conditions from Landsat 8 data using annual temperature cycle model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter in the processes of energy exchange and water cycle between the land surface and the atmosphere. The impact of cloud cover leads to spatially incomplete of thermal infrared (TIR)-based LST products, which seriously hinders the applications of LST products in various fields. Several methods have been developed to reconstruct LST under cloudy conditions in previous studies, but there is a lack of an effective method for the reconstruction of cloudy LST at the spatial resolution of Landsat pixel (30 m). In this study, a novel method was proposed to reconstruct LST under cloudy conditions from Landsat 8 data. The LST reconstruction method includes four main steps: (1) identification of cloud-free, cloud-shadow, cloudobscured, and cloud-covered pixels by integrating the Fmask method with a cloud-shape matching method; (2) calculation of annual temperature cycle (ATC)-based reference LST by fitting an ATC model to all available Landsat 8 LST product during 2013-2020; (3) estimation of LST residual from spatially adjacent similar pixels; and (4) estimation of reconstructed LST in terms of the sum of ATC-based reference LST and LST residual. The performance of the LST reconstruction method was evaluated using Landsat 8 LST images under clear-sky conditions as reference data. The root mean squared error (RMSE) between reconstructed LST and Landsat 8 reference LST ranges from 0.9 K to 2.5 K. The LST reconstruction method was further applied to reconstruct actual Landsat 8 LST images under cloudy conditions. Compared with original Landsat 8 LST images, the spatial distribution of reconstructed LST images is more complete. The pattern of reconstructed LST images reflects the spatial variability of LST well. The accuracy of the LST reconstruction method was validated against in situ LST measurements at six SURFRAD (Surface Radiation Budget Network) sites. The overall bias and RMSE between reconstructed LST and in situ LST at all sites are approximately -0.3 K and 3.5 K, respectively. The LST reconstruction method has great potentials to improve the applications of Landsat LST product in urban thermal environment monitoring and crop water stress monitoring.

TI  - Globally Scalable Approach to Estimate Net Ecosystem Exchange Based on Remote Sensing, Meteorological Data, and Direct Measurements of Eddy Covariance Sites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite a rapid development of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) for carbon removal in recent years, the methods for evaluating NBS still have certain gaps. We propose an approach based on a combination of remote sensing data and meteorological variables to reconstruct the spatiotemporal variation of net ecosystem exchange from eddy-covariance stations. A Lagrangian particle dispersion model was used for upscaling satellite images and flux towers. We trained data-driven models based on kernel methods separately for each selected land-cover class. The results suggest that the proposed approach to quantifying carbon exchange on a medium-to-large scale by blending eddy covariance flux data with moderate resolution satellite and weather data provides a set of key advantages over previously deployed methods: (1) scalability, achieved via the validation design based on a separate set of eddy covariance stations; (2) high spatial and temporal resolution thanks to the use of Landsat imagery; and (3) robust and accurate predictions due to improved data quality control, advanced machine learning techniques, and rigorous validation. The machine learning models yielded high cross-validation results. Stratification that uses separate Fluxnet stations for each fold of validation ensures that the models are accurate across the area covered by the Fluxnet sites. Overall, we present here a globally scaled technology for the land sector based on high resolution remote sensing imagery, meteorological variables, and direct carbon flux measurements of eddy covariance flux stations.

AB  - Land use land cover (LULC) change can modify local, regional, and global socio-environmental systems. Globally, much LULC change study is aimed at deforestation and urbanization with less focus on other LULC categories like grasslands and savannas. Here, we focus our LULC change study on southwestern Kenya, a topographically varying region of forest, grassland, and crop-land. This study leveraged existing remotely sensed Landsat landcover data to evaluate uncer-tainty of LULC classification, quantify the nature and magnitude of changes, and illustrate the role of topography (slope and elevation) in determining the spatiotemporal characteristics of the landscape between 1990 and 2018. We also analyzed landscape metrics of fragmentation and dominance at the class-level and employed Kruskal-Wallis tests to examine the characteristics and statistical significance of the changes. We obtained an overall classification accuracy of 86% and establish that over the 28-year period, cropland increased by 22.5% and became less frag-mented, forest decreased by 6.6% and became less fragmented, while grassland decreased by 16% and became more fragmented. Results showed statistical difference (p < 0.05) in LULC change among different topographic classes. Our results indicate that deforestation in the region has slowed in the past decades, likely due to conservation efforts, but conversion of grassland to cropland has accelerated. Grasslands, including pastures, provide essential ecosystem services both to people and the environment and should not be overlooked in conservation initiatives.

TI  - Divergent foraging habitat preferences between summer-breeding and winter-breeding <i>Procellaria</i> petrels
T2  - IBIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Foraging niche specialization is thought to occur when different members of speciose communities divide resources in either time or space. Here we compared habitat preferences of the congeneric Grey Petrel Procellaria cinerea and White-chinned Petrel Procellaria aequinoctialis, tracked in the same calendar year using GPS loggers from Gough Island and Bird Island (South Georgia), respectively. We identified periods of active foraging and determined habitat characteristics using remote-sensing data. Although these highly pelagic species could potentially overlap at sea across large areas, they showed markedly different foraging preferences during their incubation periods, which are temporally offset because Grey Petrels breed during the austral winter. Grey Petrels foraged mostly in pelagic cold-water areas to the north-west of South Georgia, whereas White-chinned Petrels foraged almost exclusively in the warm, shallow waters of the Patagonian Shelf. Within each species, foraging habitat characteristics were highly consistent. Our results demonstrate the diversity of habitat preferences within genera, and provide further evidence that colony-specific information on habitat preference is crucial to identify important feeding areas for pelagic predators.

TI  - Monitoring of land use/land cover changes and its implications in the peri-urban areas using multi-temporal landsat satellite data: a case study of Guwahati city, Assam, India
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid population growth and urbanization in and around Guwahati city, the state capital of Assam have resulted in tremendous pressure on its limited land and civic infrastructures. Due to severe congestion and shortage of space, people are exploring peri-urban plain and hilly areas around the city and gradually expanding towards adjoining districts for settlement. Earlier studies focused mainly on Guwahati city only and neighboring districts, small and medium towns around the city, and adjacent Meghalaya state have received scant attention in urban policy research. This study evaluates land use land cover changes (LULC) from 1991 to 2021 within the GMDA area and encircling a 50 km buffer from the GMDA boundary. Landsat time series data were used to analyze land use and land cover changes. The result indicates the expansion in built-up areas with a net change of 2.27% from 1991 to 2021 within the 50 km buffer study area. The result indicates the loss of forest class and cultivated land with a net change percentage of 2.12 and 0.84% within the period of 30 years. Apart from the above, the study also reveals an increase in the built-up of 33.25% within the GMDA core area from 1991 to 2021. The impact of these LULC changes shows the expansion of the built-up area beyond the GMDA boundary in the eastern, western, and northwest direction and needs to be regulated for ensuring the planned growth of its outskirts and the surrounding region. Hence through adequate decentralized regional planning, the fast-expanding Guwahati city and its surrounding region can be managed.

TI  - Assessing the vulnerability of watersheds to environmental degradation in the lesser Himalayan region using satellite data and a series of models
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lesser Himalayan watersheds are vulnerable to environmental degradation due to their unstable lithology and anthropogenic pressure. A Gaula watershed was considered for the vulnerability analysis using satellite data, compound factor (CF) and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) based on Grey Relation Analysis (GRA) and Complex Proportion Assessment of Alternatives (COPRAS) models. For prioritzation, 29 variables (12 morphometric, 5 geologies, 6 soils, 5 land uses/land covers, and 1 slope) were selected and the MCDM methods were validated using indices of the percentage of change and intensity of change. A total of five sub-watersheds (SW) were delineated, SW2 reported highest drainage density (0.58). The sinuosity index of SW1, SW4, and SW5 have 1.33, 1.34, and 1.27, showing active tectonic activities. The COPRAS reported highest intensity of change (93.33), whereas GRA and CF reported percentage of changes were 86.66 and 80.0, respectively. Hence, these models are appropriate to investigate the interrelationships of different components.

TI  - Characteristics of shoreline changes around the South China Sea from 1980 to 2020
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most sensitive factors in the sea-land interaction zone, the shoreline is significantly influenced by natural processes and anthropogenic activities. Monitoring long-term shoreline changes offers a basis for the integrated management and protection of coastal zones. The spatiotemporal distribution and the utilization types of shorelines had changed a lot, along with the advancement of the socioeconomics of the countries around the South China Sea (SCS) since 1980. However, the changes in shoreline characteristics for a long time around the whole SCS under anthropogenic influence remain uncertain. Using Landsat and high-resolution satellite images, this study monitored the changes in the spatial location and type of shorelines around the SCS from 1980 to 2020. Additionally, the possible reasons for the shoreline changes around the SCS were analyzed. The results showed the following: 1) the length of shorelines around the SCS maintained growth, especially in the 1990s, which increased by 734.8 km, from 28,243.8 km (1990) to 28,978.6 km (2000). 2) The proportion of natural shorelines around the SCS decreased from 92.4% to 73.3% during the past 40 years. Bedrock and mangrove shorelines disappeared most sharply by 34.2% and 21.6%, respectively. The increase of artificial shorelines was mostly driven by the expansion of constructed and aquaculture dikes. 3) The spatial location changes of most artificial shorelines can be attributed to seaward advancement, with an average advancing speed of 7.98 m/year. Of the natural shorelines, 58.4% changed in terms of their location (30.4% advancement and 28.0% retreat). Most natural shorelines around the SCS were threatened by erosion, but the extent of which was largely determined by the shorelines' own stability, with less influence from the surrounding environment. Artificialization was the most prominent feature of shorelines around the SCS over the past 40 years, which was closely related to the original types of shorelines and the socioeconomic conditions of the area where they are located, and often accompanied by dramatic changes in shoreline morphology and spatial location. In addition, human interventions were not only the dominant factor in shoreline artificialization but also a major driver of natural shoreline protection.

TI  - Residential greenspace and childhood asthma: An intra-city study
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Interest in assessing the effects of exposure to greenspace on human health has been increasing due to rapid urbaniza-tion, and rising trends of physical inactivity and air pollution. However, findings on the link between greenspace and child respiratory health, especially asthma, are inconsistent. We investigated the association between greenspace sur-rounding residential addresses and asthma in children. A city-wide cross-sectional study was conducted, involving 16,605 children aged 3-12 years, in Shanghai, China. Data on asthma symptoms and covariates were collected from validated self-reported questionnaires. Residential greenspace was measured using satellite-derived normalized differ-ence vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). Information on ambient temperature and partic-ulate matter with dynamic diameter <1 mu m (PM1) and 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) was also collected from satellite data. Logistic regression models were performed to assess the associations of greenspace exposure with childhood asthma as well as the effect modification by covariates. The prevalence of current asthma in children was 4.8 % in this study. An in-terquartile range increase in mean NDVI from 2016 to 2018 was associated with decreased odds of asthma in 2019 at 500 m, and 250 m resolutions (0.82, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.74 to 0.93; and 0.82, 95 % CI: 0.72 to 0.94, re-spectively) after adjustment for covariates. The greenspace-asthma association was modified by ambient temperature and residential area. Sensitivity analyses using various models and EVI exposure showed the robustness of the results.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics of dissolved organic matter in the Mackenzie Delta, Canadian Arctic waters: Implications for ocean colour remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing air temperatures and associated permafrost thaw in Arctic river watersheds, such as the Mackenzie River catchment, are directly affecting the aquatic environment. As a consequence, the quantity and the quality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that is transported via the Mackenzie River into the Arctic Ocean is expected to change. Particularly in these remote permafrost regions of the Arctic, monitoring of terrigenous organic carbon fluxes is insufficient and knowledge of distribution and fate of organic carbon when released to the coastal waters is remarkably lacking. Despite its poorly evaluated performance in Arctic coastal waters, Satellite Ocean Colour Remote Sensing (SOCRS) remains a powerful tool to complement monitoring of land-ocean DOC fluxes, detect their trends, and help in understanding their propagation in the Arctic Ocean.In this study, we use in situ and SOCRS data to show the strong seasonal dynamics of the Mackenzie River plume and the spatial distribution of associated terrigenous DOC on the Beaufort Sea Shelf for the first time. Using a dataset collected during an extensive field campaign in 2019, the performance of three commonly-used atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms and two available colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) retrieval algorithms were evaluated using the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). Our results showed that in optically-complex Arctic coastal waters the Polymer AC algorithm performed the best. For the retrieval of CDOM, the gsmA algorithm (Mean Percentage Error (MPE) = 35.7%) showed slightly more consistent results compared to the ONNS algorithm (MPE = 37.9%). By merging our measurements with published datasets, the newly -established DOC-CDOM relationship for the Mackenzie-Beaufort Sea region allowed estimations of DOC con-centrations from SOCRS across the entire fluvial-marine transition zone with an MPE of 20.5%. Finally, we applied SOCRS with data from the Sentinel-3 OLCI sensor to illustrate the seasonal variation of DOC concen-trations in the surface waters of the Beaufort Sea on a large spatial scales and high frequency throughout the entire open water period. Highest DOC concentrations and largest lateral extent of the plume were observed in spring right after the Mackenzie River ice break-up indicating that the freshet was the main driver of plume propagation and DOC distribution on the shelf. Satellite-derived images of surface water DOC concentration placed the in situ observations into a larger temporal and spatial context and revealed a strong seasonal vari-ability in transport pathways of DOC in the Mackenzie-Beaufort Sea region.

TI  - The Christian Worldview Scale: An Emic Measure for Assessing a Comprehensive View of Life Within the Christian Tradition
T2  - SPIRITUALITY IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In this two-part study, we developed and tested an emic, insider Christian Worldview Scale (CWS) with separate online samples of Christian adults. To begin, we conducted a literature review of key writings from both the contemporary psychology literature (e.g., general, social/personality, clinical/counseling) and Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant theology to arrive at an ecumenical, operationalized definition of a Christian worldview. Next, with two online samples of Christian adults, we conducted exploratory (N = 536) and confirmatory (N = 274) factor analyses, leading to a 20-item CWS with five distinct dimensions (i.e., theology, epistemology, anthropology, axiology, teleology) and four items per dimension. Finally, we examined the internal consistency reliability and convergent, predictive, and incremental validity of the scale. Results revealed high-internal consistency reliability scores for all five subscales across both samples, and most subscales were strongly positively correlated with measures of beliefs and values, Christian orthodoxy, and spiritual maturity and weakly positively correlated with mental well-being and negatively correlated with depression, anxiety, and stress. To conclude, the clinical relevance of the scale is discussed.

TI  - Application of predictor variables to support regression kriging for the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon stocks in native temperate grasslands
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose As the main component of terrestrial carbon pool, soil organic carbon (SOC) is vital to soil fertility and biogeochemical cycle. Quantifying the spatial distribution of regional SOC stocks (SOCS) provides critical support for climate change and food security decisions. Our aim was to explore the optimal interpolation method to improve the accuracy of spatial prediction of SOCS in temperate grasslands. Materials and methods To support such research, we performed soil sampling to depths of 0 to 20 and 20 to 30 cm throughout the Hulun Buir grassland of Inner Mongolia. We compared prediction of the spatial patterns of SOCS using regression kriging (RK) and ordinary kriging (OK). We used topographic factors, climate variables, satellite data (the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI)), and soil texture as predictors in the RK method. Results and discussion SOCS was significantly positively correlated with precipitation, NDVI, topographic variables, and clay content, but negatively correlated with temperature and sand content. NDVI explained more than 40% of the SOCS spatial variation and was the dominant factor. Geostatistical analysis showed strong and moderate spatial dependence of SOCS in the 0-20- and 20-30-cm soil layers, respectively. The RK and OK soil pools to a depth of 30 cm were 607.28 and 559.46 Tg, respectively. Conclusion Compared with OK, the RK method improved the SOCS prediction accuracy by 20.4, 30.1, and 23.9% for soil depths of 0-20, 20-30, and 0-30 cm, respectively. Our findings suggest that OK may be acceptable where the environmental conditions are homogeneous, but that RK performs better in heterogeneous areas.

TI  - "Playing tourist" in a divided city
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM CITIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Purpose This study aims to investigate the social and affective impacts of inviting residents of a socially divided, post-war city to "play tourist" for a day, exploring their own backyards with a new intentionality and perspective. Design/methodology/approach This qualitative research within a transformative worldview uses a creative, place-based approach of role-playing based upon principles of participatory action research. Findings While each tour was unique, participants' insights reflected three common themes: shifts in observations and perceptions of place arising from the intentionality of the "tourist" lens, a sense of freedom created by the touristic research opportunity, and the varying abilities of tourism experiences to help build empathy or awareness in a post-conflict setting. Originality/value The inventive research approach allows for a unique examination of local tourism-styled explorations, a subject of growing interest that has largely been overlooked in literature, while paying special attention to ways in which a history of conflict may manifest in contemporary urban tourism experiences.

TI  - Pembrolizumab versus placebo as adjuvant therapy in resected stage IIB or IIC melanoma (KEYNOTE-716): distant metastasis-free survival results of a multicentre double-blind, randomised, phase 3 trial
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Patients with stage IIB or IIC melanoma who undergo surgery alone are at a substantial risk for disease recurrence. Adjuvant pembrolizumab significantly improved recurrence-free survival versus placebo in stage IIB or IIC melanoma in the first interim analysis of the KEYNOTE-716 trial. Here, we report results from the secondary endpoint of distant metastasis-free survival (prespecified third interim analysis), and recurrence-free survival with longer follow-up. Methods KEYNOTE-716 is a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover or rechallenge, randomised, phase 3 trial done at 160 academic medical centres and hospitals across 16 countries. Eligible patients were aged 12 years and older with newly-diagnosed, completely resected, and histologically confirmed stage IIB (T3b or T4a) or IIC (T4b) cutaneous melanoma; negative sentinel lymph node biopsy; and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 200 mg of pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 200 mg in paediatric patients) or placebo, both intravenously, every 3 weeks for 17 cycles (part 1) or until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Eligible patients with disease recurrence could receive further treatment with pembrolizumab in the part 2 crossover or rechallenge phase. Randomisation was done using an interactive response technology system and stratified by T category and paediatric status. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed recurrence-free survival (assessed here with longer follow-up), and we report the prespecified third interim analysis of distant metastasis-free survival (secondary endpoint). Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population (all patients who were randomly assigned, according to assigned group) and safety was assessed in all patients who were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of trial treatment, according to the treatment received. KEYNOTE-716 is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03553836, and has completed recruitment.Findings Between Sept 23, 2018, and Nov 4, 2020, 976 patients were randomly assigned to receive pembrolizumab (n=487) or placebo (n=489). At a median follow-up of 27.4 months (IQR 23.1-31.7), median distant metastasis -free survival was not reached (95% CI not reached [NR]-NR) in either group. Pembrolizumab significantly improved distant metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.47-0.88, p=0.0029) versus placebo. Median recurrence-free survival was 37.2 months (95% CI NR-NR) in the pembrolizumab group and not reached in the placebo group (95% CI NR-NR). The risk of recurrence remained lower with pembrolizumab versus placebo (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50-0.84). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were hypertension (16 [3%] of 483 patients in the pembrolizumab group vs 17 [4%] of 486 patients in the placebo group), diarrhoea (eight [2%] vs one [< 1%] ), rash (seven [1%] vs two [< 1%]), autoimmune hepatitis (seven [1%] vs two [< 1%]), and increased lipase (six [1%] vs eight [2%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 49 (10%) patients in the pembrolizumab group and 11 (2%) patients in the placebo group. No treatment-related deaths were reported.Interpretation Adjuvant pembrolizumab is an efficacious treatment option for resected stage IIB and IIC melanoma, with significant improvement in distant-metastasis free survival versus placebo and continued reduction in the risk of recurrence with an adverse event profile consistent with previous studies of pembrolizumab. The overall benefit- risk of pembrolizumab continues to be positive in the adjuvant setting. Copyright (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Investigation of the Vegetation Coverage Dynamics and the Frequent Occurrence of Dominant Species on Coral Islands in the Truong Sa Islands, Vietnam
T2  - BIOLOGY BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastline vegetation cover monitoring is critical for human survival because of plants are known as the most important dunes stabilizer. Evaluation of vegetation using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) was carried out in some areas of the Truong Sa Islands (Truong Sa island: A1; Nam Yet island: A2; Sinh Ton island: A3; Son Ca island: A4; Song Tu Tay island: A5). The study's primary goal was to analyze salt-tolerant plants based on a data field survey conducted between 2020-2022 using an analysis of Sentinel-2 images taken between 2016 and 2021. Most of the islands show an increase in vegetation cover. Overall, plant species have mostly grown on dunes and sandy soil: (1) Herbaceous plants are dominated by Ipomoea pes-caprae (L.) R.Br., Chromolaena odorata (L.) R.M. King and H. Rob.; (2) Shrubland communities are dominated by Poaceae, Asteraceae, Goodeniaceae families; (3) Group of woody plants are dominated by Heliotropium arboreum (Blanco) Mabb., Barringtonia asiatica (L.) Kurz., Calophyllum inophyllum L., Coccoloba uvifera (L.) L., Casuarina equisetifolia L., Terminalia catappa L., Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don, Scaevola taccada (Gaertn.) Roxb. Results have shown that the islands located in the northern latitudes have more diverse flora than the islands in the southern part. The size of these coral islands has expanded from 2016 to 2021, leading to the growth of vegetation coverage and biodiversity support for human and societal needs. This study provides important data to expand further studies to islands in different latitudes, actively supporting biodiversity management and protecting remote islands' soil and sand resources.

TI  - Seasonally-decomposed Sentinel-1 backscatter time-series are useful indicators of peatland wildfire vulnerability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands throughout the boreal forest are expected to experience changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration and temperature due to climate change. Correspondingly, changes in hydrologic regimes could lead to increased drought and occurrence of wildfire. Fire management agencies require information about near-real time wildfire vulnerability in boreal peatlands. Remote sensing tools (e.g., NDVI, NDII) used to monitor changing wildfire vulnerability focus on monitoring changes in vascular vegetation and are not necessarily applicable to moss -dominated peatlands. We use time series analysis of Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data to compare the trends in peatlands that have burned to unburned peatlands and show that the Theil-Sen slopes of seasonally decomposed SAR backscatter reflects prolonged drought conditions that can lead to burning. Seasonally decomposed Sentinel -2 NDVI and NDII were also tested but no statistical differences were found between burned and unburned peatlands. Overall, we found that 6 months prior to a wildfire the slope of seasonally decomposed Sentinel-1 VV SAR backscatter was significantly different in burned and unburned peatlands, and can be used to spatially identify fire vulnerability and identify fire-prone areas.

TI  - Estimating predation pressure in ecological studies: controlling bias imposed by using sentinel plasticine prey
T2  - ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel plasticine prey has been increasingly used to estimate predation pressure. The use of plasticine prey may, however, bias the results, as this method was originally designed to account for predation by organisms that can visually recognize the shapes and colors of their prey. To evaluate the limitations of using sentinel plasticine prey, we compared predator attack rates between real prey - dead and live mealworms, Tenebrio molitor L. (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) - and plasticine models in a monsoonal tropical rainforest of southeastern China. The attack rates by invertebrates were highest on dead prey followed by live prey and plasticine models, whereas the attack rates by vertebrates were lowest on dead prey, and did not differ between live prey and plasticine models. These results confirm that bias imposed by using the plasticine models is affected by the type of predators. In addition, we tested the validity and generality of the premise that predators can distinguish the shapes of plasticine model prey and preferentially attack a caterpillar-like shape over other shapes. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three independent experiments in China, Papua New Guinea, and Finland. In the two latter localities, predation rates on plasticine caterpillars were higher than on models of other shapes, whereas in China, these differences were not significant. Taken together, our study suggests that plasticine models may underestimate the predation by invertebrates to a greater extent than predation by vertebrates, and the preference of model shape by predators may be locality-specific, presumably due to differences in the composition of the predator community. We propose that predation be estimated on both live and plasticine prey in future studies to measure the potential bias imposed by using plasticine models and its variation among various habitats and predator groups.

TI  - Global validation and comparison of MODIS DT and POLDER-3 GRASP aerosol products over ocean
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the third generation of Polarization and Directionality of Earth's Reflectances (POLDER-3) are two types of sensors, which have their own advantages in sensor design. MODIS is a conventional multi-spectral imager with single-angle observations and a wide spectral range of surface reflection bands from blue to shortwave infrared, while POLDER-3 is a multi-angle polarization instrument with narrower spectral range from blue to shortwave near-infrared. It is highly anticipated to un-derstand the quantitative capability of these two sensors in aerosol retrievals. For this purpose, this study con-ducts a long-time series comparison and evaluation of over-ocean aerosol products from these two types of sensors during the period 2005-2013, corresponding to the entire lifetime of the POLDER-3 products. The MODIS aerosol products based on Dark Target (DT) algorithm and two POLDER-3 products based on General Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) "High Precision" (GRASP/HP) and "Models" (GRASP/Models) al-gorithm are adopted in this study. Two types of ground-based measurements from automatic Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data and shipborne Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) data are employed to validate four parameters common to both satellite products, including total Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), angstrom ngstro center dot m Exponent (AE), fine-mode AOD (AODF) and coarse-mode AOD (AODC). The overall validation results show GRASP/Models has similar performance with MODIS DT in total AOD products. This indicates that the multi-angle polarization observations of POLDER-3 can have the same advantages as the multi-spectral observations of MODIS in total AOD retrievals. Furthermore, the statistical parameters of the validation results based on AERONET data show that GRASP/Models is slightly better than MODIS DT. However, for the validation results using MAN data, it is interesting to find that MODIS DT is slightly better than GRASP/Models in all aspects. This may be due that the manual measurements of MAN can consciously avoid more cloud contamination. Meanwhile, it suggests that MODIS DT algorithm over ocean needs further improvements in cloud mask and quality control. In addition, from the validation results of both types of ground-based data, it shows that GRASP/HP significantly over-estimates AOD, but has better validation accuracy than GRASP/Models and MODIS DT in AE products, which implies that multi-angle polarization sensor has great potential in aerosol properties retrieval. For AODF and AODC, the statistical parameters of validation results for all three products show little difference. GRASP/HP is slightly better than GRASP/Models and MODIS DT in AODF products, while the AODC products of GRASP/ Models and MODIS DT show slightly superior to that of GRASP/HP. This may suggest that although the higher AE validation accuracy of GRASP/HP, the higher total AOD accuracy of GRASP/Models and MODIS DT still dominates the validation results of AODF and AODC. The results could contribute to the application of over -ocean aerosol products of these two satellite in climate research, as well as to the improvement of aerosol retrieval algorithms over ocean for instruments such as single viewing spectrometer and multi-angle polarimeter.

TI  - A hybrid learning model for efficient classification of Land Use and land change from satellite images
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - With Deep Learning (DL) outperforming previous Machine Learning (ML) techniques in classifying images, the remote sensing community has recently shown an increased interest in using these algorithms to classify Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) using multispectral and hyperspectral data. Land Use (LU) and Land Cover (LC) are two types of cartographic data that are used to develop smart cities and monitor the environment. LULC clas-sification can benefit greatly from successfully applying remote sensing Image Classification (IC) using high spatial resolution data. The acquisition of spatiotemporal data for LULC classification has been made more accessible because of recent improvements in spatial analysis and Deep Learning (DL) technology. Considering the quality of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in related Computer Vision (CV) tasks and the enormous volume of remotely sensed data accessible, DL methods appear to be particularly promising for modelling many remote sensing problems. However, there are several issues with ground-truth, resolution, and the nature of data that have a significant impact on categorization performance. We propose a Reversible Residual Network (RAVNet), a hybrid residual attention sensitive segmentation approach, to precisely categorize LULC in this study. The suggested network is based on the VNet model, which extracts relevant information by mixing low-level and high-level Feature Maps (FM). The attention-aware features change adaptively to the integration of residual modules. Our system was tested on the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) dataset, and the findings demonstrate that our architecture is competitive against other learning models.

TI  - Sustainable policies for air pollution reduction after COVID-19 pandemic: Lessons learnt from the impact of the different lockdown periods on air quality
T2  - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments imposed several mobility restrictions which can be used to evaluate their impact on air quality and generate better-targeted policies to improve it. Therefore, this study aimed to define sustainable mitigation measures to reduce air pollution based on quantifying the impacts of the restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic on air quality in Portugal. Thus, hourly concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, O-3, CO and SO2 were obtained from the Portuguese Air Quality Monitoring Network. Data was then divided into six periods (2020-2021) and compared with the corresponding historical periods (2015-2019). Furthermore, the satellite data of NO2, CO, and absorbing aerosol index (AAI) from the sentinel-5P TROPOMI was collected to complement the analysis conducted for the monitoring data. Overall, air quality improved in all study periods and areas, except in industrial sites. The satellite data corroborated the results herein achieved and thus validated the real effect of the measures adopted in the country during the pandemic on air quality. Sustainable policies to improve air quality could include remote (or hybrid) work whenever possible as a long-term measure and prohibition of travelling between municipalities when an extraordinary event of high air pollution is predicted or occurs. Other policies should be adopted for industrial areas. Given this, and as the restrictive mobility measures had a strong effect on reducing air pollution, the post-COVID era represents an opportunity for society to rethink future mobility and other emerging policies, that should favour softer and cleaner means of transportation.

TI  - "I Just Wanted Support": Examining How LDS Clergy May Effectively Minister to Sexual and Gender Minority Congregants
T2  - REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explored why members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) who identify as sexual or gender minorities (SGM) speak with clergy regarding their SGM identities, as well as what LDS SGMs find helpful and unhelpful in these conversations. A sample of 25 current or former LDS SGMs participated in semi-structured interviews, which were analyzed using thematic analysis. Participants reported six overarching reasons for talking with clergy, including church procedures, seeking guidance, seeking emotional comfort, seeking repentance, seeking openness, and other people's initiation. Participants reported several ways clergy were helpful, including empathic listening, openness, and affirmative spiritual care. Participants further reported several ways clergy were unhelpful, including punishing, lacking empathic listening, having a limited worldview, and pathologizing. Clergy may benefit from understanding why LDS SGMs are speaking with them, and from utilizing helpful approaches such as empathic listening skills in their ministering efforts.

TI  - Co-occurrence patterns and environmental factors associated with rapid onset of<i> Microcystis</i><i> aeruginosa</i> bloom in a tropical coastal lagoon
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The environmental factors contributing to the Microcystis aeruginosa bloom (hereafter referred to as Microcystis bloom) are still debatable as they vary with season and geographic settings. We examined the environmental factors that triggered Microcystis bloom outbreak in India's largest brackish water coastal lagoon, Chilika. The warmer water temperature (25.31-32.48 degrees C), higher dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) loading (10.15-13.53 mu mol L-1), strong P-limitation (N:P ratio 138.47-246.86), higher water transparency (46.62-73.38 cm), and low-salinity (5.45-9.15) exerted a strong positive influence on blooming process. During the bloom outbreak, M. aeruginosa proliferated, replaced diatoms, and constituted 70-88% of the total phytoplankton population. The abundances of M. aeruginosa increased from 0.89 x 104 cells L-1 in September to 1.85 x 104 cells L-1 in November and reduced drastically during bloom collapse (6.22 x 103 cells L-1) by the late November of year 2017. The decrease in M. aeruginosa during bloom collapse was associated with a decline in DIN loading (2.97 mu mol L-1) and N:P ratio (73.95). Sentinel-3 OLCI-based satellite monitoring corroborated the field observations showing Cyanophyta Index (CI) > 0.01 in September, indicative of intense bloom and CI < 0.0001 during late November, suggesting bloom collapse. The presence of M. aeruginosa altered the phytoplankton community composition. Furthermore, co-occurrence network indicated that bloom resulted in a less stable community with low diversity, inter-connectedness, and prominence of a negative association between phytoplankton taxa. Variance partitioning analysis revealed that TSM (16.63%), salinity (6.99%), DIN (5.21%), and transparency (5.15%) were the most influential environmental factors controlling the phytoplankton composition. This study provides new insight into the phytoplankton co-occurrences and combination of environmental factors triggering the rapid onset of Microcystis bloom and influencing the phytoplankton composition dynamics of a large coastal lagoon. These findings would be valuable for future bloom forecast modeling and aid in the management of the lagoon.

TI  - Land change modeler and CA-Markov chain analysis for land use land cover change using satellite data of Peshawar, Pakistan
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is a global phenomenon that caused many regions worldwide to face dramatic Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes associated with urban sprawl and significant consequences. This research aims to assess and predict the urban growth of Peshawar city as well as LULC with a Cellular-Automata-Markov-Chain (CA-Markov-Chain). LULC distributions were mapped using Landsat (5, 7, and 8) data from 1998, 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018. Long-term changes to the landscape were simulated using a CA-Markov model at 10-year intervals from 2018, 2028 and 2038. Finally, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were used to validate the models and LULC maps accuracies. Results indicate a substantial expansion in built-up area and vegetation class for Peshawar city replacing bare land. As a result of our research, the total built-up area was increased in 2018 was 272 km(2). Peshawar's vegetation cover has increased by 25.6% throughout the study period, especially 12.7% under the billion-tree project (from 2013 to 2018). According to CA-Markov Chain analysis, we can predict the growth of built-up area and vegetation area from 299.75 km(2) (23.71%) to 318.92 km(2) (25.23%) and 701.38 km(2) (55.48%) to 748.69 km(2) (59.23%) between 2028 and 2038, based on the development from 1998 to 2018. This study is very significant for the urban designing, urban development, policy makers and law enforcement departments.

TI  - Modelling past and future land use and land cover dynamics in the Nakambe River Basin, West Africa
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding land use and cover (LULC) dynamic is of great importance to sustainable development in Africa where deforestation is a common problem. This study aimed to assess the historical and future dynamics of LULC in the Nakambe River Basin. Landsat images were used to determine LULC dynamics for the years 1990, 2005 and 2020 using Random Forest classification system in Google Earth Engine while the predicted LULC of 2050 was simulated using the Markov Chain and Multi-Layer-Perceptron neural network in Land Change Modeler. The findings showed significant changes in LULC patterns. From 1990 to 2020, woodland and shrubland decreased by - 45% and - 68%, respectively, while water body, cropland and bare land/built-up increased by 233%, 51%, and 75%, correspondingly. From 2020 to 2050, the results revealed that under the Business-as-usual scenario, bare land/built-up and water bodies could continue to increase by 99% and 1%, respectively. However, cropland, shrubland, and woodland could decrease by - 32.61%, - 33.91%, and - 46.86%, respectively. Under the afforestation scenario, the contrary of Business-as-usual could occur. While woodland, shrubland, and cropland would increase by 22.24%, 51.57%, and 18.13%, correspondingly, between 2020 and 2050, the area covered by water bodies and bare land/built-up will decrease by - 6.16% and - 39.04%, respectively. The results of this research give an insight into past and future LULC dynamics in the Nakambe River Basin and suggest the need to strengthen the policies and actions for better land management in the region.

TI  - Political Psychological and Sociocultural Determinants of Compliance with COVID-19 Emergency Measures Among Waste Pickers in an Iranian Sub-urban Slum Community
T2  - JOURNAL OF PREVENTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, compliance with government regulations is a tremendous challenge in the effort to curb the viral transmission. The fact that specific communities and people across the world continue to ignore government regulations of COVID-19 is a crucial issue to address. Researchers sought to examine the political psychological and sociocultural determinants of adherence to COVID-19-related law and policy measures among waste pickers in a sub-urban slum community in Iran. A cross-sectional survey of 362 waste pickers from two municipalities in the countryside of Tehran, Iran, was conducted between January and May 2022. Multiple regression analysis was used to predict the significant difference between the direct or indirect effects of political psychological and sociocultural variables on compliance with COVID-19 emergency measures. Confidence intervals were estimated using the bootstrap method. The findings supported the proposed model. The results indicated that political ideology (beta = - 0.13, 95% CI - 0.29 to 0.02), individualism worldview (beta = - 0.14, 95% CI - 0.32 to 0.07), fatalism (beta = - 0.18, 95% CI - 0.40 to 0.04), health literacy (beta = 0.16, 95%CI - 0.05 to 0.37) and prosociality (beta = 0.09, 95%CI 0.03-0.13) exert an indirect effect on compliance with the COVID-19 emergency measures through both trust in government and trust in science and scientific community. This study has implications for authorities in ensuring adherence to governmental orders for COVID-19 outbreak. A democracy-based and human rights-based approach and a flexible framework for proceeding more equitable COVID-19 legal and government regulations is critical to an effective and acceptable health response to COVID-19. Instituting slum emergency planning committees, incorporating the informal providers into all pandemic response plans in every urban informal settlement and providing an immediate guarantee of payments to waste packers will be indispensable.

TI  - A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Touch Imprint Cytology and Frozen Section Biopsy and Their Comparison for Evaluation of Sentinel Lymph Node in Breast Cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction Evaluation of axillary lymph nodes after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer is mostly done by intra-operative frozen section biopsy (FSB) and/ or touch imprint cytology (TIC). In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we have compared the accuracy of the two modalities. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane electronic databases were searched for articles comparing TIC with FSB. Articles were assessed for methodological and reporting quality. The main summary measures were pooled sensitivity, pooled specificity, and diagnostic accuracy using bivariate generalized linear mixed models using random effects. Results Fourteen studies were included. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy for FSB were 78%, 100%, and 98.57%. For TIC, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were 74%, 98%, and 98.37%. For both methods, visual inspection of summary ROC curves and of forest plots did not show significant heterogeneity. Conclusion TIC showed comparable sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy to FSB and hence can be used as its substitute as a rapid and economical test for the detection of axillary lymph node metastasis during SLNB especially in low-resource settings.

TI  - Role and value of urban forests in carbon sequestration: review and assessment in Indian context
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The role of urban forests in carbon capture and sequestration has been reviewed in a global context. An interpretive analysis was carried out using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and allometric relationships in 5 cities of India, viz. Navi Mumbai, Nagpur, Bengaluru, Leh and Delhi, to evaluate the economic importance of urban green spaces in sequestrating carbon emissions and mitigating severe climatic impacts. NDVI maps were prepared using data from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 satellite sensors. Bengaluru showed highest carbon sequestration (141.83 MT), and carbon sequestration in the city of Leh was comparatively very low (1.51 MT) as it is a cold desert with a very low urban forest cover. The valuation of urban green spaces in the selected cities was done by using market price method (MPM), value transfer method (VTM), and social cost of carbon method (SCC). The carbon sequestration valuation ranged from 55 to 5164 million$ for estimation using MPM and from 69.69 to 6537.15 million $ for SCC, whereas for VTM it ranged from 1575.06 to 147,736.94 million INR. The SCC approach used for valuation showed the highest cost of CO2 sequestered, while the MPM provided with the lowest value for all the five cities. Highest carbon sequestration and valuation values were observed in Bengaluru followed by Delhi. This study also points to the need of developing region-specific allometric relationships for better accuracy in quantifying carbon sequestration potential and associated economic value of urban forests.

TI  - High spatiotemporal resolution estimation of AOD from Himawari-8 using an ensemble machine learning gap-filling method
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The data incompleteness of aerosol optical depth (AOD) products and their lack of availability in highly urbanized areas limit their great potential of application in air quality research. In this study, we developed an ensemble machine-learning approach that integrated random forest-based Space Interpolation Model (SIM) and deep neural network-based Time Interpolation Model (TIM) to achieve high spatiotemporal resolution dataset of AOD. The spatial interpolation model first filled the spatial gaps in the Level-2 Himawari-8 hourly AOD product in 0.05 degrees (similar to 5 km) spatial resolution, while the time interpolation model further improved the temporal resolution to 10 min on its basis. A full -coverage AOD dataset of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) in 2020 was obtained as a practical implementation. The validation against in-situ AOD observations from AERONET and SONET indicated that this new dataset was satisfactory (R = 0.80), and especially in spring and summer. Overall, our ensemble machine-learning model provided an effective scheme for reconstruction of AOD with high spatiotem-poral resolution of 0.05?? and 10 min, which may further advance the near-real-time monitoring of air-quality in urban areas.

TI  - Ground Deformation and Source Fault Model of the Mw 5.7 Xegar (Tibetan Plateau) 2020 Earthquake, Based on InSAR Observation
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An Mw 5.7 earthquake occurred in Xegar, Tingri Basin, Tibetan Plateau, on 20 March 2020. Determining the precise focal mechanism solution is helpful for understanding the seismogenic mechanism and the geodynamic process of this earthquake. Here, we used Sentinel-1A data to obtain line-of-sight coseismic deformation. Fault geometric parameters and coseismic slip distribution can be estimated with the Bayesian method and the steepest descent method, respectively. The inversions show that the strike of the seismogenic fault is similar to 330.0 degrees, with a dip angle of similar to 62.7 degrees. The main rupture zone covers an area of similar to 5 x 5 km(2). Only one slip asperity appears at a depth of 1.9-5.0 km, the maximum slip on the fault is 0.98 m at a depth of 3.26 km, with a centroid location of 87.40 degrees E, 28.66 degrees N, and the mean rake angle is similar to -104.6 degrees. The results reveal that this earthquake is dominated by normal faulting, and the derived seismic moment is similar to 3.23 x 10(17) Nm (Mw 5.6). Furthermore, it is found that the 2015 Mw 7.9 Gorkha earthquake played a key role in triggering the 2020 Mw 5.7 Xegar earthquake based on calculation of the coseismic and postseismic Coulomb failure stress with different viscosities and depths.

TI  - A tangata whenua (people of the land) approach to conceptualising Maori health and wellbeing
T2  - GLOBAL HEALTH PROMOTION
M3  - Article
AB  - From a Maori (Indigenous to New Zealand) perspective, health is not confined to the treatment of illness but also includes the philosophical concepts, structures and cultural practices which reinforce health and wellbeing. The ill-health of Maori is often the focus of health initiatives, particularly if there is an equity approach that centres on disparities between ethnic groups. However, an Indigenous approach prioritises health and wellbeing aspirations through strengthening self-determination, identity and connection with the environment. This article synthesises knowledge from Indigenous and Maori rights, matauranga (Maori ways of knowing) expressed in purakau (epistemological narratives), tikanga (Maori principles), te reo (Maori language) and lived experience to reflect a shared understanding of Maori health and wellbeing. Consideration is given to the status of Maori pre-colonisation, the ongoing impacts of colonisation, and Maori led responses to contemporary health issues. It is proposed that health for Maori, like many Indigenous peoples, should be informed by an enhanced understanding of Indigenous rights, an Indigenous worldview and notions of wellbeing. We argue that a tangata whenua (people of the land) approach is integral to the effectiveness of health policies and initiatives aimed at improving Maori outcomes sustainably. We propose that the current reorganisation of Aotearoa New Zealand's health system, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic response, provide opportunities to emphasise and embed Maori health leadership and knowledge, as well as a tangata whenua conceptualisation of health and wellbeing.

TI  - Mapping plastic-covered greenhouse farming areas using high-resolution PlanetScope and RapidEye imagery: studies from Loukkos perimeter (Morocco) and Dalat City (Vietnam)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The proliferation of plastic-covered greenhouse (PCG) farming has resulted in high horticulture crop yields worldwide during the last few decades. A proper and cost-effective PCG monitoring method is necessary for maintaining sustainable horticulture and high-quality agricultural production with less plastic pollution. Remote sensing applications for mapping PCG have received great attention from the scientific community in recent years. In this paper, a comparative study was carried out in two plastic-covered greenhouse areas in Loukkos perimeter in Morocco and Dalat City in Vietnam to test PCG mapping accuracy of high spatial resolution RapidEye and PlanetScope satellite data and to understand the differences in PCG mapping quality due to topographic effects. Medium-resolution Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI imagery were also applied. Moreover, two classification algorithms-retrogressive plastic greenhouse index (RPGI) and a supervised classification algorithm using random forest (RF)-were used for mapping PCG. The findings reveal that RF outperforms RPGI. Overall, the mapping accuracy achieved exceeded 90% in both study areas, except for the RPGI method using Landsat-8 data (PCG mapping accuracy using Landsat data varied between 87.4 and 89%). Furthermore, PCGs were better detected by PlanetScope data than by RapidEye imagery due to the differences in the spectral range. Better performance in Loukkos perimeter can be explained by the study area's topography; Dalat City and surrounding areas are situated in mountainous terrain. The results obtained from this study indicate that spectral indices can be used as a cost-effective tool for mapping PCG under cloud-free conditions. PCG mapping using RF classifiers resulted in accurate PCG mapping without topographic factors' influence.

TI  - Spatiotemporal high-resolution imputation modeling of aerosol optical depth for investigating its full-coverage variation in China from 2003 to 2020
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating spatiotemporal variations of atmospheric aerosols is important for climate change and environ-mental research. Although satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved by the MAIAC (Multiangle Imple-mentation of Atmospheric Correct) algorithm provides a unique opportunity to represent global aerosol loading with high spatiotemporal resolution, accurate assessment of long-term aerosol loading countrywide is still challenging due to its non-random missingness. This study aimed to develop an adaptive spatiotemporal high -resolution imputation modeling framework for AOD that incorporates random forest models and multisource data (the simulated AOD, meteorological, and surface condition data) to support full-coverage long-and short-term aerosol studies in China. Aided by the time-stratified approach, the imputation model was constructed for each day, and the MAIAC AOD was used as the target variable. The proposed approach could effectively capture the massive spatiotemporal variability in a large amount of data and deliver full-coverage AODs with high ac-curacies at a daily timescale (i.e., overall validation R2 against ground-level AOD measurements of 0.77). We then employed the proposed approach to impute the daily MAIAC retrieved AOD towards complete coverage for China for 2003-2020. Due to the complete coverage, the spatial pattern of monthly/seasonal/yearly mean AOD imputations has better representativeness than that of original MAIAC retrievals. Comparison analysis shows that the monthly/seasonal/yearly aerosol loading over most of China tends to be underestimated by temporal ag-gregates of original satellite-retrieved AODs. Such underestimation is particularly severe in summer and over the North China Plain (the amount of underestimation >0.2). Consequently, our full-coverage AOD imputations can advance scientific research and environmental management by supporting national and local complete pictures of both short-term episodes and long-term trends in atmospheric aerosols.

TI  - Improved gross primary productivity estimation using semi empirical (PRELES) model for moist Indian sal forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - The significant role that forests play in regulating the carbon and water exchange is critical to mitigate climate change. The remote sensing data and models provide good means for estimating gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET), although they seldom face issues when implemented without proper cali-bration. The study compares the performance of empirical (TG model) and semi-empirical (PRELES) model in estimation of GPP and ET of Indian moist sal forest. PRELES-PREdict Light use efficiency, Evapotranspiration and Soil water predicted the GPP and ET adequately; GPP ranged from 1.09 to 19.73 gC m- 2 day- 1 with RMSE of 1.64 gC m- 2 day -1 and ET from 0.25 to 5.31 mm day -1 with RMSE of 0.65 mm day -1. It was found that PRELES estimated GPP with higher accuracy compared to TG model (a reduced RMSE of 0.68 gC m- 2 day -1). The study reveals, with site-specific parametrization, semi empirical model can better predict GPP and ET than empirical model.

TI  - Thermodynamic correlations between the sea surface temperature, water vapor content, and cloud fraction, using MODIS data
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - NASA MODIS data have been analyzed to quantify the relationship between the sea surface temperature (SST), water vapor content (WV), and cloud fraction (CF) for the time period from January 2000 to March 2017. SST and WV follow a Clausius-Claperyon type of a relationship with modified constants up to 300 K. However, beyond SST of 300 K, an alternate function prescribes the SST-WV correlation. A functional correlation between WV and CF has also been found for a limited range of CF, by introducing the atmospheric temperature at pressure altitude of 650 mbar as an additional parameter. The latter parameter is considered to be a modifier for the condensation process for WV to CF. An alternate correlation between SST, WV, and CF is found, where an inverted CF data tracks with WV up to SST of 300 K, and then becomes anti-correlated. These functional relationships can be used in global thermodynamic model or analyses of the Earth climate system, and also validate sub-models used in complex numerical approaches such as regional or global circulation models.

TI  - An algorithm for early rice area mapping from satellite remote sensing data in southwestern Guangdong in China based on feature optimization and random Forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating of rice areas using images obtained from satellite remote sensing is important for guiding operators. The object of this study was the Sentinel-2A/B image data of the rice planting demonstration regions in southwestern Guangdong, China. We designed an algorithm for early rice area mapping based on feature opti-mization and random forest (RF). For modeling, we selected 35 common remote sensing features and applied out-of-bag (OOB) to construct 7 feature combinations. The results showed that the overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient of the RF with the best combination were 91.23% and 87.55%, respectively. Compared with support vector machine (SVM) and back propagation neural network (BPNN), the model result of RF was also the best among the three. Additionally, the maximum error of the rice area was less than 16% when the model was transferred to other regions in Guangdong. The feature optimization and RF-based algorithm proposed in this study can effectively map the early rice region. It can be applied to estimate rice area based on satellite remote sensing image data and reveal the ecological status of rice cultivation in southwestern Guangdong.

TI  - Quantifying the impacts of DEM uncertainty on clear-sky surface shortwave radiation estimation in typical mountainous areas
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of shortwave radiation in mountains will advance our knowledge of climate change effects, especially on mountain ecosystems. Recently, some approaches have been developed to estimate shortwave radiation parameters in mountains with satellite data, but few attempts were made to understand the impacts of digital elevation model (DEM) uncertainty on estimates. Our study investigates such impacts quantitatively in clear-sky conditions at multiple spatial and temporal scales (30-3000 m, instantaneous to daily). We employed a retrieval algorithm to estimate instantaneous and daily mean clear-sky downward shortwave radiation (DSR) and net shortwave radiation (NSR), as a proxy for our evaluation. The accuracy of our method based on accurate terrain data was verified against in-situ measurements with root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of 65.9 W/m2 and 65.1 W/m2 for instantaneous DSR and NSR, and 21.2 W/m2 and 22.5 W/m2 for daily mean values, respectively. When using satellite DEM products, the DSR estimation uncertainty could increase by 64.0% for instantaneous values and 46.2% for daily mean values. Using AW3D30 and SRTM DEMs for DSR estimation led to a maximum difference of 16.8% (103.6 W/m2) and 13.0% (25.8W/m2) on instantaneous and daily mean values, respectively. That estimation difference of shortwave radiation decreased with an increase in spatial scale, with RMS deviation lower than 2% for spatial resolution beyond 3000 m. In addition, the evaluation of introducing random errors into AW3D30 DEM showed that the shortwave radiation uncertainty caused by DEM may exceed the algorithm uncertainty itself with DEM mean absolute error (MAE) equaling about 5.0 m. Considering the current DEM accuracy, the impacts of DEM errors on shortwave radiation in mountains cannot be ignored. This study emphasizes the potential impacts of DEM uncertainty on surface shortwave radiation estimation, which is crucial in using satellite-derived datasets for energy balance calculation and climate change applications in mountains.

TI  - Changes in snow and ice surface albedo and its impact on snow and ice area in the Wind River Range, Wyoming, USA
T2  - PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial and snow melt in the Wind River Range, Wyoming feed headwaters for the Missouri and Colorado River Systems, covering much of the western United States. Identifying the factors that have the greatest impact on snow and ice melt is important to managing the water resources in this region. This study examined snow and ice albedo, summer temperature and precipitation, and winter precipitation as potential significant factors related to snow and ice area changes. The Mann-Kendall statistical test was used to analyze changes in surface albedo on snow and ice over time (1985 to 2016) as derived from Landsat imagery among 5 basins in the Wind River Range. As well, a stepwise regression analysis was utilized in determining the significance of albedo along with summer mean temperature, total summer precipitation, and total winter precipitation in predicting snow and ice area. Among all the variables, albedo was found to have the greatest significance in relation to snow and ice area change. The significance of albedo on snow and ice melting in the Wind River Range is likely due to a positive feedback effect coupled with possible effects from annual increases in particulates from forest fires and fossil fuel production.

TI  - Elucidating the consequences of the co-exposure of microplastics jointly to other pollutants in bivalves: A review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The marine environment has numerous impacts related to anthropogenic activities including pollution. Abun-dances of microplastics (MPs) and other pollutants are continuously increasing in the marine environment, resulting in a complex mixture of contaminants affecting biota. In order to understand the consequences, a re-view of studies analyzing combined effects of MPs and other types of pollutants in bivalves has been conducted as species in this group have been considered as sentinel and bioindicators. Regarding studies reviewed, histological analyses give evidence that MPs can be located in the haemolymph, gills and gonads, as well as in digestive glands in the intestinal lumen, epithelium and tubules, demonstrating that the entire body of bivalves is affected by MPs. Moreover, DNA strand breaks represent the most relevant form of damage caused by the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species in response to MPs exposure. The role of MPs as vectors of pollutants and the ability of polymers to adsorb different compounds have also been considered in this review highlighting a high variability of results. In this sense, toxic impacts associated to MPs exposure were found to significantly increase with the co-presence of antibiotics or petroleum hydrocarbons amongst other pollutants. In addition, bioaccumulation processes of pollutants (PAHs, metals and others) have been affected by the co-presence with MPs. Histological, genetic and physiological alterations are the most reported damages, and the degree of harm seems to be correlated with the concentration and size of MP and with the type of pollutant.

TI  - Assessment of wet season agricultural droughts using monthly MODIS and SAR data in the red and lateritic zone of West Bengal, India
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Recurrent droughts, particularly in the monsoon seasons, often severely affect the agricultural yield. Such short-lived yet acute droughts lead to crop failure, affecting the livelihood of small and marginal farmers of the sub-humid red and laterite zones (RLZs). The present paper analyses the monthly agricultural droughts during the monsoon seasons in the RLZs using MODIS and SAR data. From the analysis of MODIS-derived indices like NDVI, TCI, TVDI, and Z(PET) for the years 2005 to 2020, three acute drought years of 2005, 2010, and 2015 were identified as severe to extreme drought conditions which led to crop failures. MODIS-derived drought indices were validated by rainfall (SPI) and evapotranspiration (SPEI) based meteorological indices. Results showed that the satellite-derived evapotranspiration index Z(PET) and soil moisture index TDVI were better correlated with the SPEI, while the NDVI anomaly was better correlated with the SPI. Ground-level drought conditions prevalent during the monsoon months of June to September in 2015 could be further detected by the SAR backscatter of multi-temporal data from 2015 to 2020. This study provides a theoretical basis for the application of MODIS and SAR data in tandem for identifying short-lived but potentially damaging agricultural droughts during monsoon months.

TI  - Landscape changes over 30 years of intense economic activity in the upper Parana River basin
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we show the complexity associated with the recent land cover changes by elucidating the paths of 30 years of changes in the Upper Paran ' a River Basin (UPRB), a region severely impacted by agricultural activity, one of the areas with the highest density in the production of hydroelectricity, biofuels and food in the world. In this sense, a post-classification comparison approach based on Landsat images was used to identify detailed 'from-to' paths behind those land cover changes. The most expressive changes were the expansion of Cropland and Forest areas and the reduction in savannas, with a net change of 17.9%, 4.1%, and-16.9% of the UPRB area, respectively. Cropland areas showed an expressive increase between 1985 and 2015, rising from 249,439 km2 (27.7%) to 412,909 km2 (45.9%). Forest areas increased from 149,389 km2 to 185,839 km2 in the period. Notably, for this class, an intense spatial dynamic of losses (7.5%) and gains (11.6%) took place between 1985 and 2015. This behavior is related to the disappearance of native vegetation fragments in some sub-basins, as well as to afforestation, reforestation, and/or forest restoration in others. The Cerrado (a typical tropical savanna in South America), the most impacted natural biome of the Basin, decreased from 21.9% of the UPRB in 1985 (196,746 km2) to only about 5% of the whole UPRB area in 2015. Grassland areas, mostly used for livestock, decreased from 271,827 km2 (30.2%) to 229,007 km2 (25.5%). This net decrease was associated with a reduction of 160,830 km2 (17.8%) and the appearance of 118,010 km2 (13.2%) in new areas, previously occupied by tropical savannas in 1985. In conclusion, economic factors were the main drivers for land cover changes, especially agriculture and livestock activities, besides forestry and hydroelectric energy production. In addition, Grassland areas that predominated on the left banks of the UPRB in 1985 retreated with the advance of Cropland areas, mainly due to the expansion of sugarcane for ethanol production, a biofuel widely used in Brazil. In turn, pasture areas migrated to the right bank and occupied a significant part of the Cerrado. Finally, our results demonstrate that the transition dynamics among land cover classes can involve complex political-economical mechanisms that are not always captured by remote sensing.

T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing estimation of aboveground biomass for desert oasis vegetation in arid area is an important means to monitor land desertification, it is of great significance to accurately evaluate the carbon sink change of desert oasis ecosystem, and maintain the stability of oasis ecosystem. The aboveground biomass information of vegetation, such as vegetation index and band factor in a delta oasis area is obtained by using Landsat 8 OLI image data; Based on the combination with the measured aboveground biomass data of vegetation, the optimal estimation model of aboveground biomass of four vegetation types (arbors, shrubs, herbs and crops) in this area is established, and the above ground biomass of vegetation was retrieved and verified. The results showed that: (1) there was a very significant correlation between the remote sensing factors of aboveground biomass of four vegetation types and the measured aboveground biomass, and the correlation coefficient ranged from 0.711 to 0.756 (P < 0.01); (2) multiple stepwise regression (MSR) model is the optimal estimation model of aboveground biomass of arbors and shrubs, and partial least squares regression (PLSR) model is the optimal estimation model of aboveground biomass of herbs and crops, the estimation results have a good linear fitting relationship with the measured results; (3) the order of aboveground biomass of vegetation in oasis area from low to high is: herbs < shrubs < arbors < crops. Among them, the aboveground biomass of grass is mainly below 280 g m(-2), the aboveground biomass of shrub is mainly 280-950 g m(-2), and the aboveground biomass of four vegetation is mainly distributed in 280-1450 g m(-2). Based on the Landsat 8 OLI image data, the remote sensing estimation model can accurately estimate the aboveground biomass of four oasis vegetation types (arbors, shrubs, herbs and crops), and reveal the spatial distribution characteristics of aboveground biomass of oasis vegetation.

TI  - Strengthening surveillance in Ghana against public health emergencies of international concern
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Among western African countries, the Republic of Ghana has maintained an economic growth rate of 5% since the 1980s and is now categorized as a middle-income country. However, as with other developing countries, Ghana still has challenges in the effective implementation of surveillance for infectious diseases. Facing public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC), it is crucial to establish a reliable sample transportation system to the referral laboratory. Previously, surveillance capacity in Ghana was limited based on Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response, and therefore the "Surveillance and Laboratory Support for Emerging Pathogens of Public Health Importance in Ghana (SLEP)" was introduced to strengthen diarrhea surveillance. The SLEP project started with a sentinel diarrhea survey supported by SATREPS/JICA in collaboration with National Public Health Reference Laboratory (NHPRL) and Noguchi Memorial Institute of Medicine (NMIMR). The base-line survey revealed the limited capacity to detect diarrhea pathogens and to transfer samples from health centers to NHPRL. The involvement of private clinic/hospital facilities into the surveillance network is also crucial to strengthen surveillance in Ghana. The strong and interactive relationship between the two top referral laboratories, NHPRL under the Ministry of Health NMIMR and under the Ministry of Education, enables Ghana Health Services and is critical for the rapid response against PHEIC. In future, we hope that the outcome of the SLEP surveillance project could contribute to building a surveillance network with more timely investigation and transfer of samples to referral labs.

TI  - Interaction of image fusion techniques and atmospheric correction for improve SVM accuracy
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land cover (LC) influence the geological, climatic, and biological environments of the earth. A precise LC map provides detailed information on resource management and intergovernmental collaboration to address global warming and biodiversity reduction. This article investigated the influence of atmospheric correction and four fusion techniques (Brovey, Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV), Principle Components (PC), and Gram-Schmidt (GS) spectral sharpening) on LC classification accuracy. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) were used as LC mapping classification algorithms using panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery. This study indicated that the SVM technique led to greater accuracy than MLC by 17%, 4.48%, 4.4%, 3.97%, and 15.57% in Overall Accuracy (OA) for HSV, Brovey, PC, GS, and MS images alternatively. The GS sharpened image gave the highest outcome across all SVM categories by 85.14% with a Kappa coefficient (K) value of 0.81 compared with the GS-MLC classification of about 4% in OA and 0.04 in K value. The OA distinction between HSV, Brovey, PC, GS, and MS images with and without atmospheric correction was also about 5% on SVM classification occasions which is consistent with MLC outcomes. These findings have shown that atmospheric correction is not required for LC mapping based on DN image Nevertheless, fusion performs a more influential role in the accuracy of classification than atmospheric correction. A combination of atmospheric correction, pansharpening, and SVM could offer promising LC maps from Landsat 8 OLI multispectral and panchromatic images.

TI  - SPOT vs Landsat satellite images for the evolution of the north Peloponnese coastline, Greece
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The littoral zone of Achaia prefecture, located in northwestern Peloponnese of Greece, is an area which has experienced significant modification the last two decades. It is a linear and sandy coast with limited curves and infrastructures, suitable for the comparison of the shoreline derived from SPOT and Landsat satellite images. Nowadays, the application of the remote sensing has overshadowed the traditional methods of shoreline mapping, such as ground survey along with transects and airborne stereophotogrammetry, as low-cost repeatable observations can be made, providing reliable results.The normalized difference water index (NDWI), which is computed from multispectral satellite data, have been successfully applied to shoreline discrimination. Consequently, the current manuscript applies to the specific index on Landsat and SPOT data for the 1987-2008 period in order to detect the shoreline position. Moreover, shorelines were generated from the Landsat and SPOT satellite images of medium spatial resolution, 30 m and 20 m respectively, for the years of 1987, 1996, and 2008, and their accuracy was compared to respective data derived from air photos with high spatial resolution (0.50 m to 1 m).The analysis revealed that the Landsat TM 5 data provide more accurate vectorized shorelines than the SPOT 1 to 4 series with 20 m spatial resolution via the NDWI. Both are not suitable for high-scale accurate diachronic shoreline monitoring, even if image fusion techniques were used, as they emerged bad overlapping ratio following significant distortions on the two axes in relation to the respective high-resolution reference data. Moreover, they provided quite different results regarding the shoreline evolution in relation to the respective high-resolution data.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Explaining farmers' pro-environmental behaviors toward plant, soil and water conservation in Iran: an application of value-belief-norm theory
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to explain the farmers' pro-environmental behaviors toward plant, soil and water conservation by adapting the value-belief-norm theory. This cross-sectional survey investigated 342 farmers in Mazandaran province, Iran. Data collection was done using a structured questionnaire and analyzed through structural equation modeling. The findings of the study confirmed the causal paths of variables in the value-belief-norm theory. As expected, in a causal chain, values influenced beliefs, and beliefs influenced norms, and finally norms influenced the plant, soil and water conservation behaviors among farmers. The results indicated that personal norms explained 60%, 10% and 5% of the variance of plant, soil and water conservation behavior variables, respectively. Also, ascription of responsibility explained 82% of the personal norms variance and awareness of consequences explained 35% of the variance of ascription of responsibility. In the following, ecological worldview (New Ecological Paradigm) explained 33% of the awareness of consequences' variance, and altruistic and egocentric values explained 72% of the New Ecological Paradigm' variance. In addition to providing support for the application of the value-belief-norm theory within the context of Iranian farmers, this study increased the understanding of the factors influencing the environmentally friendly behavior of farmers, helping agricultural policy makers and decision makers to formulate their policies for sustainable agricultural development with a better understanding of farmers' decisions and behaviors.

TI  - Mapping Phyllosilicates on the Asteroid Bennu Using Thermal Emission Spectra and Machine Learning Model Applications
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bennu, the target of the OSIRIS-REx mission, is an asteroid with compositions analogous to low petrologic type CI, CM, CR, and/or ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites. Asteroids like Bennu provide information about the building blocks of the early Solar System. Analysis of the mid-infrared remote sensing data informs mineral quantification. We apply a phyllosilicate specific model, developed by Breitenfeld et al. (2021, ) that distinguishes between Mg and Fe serpentines, to Baseball Diamond 1 (BBD1), equatorial station 3 (EQ3), and touch-and-go OSIRIS-REx thermal emission spectrometer data. The average total phyllosilicate predictions are 73 (BBD1) and 72 vol% (EQ3). We observe higher Fe-cronstedtite and lower Mg-rich serpentine content in the equatorial region of Bennu than average. Mid-infrared spectral variability may be explained by sorting effects through mass movement.

TI  - A biomimetic systems method to organizational sustainable development and harmony: The Zen Business Model
T2  - SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In a global knowledge and socioeconomic system dominated by the Western worldview, this paper introduces, from a practical point of view, the Zen Business Model. This is an emerging systems approach grounded on ancient Eastern wisdom that explores the symbiotic relationship between Taoism and Buddhism applied to organizational sustainable development and transformation. The model brings a universal and natural understanding of the organization as a living system whose value generating behaviour biomimics the natural cycles of transformation explained in Taoist systems theories. By doing so, the paper argues, on one hand, that business organizations can learn from nature-based Eastern systems approaches as a way to increase their positive contribution to society, the environment and the economy. And, on the other hand, it explains the five corporate stars and its value dynamics as a principles-based pathway to sustainable transformation.

TI  - Spatial efficiency of protected mangrove areas in Madagascar
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected Areas (PAs) are an important nature-based solution for mangrove conservation and rehabilitation. We evaluated spatial effectiveness of PAs for mangroves toward achieving Global Conservation Targets (GCTs). The hypothesis for this study was that PAs with different attributes have insignificant effects on mangrove conser-vation. We assessed the proportions of the most vulnerable mangroves inside PAs, and focused on a typical mangrove country (Madagascar). First, based on remote sensing technology and big data in Google Earth Engine (GEE), we identified the exposure location of mangroves, and determined the environmental factors significantly influencing mangrove distribution. Then, Vulnerability Assessment and Hot-Spot Analysis models were used to measure spatial vulnerability and hotspots of those values, respectively. Finally, we implemented the statistics for the most vulnerable mangroves inside PAs. It was found that: i. Mangroves were mainly abundant in west and east coasts with low latitudes, and the most typical environmental factor influencing mangrove distribution was elevation and; ii. PAs sheltered 486.18 km(2) (22.16%) of the most vulnerable mangroves in Madagascar. Overall, PAs in Madagascar failed to match 30% of spatial requirements proposed by GCTs (A key proportion of spatial requirements used to reverse trends in biodiversity loss). This study provides a quantitative paradigm for veri-fying the spatial efficiency of PAs, and will inform local decision-makers on places where mangroves are facing adaption loss to optimize mangrove conservation in future.

TI  - A Persistent Submesoscale Frontal Slick: A Novel Marker of the Mesoscale Flow Field in a Large Lake (Lake Geneva)
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Submesoscale fronts often become visible when the accumulation of biosurfactants in the water surface microlayer causes smooth surfaces, called frontal slicks, to develop. Based on in situ and remotely-sensed data, a frontal slick was documented for the first time in a lake (Lake Geneva). A quasi-stationary similar to 10-km long slick formed on the warm side of a surface temperature front with strong horizontal velocity strain. The slick width increased from similar to 50 to similar to 200 m in similar to 1.5 hr due to "feeding" by wind-driven, rapidly-moving smaller slicks. Numerical modeling results, confirmed by satellite data, indicated that the boundary between mesoscale gyres isolated warm surface water from cold water associated with wind-induced coastal upwelling. Measurements and modeling suggest that frontogenetic sharpening of the submesoscale temperature gradient created an active front with strong convergent flow. Such dynamics must be considered in buoyant material transport and the vertical exchange of surface water with deeper layers in lakes.

TI  - Projecting Stratocumulus Transitions on the Albedo-Cloud Fraction Relationship Reveals Linearity of Albedo to Droplet Concentrations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite images show solid marine stratocumulus cloud decks (Sc) that break up over the remote oceans. The Sc breakup is initiated by precipitation and is accompanied by a strong reduction in the cloud radiative effect. Aerosol has been shown to delay the Sc breakup by postponing the onset of precipitation, however its climatic effect is uncertain. Here we introduce a new approach that allows us to re-cast currently observed cloud cover and albedo to their counterfactual cleaner world, enabling the first estimate of the radiative effect due to delayed cloud breakup. Using simple radiative approximation, the radiative forcing with respect to pre-industrial times due to delayed Sc breakup is -0.39 W m(-2). The radiative effect changes nearly linearly with aerosol due to the droplet concentration control on the cloud cover, suggesting a potentially accelerated warming if the current trend of reduction in aerosol emissions continues.

TI  - Potential Overtreatment and Overtesting Among Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Across Canada: An Observational, Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF DIABETES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Our aim in this study was to assess potential overtreatment and overtesting among older adults with type 2 diabetes across Canada.Methods: An observational, population-based cohort study was conducted using data available through the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network. All patients included in the study were seen by a primary care provider between 2010 and 2017, >= 65 years of age with type 2 diabetes and had at least one glycated hemoglobin (A1C) measurement. Potential overtreatment was defined as an index A1C of <7% and being prescribed antidiabetes medications other than metformin within 1 year of the index A1C. Testing >= 3 times/year in patients with A1C <7% was considered potential overtesting. Analyses were performed/compared within 2 cross-sectional cohorts (2012 and 2016). A subcohort analysis was performed on those with advanced age and dementia.Results: An overall cohort of 41,032 patients (mean age, 76.6 years) was identified. Proportions of potential overtreatment were 7.0% (2012) and 6.9% (2016) (difference in rate in %: 0.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.32 to 0.52]). Overall, 19.2% (2012) and 19.0% (2016) of patients were potentially over-tested (difference in rate in %: 0.2; 95% CI, -0.45 to 0.85), whereas 2.4% (2012) and 2.3% (2016) were potentially undertested (difference in rate in %: 0.1; 95% CI, - 0.15 to 0.35). Among patients with dementia and advanced age, proportions of patients potentially overtreated were 14.5% and 12.1%, and those overtested were 29.2% and 25.0% in 2012 and 2016, respectively.Conclusions: Potential overtreatment and overtesting exists among older adults with diabetes in Canadian primary care practices with minimal change over time. Higher proportions of potentially unnecessary care were observed in those with advanced age and dementia. Our study highlights an opportunity for primary care clinicians to improve testing and treatment practices considering the individual patient, context and potential for net benefit.

TI  - Effects of barotropic tides and ocean stratification on the generation and propagation of internal solitary waves in the deep south Andaman Sea
T2  - DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Andaman Sea is one of the sea areas with the most internal solitary waves (ISWs) observed in the world and an ideal experimental site for studying the generation and propagation charac-teristics of ISWs. In this paper the generation and propagation characteristics of the ISWs in the deep south Andaman Sea are investigated based on the results of Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (MITgcm) numerical models. The reliability of the model is verified. The sea surface current gradient of 3D model is consistent with Terra MODIS and Sentinel-1A SAR remote sensing images. The turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate of 2D model is also consistent with in-situ mooring measurements in other sea areas. The variation of temperature, energy and current field caused by barotropic tides and oceanic stratification are analyzed and compared. The results show that ISWs cannot be generated directly by the indi-vidual diurnal tides in our 2D model, and ISWs are mainly generated by the semidiurnal tides in the deep south Andaman Sea. Ocean stratification affects the waveform, the velocity and the generation position of ISWs. ISWs are easier to form in the hot season because of a larger Ursell number and stronger nonlinearity.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Extremity and Truncal Soft Tissue Sarcomas: A Systematic Review of the Literature
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Regional lymph node metastasis (RLNM) occurs infrequently in patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS), although certain STS subtypes have a higher propensity for RLNM. The identification of RLNM has significant implications for staging and prognosis; however, the precise impact of node-positive disease on patient survival remains a topic of controversy. Although the benefits of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) are well documented in patients with melanoma and breast cancer, whether this procedure offers a benefit in STS is controversial. Methods A systematic literature search was performed and articles reviewed to determine if SLNB in patients with extremity/truncal STS impacts disease-free or overall survival. Results Six studies were included. Rates of sentinel lymph node positivity were heterogeneous (range 4.3-50%). The impact of SLNB on patient outcomes remains unclear. The overall quality of available evidence was low, as assessed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Conclusions The literature addressing the impact of nodal basin evaluation on the staging and management of patients with extremity/truncal STS is confounded by heterogeneous patient cohorts and clinical practices. Multicenter prospective studies are warranted to determine the true incidence of RLNM and whether SLNB could benefit patients with clinically occult RLNM at diagnosis.

TI  - Antibiotic-disrupted ribosome biogenesis facilitates tumor chemokine superinduction
T2  - BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Upon exposure to internal or external stressors, ribosomes stand sentinel via modulation of ribosome assembly and protein translation. Ribosome-dependent cellular dysfunctions have been associated with pathophysiological processes during inflammation and tumorigenesis. In the present study, ribosome biogenesis was assessed to determine its effects on tumor chemokines, potentially contributing to cancer cell malignant features. In particular, ribosome biogenesis inhibition by antibiotic actinomycin D (ActD) enhanced the expression of che-mokines in intestinal cancer cells under endoplasmic reticulum stress that governs multiple pro-tumoral reprogramming. Mechanistically, ribosome biogenesis inhibition superinduced proinflammatory chemokines via transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Moreover, ribosomal stress-responsive p53 and its target macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC-1) mediated chemokine superinduction by activating TGF-I3-activated kinase 1 (TAK-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) in intestinal cancer cells. Cancer cell-based regulation of chemokine induction via MIC-1 signaling was verified using clinical transcriptome datasets. Clinical tumor tissue-derived MIC-1 was a positive regulator of chemokines and genes involved in the ribosome biogenesis pathway, supporting the in vitro assessments. Moreover, MIC-1-correlated chemokine expressions predicted poor prognoses in patients with colorectal cancer. Ribosome-based chemokine regulation via MIC-1 signaling would provide novel insights into translational interventions against malignant inflammatory insults.

TI  - Radical Internalism
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUES
M3  - Article
AB  - In her paper "Radical Externalism", Amia Srinivasan argues that externalism about epistemic justification should be preferred to internalism by those who hold a "radical" worldview (according to which pernicious ideology distorts our evidence and belief-forming processes). I share Srinivasan's radical worldview, but do not agree that externalism is the preferable approach in light of the worldview we share. Here I argue that cases informed by this worldview can intuitively support precisely the internalist view that Srinivasan challenges, offer two such cases, and explain away the externalist-friendly intuitions that Srinivasan's cases solicit. I then articulate and defend a "radical" internalism, arguing that internalists' aversion to epistemic hubris and emphasis on subjecting one's beliefs to critical scrutiny are especially attractive in realistic cases involving multiple intersecting axes of oppression-that is, precisely the sort of case that permeates our social world. I also argue that externalism's lack of interest in action-guiding principles leaves it with little to offer us in the fight against epistemic oppression.

TI  - Entomo-virological surveillance followed by serological active survey of symptomatic individuals is helpful to identify hotspots of early arbovirus transmission
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti in urban environments have spread rapidly worldwide, causing great impacts on public health. The development of reliable and timely alert signals is among the most important steps in designing accurate surveillance systems for vector-borne diseases. In July and September 2017, we conducted a pilot study to improve an existing integrated surveillance system by using entomo-virological surveillance to prioritize areas to conduct active searches for individuals with arbovirus infection symptoms. Foz do Iguacu City has a permanent entomo-virological surveillance system with approximately 3,500 traps to capture Aedes sp. in the adult stage. The Aedes aegypti females are captured alive and human samples are submitted to RT-qPCR (real-time qPCR) screening for DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV diagnosis. Of the 55 Ae. aegypti mosquitoes tested in July 2017, seven (12.7%) were considered positive for DENV-2 and three (5.4%) for CHIKV. In September, we tested a sample of 54 mosquitoes, and 15 (27.7%) were considered infected by DENV-2. We created 25 circumferences with 150-m radius each to perform an active survey to identify symptomatic householders. In July, we selected one circumference, and five (35.7%) patients were positive for DENV, whereas two (14.3%) for CHIKV. In September, we selected four circumferences, and, from the 21 individuals sampled, nine (42.8%) were positive for DENV-2. A statistical model with a binomial response was used to estimate the number of cases in areas without active surveys, i.e., 20 circumferences. We estimated an additional 83 symptomatic patients (95% CI: 45-145) to be found in active searches, with 38 (95% CI: 18-72) of them confirming arbovirus infection. Arbovirus detection and serotyping in mosquitoes, but also in symptomatic individuals during active surveys, can provide an alert signal of early arbovirus transmission.

Remote sensing has been emerging as an important tool to quantify LNCA and LNCM across multiple observation scales, such as leaf and canopy. Most models for estimating LNCA and LNCM are based on their empirical relationships with chlorophyll-related vegetation indices (VIs), which cannot cap-ture the dynamic allocation of nitrogen into different components throughout the growing season. This study proposed a simplified nitrogen allocation model by dividing the total nitrogen into photosynthetic nitrogen (PN) and non-photosynthetic nitrogen with the purpose of estimating LNCA and LNCM in rice and winter wheat. The nitrogen allocation model was calibrated with an independent leaf-scale dataset (R-2 = 0.82) and then applied to the canopy scale without the need to adjust the model coefficients. The estimated fractions of PN were 71% and 78% for rice and wheat leaves, respectively, which were close to the reported value (similar to 75%) for common C-3 plants. Overall, the nitrogen allocation-based models were applicable for estimating both LNCA and LNCM with relative root mean square error (RRMSE) values <15% for the jointing and booting stages. In addition, our novel estimation model was generic for rice and wheat, yielding the best estimations for LNCM (R-2 = 0.63) across the entire growing season compared with traditional empirical models based on VIs. This study represents a first attempt to couple nitrogen allocation theory with remote sensing data to improve the spectroscopic estimation of LNCA and LNCM.

TI  - Remote sensing monitoring of total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in the water around Chaohu Lake based on geographical division
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is useful for quantifying water-quality parameters for managing inland water systems. However, the single water-quality retrieval model usually has poor applicability in large regions. To solve the issue of low retrieval accuracy of water-quality parameters in inland water, the study area herein is geographically divided into rural water and urban water according to the proportion of land-use types in the riparian zones. Furthermore, the machine-learning regression algorithms are used to construct the retrieval models suitable for the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations based on the measured water-quality data and the simultaneous Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) images. Additionally, the optical retrieval models are applied to the MSI images acquired on different dates to analyze the variations of TN and TP concentrations in the water around Chaohu Lake of China. The results show that the three accuracy indices of determination coefficient (R (2)), mean square error (MSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the TN concentration retrieval models for rural water and urban water were 0.67, 0.37 mg/L, and 36.81%, and 0.78, 0.34 mg/L, and 8.34%, respectively, while those of the TP concentration retrieval model for rural water and urban water reached 0.46, 0.0034 mg/L, and 38.60%, and 0.58, 0.018 mg/L, and 37.57%, respectively. The accuracy of the TN and TP concentration retrieval model constructed using geographical division is significantly better than that which does not use geographical division. According to the retrieval results from MSI images, the TN and TP concentrations in urban water are higher than those in rural water. TN and TP concentrations in urban water are stable throughout the year and peak in December, while those of rural water are highest in March and lowest in November. The method proposed in this study can provide a new idea for improving the retrieval accuracy of water-quality parameters in different water bodies in a large-scale region, and the relevant conclusion can provide a theoretical basis for water pollution control and prevention strategies in agricultural basins.

TI  - Thermokarst lake changes over the past 40 years in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A thermokarst lake is generally defined as a lake that occupies a closed basin and is created by the massive melting of ground ice in ice-rich permafrost regions, which has a great impact on regional hydro-ecological equilibrium and permafrost-engineering infrastructure facilities. Global warming and increasing human activities have been accompanied by permafrost degradation and glacier retreat in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). The QTP, source of many international rivers in Asia, is known as the "Asian Water Tower." The number and area of lakes in the QTP have increased in the past 40 years; however, lakes with areas of less than 1 km(2) have been overlooked when calculating the water storage. To address the evolution of thermokarst lakes in the QTP, visual interpretation and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index were applied to extract the water area based on Landsat data from the 1980s to 2020. The results indicate that thermokarst lake area was reduced from 932.5 km(2) to 799.25 km(2) from the 1980s to 1990. From 1990 to 2020, the number and area of lakes grew substantially, with the number increasing from 66506 to 120374 and the area increasing by 113.14% (932.5 km(2) in 1980s and 1703.56 km(2) in 2020). As heat carriers, thermokarst lakes transfer heat vertically and horizontally. The temperature of the surrounding permafrost rises as the number and area of lakes increase and when permafrost is extensively degraded. Longtime carbon stocks are also released into atmosphere during lake formation, which affects the regional carbon cycle.

TI  - Treatment of Mammary Paget Disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of real-world data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Because the lesions of mammary Paget disease (MPD) are often limited to the nipple-areolar com-plex, the extension of optimal tumor excision is inconclusive. Moreover, the risk of potential tumor upstaging is unknown; therefore, the application of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is required for analysis. We sys-tematically reviewed the real-world data to evaluate the optimal treatment and potential predictors of poorer prognosis for MPD.Methods: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant studies. Clinical studies were included if they evaluated the outcome of positive rates of SLNB, prognostic risk factors of MPD, and survival outcomes of treatments of interest for MPD, including mastectomy, breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with radiotherapy, and BCS alone.Results: A total of 38 studies with 24,062 patients were retrieved. Compared with BCS alone (21.2%), mastectomy (5.9%; P < 0.001) and BCS with radiotherapy (8; P = 0.001) had significantly lower local recurrence rates. Patients with palpable tumors (30.2%) had significantly worse prognoses than those with impalpable (3.4%) tumors in metastasis (P < 0.001), and significantly higher local recurrence rates were observed in patients with underlying invasive carcinoma (6.7%) than those with noninvasive carcinoma (4.5%; P = 0.032). The positive rate of SLNB was 17% (95% CI: 0.115-0.226).Conclusion: Except for MPD alone, BCS alone is not recommended for treating MPD with invasive ductal carci-noma and MPD with ductal carcinoma in situ. Moreover, a palpable mass, underlying invasive carcinoma, and positive lymph node status may lead to a poorer prognosis, which may be taken into consideration for the application of SLNB.

TI  - Interconnectedness and (in)coherence as a signature of conspiracy worldviews
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Conspiracy theories may arise out of an overarching conspiracy worldview that identifies common elements of subterfuge across unrelated or even contradictory explanations, leading to networks of self-reinforcing beliefs. We test this conjecture by analyzing a large natural language database of conspiracy and nonconspiracy texts for the same events, thus linking theory-driven psychological research with data-driven computational approaches. We find that, relative to nonconspiracy texts, conspiracy texts are more interconnected, more topically heterogeneous, and more similar to one another, revealing lower cohesion within texts but higher cohesion between texts and providing strong empirical support for an overarching conspiracy worldview. Our results provide inroads for classification algorithms and further exploration into individual differences in belief structures.

TI  - Comparison of [<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc]Tc-tilmanocept with [<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc]Tc-sulphur colloids and [<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc]Tc-albumin colloids for sentinel lymph node detection in patients with cutaneous malignancies of the head
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a staging procedure in the management of cutaneous malignancies of the head. The ideal radiopharmaceutical is controversial. This study aimed to compare [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept (TcTM) with [Tc-99m]Tc-sulphur colloid (TcSC) and [Tc-99m]Tc-albumin colloid (TcAC) for SLN detection in the head and neck region. Methods Data from 62 patients with cutaneous malignancies of the head who were injected with TcTM, TcSC, or TcAC before SLN imaging (SLN-I) and SLN excision (SLN-E) between 2012 and 2021 were retrospectively analysed. SLN-I was performed using planar lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT, and a gamma probe was used for SLN-E. The SLN-I localisation rate (patients with SLNs) and degree (SLN number) and SLN-E relocalisation rate (patients with SLNs) and ratio (SLN number in SLN-E/SLN number in SLN-I) were compared between TcTM, TcSC, and TcAC. Results TcTM showed similar SLN-I localisation rates for primaries in the anterior and posterior head region compared with TcSC (84.6% vs. 72.4%, p=0.680; both 100.0%) and TcAC (84.6% vs. 75.0%, p=1.000; both 100.0%). The SLN-I localisation degree for TcTM was higher for primaries in the anterior head region and similar for primaries in the posterior head region compared with TcSC (3.2 vs. 2.3, p=0.034; and 1.8 vs. 2.2, p=0.506) and TcAC (3.2 vs. 2.0, p=0.038; and 1.8 vs. 2.7, p=0.329). The SLN-E relocalisation rates and ratios were similar for all. Conclusion On the basis of a limited study design that compared three different tracers in three different patient groups, TcTM showed comparable overall performance to TcSC and TcAC.

TI  - Landscape ecological modeling to identify ecologically significant regions in Tumkur district, Karnataka
T2  - PHYSICAL SCIENCES REVIEWS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Temporal land use and land cover (LULC) information of a landscape provide an overview of the drivers of change, and impacts on the socio-ecological system. This necessitates organizing diverse data of a landscape, which provides insights into sustainable management. Spatial heterogeneity with landscape dynamics influences biotic and abiotic processes. The knowledge of LULC dynamics aids in assessing the feedback between socio-ecological systems across the urban and rural environments. Visualizing likely landscape changes through modeling help in the decision-making for sustainable landscape management. The current chapter accounts for changes in LULC patterns of the agrarian district Tumkur in Karnataka State, considering temporal remote sensing data of three decades, using geospatial techniques and modeling. Land use (LU) analyses indicate an increase in horticulture area from 0.94 (1989) to 1.02% (2019) due to an increase in commercial cropping. An upsurge of built-up cover from 0.02 to 2.11% (1989-2019) with the enhanced socio-economic activities with the industrialization and infrastructure development across the Tumkur to Bangalore highway. Spatial patterns of landscape dynamics assessed through spatial matrices highlight of increase in urbanization with land conversion from agriculture and forest cover in the outskirts of the Tumkur city center. Ecologically significant regions (ESR) were identified at disaggregated levels through aggregate metrics incorporating bio-geo-climatic, social, hydrological, and ecological aspects. The study region is divided into 9 x 9 km grids for computing metrics at disaggregated levels. ESR is delineated based on the composite metric of all variables, depicts 17 grids (11%) under ESR 1, indicating the highest sensitivity, 29% area (46 grids) as ESR 2 (higher sensitivity), 45% (70 grids) as ESR 3 (high sensitivity), and the rest is 15% (24 grids) in ESR 4 (moderate sensitivity). The outcome of the current research would provide critical management approaches required for managing natural resources and will be valuable for policy and planning purposes in pursuing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the regional scale.

TI  - Target decomposition using dual-polarization sentinel-1 SAR data: Study on crop growth analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Decomposition of synthetic aperture radar data has been carried out using fully polarised microwave bands. Considering the economical point of view, fully polarimetric SAR data is expensive to use for many applications like soil and agriculture, where, it is important to monitor frequently. With the advancement of human civilization, new agricultural techniques and crops are being developed to meet global food demand. With the development of crop growth, crop texture and dielectric properties varies, which is depicted in the backscattering values along with the crop growth. In this study, Sentinel-1 SAR data is used, which is freely available in dual polarimetric mode with a temporal revisit of 12 days with respect to the transmitter polarizations. In this work, we attempt to decompose the targets from dual polarised SAR data using entropy and alpha bands of H-A-alpha decomposition. The entropy and alpha band clusters are obtained by using K-means unsupervised classification is utilized for target decomposition. The clustering process is repeated 30 times for 100 iterations to obtain the optimum grouping of pixels. The clusters are plotted on the H-alpha plane to get an H-alpha plot of dual-polarization SAR data for target decomposition. The obtained H-alpha plot is used to identify the crop stages and its scattering mechanism at different growth stages. Crops grown in selected crop fields during the considered period include ginger, tobacco, rice, cabbage, and pumpkin. An attempt is made by plotting the time-series trends of early and late-planted crops with peak mature stages in terms of backscattering analysis, and the results were compared to the H-alpha plot to gain a better understanding of crop growth scattering mechanisms at various growth stages. Although the backscattering values for the VH and VV polarizations of crops are different, the temporal backscattering study showed the same trend for both polarizations with good similarity of VH polarization than VV for analyzing crop growth stages. The crop growth scattering mechanism on the H-alpha plane produced similar results to the temporal analysis.

TI  - Modelling the spatial distribution of the classification error of remote sensing data in cocoa agroforestry systems
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cocoa growing is one of the main activities in humid West Africa, which is mainly grown in pure stands. It is the main driver of deforestation and encroachment in protected areas. Cocoa agroforestry systems which have been promoted to mitigate deforestation, needs to be accurately delineated to support a valid monitoring system. Therefore, the aim of this research is to model the spatial distribution of uncertainties in the classification cocoa agroforestry. The study was carried out in Cote d'Ivoire, close to the Tai National Park. The analysis followed three steps (i) image classification based on texture parameters and vegetation indices from Sentinel-1 and -2 data respectively, to train a random forest algorithm. A classified map with the associated probability maps was generated. (ii) Shannon entropy was calculated from the probability maps, to get the error maps at different thresholds (0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5). Then, (iii) the generated error maps were analysed using a Geographically Weighted Regression model to check for spatial autocorrelation. From the results, a producer accuracy (0.88) and a user's accuracy (0.91) were obtained. A small threshold value overestimates the classification error, while a larger threshold will underestimate it. The optimal value was found to be between 0.3 and 0.4. There was no evidence of spatial autocorrelation except for a smaller threshold (0.2). The approach differentiated cocoa from other landcover and detected encroachment in forest. Even though some information was lost in the process, the method is effective for mapping cocoa plantations in Cote d'Ivoire.

T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Dodoma region of Tanzania, overexploitation of natural resources has led to a severe land degradation and, consequently, to the need to restore local ecosystems. Within the possible strategies, the farmer managed natural regeneration agroforestry is strongly being promoted in the area. To validate the utilisation of this practise, this research aims (i) to assess the benefits of trees on microclimate studying the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and tree canopy cover (TCC) in farmlands and (ii) to propose an operative tree density threshold to be set as objective by restoration activities in the area. Data collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle were integrated with Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 satellite imagery. LST was retrieved through the practical single channel algorithm and TCC was calculated with a supervised classification. Pixel-based analyses at a resolution of 30 m and 10 m were performed, and the resulting data statistically analysed through the coefficient of determination, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the Dunn test. Results showed that the TCC of the surveyed areas was 5.1%, and a significant decrease in LST of 1.32 degrees C (p < 0.01) was found in the areas with the highest TCC, during the late dry season. From these preliminary analyses, a threshold of 10% TCC is suggested for farmlands in this agroecological zone to bring beneficial microclimate changes in terms of temperature. Considering the average plant phenotype characteristic of the area, it corresponds to a tree density of 50 trees ha(-1). (C) 2021 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimation of sugar content in sugar beet root based on UAV multi-sensor data
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) is the second largest sugar source crop in the world. Sugar content in its beetroot is an important quality index of sugar beet. Rapid and accurate estimation of sugar content in beetroot is helpful to high-throughput phenotype and genotype breeding. The purpose of the current study is to explore the potential of UAV-based multimodal remote sensing data in sugar content estimation. Multimodal data were collected by different UAV-platform carried with RGB, multi-spectral, thermal infrared, hyperspectral and LiDAR. Spectral, structure and thermal features of canopy were extracted from different sensor combinations to estimate sugar content during sugar accumulation period of beetroot by using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Bayesian Ridge Regression (BRR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The main results are as follows: (i) In estimating sugar content, published vegetation indices (PBI, NDVI, TCARI, etc.) calculated from hyperspectral as spectral features outperformed these of multispectral. Structure features calculated from LiDAR outperformed those from RGB. (ii) Eight newly developed vegetation indices presented better performance than published vegetation indices. Among them (R730-R734)/(R730 + R734) index using two bands and (R694-R714)/(R710-R714) using three bands presented the best performance. (iii) Multimodal data combination from different sensors improved estimation accuracy of sugar content than data from individual sensors. PLSR based multimodal data from LiDAR, hyperspectral, thermal infrared sensor presented the best accuracy with R2 = 0.64 and relative root mean square error (rRMSE) = 7.2 %. These results showed that UAV-based canopy features from multimodal data can be used to quickly and accurately obtain sugar content of beetroot. This study provides a basic reference for estimating bioactive substances in roots of root tuber crops based on multimodal canopy remote sensing data.

TI  - Estimation of hourly actual evapotranspiration over the Tibetan Plateau from multi-source data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) is an important component of the global energy exchange process and hydro-logical cycle. ETa data with high accuracy are of great significance to the understanding of hydrological processes and the regulation of local climate. In this paper, an ETa product with hourly temporal resolution for the entire Tibetan Plateau (TP) was proposed by using Fengyun-4A geostationary satellite data and a random forest (RF) model. Validation between RF-based ETa and in situ observations from six eddy-covariance stations over the TP showed a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.991 mm day(-1). Compared with the ETa results from the surface energy balance system (SEBS), maximum entropy production (MEP) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis Fifth Generation (ERA5) with RMSE values of 1.997 mm day(-1), 2.182 mm day(-1) and 1.555 mm day(-1), respectively, the RF model showed the best performance. The annual RF-based ETa over the entire TP was approximately 365.60 mm. Thus, the total water amount evapotranspired from the TP surface was approximately 9811.01x10(8) t yr(-1). Additionally, diurnal, monthly and seasonal ETa variations in different land cover types and climate zones over the TP and their contributions to the total ETa were clearly quantified.

M3  - Article
AB  - At present, the daily global Total Column carbon monoxide (CO) (TCCO) product from TROPOMI is performed at the highest spatial resolution, which has been broadly adopted in atmospheric CO-related researches. Unfortu-nately, missing data emerges in the TROPOMI TCCO and the studies for the recovery of its missing pixels on a globe-scale are scarce. To address this issue, we develop a novel framework to recover missing data in global TROPOMI TCCO product over land from Jun. 01, 2018 to May. 31, 2021 by fusing multisource data. A finely devised Swath-based Local Ensemble Learning (SLEL) method is proposed due to the spatiotemporal discrepancy of missing pixels. In our study, three validation schemes are employed, including a Cross-Validation technique for each swath, in-situ validation against NDACC and TCCON, and transverse comparison with MOPITT and CAMS TCCO products. Validation results show that the developed framework presents an expected accuracy for recovering missing data in each swath, with daily average R and MB fluctuating around 0.9 and 0 mol/m2, respectively. Meanwhile, the accuracy of recovered results is satisfactory and close to that of TROPOMI, with the R of 0.885 against NDACC and 0.918 against TCCON. Furthermore, the recovered results achieve a small (distinctly) better performance than those of MOPITT (CAMS). The spatial pattern of the recovered TCCO is consistent with that of the MOPITT TCCO and can specify much finer spatial details by comparison with CAMS. As for daily examples, the SLEL method well recovers the missing pixels in global TROPOMI TCCO with rich spatial details, even for some critical missing cases. Seasonal variations of global CO spatial patterns are also clearly captured in our results. The daily full-coverage high-resolution (0.07 degrees) TCCO can help obtain spatio-temporally continuous global changes of CO and support related researches, which is accessible on https://doi. org/10.5281/zenodo.7213104.

TI  - Near-Cloud Aerosol Retrieval Using Machine Learning Techniques, and Implied Direct Radiative Effects
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a lack of satellite-based aerosol retrievals in the vicinity of low-topped clouds, mainly because reflectance from aerosols is overwhelmed by three-dimensional cloud radiative effects. To account for cloud radiative effects on reflectance observations, we develop a Convolutional Neural Network and retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) with 100-500 m horizontal resolution for all cloud-free regions regardless of their distances to clouds. The retrieval uncertainty is 0.01 + 5%AOD, and the mean bias is approximately -2%. In an application to satellite observations, aerosol hygroscopic growth due to humidification near clouds enhances AOD by 100% in regions within 1 km of cloud edges. The humidification effect leads to an overall 55% increase in the clear-sky aerosol direct radiative effect. Although this increase is based on a case study, it highlights the importance of aerosol retrievals in near-cloud regions, and the need to incorporate the humidification effect in radiative forcing estimates.

T2  - TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - A new group of socio-political actors has emerged from the depths of the internet. Thriving in the online Manosphere, the involuntary celibates, or "Incels," are men who feel they have been victimized by feminism. Initially just another misogynist social group online, this article argues that Incels are moving beyond social commentary to become a political movement. This article demonstrates that Incels have begun to craft a particularly violent political ideology drawing on a unique form of misogyny rooted in the construction of a counternarrative to hegemonic masculinity. Using critical narrative analysis, this article assesses the discourse and narratives used by the Incels to create their unique worldview and identifies core components of their emerging political ideology to understand how this group may justify the use of political violence as part of their political movement.

TI  - Detection of wet snow in the Arctic tundra from time-series fully-polarimetric RADARSAT-2 images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow melt onset detection and mapping of snow extent during the spring melt period using spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is important for various applications including understanding and predicting snowmelt runoff, flood hazard risk, and freshwater resource supply. In this study, we investigated the time-series evolution of RADARSAT-2 C-band HH, VV, VH and HV radar backscattering coefficients and scattering contributions during the spring melt seasons of 2017 and 2018 over the Niaqunguk (Apex) River, Nunavut, Canada. Meteo-rological observations and optical Planet satellite images were analyzed to support interpretations of SAR data in relation to snowpack warming and melt processes at the high spatial resolution of 6 m. Our results suggest that the cross-polarization (HV and VH) backscatter from snow significantly dropped by-10.7 dB when the air temperatures became positive and snowpack moisture content began to increase (i.e., melt onset). Co -polarization (HH and VV) backscatter from snow also decreased, but by a smaller magnitude of-7.4 dB. Freeman-Durden decomposition analysis suggested that the volume scattering contribution dropped drastically, and surface scattering dominated at the melt onset. The timing of melt onset can be readily inferred from the temporal changes in backscatter signal, which was particularly pronounced in the HV time-series. The back -scatter decrease (e.g., 2.5 dB for HH and 3.4 dB for HV) associated with melt onset was also pronounced for large areas, where both snow-covered and snow-free surfaces were present, and water was masked out. Cross -polarization signal demonstrated better separability between snow-free and snow-covered surfaces than co -polarization signal throughout the melt season. This suggests that the HV backscatter signal is more suitable for snow melt onset and snow/ground detection compared to conventionally used HH and VV, given the in-strument noise floor is sufficiently low to capture the HV signal variations. Our classification results demon-strated slightly higher overall accuracy for HV (83.9%) than for HH (82.7%) signal. However, snow and bare -ground classification accuracies were limited to the late season period when class separabilities were lower compared to the earlier melt season, preventing robust assessment of classification accuracy using HV back -scatter due to limited ground truth data.

TI  - Profiling of metabolic alterations in mice infected with malaria parasites via high-resolution metabolomics
T2  - MOLECULAR AND BIOCHEMICAL PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Malaria infection can result in distinct clinical outcomes from asymptomatic to severe. The association between patho-physiological changes and molecular changes in the host, and their correlation with severity of malaria progression is not fully understood. Methods: In this study, we addressed mass spectrometry-based temporal profiling of serum metabolite levels from mice infected with Plasmodium berhgei (strain ANKA). Results: We show global perturbations and identify changes in specific metabolites in correlation with disease progression. While metabolome-wide changes were apparent in late-stage malaria, a subset of metabolites exhibited highly correlated changes with disease progression. These metabolites changed early on following infection and either continued or maintained the change as mice developed severe disease. Some of these have the potential to be sentinel metabolites for severe malaria. Moreover, glycolytic metabolites, purine nucleotide precursors, tryptophan and its bioactive derivatives were many fold decreased in late-stage disease. Interestingly, uric acid, a metabolic waste reported to be elevated in severe human malaria, increased with disease progression, and subsequently appears to be detoxified into allantoin. This detoxification mechanism is absent in humans as they lack the enzyme uricase. Conclusions: We have identified candidate marker metabolites that may be of relevance in the context of human malaria.

TI  - Precise application of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ: A systematic review and meta-analysis of real-world data
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose: Although ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) seldom involves lymph nodes, some patients may upstage to invasive disease, thus requiring a second surgery for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB). However, the indications of SLNB remain inconclusive and clinical trials are rarely available. Our aim is to systematically review the real-world data to evaluate whether SLNB is precisely applied in patients with a high risk of upstaging from DCIS to invasive carcinoma.Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases were searched. Prospective and retrospective cohort studies that evaluated the pathological outcomes of SLNB and the upstaging rate in women with DCIS were included. The primary outcomes were the upstaging and SLN-positive rates of patients initially diagnosed as having DCIS. We analyzed factors, namely biopsy methods, clinical presentations, histological patterns, and hormone receptor status, that potentially indicate nodal involvement risk.Results: We retrieved 43 prospective and 69 retrospective studies including 44,001 patients. The pooled estimates of upstaging and SLN-positive rates were 25.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.230-0.286) and 4.9% (95% CI: 0.042-0.055), respectively. In subgroup analysis, the upstaging rate was significantly higher in patients with estrogen receptor-negative status, palpable mass, tumor size >2 cm on imaging, and high-nuclear grade and those who received a preoperative diagnosis through core needle biopsy.Conclusion: The upstaging and SLN-positive rates of DCIS were 25.8% and 4.9%, respectively. By selecting pa-tients with high risk DCIS, surgeons may increase the precision of and reduce the excess and incomplete treat-ment rates of SLNB.

TI  - Modeling of the thermal regime of rivers subject to seasonal ice cover using data from different sources and temporal resolutions
T2  - CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive picture of the spatial and temporal patterns of river thermal regimes requires temperature recorded over continuous long time series and across various environments. Unfortunately, these data are generally scarce in extended areas. In Canada, the first attempt to a general large-scale characterization of river thermal regimes was done using a standardized three-parameter Gaussian function and continuous temperature records collected in 158 Quebec rivers. This model provided estimates of the river temperature annual maximum, the date of the annual maximum occurrence and the duration of the warm season, with confidence intervals linked to the duration of the available time series. This resulting thermal map was however limited spatially by the geographical location of the monitoring stations, restricted to the eastern portion of the province. It was also based on relatively short and recent temperature series, with most records shorter than five years and starting after 2010. In this work, we expanded both the space and time spans of the Quebec rivers thermal map by adding new temperature data sources, namely satellite thermal data and spot measurements. Satellite data provided thermal information in remote northern regions where in situ data acquisition is difficult, from early 1980s until today. Spot measurements from the Banque de donnees sur la qualite des milieux aquatiques allowed to add nearly 250 rivers to the Quebec thermal regimes characterization, with several stations operating since 1979. These three data sources were combined to characterize Quebec rivers thermal regimes in more than 400 rivers and streams, over an extended geographical distribution. Uncertainty brought by the coarser temporal resolution of the spot and combined time series was assessed and found to result in substantially larger confidence intervals on the estimated model parameters, as compared with the confidence intervals obtained when using continuous time series of similar length.

TI  - Unravelling lake water storage change in Central Asia: Rapid decrease in tail-end lakes and increasing risks to water supply
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There are extensive and fragile mountain-oasis-desert ecosystems in Central Asia. Lakes are not only the most important water resources in arid Central Asia, but also important resources for maintaining the unique ecosystem of the region. As most lakes in Central Asia lack in situ monitoring data, and satellite altimetry records are relatively short-term, the continuous long-term monitoring of lake water storage change (LWSC) in Central Asia is inadequate. To this end, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model data were used in conjunction with all available Landsat images to construct an empirical model of area-elevation-storage changes and estimate the maximum LWSC (maxLWSC) and minimum LWSC (minLWSC) of 9,619 lakes (watershed area > 10 km(2)) in Central Asia from 1990 to 2020. Subsequently, the random forest (RF) algorithm was used to quantitatively evaluate the associations among climate change, human activities, and LWSC. It was revealed that maxLWSC and minLWSC decreased by 27.94 and 144.21 Gt, respectively. The results also revealed that LWSC varied by elevation, whereby lakes below 3,500 m shrunk and those above 3,500 m expanded. The RF findings demonstrated that human activities are more important than climate change for LWSC in Central Asia. Up to 96 % of LWSC can be explained by human activities. This study comprehensively evaluates the characteristics of LWSC in Central Asia, providing the latest data to help alleviate the contradiction between water supply and demand in Central Asia and resolve cross-border water resource disputes, so as to realize the protection of fragile regional ecosystems.

TI  - Changes in aerosol loading before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in China: Effects of anthropogenic and natural aerosol
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic emissions reduced sharply in the short-term during the coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19). As COVID-19 is still ongoing, changes in atmospheric aerosol loading over China and the factors of their variations remain unclear. In this study, we used multi-source satellite observations and reanalysis datasets to synergistically analyze the spring (February-May) evolution of aerosol optical depth (AOD) for multiple aerosol types over Eastern China (EC) before, during and after the COVID-19 lockdown period. Regional meteorological effects and the radiative response were also quantitatively assessed. Compared to the same period before COVID-19 (i.e., in 2019), a total decrease of -14.6 % in tropospheric TROPOMI nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and a decrease of -6.8 % in MODIS AOD were observed over EC during the lockdown period (i.e., in 2020). After the lockdown period (i.e., in 2021), anthropogenic emissions returned to previous levels and there was a slight increase (+2.3 %) in AOD over EC. Moreover, changes in aerosol loading have spatial differences. AOD decreased significantly in the North China Plain (-14.0 %, NCP) and Yangtze River Delta (-9.4 %) regions, where anthropogenic aerosol dominated the aerosol loading. Impacted by strong wild-fires in Southeast Asia during the lockdown period, carbonaceous AOD increased by +9.1 % in South China, which partially offset the emission reductions. Extreme dust storms swept through the northern region in the period after COVID-19, with an increase of +23.5 % in NCP and + 42.9 % in Northeast China (NEC) for dust AOD. However, un-favorable meteorological conditions overwhelmed the benefits of emission reductions, resulting in a +20.1 % increase in AOD in NEC during the lockdown period. Furthermore, the downward shortwave radiative flux showed a positive anomaly due to the reduced aerosol loading in the atmosphere during the lockdown period. This study highlights that we can benefit from short-term controls for the improvement of air pollution, but we also need to seriously considered the cross-regional transport of natural aerosol and meteorological drivers.

TI  - Upper Ocean Response to The Passage of Cyclone Tauktae in The Eastern Arabian Sea Using In Situ and Multi-Platform Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The present work examines the response of physical and biogeochemical processes of the upper ocean during the crossing of cyclone Tauktae (14-19 May 2021) over the eastern Arabian Sea utilizing satellite and in situ data. Tauktae cyclone was developed as a depression on 14 May and subsequently intensified into an extremely severe cyclonic storm on 17 May 2021. The observational data obtained from the moored buoy and ARGO floats are used to evaluate the changes in the upper ocean induced by the cyclonic event. Translation speed of the Tauktae cyclone decreased suddenly on 17 May 2021 (early morning) which enhanced the further intensification. The presence of an anticyclonic eddy (warm core) in the proximity of the cyclone track played a crucial role in the sudden increase in the intensity of the cyclone. Remarkable sea surface temperature cooling is observed along the cyclone track, with maximum surface cooling of 1.5-2 degrees C. The observations show that the isothermal layer depth increased by about 20-30 m due to the strong vertical mixing caused by cyclonic winds. Analysis of subsurface temperature obtained from ARGO floats and RAMA buoy revealed the extent of vertical mixing induced by the cyclone Tauktae. The regions that experienced intense upwelling induced by the cyclone are identified by estimating the Ekman pumping velocity. Significant upwelling occurred in the proximity of the center of the cyclone due to the divergence of the surface water induced by the Ekman transport. An abrupt out-gassing of CO2 from the ocean to the atmosphere was noticed and the magnitude was found to be increased about 8-fold compared to the pre-cyclone values.

TI  - Rethinking professional identity formation amidst protests and social upheaval: a journey in Africa
T2  - ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The under-representation of minoritized or previously oppressed groups in research challenges the current universal understanding of professional identity formation (PIF). To date, there has been no recognition of an African influence on PIF, which is crucial for understanding this phenomenon in places like South Africa, a society in which the inequity of the apartheid era still prevails. In addition, there is little data examining how social upheaval could impact PIF. This study uses interviews with medical students to explore PIF within the context of social upheaval during the 2015-2016 protests that rocked South Africa when students challenged asymmetries of power and privilege that persisted long after the country's democratic transition. The combination of the primary author's autoethnographic story, weaved into the South African sociohistorical context and ubuntu philosophy, contributes to this study of PIF in the South African context. The use of an African metaphor allowed the reorientation of PIF to reflect the influence of an ubuntu-based value system. Using the calabash as a metaphor, participants' experiences were framed and organized in two ways: a calabash worldview and the campus calabash. The calabash worldview is a multidimensional mixture of values that include ubuntu, reflections of traditional childhoods, and the image of women as igneous rocks, which recognizes the power and influence on PIF of the women who raised the participants. Introducing an African ubuntu-based perspective into the PIF discourse may redirect the acknowledgement of context and local reality in developing professional identity.

TI  - Do Worldviews Matter for Implementation-Relevant Responses to Mindfulness-Based Interventions? An Empirical Investigation of Existential and Religious Perspectives
T2  - MINDFULNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) touch on concepts deemed spiritual or religious in the popular imagination, which may interact with participants' own religious beliefs to influence implementation-relevant outcomes.Methods Four studies examined how interactions between different (a) religious framings of MBIs and participants' religious and existential characteristics are related to participant responses to the MBIs. Two cross-sectional studies (N = 480 MTurk participants and N = 266 undergraduates) examined associations between individual differences in religious/existential characteristics (scriptural literalism and existential flexibility) and participants' willingness to try mindfulness described as (a) secular, (b) spiritual, (c) Buddhist, (d) from one's own religion, or (e) from an unspecified background. Next, two experiments (N = 677 MTurk participants and N = 157 undergraduates) randomized participants to brief MBIs framed as either "secular," "spiritual," or "Buddhist," and examined acceptability of the MBI post-intervention.Results Both cross-sectional studies revealed interactions of participant characteristics and MBI labels on willingness to try the MBI. Existential flexibility was positively associated with willingness to try mindfulness overall, and willingness to try "secular" and "Buddhist" mindfulness. Scriptural literalism was positively associated with greater willingness to try mindfulness labeled as "spiritual" or "from your own religious tradition," and negatively with "Buddhist" or "secular" mindfulness. In the experimental studies, condition moderated the association between existential flexibility and acceptability ratings of the MBI, with only a positive simple effect of existential flexibility on acceptability of the Buddhist condition observed in both studies.Conclusions MBI framing, as well as participants' religious and existential perspectives, may influence MBI acceptability and implementation.

TI  - Quantitative estimation of sentinel-1A interferometric decorrelation using vegetation index
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1A data are widely used in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) studies due to the free and open access policy. However, the short wavelength (C-band) of Sentinal-1A data leads to decorrelation in numerous applications, especially in vegetated areas. Phase blurring and reduced monitoring accuracy can occur owing to changes in the physical and chemical characteristics of vegetation during the satellite revisit period, which essentially makes poor use of SAR data and increases the time and economic costs for researchers. Interferometric coherence is a commonly used index to measure the interference quality of two single-look complex (SLC) images, and its value can be used to characterize the decorrelation degree. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is obtained from optical images, and its value can be used to characterize the surface vegetation coverage. In order to solve the problem that Sentinel-1A decorrelation in the vegetated area is difficult to estimate prior to single-look complex interference, this paper selects a vegetated area in Sichuan Province, China as the study area and establishes two two-order linear quantitative models between Landsat8-derived normalized difference vegetation index and Sentinel-1A interferometric coherence in co- and cross-polarization: When NDVI at extremely high and low levels, coherence is close to zero, while NDVI and coherence show two different linear relationships in co- and cross-polarization in terms of NDVI at the middle level. The models global error basically obeys the normal distribution with the mean value of -0.037 and -0.045, and the standard deviation of 0.205 and 0.201 at the VV and VH channels. The two models are then validated in two validation areas, and the results confirm the reliability of the models and reveal the relationships between Sentinel-1A InSAR decorrelation and vegetation coverage in co- and cross-polarization, thus demonstrating that the NDVI can be applied to quantitatively estimate the InSAR decorrelation in vegetated area of Sentinel-1A data in both polarization modes prior to SLC interference.

TI  - Characterization and attribution of vegetation dynamics in the ecologically fragile South China Karst: Evidence from three decadal Landsat observations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant growth and its changes over space and time are effective indicators for signifying ecosystem health. However, large uncertainties remain in characterizing and attributing vegetation changes in the ecologically fragile South China Karst region, since most existing studies were conducted at a coarse spatial resolution or covered limited time spans. Considering the highly fragmented landscapes in the region, this hinders their capability in detecting fine information of vegetation dynamics taking place at local scales and comprehending the influence of climate change usually over relatively long temporal ranges. Here, we explored the spatiotemporal variations in vegetation greenness for the entire South China Karst region (1.9 million km(2)) at a resolution of 30m for the notably increased time span (1987-2018) using three decadal Landsat images and the cloud-based Google Earth Engine. Moreover, we spatially attributed the vegetation changes and quantified the relative contribution of driving factors. Our results revealed a widespread vegetation recovery in the South China Karst (74.80%) during the past three decades. Notably, the area of vegetation recovery tripled following the implementation of ecological engineering compared with the reference period (1987-1999). Meanwhile, the vegetation restoration trend was strongly sustainable beyond 2018 as demonstrated by the Hurst exponent. Furthermore, climate change contributed only one-fifth to vegetation restoration, whereas major vegetation recovery was highly attributable to afforestation projects, implying that anthropogenic influences accelerated vegetation greenness gains in karst areas since the start of the new millennium during which ecological engineering was continually established. Our study provides additional insights into ecological restoration and conservation in the highly heterogeneous karst landscapes and other similar ecologically fragile areas worldwide.

TI  - Spatio-temporal development of the urban heat island in a socioeconomically diverse tropical city
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands, where temperatures are elevated relative to non-urban surrounds, are near-ubiquitous in cities globally. Yet, the magnitude and form of urban heat islands in the tropics, where heat has a large morbidity and mortality burden, is not well understood, especially for those of urban informal settlements. We used 29 years of Landsat satellite-derived surface temperature, corroborated by in situ temperature measurements, to provide a detailed spatial and temporal assessment of urban heat islands in Makassar, Indonesia, a city that is representative of rapidly growing urban settlements across the tropics. Our analysis identified surface urban heat islands of up to 9.2 C in long-urbanised parts of the city and 6.3 C in informal settlements, the seasonal patterns of which were driven by change in non-urban areas rather than in urban areas themselves. In recently urbanised areas, the majority of urban heat island increase occurred before land became 50% urbanised, whereas the established heat island in long-urbanised areas remained stable in response to urban expansion. Green and blue space protected some informal settlements from the worst urban heat islands observed across the city and maintenance of such space will be essential to mitigate the growing heat burden from urban expansion and anthropogenic climate change. Settlements further than 4 km from the coast and with Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) less than 0.2 had higher surface temperatures, with modelled effects of more than 5 C. Surface temperature measurements were representative of in situ heat exposure, measured in a subset of 12 informal settlements, where mean indoor temperature had the strongest relationship with surface temperature (R2 = 0.413, P = 0.001). We advocate for green space to be prioritised in urban planning, redevelopment and informal settlement upgrading programs, with consideration of the unique environmental and socioeconomic context of tropical cities.

TI  - Millennial femininity and the harmonious state of mind
T2  - CURRENT SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article depicts feminine subjectivity among women of the millennial generation. Content analysis of an open question relating to the answers of 623 Israeli participants reveals perceptions of femininity as at once gender conscious and non-political. Respondents express a strong sense of entitlement to gender equality yet retain an essentialized perception of gender differences. They are aware of the contradictory demands directed at women, but avoid problematizing them, instead priding themselves on their capacity to encompass both feminine and masculine traits without losing femininity. We identify in the women's framing a strong commitment to a harmonious worldview and a non-political outlook and trace it to the influences of the global, late-modern generational preoccupation with personal transformation, self-governmentality, and positive thinking.

TI  - FarmCan: a physical, statistical, and machine learning model to forecast crop water deficit for farms
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the coming decades, a changing climate, the loss of high-quality land, the slowing in the annual yield of cereals, and increasing fertilizer use indicate that better agricultural water management strategies are needed. In this study, we designed FarmCan, a novel, robust remote sensing and machine learning (ML) framework to forecast farms' needed daily crop water quantity or needed irrigation (NI). We used a diverse set of simulated and observed near-real-time (NRT) remote sensing data coupled with a random forest (RF) algorithm and inputs about farm-specific situations to predict the amount and timing of evapotranspiration (ET), potential ET (PET), soil moisture (SM), and root zone soil moisture (RZSM). Our case study of four farms in the Canadian Prairies Ecozone (CPE) shows that 8 d composite precipitation (P) has the highest correlation with changes (Delta) of RZSM and SM. In contrast, 8 d PET and 8 d ET do not offer a strong correlation with 8 d P. Using R-2, root mean square error (RMSE), and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) indicators, our algorithm could reasonably calculate daily NI up to 14 d in advance. From 2015 to 2020, the R-2 values between predicted and observed 8 d ET and 8 d PET were the highest (80 % and 54 %, respectively). The 8 d NI also had an average R-2 of 68%. The KGE of the 8 d ET and 8 d PET in four study farms showed an average of 0.71 and 0.50, respectively, with an average KGE of 0.62. FarmCan can be used in any region of the world to help stakeholders make decisions during prolonged periods of drought or waterlogged conditions, schedule cropping and fertilization, and address local government policy concerns.

TI  - Multisource Remote Sensing Based Estimation of Soil NO<sub><i>x</i></sub> Emissions From Fertilized Cropland at High-Resolution: Spatio-Temporal Patterns and Impacts
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from agricultural areas currently dominate in some regions around the world. Since China is largely an agricultural country, an accurate estimation of soil NOx emissions from agricultural areas is essential for monitoring air pollution. In this study, we use high-resolution multi-source remote sensing data to enhance data inputs to existing empirical NOx emission models, with a particular emphasis on crop phenological features and the impact of nitrogen fertilizer application on NOx at the grid level. As a result, a high-resolution emission inventory of soil NOx from agricultural areas in China is built. According to the emission inventory, total national NOx emissions from fertilized croplands were 3,741 +/- 0.39, 3,231 +/- 0.39, and 3,059 +/- 0.39 Gg N/yr during 2017-2019, respectively. Moreover, in 2017, soil NOx emissions contributed to 17.3% of the total emissions. It was found the "Hu Huanyong Line" (Hu line) is a dividing line for China's agricultural soil NOx emissions, with soil NOx emissions dominating in the west of the Hu line while being high in the east. The results also show that emissions are highest in summer and lowest in winter, with a significant difference between the two seasons. Furthermore, crop cultivation structure can affect overall soil NOx emissions, which suggests a potential NOx reduction strategy. We demonstrate that the established emission inventory can precisely reflect the distribution of soil NOx emissions in China's agricultural areas, which will be beneficial to overall NOx emission control and air quality improvement.

TI  - The experiences of non-religious children in religious education
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - There is growing recognition of the need for pupils to have the opportunity to engage with both religious and non-religious worldviews in religious education (RE). This recognition is bound up with issues of social justice and equality, underpinned by a desire to ensure that all young people should have the opportunity 'to understand the worldviews of others and reflect on their own' (Commission on Religious Education 2018: 26). In thinking about how best to provide non-religious pupils with opportunities to reflect on their own worldviews, beliefs, and moral commitments, we should take into account their current experiences in RE. This article therefore offers original insight into the experiences and perspectives of non-religious primary school children in relation to RE. We draw on data from a qualitative study exploring what it means to be 'non-religious' for primary school children in three different areas of England. Through presenting how these children reflect on RE, we see that they care about social justice but also that their own experiences of RE can be seen as perpetuating a 'hermeneutic injustice' (Fricker, 2007) as they are not being given interpretive resources to make sense of their own experiences and worldviews. We argue that giving children the opportunity to explore the kind of 'emerging worldview' (Beaman, 2017) that they themselves express might be one way to overcome this inequality and provide them with a language to reflect on their beliefs and values and enter into meaningful conversation with others.

TI  - Summertime variability of aerosols and covariates over Saudi Arabia using remote sensing
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The summer season is the longest in Saudi Arabia and thus significantly modifies the aerosol concentration in the country. Hydrometeorological parameters when exposed to and interacting with multiple source aerosols produce a radiative climatic response. This study was made to analyze the space-time dynamics of aerosol optical depth (AOD) with prevailing meteorological and surface parameters from the summer of 2003 to 2016. Level 3 daily products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) were used. Covariates such as surface temperature, ozone, and relative humidity (RH) from AIRS, and SO2, dust column mass density (CMD), and dust surface mass concentration (SMC) were also used on a daily time scale. The spatial distribution of AOD showed high concentration (0.5-0.9) over southern and southeastern regions, whereas relatively low concentrations were present in the northern and northwestern regions. For trend observation of AOD, the Mann-Kendall trend test was used, which manifested an increasing trend in the southern and southwestern regions, whereas a decreasing trend in the northern and central regions of Saudi Arabia was observed. Correlation analysis was performed between AOD and meteorological parameters, in which slightly similar patterns were observed for the same variables. Wavelet analysis displays significant periodicity in the 16-64 band. The wavelet coherency analysis provides the abundance of in-phase, anti-phase, leading, and lagging situations in the 16-64 periodic band, along with a few interjections of the 64-128 periodic band. Through this, an obvious difference was concluded in space-time patterns between MODIS and MISR datasets. These findings may prove useful for short-term and long-term studies including oscillating features of AOD and covariates.

TI  - Modelling spatiotemporal carbon dioxide emission at the urban scale based on DMSP-OLS and NPP-VIIRS data: A case study in China
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon emissions from urban areas are pivotal in meeting emission reduction targets. While carbon emissions in the coastal areas of urban China have been clarified, those for central cities in the west remain limited, despite rapid economic development likely raising them. Here, we developed a model to estimate carbon emissions from land under construction in urban areas of Chengdu, China, using remote sensing data and carbon emission statistics. The spatial distribution of carbon emissions was quantified from spatial analyses using a geographic information system (GIS). The feasibility of the proposed model for estimating urban carbon emissions was supported by the high R2 for estimated and statistical carbon emissions (>0.87) and the F-test (F-statistic >112.59). During 2000-2015, carbon emissions from construction land increased substantially (by 19.09 Mg C), with emissions increasing from core cities and beyond. Carbon emissions clearly differed among construction areas in Chengdu's districts, adjacent counties, and outer counties. The results of this study could help guide the development of policies and plans for managing carbon emissions, emission density, and urban sustainability.

TI  - Coastal subsidence detection and characterization caused by brine mining over the Yellow River Delta using time series InSAR and PCA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive coastal deltas in the world are subsiding due to natural or anthropogenic activities. As the widest and youngest river delta in the world, serious coastal subsidence in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) has exacerbated the relative sea level rise (RSLR) and increased the risk of soil salinization and coastal flooding. However, there are rarely relevant studies that quantitatively separate the contributions from different driving factors to subsidence. In this work, we aim to provide a detailed and comprehensive analysis of coastal subsidence related to coastal brine pumping activities in YRD. We investigate the land deformation of the entire YRD by time series InSAR analysis (TS-InSAR) of Sentinel-1 images acquired between 2016 and 2021. The results reveal that fast subsiding funnels larger than 50 mm/yr are mainly distributed in the coastal brine mining clusters. We further used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract the principal components and temporal patterns from the deformation time series. Taking geological data, precipitation, temperature, and human activities into consideration, we quantitatively separate the driving factors of coastal subsidence in sub-areas. We find that underground brine mining contributes to more than 94 % of the coastal subsidence of the YRD. In addition, precipitation is the most important natural factor that can affect the process of land subsidence in YRD, whereas other driving factors from soil consolidation, oil extraction and other activities are not noticeable. This study is expected to offer a cost-effective method for detecting and characterizing coastal subsidence in global sinking deltas, which will contribute to more accurate dynamic monitoring of coastal subsidence and a better understanding of land subsidence responses to anthropogenic activities.

TI  - Vehicle routing optimization for rural package collection and delivery integrated with regard to the customer self-pickup radius
T2  - APPLIED ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper explores the optimization for the integrated vehicle routing of package collection and delivery in rural areas, based on the coverage idea and customer self-pickup strategy. The purpose is to optimize package collection and delivery in rural areas with the scattered and small-scale demand for the express service. An integrated vehicle routing model for rural package collection and delivery is established with regard to the radius of customer self-pickup, via taking the sum of operation cost, transportation cost, time penalty cost and carbon emission cost as the optimization goal. A two-stage algorithm based on the improved k-means clustering algorithm and genetic algorithm is designed to solve the model. Ziyuan county of Guangxi province is taken for typical example. The simulation results show that the optimization model can raise vehicle loading rate and service coverage rate, while reducing cost. A rise in the customer's self-pickup radius and the number of packages collected and delivered can decrease the unit collection and delivery cost, and it is found that carbon emissions have little effects on the optimization of vehicle routing from the perspective of cost.

TI  - Urban black and odorous water body mapping from Gaofen-2 images
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology has shown its irreplaceable advantages in the identification of urban black and odorous water body. However, the universality of the remote sensing recognition algorithm for the black and odorous water body is not clear in different regions. Thus, two typical cities, Shenyang and Nanjing, were selected from northern and southern China as the study areas. Four forms of recognition models of the black and odorous water body are built based on Gaofen-2 images, including the single-band model, difference model, ratio model, and water quality parameter model. Combined with the remote sensing interpretation marks of black and odorous water body, the recognition precision of black and odorous water body is analyzed by the methods of the confusion matrix and Kappa coefficient. The results show that the overall accuracy of the normalized difference black-odorous water index (NDBWI) model is higher than 80% in the northern and southern cities of China, with good consistency of spatial distribution. The accuracy of the black and odorous water index model and G model is higher than 75% only in the special areas of Nanjing or Shenyang. The accuracy of other models is generally low. Research show that the NDBWI model has better universality in the identification of urban black and odorous water body, and it is suitable for promotion and application. The remote sensing interpretation marks of black and odorous water body have shown a good auxiliary identification function. The research provides a technical foundation for large-scale and rapid identification of urban black and odorous water body.

TI  - Reveal the severe spatial and temporal patterns of abandoned cropland in China over the past 30 years
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The abandonment phenomenon is familiar in China. It threatens food security and seriously affects the sustainable development of society, the economy, and the natural environment. However, monitoring and mapping abandoned cropland on a large scale remains a challenge because of its complex land-use change process. According to the World Food and Agriculture Organization, cropland not used for agricultural production for more than 5 years is defined as abandoned cropland. This study uses the Landsat high-precision long-time series product to detect cropland nationwide from 1990 to 2019 by using the sliding window method on Google Earth Engine to profile the spatial distribution, intensity, trend, frequency, and recultivation of abandoned cropland. Between 1992 and 2015, the results illustrate that the total area of abandoned cropland in China was 559,170.26 km(2), 18.59% of the cropland area. Excluding the recultivated cropland area, China's abandoned cropland area amounted to 392,156.24 km(2), 13.03 % of the total cropland. Cropland abandonment is mainly distributed in the second terrain gradient in midwestern and southwestern regions such as Inner Mongolia and Gansu. It rarely happens in western and eastern coastal areas. A high abandonment rate area usually has high elevation and slope. The light index is negatively correlated with the abandonment rate in suburban areas. This study is the first to map the spatiotemporal distribution of abandoned cropland in China with high precision at 30 m resolution. It provides an important basis for policies regarding the recultivation of abandoned cropland.

TI  - Glacial Lake Area Changes in High Mountain Asia during 1990-2020 Using Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in a large-scale glacial lake area directly reflect the regional glacier status and climate changes. However, long time series of glacial lake dataset and comprehensive investigation of the spatiotemporal changes in the glacial lake area in the whole High Mountain Asia (HMA) region remained elusive. Satellite remote sensing provides an indispensable way for dynamic monitoring of glacial lakes over large regions. But glacial lakes are quite small and discretely distributed, and the extraction of glacial lakes is usually influenced by clouds, snow/ice cover, and terrain shadows; thus, there is a lack of an automatic method to continuously monitor the dynamic changes of glacial lakes in a large scale. In this paper, we developed a per-pixel composited method named the "multitemporal mean NDWI composite" to automatically extract the glacial lake area in HMA from 1990 to 2020 using time-series Landsat data. There were 19,294 glacial lakes covering a total area of 1471.85 +/- 366.42 k m2 in 1990, and 22,646 glacial lakes with an area of 1729.08 +/- 461.31 km(2) in 2020. It is noted that the glacial lake area in the whole HMA region expanded by 0.58 +/- 0.21%/a over the past three decades, with high spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The glacial lake area increased at a consistent speed over time. The fastest expansion was in East Kun Lun at an average rate of 2.01 +/- 0.54%/a, while in the Pamir and Hengduan Shan, they show slow increases with rates of 0.33 +/- 0.08%/a and 0.39 +/- 0.01 %/a, respectively, during 1990-2020. The greatest increase in lake area occurred at 5000-5200 m a.s.l., which increased by about 45 km(2) (similar to 25%). We conclude that the temperature rise and glacier thinning are the leading factors of glacial lake expansion in HMA, and precipitation is the main source of lake water increase in West Kun Lun. Using the proposed method, a large amount of Landsat images from successive years of melting seasons can be fully utilized to obtain a pixel-level composited cloud-free and solid snow/ice-free glacial lake map. The uncertainties from supraglacial ponds and glacial meltwater were also estimated to improve the reliability and comparability of glacial lake area changes among different regions. This study provides important technical and data support for regional climate changes, glacier hydrology, and disaster analysis.

TI  - Satellite data-driven and knowledge-informed machine learning model for estimating global internal solitary wave speed
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Internal solitary waves (ISW) are widely distributed worldwide and significantly affect the ocean environment and offshore activities. ISW propagation speed is important for ISW forecasts and varies largely globally. This study collected 810 quasi-synchronous optical satellite images with clear ISW signatures in 13 global hotspots to build a large ISW dataset. ISW speed was calculated using extracted ISW wave crest locations and the time difference between satellite image pairs. The dataset contains 57,196 samples, including extracted ISW wave crests and corresponding ISW phase speed. We developed an ISW propagation speed (IPS) model based on the dataset using machine learning techniques. The model structure includes clustering and regression algorithms. The model adopts two tailored modifications to incorporate the ISW domain knowledge and solve the ISW sample distribution imbalance problems. Implementation domain knowledge (IDK) includes selecting relevant ocean factors and ISW properties based on oceanography theory and remote sensing imaging mechanisms. The second tailored modification is adopting advanced model architecture (AMA) by introducing the Gaussian clustering algorithm to classify ISW samples into several groups beyond the limitation of space and time. The extreme gradient boosting regression algorithm was applied in each group to build the IPS model. We used 47,425 samples as the training dataset and the remaining 9771 samples as the test dataset. The model-predicted ISW speed shows good accuracy, with a root mean square error/relative error rate (RER) of 0.16 (7.9) and 0.30 m/s (12.7%) on the training and test dataset. Analysis shows that IDK and AMA improve the model performance by 19.4% and 13.1%, respectively. With a one-pixel error in the peak-to-peak distance of input parameters, the model results degraded from 0.30 m/s to 0.33 m/s. The IPS model was applied to estimate ISW speeds in ocean regions besides the 13 hotspots, and the average RER is 6.0%. ISW forecast in seven ocean areas was tested, and the results indicate that the IPS model can describe ISW propagation patterns. The model results reveal that the ISW phase speed strongly correlates with the spring and neap tide. The IPS model results show that ISW speed is decreased with a deepening stratification. Model-predicted global ISW propagation speed comparison shows that the Celebes Sea and North-West of South America has the fastest and slowest propagating ISWs all year around, respectively. Discussion on the background current's influence on the IPS model results is presented.

TI  - Individual tree-based vs pixel-based approaches to mapping forest functional traits and diversity by remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant ecology and biodiversity research have increasingly incorporated trait-based approaches and remote sensing. Compared with traditional field survey (which typically samples individual trees), remote sensing enables quantifying functional traits over large contiguous areas, but assigning trait values to biological units such as species and individuals is difficult with pixel-based approaches. We used a subtropical forest landscape in China to compare an approach based on airborne LiDAR-delineated individual tree crowns (ITCs) with a pixelbased approach for assessing functional traits from remote sensing data. We compared trait distributions, trait-trait relationships and functional diversity metrics obtained by the ITC- and pixel-based approaches at changing pixel size and extent. We found that morphological traits derived from airborne laser scanning showed more differences between ITC- and pixel-based approaches than physiological traits estimated by airborne Pushbroom Hyperspectral Imager-3 (PHI-3) hyperspectral data. Pixel sizes approximating average tree crowns yielded similar results as ITCs, but 95th quantile height and foliage height diversity tended to be overestimated and leaf area index underestimated relative to ITC-based values. With increasing pixel size, the differences to ITC-based trait values became larger and less trait variance was captured, indicating information loss. The consistency of ITC- and pixel-based functional richness also decreased with increasing pixel size, and changed with the observed extent for functional diversity monitoring. We conclude that whereas ITC-based approaches in principle allow partitioning of variation between individuals, genotypes and species, high-resolution pixel-based approaches come close to this and can be suitable for assessing ecosystem-scale trait variation by weighting individuals and species according to coverage.

TI  - Glacial lake changes and the identification of potentially dangerous glacial lakes (PDGLs) under warming climate in the Dibang River Basin, Eastern Himalaya, India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming has caused accelerated glacier recession in the Eastern Himalayas. This phenomenon has consequently resulted in the development of new glacial lakes and expansion of the existing ones. The outbursts of these lakes has the potential to cause flashfloods with negative impacts for the downstream community. This study used Remote Sensing data products to develop a glacial lake database of Dibang River Basin for the year 2020. The multi-temporal Landsat series data was used to examine the surficial changes in glacial lakes larger than 0.1 km(2). The key parameters derived from previous glacial lake studies were used to identify the Potentially Dangerous Glacial Lakes (PDGLs) and conduct their hazard assessment. Finally, the Indian Monsoon Data Assimilation and Analysis (IMDAA) data was used to analyze the Temperature and Precipitation trends from 1980 to 2020 to understand timpact of climate change on lake behaviour. Our findings reveal that the study region has 403 glacial lakes with a total area of 55.73 km(2) in 2020. The area of selected glacial lakes has increased from 29.96 km(2) in 1985 to 32.56 km(2) in 2020 at a rate of 0.07 km(2) per year. Twelve (12) lakes were identified as PDGLs in the study region. After applying the weighted index method, 4 lakes among them were categorized as high, 5 as medium and 3 as low hazard glacial lakes. The Mann Kendal test of T-min, T-max and T-mean revealed an increasing trend with a Z statics value of >0, whereas mean precipitation on the contrary showed a significant decreasing trend with a Z statics value of <0. The changes in climatic variables (i.e., temperature and precipitation) indicate that the warmer conditions prevail in the region, causing glacier shrinking and retreat, formation of new lakes and expansion of existing ones. Hence, we propose the continuous monitoring and assessment of high hazard glacial lakes for the prevention and mitigation of Glacier Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) in the study region.

T2  - BMJ SUPPORTIVE & PALLIATIVE CARE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Objectives To assess possible trends between 2009 and 2019 in the Netherlands of palliative care indicators: the provision of palliative care or treatment, hospitalisations in the last month before death, use of specialised palliative care services and place of death. Methods The study design was a repeated retrospective cross-sectional design with questionnaires filled in by general practitioners within a clustered sample of 67 Sentinel practices. Patients whose death was non-sudden, and thus could have received palliative care, between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2019 were included in the study, resulting in 3121 patients. Results Between 2009 and 2019, there is a significant increase in the number of people who receive palliative care or treatment alongside life-prolonging or curative treatment and the number of people who die at home, while the number of hospitalisations in the last month before death and the number of people dying in hospital shows a significant decrease. However, there is no trend in the involvement of specialised palliative care services or people receiving solely palliative care or treatment. Conclusion This study suggests improvements in end-of-life care provided in primary care in the Netherlands. Trends coincided with increased attention to palliative care both in practice and policy. Yet, there is still considerable room for improvement as there is no significant increase in people solely receiving palliative care or treatment and the involvement of specialised palliative care services.

TI  - Automated methods for image detection of cultural heritage: Overviews and perspectives
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data covering large geographical areas can be easily accessed and are being acquired with greater frequency. The massive volume of data requires an automated image analysis system. By taking advantage of the increasing availability of data using computer vision, we can design specific systems to automate data analysis and detection of archaeological objects. In the past decade, there has been a rise in the use of automated methods to assist in the identification of archaeological sites in remote sensing imagery. These applications offer an important contribution to non-intrusive archaeological exploration, helping to reduce the traditional human workload and time by signalling areas with a higher probability of presenting archaeological sites for exploration. This survey describes the state of the art of existing automated image analysis methods in archaeology and highlights the improvements thus achieved in the detection of archaeological monuments and areas of interest in landscape-scale satellite and aerial imagery. It also presents a discussion of the benefits and limitations of automatic detection of archaeological structures, proposing new approaches and possibilities.

TI  - Coupling optical and SAR imagery for automatic garlic mapping
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate garlic identification and mapping are vital for precise crop management and the optimization of yield models. However, previous understandings of garlic identification were limited. Here, we propose an automatic garlic mapping framework using optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images on the Google Earth Engine. Specifically, we firstly mapped winter crops based on the phenology of winter crops derived from Sentinel-2 data. Then, the garlic was identified separately using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data based on the winter crops map. Additionally, multi-source validation data were used to evaluate our results. In garlic mapping, coupled optical and SAR images (OA 95.34% and kappa 0.91) outperformed the use of only optical images (OA 74.78% and kappa 0.50). The algorithm explored the potential of multi-source remote sensing data to identify target crops in mixed and fragmented planting regions. The garlic planting information from the resultant map is essential for optimizing the garlic planting structure, regulating garlic price fluctuations, and promoting a healthy and sustainable development of the garlic industry.

TI  - Investigating slow-moving shallow soil landslides using Sentinel-1 InSAR data in Gisborne, New Zealand
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are widespread geomorphological features on the North Island of New Zealand, where they represent one of the primary landscape-forming processes. This study focuses on the steepland terrain surrounding Gisborne, a city located on the east coast of the North Island, at the Hikurangi subduction margin. This terrain consists of young, weak, sedimentary rocks and soils; the most common modes of slope failures are soil creep, slides and flows in shallow, clay-rich soil and regolith, triggered by heavy rainfall. Based on observational data from Sentinel-1 imagery, this study leverages results from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) processing to reveal the distribution of deformation across Gisborne's steepland periphery from January 2016 to December 2021. Velocities in the line of sight were obtained from the stack of interferograms and projected along the direction of maximum slope, to extract the true displacement on the slopes. The ascending and descending data sets were combined to reveal the vertical and horizontal components of the deformation. The results were combined with a regional LiDAR data set, aerial imagery and field observations to delineate areas of slope deformation. Finally, slope deformation time series data was compared with rainfall records to identify seasonal changes, due to shrinking and swelling of expansive soils. Although the InSAR displacement data contains some noise, results could be used to identify 132 unstable slopes within the study area, caused by soil creep and earthflows. Also, the shrink-swell of expansive soils causes a seasonal pattern of displacements, which varied by 10-20 mm/year between Austral winter and summer, strongly correlated to rainfall.

TI  - Probability assessments of an ice-free Arctic: Comparing statistical and climate model projections
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The downward trend in the amount of Arctic sea ice has a wide range of environmental and economic consequences including important effects on the pace and intensity of global climate change. Based on several decades of satellite data, we provide statistical forecasts of Arctic sea ice extent during the rest of this century. The best fitting statistical model indicates that overall sea ice coverage is declining at an increasing rate. By contrast, average projections from the CMIP5 global climate models foresee a gradual slowing of Arctic sea ice loss even in scenarios with high carbon emissions. Our long-range statistical projections also deliver probability assessments of the timing of an ice-free Arctic. These results indicate almost a 60 percent chance of an effectively ice -free Arctic Ocean sometime during the 2030s - much earlier than the average projection from the global climate models.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Patients with acute febrile illness need to be screened for malaria and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in malaria-endemic areas to reduce malaria mortality rates and to prevent the transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Objectives: To estimate the frequency of children and adolescents with COVID-19 and/or malaria among febrile patients attending for malaria diagnosisMethod: This cross-sectional study was conducted in a sentinel site for malaria surveillance during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (Omicron variant), from October 2021 to December 2021 in Gabon. All febrile patients were tested for malaria using microscopy. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was detected by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid antigen tests developed by Sansure Biotech (R).Results: A total of 135 patients were screened. Their median age was 6 (interquartile range [IQR]: 3-14) years. Malaria was confirmed for 49 (36.3%) patients, 29 (32.5%) children, 13 (59.0%) adolescents and 7 (29.2%) adults. The frequency of COVID-19 cases was 7.4% (n = 10/135), and it was comparable between children (n = 6; 6.7%), adolescents (n = 2; 9.1%) and adults (n = 2; 8.3%) (p = 0.17). Malaria and COVID-19 co-infections were diagnosed in 3 (6.1%) patients from all the age groups. Participants with a co-infection had a higher median temperature, a higher median parasitaemia, and were mostly infected with non-falciparum malaria.Conclusion: COVID-19 cases and cases of malaria/COVID-19 co-infections were found in febrile children and adolescents. SARS-CoV-2 testing should be included in the screening of suspected malaria cases.

TI  - A deep learning based framework for remote sensing image ground object segmentation
T2  - APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation of very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images is of great significance, in which remote sensing can be applied to numerous fields. However, VHR remote sensing images are taken at different seasons and regions, causing the large intra-class and low inter-class variations of pixels. Thus, the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation network have considerable misclassifications and blurring of object boundaries. To solve the above problems, a deep learning-based semantic segmentation framework (DLSS) of VHR remote sensing images is proposed in this study, which comprising three stages. At the pre-processing stage, a novel data pre-processing method named Image Block Segmentation (IBS) is proposed to coarse segmentation of VHR remote sensing images at the image block scale. At the image segmentation stage, the different strategies are adopted to segment image blocks of different categories for fine segmentation. Through these two stages, this study implements a coarse-to-fine segmentation strategy, which reduces the phenomenon of misclassification by using different network models for low inter class variations of pixels. At the post-processing stage, a novel post-processing method termed Superpixel Cluster (SPC) is proposed to modify the segmentation results. SPC can capture fine details of objects and aggregating continuous pixels with similar characteristics into a set of superpixels, so as to ensure the boundary accuracy and internal consistency of ground object. Extensive experiments, including a comprehensive ablation study, confirm that IBS is capable of effectively reducing the misclassification, and SPC can correct the segmentation results significantly. The experimental results on the Gaofen Image Dataset (GID) suggest that the overall accuracy (OA) of the commonly utilized models combined with DLSS framework can increase, and the average is 2.05%. The code of DLSS is available at https://github.com/dxj620/Deep-learning-semantic-segementation.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Detection of numerous phycotoxins in young bull sharks (<i>Carcharhinus leucas</i>) collected from an estuary of national significance
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Florida's Indian River Lagoon (IRL) has experienced large-scale, frequent blooms of toxic harmful algae in recent decades. Sentinel, or indicator, species can provide an integrated picture of contaminants in the environment and may be useful to understanding phycotoxin prevalence in the IRL. This study evaluated the presence of phycotoxins in the IRL ecosystem by using the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) as a sentinel species. Concentrations of phycotoxins were measured in samples collected from 50 immature bull sharks captured in the IRL between 2018 and 2020. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure toxins in shark gut contents, plasma, and liver. Analysis of samples (n = 123) demonstrated the presence of multiple phycotoxins (microcystin, nodularin, teleocidin, cylindrospermopsin, domoic acid, okadaic acid, and brevetoxin) in 82 % of sampled bull sharks. However, most detected toxins were in low prevalence (<= 25 % of samples, per sample type). This study provides valuable baseline information on presence of multiple phycotoxins in a species occupying a high trophic position in this estuary of national significance.

TI  - The emergence of smart service ecosystems-The role of socio-technical antecedents and affordances
T2  - INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - As physical products are increasingly augmented with digital technology, manufacturing firms have become part of the development of so-called smart products and smart services. As such, manufacturing firms are challenged by new market participants and ecosystem partners, particularly from the software development industry, and by the dynamic nature of business relationships. While the academic literature on the distinctive characteristics of ecosystems, particularly digital ecosystems, is rich, the effect of smart service ecosystems' emergence on the foundation of smart products remains uncertain. This study reports on case study research based on 47 semi-structured interviews with four companies that participate in an industrial smart service ecosystem. Taking an affordance-theoretic perspective, we uncover the antecedents of and the process of emergent smart service ecosystems. We find that smart service ecosystems have three socio-technical antecedents: a shared worldview, structural flexibility and integrity, and architecture of participation. We explain the emergence of smart service ecosystems as the result of specialisation in shared affordances and integration of idiosyncratic affordances into collective affordances. We derive seven propositions regarding the emergence of smart services, outline opportunities for further research, and present practical guidelines for manufacturing firms.

TI  - Inversion and analysis of aerosol optical properties and lidar ratios based on sky-radiometer and Raman lidar measurements in Xi'an, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerosol observations in Xi'an (34.25 degrees N, 108.983 degrees E), a typical urban site in Northwest China, were conducted using a sky-radiometer from January 2015 to March 2018. Multi-year variations of aerosol optical properties (AOPs) and lidar ratios (LRs) were simultaneously analyzed and calculated. In particular, LRs in 340 nm were compared and validated using the UV-Raman lidar (RL) measurements. During the study period, aerosol optical depth at 500 nm (AOD(500)) had significant seasonal variation, with a maximum value of 0.68 in winter and a minimum value of 0.59 in autumn. Angstrom exponent (AE) exhibited different seasonal variation patterns, and the minimum (0.81) and maximum (1.06) values appeared in spring and summer, respectively. The spectral difference between AE(400-675) and AE(675-870) indicated that high AOD(675) values (>1.0) were affected by accidental factors (e.g., dust weather in spring and winter) and the accumulation of fine particle aerosols across all seasons. The relationship between AOD(500) and AE(400-870) was used to distinguish different aerosol types. Overall, mixed aerosols (MX) accounted for the largest contribution (ranging from 40.14% in autumn to 69.9% in spring), followed by biomass-burning or urban/industrial aerosols (BB/UI) (with the smallest value of 19.9% in spring, and the largest value of 43.66% in winter). Single-scattering albedo (SSAs) experienced weak seasonal variation, with a minimum in winter and a maximum in spring. The seasonal aerosol volume size distributions (VSDs) generally exhibited the trimodal patterns. The particle radius (R) of less than 0.5 mu m is considered as fine mode, the coarse mode is R greater than 2.5 mu m, and the middle mode is located somewhere in between them. The real CRI were similar to 1.41-1.43, with no significant difference among different seasons. Besides, the LRs derived by combining sky-radiometer with Mie-scattering theory changed greatly with weather from 49.95 +/- 8.89 in summer to 63.95 +/- 6.77 in autumn, which were validated by RL with the errors within a certain height range of less than 10%. We confirmed the feasibility of using the LR of UV band from sky-radiometer as a reference value for the Fernald or Klett method.

TI  - Data assimilation for the Model for Prediction Across Scales - Atmosphere with the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI-MPAS 1.0.0): EnVar implementation and evaluation
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - On 24 September 2021, JEDI-MPAS 1.0.0, a new data assimilation (DA) system for the Model Prediction Across Scales - Atmosphere (MPAS-A) built on the software framework of the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI) was publicly released for community use. Operating directly on the native MPAS unstructured mesh, JEDI-MPAS capabilities include three-dimensional variational (3DVar) and ensemble-variational (EnVar) schemes as well as the ensemble of DA (EDA) technique. On the observation side, one advanced feature in JEDI-MPAS is the full all-sky approach for satellite radiance DA with the introduction of hydrometeor analysis variables. This paper describes the formulation and implementation of EnVar for JEDI-MPAS. JEDI-MPAS 1.0.0 is evaluated with month-long cycling 3DEnVar experiments with a global 30-60 km dual-resolution configuration. The robustness and credible performance of JEDI-MPAS are demonstrated by establishing a benchmark non-radiance DA experiment, then incrementally adding microwave radiances from three sources: Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) temperature sounding channels in clear-sky scenes, AMSU-A window channels in all-sky scenes, and Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) water vapor channels in clear-sky scenes. JEDI-MPAS 3DEnVar behaves well with a substantial and significant positive impact obtained for almost all aspects of forecast verification when progressively adding more microwave radiance data. In particular, the day 5 forecast of the best-performing JEDI-MPAS experiment yields an anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) of 0.8 for 500 hPa geopotential height, a gap of roughly a half day when compared to cold-start forecasts initialized from operational analyses of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, whose ACC does not drop to 0.8 until a lead time of 5.5 d. This indicates JEDI-MPAS's great potential for both research and operations.

TI  - Clinical indocyanine green-based silk fibroin theranostic nanoprobes for in vivo NIR-I/II fluorescence imaging of cervical diseases
T2  - NANOMEDICINE-NANOTECHNOLOGY BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cervical diseases such as lymph node disease and tubal obstruction have threatened women's health. However, the traditional diagnostic methods still have shortcomings. NIR-II fluorescence imaging with advantages of low scattering, negligible autofluorescence, and high spatial resolution could be an ideal option. To obtain high quality NIR-II fluorescence imaging, selecting appropriate nanoprobes becomes the important issue. As a small molecular photothermal agent, extensive applications of ICG are rather limited because of its drawbacks. Herein, natural silk fibroin (SF) was synthesized and encapsulated ICG molecules to form SF@ICG nanoparticles (NPs). After detailed analysis, SF@ ICG NPs showed excellent stability and long circulation time, as well as strong NIR-II fluorescence emission, well photo-stability, bio-compatibility and well photothermal property under 808 nm laser irradiation. Furthermore, SF@ICG NPs were utilized for NIR-II fluores-cence imaging of lymph node/lymphangiography and angiography of fallopian tubes. The process of fallopian tubes could be detected with high resolution and high sensitivity. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Human and Physical Dilemmas in Small-Scale Irrigation Development: Evidence from Climate-Sensitive Northern Ghana
T2  - PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation is widely accepted as an effective adaptive management strategy for small-scale farmers of traditional rain-fed crops in areas experiencing climate change. These changes include timing of onset of the rainy season and the amount and intensity of rainfall-both issues of concern to rural farmers in northern Ghana. Despite obvious benefits, it is not apparent if farmers in this area perceive irrigation as a viable or attainable option to deal with potential food insecurity related to climate change. In this article, we examine three main issues: (1) dry spells during the early parts of the farming season, (2) impacts of these dry spells on farming systems, and (3) farmer adaptation through different agricultural water management practices. A geographic information system and remote sensing analysis using Landsat 8 and field Global Positioning System data supports findings from seventy-two in-depth interviews with smallholder farmers. Results from this integrated assessment reveal sociocultural and physical barriers to manual irrigation, including labor needs, water source proximity, and size of operational land holding. Increasing climate variability in this region will necessitate adaptation by local farmers; however, we argue that irrigation projects should not be initiated without detailed understanding of local sociocultural contexts. Effectively moving water from source to crop will require integrative knowledge of local hydrogeology and sociocultural norms.

TI  - Geospatial assessment of agricultural drought vulnerability using integrated three-dimensional model in the upper Dwarakeshwar river basin in West Bengal, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The amount of agricultural drought vulnerability in an underdeveloped rain-fed agro-based economy at the local, regional, and national level is most prominent factor for measurement. The desiccation of rain in agricultural sector becomes apprehensive to intercontinental food supply chain. So, adequate investigation and development of sustainable agricultural methodology are key factors to sustain the food security of a territory. In this research, delineation of agricultural drought vulnerability (ADV) status has been carried out by multidimensional mixed-method index approach using remote sensing and geographic information system. An integrated three-dimensional model is utilized to enrich this study. The three indices of this model include exposure index (EI), sensitivity index (SI), and adaptive capacity index (ACI). The ACI has been constructed by combining the environmental adaptive capacity (EAC), social adaptive capacity (SAC), and economic adaptive capacity (EcAC) index. The 40 parameters for ADV modeling are picked up by analyzing metrological, geo-environmental, social, and remote sensing data. There are six exposure parameters, seven sensitivity parameters, twelve environmental adaptive capacity parameters, six social adaptive capacity parameters, and nine economic adaptive capacity parameters. Each index has been computed by assigning the weights based on their relative importance by using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach. Final results were classified into five vulnerability zones, e.g., very low, low, moderate, high, and very high covering an area 362.32 km(2), 186.68 km(2), 568.69 km(2), 547.05 km(2), and 266.89 km(2) respectively. Results have been validated with long-term Aman paddy yield data (2004 to 2014) through the yield anomaly index (YAI). Finally, the model ADV is a good model fit (R square = 0.894) and all the relationships were found significant, when SI, EI, and ACI are considered its predictors. While SI (B = 0.391, p < 0.001) and EI (B = 0.223, p < 0.001) are positively associated with ADV, ACI is negatively associated with ADV (B = - 0.721, p < 0.001). This regional agricultural drought vulnerability model can be useful to identify drought-responsive areas and improve drought mitigation measures.

T2  - HUMAN AFFAIRS-POSTDISCIPLINARY HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this attempt to deal with the problem of free will Tallis identifies intentionality as a feature of our lives that cannot be explained by deterministic, natural, physical, causal laws. Our ability to think about the world, and not merely be objects subject to it, gives us room for manoeuvre for free thought and action. Science, far from being antagonistic to the possibility of free will as it is usually presented through its deterministic explanations, is a manifestation of our freedom and could not exist without it. However, doubts arise for the argument owing to a lack of explanation as to how freedom is possible no matter how persuasively we are shown that it appears to be. That is, what kind of world would it have to be for freedom to exist and be explicable. I conclude with my own view, alluded to by Tallis, but not followed up, that the problem with the scientific worldview is that it is wedded to objectivity as the only stance deemed veridical as to the nature of reality, one which therefore cannot by necessity allow subjects or freedom. As freedom is a property of subjects, the scientific worldview cannot allow for freedom. Once the condition is dropped that only the objectively knowable can be real, freedom also may be real, defined as a knowable property of our subjectivity. There is no need to deny physicalism if the definition of it is released from the epistemic bonds of objectivity and we hold that some physical properties may be known subjectively, namely those that characterize our subjective life.

TI  - Analysing metaphorical pebbles in English RE
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is a critical analysis of the use of metaphors in English Religious Education (RE). It is grounded in the educational theory of Anna Sfard (a professor of Mathematics) who has written about learning metaphors, before considering some of the metaphoric language used in English education generally and RE specifically. It will examine carefully at how the metaphors implicit within the Commission on RE Report might help us interpret it, considering particularly the National Entitlement and note the changes to these metaphors in the newly adapted national entitlement in the REC Worldviews' Project Draft Handbook. It will then turn (metaphorically) to the Research Review into RE from Ofsted and examine some aspects of that through metaphorical lenses. It will consider the metaphors inherent in Ofsted's Deep Dive methodology, the work of Fordham, Counsell and the Early Career Framework and Core Content framework materials. The paper will conclude with some thoughts about RE as a subject discourse, suggesting that RE continues to have an identity crisis, which is not helped by a disciplinary, or a worldview, approach.

TI  - Greening or browning? The macro variation and drivers of different vegetation types on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from 2000 to 2021
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation greenness is one of the main indicators to characterize changes in terrestrial ecosystems. China has implemented a few large-scale ecological restoration programs on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) to reverse the trend of ecosystem degradation. Although the effectiveness of these programs is beginning to show, the mechanisms of vegetation degradation under climate change and human activities are still controversial. Existing studies have mostly focused on changes in overall vegetation change, with less attention on the drivers of change in different vegetation types. In this study, earth satellite observation records were used to robustly map changes in vegetation greenness on the QTP from 2000 to 2021. The random forest (RF) algorithm was further used to detect the drivers of greenness browning on the QTP as a whole and in seven different vegetation types. The results show that an overall trend of greening in all seven vegetation types on the QTP over a 21-year period. The area of greening was 46.54x10(4) km(2), and browning was 5.32x10(4) km(2), representing a quarter and 2.86% of the natural vegetation area, respectively. The results of the browning driver analysis show that areas with high altitude, reduced annual precipitation, high intensity of human activity, average annual maximum and average annual minimum precipitation of approximately 500 mm are most susceptible to browning on the QTP. For the seven different vegetation types, their top 6 most important browning drivers and the ranking of drivers differed. DEM and precipitation changes are important drivers of browning for seven vegetation types. These results reflect the latest spatial and temporal dynamics of vegetation on the QTP and highlight the common and characteristic browning drivers of vegetation ecosystems. They provide support for understanding the response of different vegetation to natural and human impacts and for further implementation of site-specific restoration measures.

TI  - Reinforcing nature-based solutions through tools providing social-ecological-technological integration
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Review
AB  - While held to be a means for climate change adaptation and mitigation, nature-based solutions (NbS) themselves are vulnerable to climate change. To find ways of compensating for this vulnerability we combine a focused literature review on how information technology has been used to strengthen positive social-ecological-technological feedback, with the development of a prototype decision-support tool. Guided by the literature review, the tool integrates recent advances in using globally available remote sensing data to elicit information on functional diversity and ecosystem service provisioning with information on human service demand and population vulnerability. When combined, these variables can inform climate change adaptation strategies grounded in local social-ecological realities. This type of integrated monitoring and packaging information to be actionable have potential to support NbS management and local knowledge building for context-tailored solutions to societal challenges in urban environments.

TI  - Implementation of a <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> sentinel surveillance system in Germany: First insights for 2019-2021
T2  - ANAEROBE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Clostridioides difficile is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea. Several "hypervirulent" lineages such as ribotype 027 (RT027) and RT078 are of high epidemiological importance, leading to outbreaks and more severe courses of disease. An active surveillance system targeting molecular epidemiology and corresponding antimicrobial resistance has not been established in Germany.Methods: Since October 2019, University Hospitals throughout Germany collected by two dates every year (1st April and October, respectively) their first ten unselected samples being tested positive for C. difficile.Results: Out of 1026 samples received from 29 sites, 876 toxigenic C. difficile strains could be cultivated. PCR ribotyping of these strains revealed a large strain diversity with RT014 (17.5%) dominating, followed by isolates of the major nosocomial lineage RT001 (7.1%) and the "hypervirulent" lineage RT078 (5.9%). Notably, prevalence of RT027 was low with similar to 3.5% at all time points analyzed, while the abundance of RT001 isolates significantly declined from 12.3% to 3.7% during the sampling period (P < 0.001). Antimicrobial resistance against clarithromycin, moxifloxacin, and rifampicin was detected in 18%, 15%, and 4% of the tested isolates, respectively. Highest resistance rates were found among RT027 isolates (83%, 87% and 63% for clarithromycin, moxifloxacin, and rifampicin, respectively). Vancomycin resistance was not detected, and metronidazole resistance was observed only for a single RT027 isolate.Conclusions: This Germany-wide continuing surveillance effort with a standardized mode of isolate acquisition indicates that isolates of RT027 were only sporadically detected under these strain acquisition conditions, and RT001 seems to become less important in the hospital setting, being replaced by other RTs.

T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, hydrological responses to climate change and land-cover alteration on future runoff in the Zayandeh-Roud dam upstream watershed were assessed. In this regard, land-use maps in 1996, 2008, 2018, and 2033 were generated using Landsat time-series (TM and OLI), Support-Vector Machine (SVM), and the CA-Markov chain model, for analysing the effects of land-cover alteration on future runoff. Second, the Global Circulation Model (GCM) scenario time-series under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios were downscaled to evaluate the impacts of climate change on future streamflow. Eventually, the HEC-HMS model was calibrated (1996-2018) for evaluating the impacts of climate and land-use map changes. Results showed that the percentage of the urban area and farmland in 2033 compared to 2018 were expected to grow by 0.1 and 2.39% upstream of the Eskandari station and 0.05 and 0.71% upstream of the Ghale-Shahrokh station, respectively, although the percentage of the barren area was expected to remain almost unchanged in both regions. The future stream flow of Eskandari and Ghale-Shahrokh stations in 2033 was expected to decrease by 57-63 MCM (for RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) and 295-403 MCM, respectively, where 68-72% and 79-86% were expected to decrease under climate change scenarios and remains are due to land-cover alteration.

TI  - Recent trends of land surface temperature in relation to the influencing factors using Google Earth Engine platform and time series products in megacities of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing land surface temperature (LST) is one of the significant anthropogenic issues that is threatening livelihoods in urban areas. Understanding the urban LST is essential for sustainable management of the urban landscape. Various studies focused on the spatial pattern and average trend of LST in relation to influencing factors, but little is known regarding the pixel-scale spatiotemporal trends and integration of multiple influencing factors in the different seasons using time series data. Therefore, we focused on the spatiotemporal trends of LST in relation to the influencing factors using the Google Earth Engine platform and time series products. MODIS land surface temperature data was used to estimate the annual and seasonal day-night LST from 2003 to 2020. Theil-Sen slope and Mann-Kendall statistics were used to examine the magnitude and significance of the spatiotemporal trend. All-subsets regression and hierarchical partitioning (HP) were applied to explore the driving factors of LST. Average LST and range varied between the cities, but were highest in Chennai and Delhi, respectively. Except for winter nighttime in Kolkata, all cities' annual and seasonal nighttime LST are increasing (0.027-0.075 degrees C/year) over a large part of the study area (33.934%-100% of areas), indicating that anthropogenic force is increasing in urban areas during nighttime. Annual and seasonal daytime LST is increasing in most parts (55.545%-94.604% of areas) of Chennai and Kolkata, but daytime LST is decreasing (33.602%-98.571% of areas) in Mumbai and Delhi due to the increasing concentration of absorbing aerosol over the city. Strength of independent factors and multiple influencing factors varied in the day-night time between the cities. But nighttime LST was well explained using the all-subsets regression compared to daytime LST, except for Mumbai. Also, nighttime light density and NDBI had consistent effects on nighttime, and daytime, respectively. These findings can help to take scientific adaptation and mitigation strategies for sustainable development.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Region: Licungo basin (Mozambique) Study Focus: The Licungo basin (23,263 km2) suffers frequent severe flooding due to tropical storms, in a country that is among the world's most vulnerable in terms of exposure to weather-related hazards and climate change. We propose a methodology for the estimation of the population exposed to flooding at the catchment scale in data-scarce regions, combining satellite imagery with integrated high-resolution hydrological-hydraulic modelling. All the input data needed are retrieved from freely-available global satellite products. The numerical model is also freeware. The methodology is therefore replicable worldwide. An estimate of the flood extent and exposed population during Tropical Storm Ana (January 2022) is presented as a case study. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Current freely-available satellite products in combination with high-resolution hydrological-hydraulic models can be used to estimate the population exposed to flooding in the whole catchment. This estimate is more realistic than the one obtained using satellite imagery alone, since satellite images are very rarely taken at the time of maximum flooding. Using the proposed methodology, we estimate that over 273,000 people (out of 1.5 million) were exposed to flooding in the Licungo basin during Tropical Storm Ana. This represents 18% of the basin population and is 8 times larger than the estimate obtained using only the available satellite images.

TI  - Assessing swidden land use in Myanmar by decision tree-based detection method using landsat imagery
T2  - CABI AGRICULTURE & BIOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Swidden agriculture is a common land use found in the mountainous regions, especially in Southeast Asia. In Myanmar, the swidden agriculture has been practicing as an important livelihood strategy of millions of people, mainly by the ethnic groups. However, the extent of swidden agriculture in Myanmar is still in question. Therefore, we attempted to detect swidden patches and estimate the swidden extent in Myanmar using free available Landsat images on Google Earth Engine in combination with a decision tree-based plot detection method. We applied the commonly used indices such as dNBR, RdNBR, and dNDVI, statistically tested their threshold values to select the most appropriate combination of the indices and thresholds for the detection of swidden, and assessed the accuracy of each set of index and thresholds using ground truth data and visual interpretation of sample points outside the test site. The results showed that dNBR together with RdNBR, slope and elevation demonstrated higher accuracy (84.25%) compared to an all-index combination (dNBR, RdNBR, dNDVI, slope, and elevation). Using the best-fit pair, we estimated the extent of swidden at national level. The resulting map showed that the total extent of swidden in Myanmar was about 0.1 million ha in 2016, which is much smaller than other previously reported figures. Also, swidden patches were mostly observed in Shan State, followed by Chin State. In this way, this study primarily estimated the total extent of swidden area in Myanmar at national level and proved that the use of a decision tree-based detection method with appropriate vegetation indices and thresholds is highly applicable to the estimation of swidden extent on a regional basis. Also, as Myanmar is the largest country in mainland Southeast Asia in area with a great majority of the population living in rural areas, and many in the mountains, its land resources are of great relevance to the people's livelihoods and thereby the nation's progress. Therefore, this study will contribute to sustainable land management planning on both regional and national scale.

TI  - Causes and processes of two opposite climatic years in the tropical Atlantic warm pools
T2  - DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - A numerical investigation of the interannual Southwestern and Equatorial Atlantic warm pools (WPs) (SST>28 degrees C) was conducted for the 2000-2014 period, focusing on two major opposite events over the past 39 years (1982-2020): an intense warming event in 2010 (sizeable warm pool) and a moderate-to-low event in 2012 (small warm pool). Some modes of climate variability (remote and local) were confronted with the WP area. Significant remote connections were found for the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Atlantic Meridional Mode (AMM). Whereas, the Tropical Northern Atlantic (TNA) and Tropical Southern Atlantic (TSA) indices were locally related to anomalies over the WP area. On the months that preceded the 2010 WP event, an anomalous atmospheric circulation in the tropical North Atlantic basin occurred (extremely negative NAO and positive AMM), causing a major weakening of winds, shallower mixed layer, and higher SST. Consequently, the WP boundaries, which usually developed southward along the equator in the austral fall, were pushed northward as warm waters spread out into the north tropical basin. Locally, both basins (i.e., tropical north and south) were warmer than climato-logically expected (positive TNA and TSA), leading to a significant increase in the WP area recorded in this period. On the other hand, during the months that preceded the 2012 WP, the trade winds were faster (positive NAO and positive AMM), leading to a condition close to the climatologically expected. The approximation of the center of the subtropical high in the southern ocean basin practically extinguished the portion of warm waters that usually spreads southwest along the basin. While the TNA was weakly positive, the TSA presented negative anomalies that ensured a significant reduction in the WP area in the southern basin during this time. Numerical results from the 2000-2014 run were contrasted with PIRATA buoys and satellite data to assess the model's performance. Investigations of the mixed layer temperature terms disclosed the predominance of the atmosphere over the oceanic terms during the warm pool area increase/ decrease, showing a significantly different composition within the oceanic terms. The persistence of the same sign anomalies during the three months preceding the WP's seasonal development appeared to be a pivotal factor in understanding how different the events in 2010 and 2012 were. Net heat flux anomalies, mainly controlled by anomalous wind patterns, were primarily responsible for the extreme events observed in 2010 and 2012.

TI  - Improved drought monitoring in teleconnection to the climatic escalations: A hydrological modeling based approach
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Catchment-scale efficient agricultural drought monitoring and irrigation planning mostly depend on the accuracy of evapotranspiration (ET) estimates under different crop-growth phases. As indirect ET estimation under limited data availability scenario and complex paddy-field dynamics could not be sufficiently addressed by the conventional curve number (CN) based SWAT model, SWAT incorporates an add-in pothole module (SWAT-P) that conceptualizes the paddy-field hydrology with the empirical coefficient or equations resulting in poor ET estimates. To address these limitations, this study integrates an improved pothole methodology in SWAT (SWAT-EP) accounting the vadose-zone soil water dynamics under alternate ponding and drying conditions, ET variation under moisture abundant and stress conditions, and role of irrigation return flow generated in the paddy fields. The proposed approach was validated in the Kangsabati River integrated reservoir-catchment-command (12,014.70 km(2)) of the eastern India, and the results reveal that SWAT-EP outperformed the existing SWAT-P in reproducing the catchment-scale streamflow and ET flux with respect to the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith (PM) based ET estimates in all the four cropping seasons. The SWATEP derived Standardized Evapotranspiration Drought Index (SEDI) based drought severity and duration wellcorroborate with the benchmark MOD16A2 derived drought estimates; whereas, the SWAT-P tends to overestimate the drought severity in the command area. The predictive uncertainty in drought monitoring was the lowest by SWAT-EP with relatively lower uncertainty was observed in the crop-growing locations of Kharagpur and Mohanpur. Moreover, the teleconnection between drought and climatic escalations corresponds to a better reproducibility of El Nino and La Nina phases by the SWAT-EP, while the SWAT-P performed un-satisfactorily across different spatiotemporal domains. This study endorses to adopt the proposed SWAT-EP model for river basin-scale drought monitoring and irrigation planning with prior validation in the diversified climatic and topographic conditions.

TI  - The role of oceanic heat flux in reducing thermodynamic ice growth in Nares Strait and promoting earlier collapse of the ice bridge
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ice bridge in Nares Strait is a well-known phenomenon that affects the liquid and solid freshwater flux from the Arctic Ocean through the strait and controls the downstream North Open Water polynya in northern Baffin Bay. Recently, the ice bridge has been in a state of decline, either breaking up earlier in the year or not forming at all and thereby increasing the sea ice export out of the Arctic Ocean. The decline in the ice bridge has been ascribed to thinner and therefore weaker ice from the Arctic Ocean entering Nares Strait; however, local forcing also affects the state of the ice bridge and thereby influences when it breaks up. Using a variety of remotely sensed data we examine the spatial patterns of sea ice thickness within the ice bridge, highlighting the presence of negative ice thickness anomalies on both the eastern and western sides of the strait and identifying a recurrent sensible heat polynya that forms within the ice bridge near Cape Jackson in northwestern Greenland. Using the sea ice-ocean model FESOM2, we then attribute these ice thickness anomalies to the heat from warmer subsurface waters of Pacific and Atlantic origin that reduce thermodynamic ice growth throughout winter on the western and eastern sides, respectively. The consequently weaker and thinner areas within the ice bridge are then suggested to promote instability and earlier breakup. This work provides new insight into the structure of the Nares Strait ice bridge and highlights that warming of the modified Atlantic and/or Pacific waters that enter the strait may contribute to its further decline.

TI  - Use of remote sensing-derived fPAR data in a grapevine simulation model for estimating vine biomass accumulation and yield variability at sub-field level
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Grapevine simulation models are mostly used to estimate plant development, growth and yield at plot scale. However, the spatial variability of pedologic and micro-climatic conditions can influence vine growth, leading to a sub-field heterogeneity in plant vigor and final yield that may be better estimated through the assimilation of high spatial resolution data in crop models. In this study, the spatial variability of grapevine intercepted radiation at fruit-set was used as input for a grapevine simulation model to estimate the variability in biomass accumulation and yield in two Tuscan vineyards (Sites A and B). In Site A, the model, forced with intercepted radiation data as derived from the leaf area index (LAI), measured at canopy level in three main vigor areas of the vineyard, provided a satisfactory simulation of the final pruning weight (r(2) = 0.61; RMSE = 19.86 dry matter g m(-2)). In Site B, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2A images was firstly re-scaled to account for canopy fraction cover over the study areas and then used as a proxy for grapevine intercepted radiation for each single pixel. These data were used to drive the grapevine simulation model accounting for spatial variability of plant vigor to reproduce yield variability at pixel scale (r(2) = 0.47; RMSE = 75.52 dry matter g m(-2)). This study represents the first step towards the realization of a decision tool supporting winegrowers in the selection of the most appropriate agronomic practices for reducing the vine vigor and yield variability at sub-field level.

TI  - Design and implementation of variable coding and modulation for LEO high-resolution Earth observation satellite
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
M3  - Article
AB  - As LEO (Low Earth Orbit) high-resolution Earth observation satellite needs to transmit a large amount of remote sensing data from the satellite to the ground station, higher downlink capacity still poses a severe challenge to LEO. Therefore, variable coding and modulation (VCM) has become an important scheme to optimize the performance of satellite downlink. In this paper, the downlink VCM system of China Earth observation satellite is studied for the first time. By evaluating the free space loss of the satellite downlink path, a VCM-based satellite downlink system is designed, and a DVB-S2 BCH-LDPC encoded variable bit rate high-order MAPSK modulator is implemented. The maximum channel bit rate can reach 3.5 Gbps. Then, the experimental results of Gaofen-7 satellite, which was launched in November 2019, are carried out which showed that our design method effectively meets the design requirements, and the performance is verified.

TI  - Pet cats, the better sentinels for indoor organic pollutants
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Pets are the most intimate companions of humans, as pets and people share most of their lives indoors. Based on the connections between pet animals, humans, and the environment, pet cats and dogs are often recommended as sentinels for the detection of environmental contaminants and for comorbidity tracking. However, their suitability as sentinels is yet to be established. Persistent organic pollutants and environmental hormones have replaced particulate matter (PM2.5) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in causing indoor air pollution. This review summarises the differences in the types and concentrations of indoor organic environmental pollutants detected in pet dogs and cats. This includes an analysis of the main exposure routes of different types of pollutants. To identify which of the two pet species are better sentinels, cats and dogs were compared based on their metabolic capacities of various indoor organic pollutants. In addition to PM2.5, a range of organic compounds including polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), bromophenols, perfluoroalkyl substances, organochlorine pesticides, fungicides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalic acid esters, organophosphate pesticides, organophosphorus flame retardants, and melamine have been detected in both dogs and cats. Pets often accumulate PBDEs from dust; however, traces of PBDEs are present in their diet. The indoor pollutant contamination levels in internal cats were generally higher than those in dogs. Cats accumulate organic pollutants associated with indoor environments, but they are sensitive to their toxicity because, unlike dogs, cats cannot metabolise most of the accumulated pollutants. Moreover, cats share similar clinical symptoms of thyroid diseases in humans. Based on the above observations of detection of indoor organic pollutants, it could be said that cats are better sentinels than dogs.

TI  - Predicting plant biomass and species richness in temperate grasslands across regions, time, and land management with remote sensing and deep learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial predictions of biomass production and biodiversity at regional scale in grasslands are critical to evaluate the effects of management practices across environmental gradients. New generations of remote sensing sensors and machine learning approaches can predict these grassland characteristics with varying accuracy. However, such studies frequently fail to cover a sufficiently broad range of environmental conditions, and their prediction models are often case-specific. To address this gap, we have modelled above-ground biomass and species richness in 150 spatially independent grassland plots of three geographical regions in Germany. These regions follow a North-South climate gradient and differ in soil types, topography, elevation, climatic conditions, historical contexts, and management intensities. The predictors tested in this study are Sentinel-1 backscatter, Sentinel-2 time series of surface reflectance along with derived vegetation indices and Rao's Q, and a set of topoedaphic variables. We compared the performance of a feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) with a random forest (RF) regression algorithm. The DNN achieved the best estimations of biomass (r2 = 0.45) when trained with Sentinel-2 surface reflectance only. Moreover, the DNN showed a higher generalizability than RF during spatial cross-validations (i.e., calibrating and validating in different regions, r2 = 0.38 vs. 0.26). Species richness pre-dictions by both algorithms improved when the full time series of Sentinel-2 surface reflectance values were used (highest r2 = 0.42 achieved by the DNN), but both performed poorly during spatial cross-validations. Overall, the DNN-based models were more robust than RF models, showed a lower bias and lower systematic error, and required fewer inputs. Explainability analysis indicated that red-edge and near infrared information from May and October was the most relevant to predict species richness. This study presents an important step forward in generating robust spatially explicit predictions of grassland attributes and biodiversity variables across large areas, environmental gradients, and phenological stages.

TI  - Lymph Node and Distant Metastases in Phyllodes Tumor of the Breast
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A 54-year-old woman who incidentally noticed a "knot" in her left breast subsequently underwent excisional biopsy which yielded a diagnosis of malignant neoplasm with sarcomatous features. Given the broad differential diagnosis and imaging findings, the patient underwent bilateral mastectomy and intraoperative sentinel lymph node assessment. An 8.5 cm tumor that was further classified as a malignant phyllodes tumor was identified in the left breast, while the frozen section interpretation came back as positive for metastatic disease which resulted in left axillary lymphadenectomy. Two months later the patient progressed to distant metastatic disease and unfortunately passed away within 6 months after her initial diagnosis. Lymph node metastasis in phyllodes tumor is an exceptionally rare event for which patients usually do not undergo intraoperative sentinel lymph node examination; however high clinical suspicion of metastatic disease would be evidence for further investigation.

TI  - A daily and complete PM2.5 dataset derived from space observations for Vietnam from 2012 to 2020
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PM2.5 pollution is a serious problem in Vietnam and around the world, having bad impacts on human health, animals and environment. Regular monitoring at a large scale is important to assess the status of air pollution, develop solutions and evaluate the effectiveness of policy implementation. However, air quality monitoring stations in Vietnam are lim-ited. In this article, we propose an approach to estimate daily PM2.5 concentration from 2012 to 2020 over the Vietnamese territory, which is strongly affected by cloudy conditions, using a modern statistical model named Mixed Effect Model (MEM) on a dataset consisting of ground PM2.5 measurements, integrated satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), meteorological and land use maps. The result of this approach is the first long-term, full coverage and high quality PM2.5 dataset of Vietnam. The daily mean PM2.5 maps have high validation results in comparison with ground PM2.5 measurement (Pearson r of 0.87, R2 of 0.75, RMSE of 11.76 mu g/m3, and MRE of 36.57 % on a total of 13,886 data samples). The aggregated monthly and annual average maps from 2012 to 2020 in Vietnam have out-standing quality when compared with another global PM2.5 product. The PM2.5 concentration maps has shown spatial distribution and seasonal variations of PM2.5 concentration in Vietnam in a long period from 2012 to 2020 and has been used in other studies and applications in the environment and public health at the national scale, which has not been possible before because of the lack of monitoring stations and an appropriate PM2.5 modeling approach.

T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Following publication of the MSLT-II trial showing no survival benefit of completion lymphadenectomy (CLND) in patients with melanoma sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases, it is expected that practice patterns have changed. The purpose of this study is to understand real-world practices and outcomes after publication of this landmark trial. Patients and Methods Patients with truncal/extremity melanoma SLN metastases diagnosed between 2013 and 2019 at four academic cancer centers were included in this retrospective cohort study. Descriptive statistics, Cox proportional hazards model, and multivariable regression were used to characterize the cohort and identify predictors of CLND, harboring non-SLN (NSLN) metastases, and survival. Results Results of 1176 patients undergoing SLN biopsy, 183 had SLN metastases. The number of patients who underwent CLND before versus after trial publication was 75.7.% versus 20.5% (HR 0.16, 95% CI 0.09-0.28). Of those undergoing nodal observation (NO), 92% had a first nodal-basin ultrasound, while 63% of patients had a fourth. In exploratory multivariable analyses, age >= 50 years was associated with lower rate of CLND (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36-0.92) and larger SLN deposit (> 1.0 mm) with increased rate of CLND (HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.17-3.00) in the complete cohort. Extracapsular extension was associated with increased risk of NSLN metastases (HR 12.43, 95% CI 2.48-62.31). Adjusted survival analysis demonstrated no difference in recurrence or mortality between patients treated with CLND versus NO at median 2.2-year follow-up. Conclusion Nodal observation was rapidly adopted into practice in patients with melanoma SLN metastases at four centers in Canada. Younger age and higher nodal burden were associated with increased use of CLND after trial publication. Ultrasound (US) surveillance decreased with time from SLNB. In our study, CLND was not associated with a decreased risk of recurrence or mortality.

TI  - Modeling heat island exposure and vulnerability utilizing earth observations and social drivers: A case study for Alabama, USA
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Alabama currently experiences an above-average threat from extreme heat events compared to the remaining states in the USA. More than 160,000 people living in the state (infants, elderly age groups, or poverty-ridden populations) remain vulnerable to heat events. The risk of heat-related mortalities and morbidities disproportionately impacts the growing Alabama cities due to increasing hot-weather episodes and several underlying social vulnerability factors. The exposure threat in 2050 is projected to increase by more than 90 average heat days a year and the number of heat-wave days is predicted to increase from 15 to more than 70 days a year. Although the state's hazard mitigation plan covers extreme heat issues and heat emergency plans, Alabama lacks heat adaptation plans and is conducting heat vulnerability assessments from time to time. This study focused on determining the social drivers of heat vulnerability and identifying regions within the state that experienced intense heat island effects over the course of five years (2015-2019). 15 sociodemographic factors data from the 2018 American Community Survey (ACS), and 6 health outcome variables (asthma, obesity, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes) were analyzed to assess cumulative social vulnerability using principal component analysis (PCA). Using Spatial Autoregression (SAR) model, exposure risk was measured as a function of environmental parameters including proportional vegetation, normalized difference water index (NDWI), digital elevation model (DEM), and percent imperviousness of land surface. A heat risk index calculated as a product of social vulnerability and exposure risk was analyzed for Alabama's eight largest and growing cities (Birmingham, Huntsville, Hoover, Montgomery, Mobile, Tuscaloosa, Auburn, and Dothan) at the block-group census resolution. Spatial data depicting the physical landscape characteristics across the cities revealed differing levels of and factors in exposure to urban heat effects across the city.

TI  - A method for considering the evolution of the visible landscape
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The visible landscape represents an important consideration within landscape management activities, forming an inhabitants' perception of their overall surroundings and providing them with a sense of landscape connection, sustainability and identity. The historical satellite imagery archive can provide key knowledge of the overall change in land use and land cover (LULC), which can inform a range of important management decisions. However, the evolution of the visible landscape at a terrestrial level using this information source has rarely been investigated. In this study, the Landsat archive is leveraged to develop a method that depicts changes within the visible landscape. Our method utilises other freely available data sources to determine the visibility of the landscape, and LULC composition, visible from road networks when the imagery was captured. This method was used to describe change in the visible landscape of a rural area in Nuble, Chile, in the period from 1986 to 2018. Whilst native forests on the slopes of the mountains within the study area provide a natural backdrop, because of the flat topography of most of the area, the foreground dominates the overall landscape view. This has resulted in a visible transition from a landscape visibly dominated by agricultural use in 1986 to one of equal agriculture and plantation forestry in 2018. It is hoped that the method outlined within this study can be applied easily to other regions or at larger scales to provide insight for land managers regarding the visibility of LULC.

TI  - High-resolution mapping of 33 years of material stock and population growth in Germany using Earth Observation data
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global societal material stock in buildings and infrastructure have accumulated rapidly within the last decades, along with population growth. Recently, an approach for nation-wide mapping of material stock at 10 m spatial resolution, using freely available and globally consistent Earth Observation (EO) imagery, has been introduced as an alternative to cost-intensive cadastral data or broad-scale but thematically limited nighttime light-based mapping. This study assessed the potential of EO data archives to create spatially explicit time series data of material stock dynamics and their relation to population in Germany, at a spatial resolution of 30 m. We used Landsat imagery with a change-aftereffect-trend analysis to derive yearly masks of land surface change from 1985 onward. Those served as an input to an annual reverse calculation of six material stock types and building volume-based annual gridded population, based on maps for 2018. Material stocks and population in Germany grew by 13% and 4%, respectively, showing highly variable spatial patterns. We found a minimum building stock of ca. 180 t/cap across all municipalities and growth processes characterized by sprawl. A rapid growth of stocks per capita occurred in East Germany after the reunification in 1990, with increased building activity but population decline. Possible over- or underestimations of stock growth cannot be ruled out due to methodological assumptions, requiring further research.

TI  - GLeSI: A system for extraction of glacial lakes using satellite imagery
T2  - CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - For outburst susceptibility assessment of glacial lakes, manual field survey is a time-consuming, expensive, and very tedious process. Therefore, an automatic and reliable system is required for efficient extraction of glacial lake's from satellite imagery. Low spectral contrast and heterogeneous backgrounds of satellite images are the major challenges for finding information of the glacial lake's region. Therefore, to overcome these challenges, an automatic technique for extraction of glacial lakes using satellite imagery which is termed as GLeSI, is proposed in this article. In the GLeSI system, normalized cut (Ncut) segmentation technique with region adjacency graph and simple linear iterative clustering is proposed for accurate extraction of the glacial lake's region. The proposed system achieved an overall accuracy of 93.21%, 91.57%, 97.65% on Landsat 8 datasets for Imja, Chandra basin, and Bhaga basin glacier lake region, respectively. The qualitative and quantitative performance analysis shows the significant improvement of the proposed technique compared to state-of-the-art techniques for extraction of glacial lake's region.

TI  - Satellite-based daytime urban thermal anisotropy: A comparison of 25 global cities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) has become one of primary observational sources for urban climate research. However, LST is subject to considerable angular variation, particularly in urban areas caused by a large variation of sensor viewing angles and non-isothermal facades of 3D urban structures. Anisotropy varies seasonally and diurnally, and is sensitive to sensor viewing geometry, solar angles, and urban surface properties. Current studies focus on urban thermal anisotropy of individual cities, comparative study and the resultant driving factor analysis are still lacking. To bridge this critical knowledge gap, a systematic comparative assessment of satellite-based urban thermal anisotropy is required. Here, we modify and validate a satellite-based anisotropy estimation approach and compare the seasonal and diurnal anisotropy variations over 25 global cities to answer the following research questions: 1) How do the anisotropy magnitude and profile shapes vary among different cities? 2) What are the factors influencing the anisotropy? The results show that off-nadir observations are up to 3.5 K cooler on average than nadir LST during summer whereas the effective anisotropy ranges between 2.1 K and 5.8 K for all cities. Winter anisotropy is much smaller (similar to 1 K), where the warm or cold bias is determined by solar zenith angle (morning/afternoon overpasses), and its bias magnitude is linearly proportional to the sensor zenith angle. Urban thermal anisotropy is partly influenced by geographic location (e.g., latitude, longitude), urban vegetation (measured by NDVI) and urban geometry (building height-street width ratio, h/w), where low latitude cities or cities with less vegetation tend to have a greater angular variation in summer, and the anisotropy tends to increase with more complex urban morphology (i.e., higher building aspect ratio). High vegetation cover makes the anisotropy distribution shape more asymmetric along the cross-track direction (or sensor zenith angle). Our findings help understand the seasonal and diurnal impact of anisotropy for wide-swath LST applications in cities and offers insights for addressing anisotropy in future satellite products.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Utilizing the direct mooring observation along 130 degrees E (10.5 degrees N, 13 degrees N, 15.5 degrees N, and 18 degrees N), 18 degrees N (122.7 degrees E, 123 degrees E, and 123.3 degrees E), and 8 degrees N (127 degrees E) and satellite data, the seasonal variabilities of the North Equatorial Current (NEC), Kuroshio Current (KC), and Mindanao Current (MC) were investigated. The southern part of the NEC along 130 degrees E, the KC along 18 degrees N, and the MC along 8 degrees N featured similar seasonal cycles: that is, the currents were strong in spring and weak in autumn, while the KC along 18 degrees N featured another peak in winter. Moreover, the seasonal phase of the NEC along 130 degrees E was latitude-dependent; it advanced slightly from 10 degrees N to 14 degrees N and delayed poleward. The seasonal variabilities of the three currents were mainly controlled by local winds and Rossby waves via a geostrophic relationship, as the mooring observation was consistent with satellite data. The calculation shows that the local wind was dominant in the above mentioned in-phase areas (i.e., the southern part of the NEC, KC, and MC), while Rossby waves played an important role in the northern part of the NEC. The results indicate that the NEC-KC-MC system had the same zonal dynamics but different meridional dynamics across seasons.

T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Comprehensive management of the ecological environment and sustainable ecological development, such as the gully control and land consolidation (GCLC) project, may affect surface vegetation. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a sensitive indicator of vegetation dynamics; however, an in-depth study that continually monitors the spatial and temporal variation of regional vegetation before and after the implementation of the GCLC project is still scarce. To address this issue, we analyzed the spatial and temporal variations of Landsat surface reflectance-derived NDVI data in the Jiulongquan watershed in Yan'an City, China, from 2010 to 2019, and examined the main driving factors for these variations. Results showed high overall vegetation coverage in the evaluated watershed. The NDVI was spatially varied and tended to be low in the gully area and high on the slope. From 2010 to 2019, the NDVI values exhibited an increasing trend, and the most evident changes were concentrated in the gully areas. The changes in NDVI were mainly driven by human activities rather than the evaluated climatic factors. This work indicates that the GCLC project had positive effects on the ecological and agricultural environment at a regional scale.

TI  - Urban local surface temperature prediction using the urban gray-green space landscape and vegetation indices
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous rise of global temperature, the urban thermal environment is facing severe challenges. The planning of urban buildings and urban green space (UGS) has a major impact on urban thermal environment. In this study, vegetation and landscape indices were taken as independent variables, and land surface temperature was taken as dependent variable, the gray-green space was used to predict local land surface temperature. The importance of each index was evaluated to explore the importance of gray-green space in mitigating the heat island effect and improving the thermal comfort. The results show that: 1) The characteristics of gray-green space can be used to predict the surface temperature, and the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBRT) model has the best prediction effect and higher accuracy. 2) The building material has a significant effect on the surface temperature, so consideration of the gray space allows a more accurate prediction effect of building material on the local surface temperature in cities. 3) In the course of predicting surface temperature, PLAND _ UGS is the most influential index, which is the proportion of UGS patches in landscape area. Overall, vegetation and landscape indices can predict local surface temperature. The findings can help city planners in designing better urban construction plans, so as to provide more effectively thermal comfort.

TI  - Mapping mangrove leaf area index (LAI) by combining remote sensing images with PROSAIL-D and XGBoost methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a vital parameter reflecting vegetation structure, physioecological process and growth development. Accurate estimation of mangrove LAI is fundamental for assessing the ecological restoration and sustainable development of mangrove ecosystems. To date, very few studies have explored the hybrid method of radiative transfer model (RTM) and machine-learning model in retrieving mangrove LAI with different satellite sensors. This study investigated the capabilities of combining the PROSAIL-D model, XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) and remote sensing images in estimating mangrove LAI, considering the spatial resolutions and spectral vegetation indices (VIs) of Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, Worldview-2 and Zhuhai-1 images, and further explored the role of eco-environmental factors in the spatial distribution of LAI in Gaoqiao Mangrove Reserve, China. The results showed that the Zhuhai-1 acquires the best estimation accuracy (R-Val(2) (the determination coefficient of validation) = 0.86, RPD (residual prediction deviation) = 3.36 and RMSE (root mean square error) = 0.31), followed by Worldview-2 (R-Val(2) = 0.84, RPD = 2.64 and RMSE = 0.33), Sentinel-2 (R-Val(2) = 0.34, RPD = 1.33 and RMSE = 0.62) and Landsat-8 (R-Val(2) = 0.29, RPD = 1.03 and RMSE = 0.71). The newly developed three-band VIs ((B-443 - B-864) / [ (B-443 + B-864) - 2 x B-561] with Landsat-8, (B-490 - B-842) / [(B-490 + B-842) - 2 x B-705] with Sentinel-2, (B-427 - B-832) / (B-908 - B-832) with Worldview-2 and (B-896 - B-700) / (B-776 - B-700) with Zhuhai-1) were efficient estimators of mangrove LAI. Moreover, elevation and species composition could greatly affect the spatial distribution of mangrove LAI. We concluded that the hybrid method of PROSAIL-D and XGBoost model using VIs derived from Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral image could be deemed as basic method and input variables of mapping mangrove LAI, and could be effectively and widely applied in generating mangrove LAI products at the regional and national scales.

TI  - Surviving in a hostile landscape: <i>Nothofagus alessandrii</i> remnant forests threatened by mega-fires and exotic pine invasion in the coastal range of central Chile
T2  - ORYX
M3  - Article
AB  - Nothofagus alessandrii, categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, is an endemic, deciduous tree species of the coastal range of central Chile. We assessed the effects of fire severity, invasion by the exotic fire-prone Pinus radiata, and land-cover composition and configuration of the landscape on the resilience of fragments of N. alessandrii after a mega-fire in 2017. We used remote sensing data to estimate land-use classes and cover, fire severity and invasion cover of P. radiata. We monitored forest composition and structure and post-fire responses of N. alessandrii forests in situ for 2 years after the mega-fire. In the coastal Maule region wildfires have been favoured by intense drought and widespread exotic pine plantations, increasing the ability of fire-adapted invasive species to colonize native forest remnants. Over 85% of N. alessandrii forests were moderately or severely burnt. The propagation and severity of fire was probably amplified by the exotic pines located along the edges of, or inside, the N. alessandrii fragments and the highly flammable pine plantations surrounding these fragments (> 60% of land use is pine plantations). Pinus radiata, a fire-adapted pioneer species, showed strong post-fire recruitment within the N. alessandrii fragments, especially those severely burnt. Positive feedback between climate change (i.e. droughts and heat waves), wildfires and pine invasions is driving N. alessandrii forests into an undesirable and probably irreversible state (i.e. a landscape trap). A large-scale restoration programme to design a diverse and less flammable landscape is needed to avoid the loss of these highly threatened forest ecosystems.

We look at how a conservative authoritarian movement and leadership interact with foreign policy in three different ways-by redefining the place of foreign policy in the wider social and political project of the government; by redesigning how the government prioritizes international relations with different countries; and, most importantly, by alienating the country's foreign policy from its long-standing support for multilateral institutions.

TI  - A bibliometric and content analysis of research trends on GIS-based landslide susceptibility from 2001 to 2020
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - To assess the status of hotspots and research trends on geographic information system (GIS)-based landslide susceptibility (LS), we analysed 1142 articles from the Thomas Reuters Web of Science Core Collection database published during 2001-2020 by combining bibliometric and content analysis. The paper number, authors, institutions, corporations, publication sources, citations, and keywords are noted as sub/categories for the bibliometric analysis. Thematic LS data, including the study site, landslide inventory, conditioning factors, mapping unit, susceptibility models, and mode fit/prediction performance evaluation, are presented in the content analysis. Then, we reveal the advantages and limitations of the common approaches used in thematic LS data and summarise the development trends. The results indicate that the distribution of articles shows clear clusters of authors, institutions, and countries with high academic activity. The application of remote sensing technology for interpreting landslides provides a more convenient and efficient landslide inventory. In the landslide inventory, most of the sample strategies representing the landslides are point and polygon, and the most frequently used sample subdividing strategy is random sampling. The scale effects, lack of geographic consistency, and no standard are key problems in landslide conditioning factors. Feature selection is used to choose the factors that can improve the model's accuracy. With advances in computing technology and artificial intelligence, LS models are changing from simple qualitative and statistical models to complex machine learning and hybrid models. Finally, five future research opportunities are revealed. This study will help investigators clarify the status of LS research and provide guidance for future research.

M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/Land cover (LULC) change seriously affects ecosystem services and ecosystem functions. In order to maintain ecological security and orderly social development, habitat quality assessment based on Land use/Land cover change is worth exploring. Based on multi-source land use data and Google remote sensing data from 1985 to 2017, land use transfer matrix and habitat quality index were used to study land use change, spatial-temporal evolution of habitat quality, and driving factors influencing habitat quality change in Sanjiang Plain. The results showed that Land use/Land cover changed significantly from 1985 to 2017, especially paddy land increased by 22,184.92 km(2), while unutilized land decreased by 11,533.53 km(2). The increase of construction land was mainly at the expense of dry land. There was a polarization in habitat quality, and the high intensity of land use utilization and development resulted in a significant decrease in habitat quality. From 1985 to 2017, the largest change in habitat quality was grassland, which decreased from 0.99 to 0.91.

TI  - A stand-alone remote sensing approach based on the use of the optical trapezoid model for detecting the irrigated areas
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the current water scarcity scenario, the promotion of water saving strategies is essential for improving the sustainability of the irrigated agriculture. In particular, high resolution irrigated area maps are required for better understanding water uses and supporting water management authorities. The main purpose of this study was to provide a stand-alone remote sensing (RS) methodology for mapping irrigated areas. Specifically, an unsupervised classification approach on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data was coupled with the OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) for detecting actual irrigated areas without the use of any reference data. The proposed methodology was firstly applied and validated at the Marchfeld Cropland region (Austria) during the irrigation season 2021, showing a good agreement with an overall accuracy of 70%. Secondly, it was applied at the irrigation district Quota 102,50 (Italy) for the irrigation seasons 2019-2020. The results of the latter were instead compared with the data declared by the Reclamation Consortium, finding an overestimation of irrigated areas of 21%. In conclusion, this study suggests an easy-to-use approach, eventually independent of reference data such as agricultural statistical surveys or records and replicable under different agricultural set-tings in continental or Mediterranean climates to support stakeholders for regular estimation of irrigated areas in different growing years or detecting eventual unauthorized water uses. However, some uncertainties should be considered, needing further analyses for improving the accuracy of the proposed approach.

TI  - Bio-optical properties of the Brazilian Abrolhos Bank's shallow coral-reef waters
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Abrolhos Bank harbors the richest coral reef ecosystem in the South Atlantic Ocean. It exhibits unique geomorphologic structures, is localized in shallow depths, and is divided into two reef regions with an inner arc close to the coast (3-20 m depth) and an outer deeper arc (5-30 m depth). This study aims to describe some bio-optical properties of the Abrolhos Bank waters and to evaluate the performance of the inversion Hyperspectral Optimization Processing Exemplar (HOPE) model, developed to retrieve optical properties in shallow waters, in the region. To this end, measurements at 75 stations during two field campaigns conducted during the 2013 and 2016 wet seasons were analyzed, and the HOPE model was applied to both in situ remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) spectra and PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) imagery. Significant differences in optical and biological properties were found between the two arcs. The empirical relationships between chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and absorption coefficient of phytoplankton at 440 nm (aphy(440)) diverged from Bricaud's models, suggesting differences in phytoplankton diversity and cell size. In both arcs, total non-water absorption coefficient at 440 nm (aT-w(440)) was dominated by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) by & SIM;60%. Absorption coefficient by CDOM (acdom) presented a higher variability within the outer arc, with the lowest contribution from non-algal particles (NAPs), and the spectral slopes of aCDOM resembled those of the inner arc. The spectral slopes of the NAP absorption coefficient suggested a dominance by organic rather than mineral particles that probably originated from biological production. The HOPE model applied to in situ Rrs performed satisfactorily for depth in the Abrolhos Bank waters, although retrievals of aphy(440), CDOM plus NAP (adg(440)) and aT-w(440) were underestimated with a relative bias of -27.9%, -32.1% and -45.8%, respectively. The HOPE model retrievals from the PRISMA image exhibited low aphy(440) values over the whole scene and the highest adg(440) values in the Caravelas river plume. Very shallow depths (& LE;3 m), bottom substrate reflectance used as input in the HOPE model, model parametrization associated with the water complexity in the study site, and uncertainties associated to Rrs measurements used as input might be responsible for differences found when comparing HOPE retrievals with in situ measurements.

TI  - Predicting the impacts of urban development on seasonal urban thermal environment in Guwahati city, northeast India
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The formation and intensification of the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon over an urban area largely depend on its land surface properties, which alters the urban thermal environment. So, assessing and predicting the effect of land use land cover (LULC) change on thermal environment of urban area is crucial. In this context, the present study aims to analyze the LULC change and its effect on land surface temperature (LST) and the UHI phenomenon over Guwahati city, northeast India, from 1995 to 2020 using Landsat data. A significant increase in built-up land of about 147.5% is seen during 1995-2020, while vegetation and cropland show decreasing trend of about 47% and 27%, respectively. Moreover, the future simulation of LULC using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based Cellular Automata (CA) model suggests a continuous increase in urban built-up land to about 10.18% during 2020-2030. The future prediction result of seasonal LST using XGB (Extreme Gradient Boosting) regression suggests that around 86.73% in 2025 and 94.53% in 2030 will have to face higher LST of 15 degrees C-<20 degrees C in the summer season and 82.58% in 2025 and 97.16% in 2030 of 25 degrees C-<30 degrees C zone in the winter season. The dis-tribution of urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) maps suggest the occurrence of the strongest UTFVI zones over the built-up land while none UTFVI over the surrounding rural region, suggesting a positive UHI phenomenon. Over the predicted years, a notable increase in the strongest UTFVI zone in the built-up region is seen, more significantly in summer than in winter.

TI  - Diagnostic biopsy of cutaneous melanoma, sentinel lymph node biopsy and indications for lymphadenectomy
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Letter
AB  - The incidence of cutaneous melanoma appears to be increasing worldwide and this is attributed to solar radiation exposure. Early diagnosis is a challenging task. Any clinically suspected lesion must be assessed by complete diagnostic excision biopsy (margins 1-2 mm); however, there are other biopsy techniques that are less commonly used. Melanomas are characterized by Breslow thickness as thin (< 1 mm), intermediate (1-4 mm) and thick (> 4 mm). This thickness determines their biological behavior, therapy, prognosis and survival. If the biopsy is positive, a wide local excision (margins 1-2 cm) is finally performed. However, metastasis to regional lymph nodes is the most accurate prognostic determinant. Therefore, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for diagnosed melanoma plays a pivotal role in the management strategy. Complete lymph node clearance has undoubted advantages and is recommended in all cases of positive SLN biopsy. A PET-CT (positron emission tomography-computed tomography) scan is necessary for staging and follow-up after treatment. Novel targeted therapies and immunotherapies have shown improved outcomes in advanced cases.

TI  - Accumulation of metal trace elements in different body parts of terrestrial Roman snail <i>Helix pomatia</i> L., 1758 on three polluted sites in Serbia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric pollution remains one of the growing concerns in the twenty-first century, with particular focus on metal trace elements (MTE) from anthropogenic sources, due to their adverse effects on biota. The concentration and type of MTE in the atmosphere and in the soil are diverse, depending on the origin of pollutants, which can cause diverse detrimental effects on organisms living in the nearby environment. Three sites in Central Serbia with different origins of MTE pollution (urban contamination, smelting, and fly ash area) were assessed, using terrestrial Roman snails (Helix pomatia) as biomarker organisms. These snails are sentinel organisms and are known for their capacities for accumulation of MTE. Snails were sampled and their body was divided in three parts: viscera, foot, and shell and concentrations of MTE were determined in each of these body parts using inductively coupled plasma optical spectrometry. Results showed contrasting MTE accumulation patterns in body parts of the snails. Of three studied sites, snails sampled in the vicinity of fly ash containment had lower concentrations of MTE compared to other two polluted sites.

TI  - Cluster landslides and associated damage in the Dima Hasao district of Assam, India due to heavy rainfall in May 2022
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - During 11-18 May 2022, the Dima Hasao district of Assam state in India received heavy rainfall. The rainfall triggered floods and landslides across the district, resulting in the death of three people and damage to property (mainly road and rail network) worth few hundred crores of Indian rupees. Platforms of the New Haflong railway station were completely buried by multiple debris flows, and several coaches of a train were overtoppled. We hereby investigate the cause of the landslide disaster by analyzing temporal rainfall data and also assess damages in the region using high-resolution optical satellite imagery from Resourcesat-2A (5.8 m), Sentinel-2 (10 m), and Cartosat-3 (1.1 m) satellites. It is seen from the satellite-based precipitation measurement that the region around Haflong town received maximum 24 h rainfall (156 mm) on 11 May 2022 and the heavy rainfall continued till 18 May 2022. This resulted in the occurrence of 5178 landslides, which are mapped using multi-temporal cloud free optical satellite data. Rainfall data analysis shows that 4 days antecedent rainfall of similar to 200 mm has mainly triggered landslides in this area. The initial heavy rainfall has saturated the soil and increased the pore pressure, which caused slope failure due to subsequent spell of rains. Small-sized landslides are seen to damage buildings in the Haflong town and neighboring villages. Various roads, including the Lumding-Silchar highway, were damaged at multiple places by landslides. Landslides were triggered mainly within Renji and Bokabil Rock Formations on moderate to high slopes. Results are further substantiated by debris flow simulations which showed that similar to 4 m height of debris may have been accumulated in the New Haflong railway station, thus burying the railway track and platforms.

TI  - Urbanization and Land surface temperature changes over Hyderabad, a semi-arid mega city in India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing/developed cities have resulted in massive anthropogenic modifications of the envi-ronment through replacement of natural land cover with concrete, bricks, asphalt and metal. This reduces evapotranspiration, increases the heat storage and alters air movement. Consequently, many urban areas experience temperatures higher than their surrounding rural areas, turning them into Urban Heat Islands (UHI). Hyderabad, a Tier-1 Indian city has experienced significant land use land cover (LULC) changes during the last two decades (2001-2020) owing to rapid ur-banization. This study investigates the urban growth and consequent changes in surface UHI (SUHI) intensity over this period using Landsat LULC, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) and Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Substantial LULC changes were observed during this period with the urban area increas-ing by 108.8%, but barren and grasslands decreasing by 27.2% and 27.0%, respectively. Vegeta-tion showed a decreasing trend by 19.0% from 2001 to 2015, but an increase by 24.8% during the 2015 to 2020 period. Comparison with surrounding rural areas led to the conclusion that Hyder-abad urban behaved as an surface Urban Cool Island (SUCI) during the daytime and as SUHI dur-ing the nighttime with higher LST regions concentrated within 0-15 km from the city center. The area from 20 to 25 km from the city center experienced the highest urban expansion in the last two decades.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kaymaz Gold Deposit (KGD) is an economically important gold deposit in Eskis,ehir, Central Anatolia, Turkiye. The deposit occurred in very rare non carbonate-containing and highly silicified listvenite rock, an alteration product of serpentine in the Tavs,anli Zone, located south of the Izmir-Ankara-Erzincan Suture Zone. We studied the alteration in the KGD through petrographic examination and XRD analyses. We used Fourier -transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to study the spectral absorption properties of field samples. The absor-bance and reflectance patterns of the samples were used to derive mineral maps using the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER) and Sentinel-2 images. The argillized zone was mapped using ASTER band ratio images 4/6, 4/9, 7/6, and RGB (red-green-blue) composite images. In addition, the 11/2 and 10/11 band ratios of Sentinel-2 were used to map Fe-oxyhydroxide containing listvenite and serpentinite, respectively. The images of band ratios and derived RGBs discriminated the altered rocks as well as the meta-morphic and ultramafic rocks occurring around the open-pit mine and can be used to explore new deposits in similar geological settings. The results were verified and confirmed in the field, which showed that the ore zone is highly silicified with significant Fe-oxyhydroxide content.

TI  - Algorithm for vertical distribution of boundary layer aerosol components in remote-sensing data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The vertical distribution of atmospheric aerosol components is vital to the estimation of radiative forcing and the catalysis of atmospheric photochemical processes. Based on the synergy of ground-based lidar and sun-photometer in Generalized Aerosol Retrieval from Radiometer and Lidar Combined data (GARRLiC), this paper developed a new algorithm to get the vertical mass concentration profiles of fine-mode aerosol components for the first time. Retrieval of aerosol properties was achieved based on the sky radiance at multiple scatter angles, total optical depth (TOD) at 440, 675, 870, and 1020 nm, and lidar signals at 532 and 1064 nm. In addition, the internal mixing model and normalized volume size distribution (VSD) model were established according to the absorption and water solubility of the aerosol components, to separate the profiles of black carbon (BC), water-insoluble organic matter (WIOM), water-soluble organic matter (WSOM), ammonium nitrate-like (AN), and fine aerosol water (AW) content. Results showed a reasonable vertical distribution of aerosol components compared with in situ observations and reanalysis data. The estimated and observed BC concentrations matched well with a correlation coefficient up to 0.91, while there was an evident overestimation of organic matter (OM D WIOM C WSOM, NMB D 0.98). Moreover, the retrieved AN concentrations were closer to the simulated results (R = 0.85), especially in polluted conditions. The BC and OM correlations were relatively weaker, with a correlation coefficient of similar to 0.5. Besides, the uncertainties caused by the input parameters (i.e., relative humidity (RH), volume concentration, and extinction coefficients) were assessed using the Monte Carlo method. The AN and AW had smaller uncertainties at higher RH. Herein, the proposed algorithm was also applied to remotesensing measurements in Beijing with two typical cases. In the clean condition with low RH, there were comparable AN and WIOM, but peaking at different altitudes. On the other hand, in the polluted case, AN was dominant and the maximum mass concentration occurred near the surface. We expected that the algorithm could provide a new idea for lidar inversion and promote the development of aerosol component profiles.

TI  - Landslide hazard and susceptibility maps derived from satellite and remote sensing data using limit equilibrium analysis and machine learning model
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide susceptibility mapping and landslide hazard mapping are approaches used to assess the potential for landslides and predict the occurrence of landslides, respectively. We evaluated and tested a limit equilibrium approach to produce a local-scale, multi-temporal geographic information system-based landslide hazard map that utilized satellite soil moisture data, soil strength and hydrologic data, and a high-resolution (1.5 m) LiDAR-derived digital elevation map. The final multi-temporal landslide hazard map was validated temporally and spatially using four study sites at known landslide locations and failure dates. The resulting product correctly indicated low factor of safety values at the study sites on the dates the landslide occurred. Also, we produced a regional-scale landslide susceptibility map using a logistic regression machine learning model using 15 variables derived from the geomorphology, soil properties, and land-cover data. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve was used for the accuracy of the model, which yielded a success rate of 0.84. We show that using publicly available data, a multi-temporal landslide hazard map can be created that will produce a close-to-real-time landslide predictive map. The landslide hazard map provides an understanding into the evolution of landslide development temporally and spatially, whereas the landslide susceptibility map indicates the probability of landslides occurring at specific locations. When used in tandem, the two mapping models are complementary to each other. Specifically, the landslide susceptibility mapping identifies the area most susceptible to landslides, while the landslide hazard mapping predicts when landslide may occur within the identified susceptible area.

TI  - Improving mine reclamation efficiency for farmland sustainable use: Insights from optimizing mining scheme
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground coal mining inevitably causes ground subsidence, especially in the coal-grain composite area with a high groundwater table (HGT) in eastern China, where mining subsidence causes waterlogging of arable land and threatens regional food security. Concurrent Mining and Reclamation (CMR) of underground coal mines em-phasizes the implementation of reclamation measures in the subsidence process, so it is necessary to simulate and analyze dynamic subsidence to optimize reclamation planning. In this paper, the Guqiao coal mine, one of the HGT coal mining areas in eastern China, is used as a research area. First, the New Water Index (NWI) method and Otsu image segmentation algorithm were adopted to quantitatively analyze the spatial distribution and expan-sion of surface ponding caused by underground coal mining from 2008 to 2020 based on Landsat remote sensing images. Second, Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua in three Dimensions (FLAC3D) was used to invert the law of surface subsidence and the evolution characteristics of surface water caused by different mining schemes. Finally, each simulated mining scheme's reclamation timing, earthwork allocation, and reclamation rate were compared. The results show that: (1) the waterlogging area increases yearly with coal mining, reaching 1049 hm2 in 2020; (2) compared with the traditional reclamation (TR) rate of 32%, the reclamation rate of CMR could be increased to 65%; (3) the best mining scheme for CMR was up-warding skip mining with a reclamation duration of three years in this case. Optimization of mining schemes could control the temporal and spatial distribution of surface subsidence and determine the land reclamation plan. Meanwhile, the land use planning feedback could guide the mining scheme's design and realize sustainable land use during the mining life cycle in other similar areas.

TI  - Spatial-temporal variation analysis of water storage and its impacts on ecology and environment in high-intensity coal mining areas
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In common with other important coal bases in northwestern China, the hydrology and ecology and environment of Ordos, northern Shaanxi (Shanbei), and Shanxi Provinces have much. Terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA), soil moisture anomaly (SMA), and groundwater storage anomaly (GWSA), are important water storage qualities that play a critical role in the distribution and growth of vegetation. In this paper, multi-source remote sensing data were used to analyze the spatial-temporal changes and relationships of water storage, ecology and environment from 2002 to 2020. The numerical results showed the TWSA and GWSA in the study area had a declining trend and the rates were -7.512 mm yr(-1) and -8.268 mm yr(-1), respectively. On the contrary, the SMS showed an increasing trend, and the rate was 0.840 mm yr(-1). By trend variation and correlation analysis, we found GWSA is the main part in the variation of TWSA. By further analysis, it was found that the climate factors are not the major factors causing the variation of GWSA, but coal mining and artificial irrigation activities, which are especially clear in the Taihang Mountains in eastern Shanxi Province. The ecology and environment have been improving, and water storage and climate factors have played a different role in different regions. The warm climate conditions and the increased 0-40 cm of soil water have promoted the growth of vegetation and the improvement of the ecology and environment. The research results are helpful to understand the impacts of water storage on the ecology and environment in high-intensity coal mining areas.

TI  - Christian Worldview as a Critical Information Literacy Lens: A Synthesis of the CCCU Commitments and the ACRL Framework
T2  - CHRISTIAN HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The work of numerous authors discussing the integration of Christian faith and practice in higher education has been presented in the scholarly conversation to date. Simultaneously, literature abounds regarding the Association of College and Research Libraries' (ACRL) Framework for Information literacy for Higher Education, its application by academic librarians and teaching faculty in the classroom, and how this framework is being utilized by scholars espousing critical information theories to analyze information. This article proposes an intersectional approach to these distinct scholarly discussions and attempts to answer the question: How can Christian educators equip students to navigate the information ecosystem of a fallen world with a Christ-centered perspective? Reasons for undertaking this work are evidenced by the three commitments articulated by the Council for Christian College & Universities (CCCU) to which the organization's 185+ member institutions adhere; additionally, the ways in which educators can achieve this goal are founded in the guiding document on higher education information literacy concepts, the ACRL Framework.

TI  - Past and potential future distribution of white mangroves in an arid estuarine environment: Integration of Maxent and CA-Markov models
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study performed a coupled modeling approach to assess the past-to-future distribution of white mangrove trees (Avicennia marina) along an intertidal zone in the Strait of Hormuz. Historical mangrove distributions were extracted from 3 temporally-median-filtered Landsat images in 2002 (ETM+), 2011 (TM), and 2020 (OLI). The mangrove habitat suitability was investigated using the Maxent model, employing distance from shoreline, creeks, and mangroves, elevation and sediment physio-chemical characteristics. The sediment attributes including EC, pH, sediment texture, total organic carbon, bulk density, and total nitrogen and phosphorous were measured at 25 sampling points and interpolated using the IDW technique. The resulting habitat layer was used as the transition layer in the CA-Markov to predict the future distribution of mangroves by 2030 and 2040. From 2002-2020, the mangrove cover increased by 165 ha (annual rate of 8.19 ha) through both edge-and out-growth patterns. The habitat suitability modeling was performed successfully with an AUC of 0.962 with distance from mangrove patches, distance from water creeks, sediment texture, and phosphorous as the most important pre-dictors. According to the CA-Markov prediction (AUC of 0.690), the area of mangroves is projected to increase to 497 and 543 ha in a compact edge-growth pattern by 2030 and 2040, respectively.

TI  - Comprehensive effect of the three-dimensional spatial distribution pattern of buildings on the urban thermal environment
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The three-dimensional spatial distribution pattern of buildings is an important factor causing the spatial differences in the urban thermal environment. The study units were divided based on the urban road network, DEM, and building big data in Jinan. The Landsat 8 remote sensing images were used to invert the land surface temperature (LST), and Kriging interpolation was used to obtain the spatially continuous air temperature (AT). The integrated LST and AT represented the urban thermal environment. By constructing three-dimensional spatial distribution indicators of buildings and using analysis of variance and multiple correspondence analysis methods, the influence of the three-dimensional spatial distribution pattern of buildings on the urban thermal environment was comprehensively investigated. The results showed that all the indicators of the three-dimensional spatial distribution of buildings were factors that have prominent influence on the urban thermal environment. The interaction of mean DEM respectively with building density, volume ratio, mean building height, and mean building volume demonstrated significant effects on both LST and AT, and the analysis of variance results of these indicators with each temperature reached a significance level of <= 0.05. The types and levels of the main strongly correlated indicators varied with increasing temperature levels. The optimal combination of levels corresponding to the lower LST depended on the terrain, while the lower AT was affected by a combination of buildings and terrain. The height indicators contributed more to LST than to AT.

TI  - Measurement and comparison of photosynthetically active radiation by different methods at Delhi
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) received at the earth surface is the primary driver of plant growth and biomass production. The absence of a dedicated sensor network for regular measurements of PAR over the Indian region poses a challenge to the crop modelers and the decision makers. In the absence of any long-term study of PAR from this region, the present study from Delhi provides 4 years (2013-2016) of dedicated PAR measurements and also compares it with three other different methods of PAR estimation. PAR has been measured at the surface using Kipp and Zonen PQS1 PAR sensor and the data has been compared with the remotely sensed CERES-derived all-sky PAR values. It was also compared with the PAR estimated by fractional method using shortwave (SW) flux measured by pyranometer and the ratio of PAR/SW fraction using long-term satellite data for Delhi. It was further compared with the TUV radiative transfer model-derived PAR on clear-sky days. The daily mean PAR observed at Delhi is in the range 7.9 to 185.3 Wm(-2) (average 94.5 +/- 1.1 Wm(-2)) which nearly matched with the CERES-derived PAR in the range 10.8 to 144.3 Wm(-2) (average 89.4 +/- 0.8 Wm(-2)) and PAR derived by fractional method range 8.9 to 187 Wm(-2) (with average 88.1 +/- 0.8 Wm(-2)). The TUV model-estimated PAR on clear-sky days was found in the range 39.1-154.9 Wm(-2) (average 96.8 +/- 1.4 Wm(-2)) which showed a strong correlation of 0.82 with the observed PAR values on concurrent days. PAR estimated by all the three methods showed a good correlation with the observations (> 0.80). It may be concluded that in the absence of a regular PAR measurements, any of the three above methods of PAR estimation can give fairy accurate value at a point but CERES gives added advantage of providing PAR over large spatial area in the region.

TI  - Corporate governance: Does it matter management of carbon emission performance? An empirical analyses of Indian companies
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - There is anxiety that has been rising vis-`a-vis the climate changes in the entire world. Notwithstanding this, the primary purpose of this paper is to examine the board characteristics and carbon emission performance. This study applied the fixed effect model, 2SLS, and multiple regression analyses data from 220 non-financial listed companies on the BSE index and covering a period of 7 years from FY 2014-15 to FY 2020-21. The estimated results confirmed that board size, board meetings, board gender diversity, CEO duality, and ownership con-centration have a negative association with carbon emission performance. In addition, board independence and the environmental committee are found to be positively associated with carbon emission performance based on 2 SLS and multiple regression analyses, and these results imply that they improve carbon performance. Overall, this study's shreds of evidence suggest that governing boards tend to pay attention to company's carbon per-formance and without mitigating original carbon performance is not likely to reduced GHGs emissions. This study's outcomes have significant implications for policymakers, corporate bodies, creditors, and regulators regarding the efficiency of corporate governance mechanisms in communicating climate change risks. However, corporate boards can use these results to find positive aspects of companies and formulate possible corporate governance modifications in relation to carbon policies.

TI  - Development and validation of a drill attachment for faster and safer deployments of fin-mounted geolocators in large-bodied sharks
T2  - ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fin-mounted geolocators are widely used in marine studies to track animal movements and to design informed management strategies. However, the deployment protocols of such geolocators, which normally consist of drilling one to multiple holes using a template, can be challenging, and depending on the animal's stress physiology and ocean conditions, speed and accuracy may be crucial. Here, we present the plans for a drill attachment allowing the template-free drilling of up to four holes simultaneously for a faster, more accurate and safer deployment of fin-mounted geolocators. The drill attachment was successfully tested on four great and two scalloped hammerheads, Sphyrna mokarran and Sphyrna lewini, which were all tagged with 4-bolt Smart Position and Temperature (SPOT) tags. The time required to secure the geolocators, from drill alignment to the complete fastening of the last bolt, ranged from 68 to 85 s (78.2 +/- 10.9 s, mean +/- SD). The new drill attachment further allowed the successful tagging of a great hammerhead alongside a research vessel in rough seas that would have made the deployment using traditional protocols more challenging. Simultaneously drilling four holes reduces the need to keep the animal's fin steady for an extended period of time and thus makes the deployment of fin-mounted geolocators less dependent on the animal's behavior and the weather conditions. As such, the 4-hole drill attachment makes the mounting process faster and more reliable and should reduce the stress experienced by the animal.

TI  - Dust source susceptibility mapping based on remote sensing and machine learning techniques
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust source susceptibility modeling and mapping is the first step in managing the impacts of dust on environ-mental systems and human health. In this study, satellite products and terrestrial data were used to detect dust sources in central Iran using remote sensing and machine learning techniques. After recording 890 sites as dust sources based on field surveys and determining 14 independent variables affecting wind erosion and dust sources, dust source distribution maps were prepared through GLM (Generalized Linear Model), CTA (Classifi-cation Tree Analysis), ANN (Artificial Neural Network), MARS (Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline), RF (Random Forest), Maxent (Maximum Entropy), and ensemble algorithms. Specifically, 70% of dust source sites were used as training data and 30% were used for algorithm performance evaluation through different statistical methods such as partial ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristic), sensitivity, specificity, and TSS (True Skill Statistics). According to the results, following the ensemble model, RF had the highest and GLM had the lowest performance in dust source detection. According to the ensemble model, precipitation with a mean weight of 0.3 followed by evaporation, temperature, and soil moisture with mean weight of 0.173, 0.16, and 0.153, respec-tively, were the main driving forces in dust susceptibility mapping. This model classified 40.92% of the study area with low potential, 15.37% with medium potential, 25.77% with high potential, and 17.94% with very high potential. The research findings indicate that the integration of remote sensing and prediction algorithms can be used as a useful means for predicting the spatial distribution of dust sources in arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - The effect of spatial and temporal scale on camouflage in North African rodents.
T2  - Biological Journal of the Linnean Society
M3  - Article
AB  - Background matching, a common form of camouflage, is a widespread anti-predator adaptation that hinders detection or recognition by increasing the resemblance of prey to its environment. However, the natural environment is complex and both spatially and temporally variable, which constrains effective background matching as an anti-predator strategy. Here, using remote sensing data (publicly available satellite imagery), we investigated how variation of habitat parameters predicts background matching in 16 Sahara-Sahel rodent species across spatial and temporal scales. All fur colour parameters (hue, saturation and brightness) strongly matched the respective habitats of the different species. Background matching in terms of hue was best at the microscale, whereas results for saturation and brightness showed more variation across spatial scales among species. Camouflage across the temporal scale (from 1 to 3 years before capture) was variable among species for all colour parameters. These complex interactions suggest that, in desert rodents, colour parameters are differentially sensitive to the respective scale of the habitat, plausibly reflecting the behaviour and life history of the species and the ecological properties determining their activity patterns. Consequently, the division between habitat (camouflage) generalists and specialists might become blurred in temporally changing and spatially variable environments.

TI  - Sentinel species selection for monitoring microplastic pollution: A review on one health approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Nowadays, global environmental pollution is one of the most topical issues we have to deal with on a daily basis. Due to the development of the current society including industrial and agricultural areas, pollution and waste have increased dramatically in recent years. Among all contaminants spread worldwide, the increased use of plastic is probably the most evident. Nevertheless, plastic objects which are released into environmental com-partments are processed into smaller units of plastic debris, defined, based on their dimensions, as micro-(MP) and nano-plastics (NP). These particles are classified as some of the most hazardous current micro-pollutants. The use of model organisms as bioindicators is one of the most effective ways to monitor and assess the occurrence of plastic particles in the environment.This review aims to provide comprehensive knowledge about the behaviour and the effects of MP/NPs par-ticles on animals, humans, and the environment through the "One Health" concept, which provides an innovative and suitable perspective focused on the intersection of the above-mentioned three areas. Moreover, the key point is the evaluation of the most efficient bioindicators for monitoring microplastic pollution in environmental compartments, in order to better understand the importance of being more eco-friendly through the reduction of plastics objects.Whereas the earth is composed of about 70% water, a special focus is placed on aquatic ecosystems and the relative bioindicators. In addition, this collection of information highlights a common issue that requires awareness, prevention, and solutions to take care of global environments.

TI  - Using SWAT to model the response of evapotranspiration and runoff to varying land uses and climatic conditions in the Muringato basin, Kenya
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration and runoff being the major outflows in a water balance help in accounting for the water losses from the land surface and the amount of water available to replenish the streamflow. Their trends over time are influenced by the changes in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC), and climatic patterns. Muringato basin located in the Upper Tana River Basin, Kenya has faced degradation over the years as a result of anthropogenic factors, with an increase in population and changing climatic patterns being noted. This necessitates monitoring, managing, and conserving the basin for its sustainable utilisation. This research utilised remotely sensed data for the Muringato basin: Landsat satellite imageries, a digital elevation model, climatic data, and soil data to simulate the evapotranspiration and runoff from 1990 to 2020 while considering the changing LULC and climatic conditions in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The model was satisfactorily calibrated and validated using the observed discharge data. The simulation results indicated that both outflow components account for 78% of the rainfall received in the basin. A 21.4% reduction in the forest cover by 2020 contributed to reduced evapotranspiration by 100 mm and increased runoff amounts by 5 mm. Therefore, the changes in the LULC and climatic patterns could easily alter the water balance. Thus, there is a need to formulate policies and sensitise the community on the importance of environmental conservation and its management. This would ensure that a healthy water balance in the Muringato basin is maintained.

TI  - A gap-filling hybrid approach for hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> prediction at high spatial resolution from multi-sourced AOD data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite a growing interest in the satellite derived estimation of ground-level PM2.5 concentrations, modeling hourly PM2.5 levels at high spatial resolution with complete coverage for a large study domain remains a challenge. The primary modeling challenges lie in the presence of missing data in aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the limited data resolution for a single-platformed satellite AOD product. To address these issues, we developed a gap-filling hybrid approach to estimate full coverage hourly ground-level PM2.5 concentrations at a high spatial resolution of 1 km using multi-platformed and multi-scale satellite derived AOD products. Specif-ically, we filled the gaps and downscaled the multi-sourced AOD from Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC), and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications -version 2 (MERRA-2), using a hybrid data fusion approach. The fused hourly AOD with full coverage was then used for hourly PM2.5 predictions at a high spatial resolution of 1 km. We demonstrated the application of the proposed approach and assessed its performance using the data collected from northeastern Asia from 2015 to 2019. Our fused hourly AOD data showed high accuracy with the mean absolute error of 0.14 and correlation coefficient of 0.94, in validation against Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD. Our AOD-based PM2.5 prediction model showed a good prediction accuracy with cross -validated R2 of 0.85 and root mean squared error of 12.40 mu g/m3, respectively. Given that the highly resolved PM2.5 predictions captured both the temporal trend and the peak of PM2.5 pollution scenarios, we concluded that the proposed hybrid approach can effectively combine multi-sourced satellite AOD and derive subsequent PM2.5 distributions at high spatial and temporal resolutions.

TI  - Could a city-dwelling bat<i> (Pipistrellus</i><i> kuhlii)</i> serve as a bioindicator species for trace metals pollution?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Bats are an endangered group of mammals that are very sensitive to environmental stresses. One of such stress factor is trace metals pollution which threatens populations of insectivorous bats due to their top position in the food webs and exceptionally long life span. In our research Pipistrellus kuhlii was tested as a promising indicator species (urbandwelling, sedentary, with limited daily home-range) for trace metal exposure of bats. We measured concentrations of Pb, Cu, Zn and Cd in internal and external tissues of bats from the industrial city Mariupol and the village Karlovka, Ukraine, to answer the following questions: (1) Do metal concentrations in soil samples differ between urban and rural areas, and between populations of P. kuhlii from those areas? (2) Does metal contamination differ between individuals of different sexes and ages? (3) Whether fur and/or wing membrane, the two tissues that can be collected from live bats, can be used as proxies of metal contamination in internal tissues (liver, kidney, lung, forearm bones) of P. kuhlii? Metal concentrations in soil samples were significantly higher in the city. Bats from the city accumulated significantly more Cd, Pb and Zn in external tissues than those from the rural area. Females accumulated more Cd than males, and this-year-born did not differ significantly from adult individuals. We did not find, however, significant positive correlations between metal concentrations in external and internal tissues, indicating that external tissues cannot serve as an indicator of the metal contamination of internal tissues in P. kuhlii.

TI  - Seasonal controls on nearshore dissolved oxygen variability and hypoxia in a coastal embayment
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Declining dissolved oxygen (DO) is emerging as an increasingly important stressor in nearshore ecosystems, and there is a growing need to better understand DO dynamics and hypoxia risk in this highly variable environment. In this study, we collected data from monthly cruises on the inner shelf, continuous nearshore moorings inside and outside a small coastal upwelling embayment (San Luis Obispo Bay in Central California), and weekly phytoplankton measurements inside the bay during the upwelling season. Nearshore DO was generally domi-nated by low-frequency synoptic variability, with increased DO variance near the surface relative to the bottom and inside the bay compared to outside. Two nearshore hypoxic regimes were identified. In the first regime, which occurred during periods of strong upwelling in the spring across all nearshore sites, the nearshore bottom water temperature-DO (T-DO) relationship was aligned with that found offshore, suggesting hypoxia was driven by the direct advection and cross-shelf exchange of low DO subthermocline waters from the shelf. This period also coincided with minimal water-column stratification, small vertical DO differences, and a diatom-dominated phytoplankton assemblage. In the second regime, which occurred during summer months and was characterized by weaker upwelling, strong stratification, and dinoflagellate-dominated phytoplankton assemblage, the near -bottom T-DO relationship inside the bay deviated significantly from that on the shelf offshore. These hypoxic events inside the bay were likely driven by localized respiration and lack of ventilation of bottom waters due to strong stratification. Collectively, these observations reveal a shift in the strength and magnitude of physical versus biological processes driving nearshore DO dynamics. The high spatiotemporal variability of DO dynamics in upwelling bays means that they are likely to be at the forefront of ecosystem impacts of and adaptions to climate change, and may act as sentinel systems or "canaries on the coast."

M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) provides an effective way to investigate global and regional var-iations in atmospheric aerosols. However, due to cloud cover and surface reflectance, AOD datasets derived from satellite instruments generally have non-random missing values, which introduces additional uncertainty into AOD data and limits its downstream. To remedy this problem, this study used a two-stage approach based on spatial interpolation and a random forest model to fill the gaps in data generated by the Multiangle Imple-mentation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) aerosol retrieval algorithm, which provides the best-available AOD product to the global public. The relationship between ground-level fine particulate matter concentra-tions and satellite AOD was considered in the modeling. By gap-filling daily 1-km MAIAC AOD data from 2003 to 2019 over Taiwan, the two-stage model achieved comparable accuracy (coefficient of determination = 0.52, root-mean-square error = 0.22) against ground-level AOD measurements to the accuracy that has been achieved by previous studies. Furthermore, it improved daily high-spatial-resolution AOD estimates to 100% of spatial coverage. Comparisons between the full-coverage estimates and MAIAC retrievals showed that the MAIAC AOD dataset generally underestimated monthly/seasonal/annual mean AOD values in Taiwan. We also used the long-term estimates of the daily 1-km AOD dataset with full coverage to explore the spatiotemporal trends in AOD in Taiwan. The practical approach developed in this study is suitable for application in long-and short-term studies of air pollution and its effects on public health.

TI  - VSDF: A variation-based spatiotemporal data fusion method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The fusion of spatiotemporal data provides the possibility to improve both the spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing data. Nevertheless, the performance of current spatiotemporal data fusion methods is affected by several aspects, e.g., (1) retrieval of abrupt land cover changes, (2) recovery of detailed spatial information, and (3) the need to reduce side effects related to the performance differences between sensors. Concerning the above aspects, this study proposes the use of a Variation-based Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (VSDF) method. In VSDF, an abundant variation classification (AVC) is used to identify explicitly the land cover changes for spectral unmixing. In addition, feature-level fusion is introduced to strengthen the spatial structures, i.e., the edges and texture. Furthermore, a relative reliability index (RRI) is proposed to guide the prediction process to lower the uncertainty of the input datasets. With reference to the all-round performance assessment (APA) metrics, the performance of VSDF was compared with five popular methods, i.e., Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF), FSDAF 2.0, Reliable and Adaptive Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (RASDF), and Fit-FC (regression model Fitting, spatial Filtering and residual Compensation). The experimental results demonstrated that VSDF can realize a more accurate prediction of temporal land cover changes with better spatial detail than the benchmark methods. Consequently, VSDF has the potential to generate accurate high-spatiotemporal-resolution simulations for global remote sensing studies.

TI  - A multi-task driven and reconfigurable network for cloud detection in cloud-snow coexistence regions from very-high-resolution remote sensing images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is a crucial step in remote sensing image preprocessing. Deep learning (DL) methods are currently preferred for cloud detection, and the original images need to be cropped into smaller patches for DL training and testing. However, in very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing cloud-snow coexistence scenes, the cropped patches have low feature richness and high inter-class feature similarity. As a result, the common DL methods are prone to misclassifying clouds in complex regions. Therefore, based on the expanded cloud detection dataset of VHR cloud-snow coexistence regions, this paper proposes a multi-task driven and recon-figurable network (MTDR-Net) to better perform the cloud detection work in the scenes. There are four modules in MTDR-Net: the high-resolution backbone with multiple projection heads module (HRB-MPH), the re-parametrizable multi-scale feature fusion module (RP-MFF), the lightweight and adaptive feature fusion mod-ule (LAFF), and the multi-task gradient flow guidance module (MTGFG). HRB-MPH facilitates global information interaction, enhances the multi-level granularity feature representation, and supports feature sharing between pixel-level and superpixel-level segmentation tasks. RP-MFF is used to capture the local multi-scale cloud fea-tures in the training stage and simplify losslessly the structure in the testing stage. LAFF is employed to reconstruct meaningful cloud features. MTGFG can provide unbiased guidance on dividing gradient flow be-tween the multi-tasks. The experimental results show that the MTDR-Net obtains the greatest accuracy perfor-mance due to its anti-interference capacity for confusing ground objects and its excellent cloud boundary and thin cloud extraction ability. In addition, MTDR-Net has the fewest parameters, forward-reasoning floating point operations, memory footprint, and memory access volume. With the coarse-to-fine strategy, MTDR-Net can be further sped up by avoiding inference resource consumption in cloud-free/all-cloud scenes.

TI  - P2Sharpen: A progressive pansharpening network with deep spectral transformation
T2  - INFORMATION FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Most existing deep learning-based methods for pansharpening task solely rely on the supervision of pseudo -ground-truth multi-spectral images, which exhibits two limitations in producing high-quality images. On the one hand, it is uncontrollable to regulate the full-resolution performance due to the fact that their whole training process only remain at the scale of reduced resolution. On the other hand, they ignore the accurate spatial information reference of high-resolution panchromatic images for supervision, resulting in insufficient spatial structure details. To address these challenges, we propose a progressive pansharpening network with deep spectral transformation, termed as P2Sharpen, where we balance the performance in different resolutions and make full use of the observed satellite data to improve the quality of fused results. First, we design a spectral transformation network (STNet) to cross the modality difference between multi-spectral data and panchromatic data, which establishes an accurate mapping function from MS to PAN images. Second, we propose a progressive pansharpening network (P2Net), in which the optimization of pansharpening at reduced and full resolutions is considered in a two-stage manner, balancing the performance at two scales effectively. In addition, we introduce the trained STNet to construct the consistency constraint between the sharpened result and PAN image at both reduced-resolution stage and full-resolution stage, which further improves the ability of P2Net for preserving spatial textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method shows excellent performance over the state-of-the-arts on the sharpening quality and the spectral response consistency in both reduced and full resolutions. Moreover, the proposed method can be applied to generate the high-resolution normalized difference vegetation index with promising accuracy.

TI  - Cosmologically degenerate fermions
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW D
M3  - Article
AB  - Dark matter (DM) with a mass below a few keV must have a phase space distribution that differs substantially from the Standard Model particle thermal phase space: otherwise, it will free stream out of cosmic structures as they form. We observe that fermionic DM y, in this mass range will have a non-negligible momentum in the early Universe, even in the total absence of thermal kinetic energy. This is because the fermions were inevitably more dense at higher redshifts, and thus experienced Pauli degeneracy pressure. They fill up the lowest-momentum states, such that a typical fermion gains a momentum similar to O(pF) that can exceed its mass my,. We find a simple relation between my,, the current fraction fy, of the cold DM energy density in light fermions, and the redshift at which they were relativistic. Considering the impacts of the transition between nonrelativistic and relativistic behavior as revealed by constraints on Delta Neff and the matter power spectrum, we derive qualitatively new bounds in the fy, - my, plane. We also improve existing bounds for fy, =1 to be my, >= 2 keV. We remark on implications for direct detection and suggest models of dark sectors that may give rise to cosmologically degenerate fermions.

TI  - High-resolution crop yield and water productivity dataset generated using random forest and remote sensing
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Accurate and high-resolution crop yield and crop water productivity (CWP) datasets are required to understand and predict spatiotemporal variation in agricultural production capacity; however, datasets for maize and wheat, two key staple dryland crops in China, are currently lacking. In this study, we generated and evaluated a long-term data series, at 1-km resolution of crop yield and CWP for maize and wheat across China, based on the multiple remotely sensed indicators and random forest algorithm. Results showed that MOD16 products are an accurate alternative to eddy covariance flux tower data to describe crop evapotranspiration (maize and wheat RMSE: 4.42 and 3.81 mm/8d, respectively) and the proposed yield estimation model showed accuracy at local (maize and wheat rRMSE: 26.81 and 21.80%, respectively) and regional (maize and wheat rRMSE: 15.36 and 17.17%, respectively) scales. Our analyses, which showed spatiotemporal patterns of maize and wheat yields and CWP across China, can be used to optimize agricultural production strategies in the context of maintaining food security.

TI  - Analysis of polarimetric coherence data and derived roll-variant parameters of Sentinel-1 data for discriminating mangrove types in Pichavaram wetlands
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The major focus of the present study is the polarimetric coherence, which corresponds to the correlation between two polarized channels of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets. The capability of the polarimetric coherence to detect target scatters utilizing the entire rotation domain rather than the fixed radar line of sight is the fundamental concept applied in this study. The present study attempts to test the potential of these concepts in mangrove types discrimination using the Sentinel-1 dual polarimetric (VV and VH) dataset. The study targets to characterize the Rhizophora and Avicennia mangrove types of the Pichavaram region of the eastern coast of India. The roll variant parameters were estimated using the polarimetric coherence values derived in the rotation domain for non-redundant angles. The seasonal influence on these parameters was prominent and confirmed through wet and dry season analysis using the ombrothermic diagram, which depicts the temperature and rainfall data. The temporal analysis with a monthly frequency confined to the period of 2018 to 2020 and revealed the capability of discriminating the selected mangrove types better in the pre-monsoon period. The results also unveiled the sensitivity of the polarimetric coherence and associated parameters to the abrupt change in climatic factors, especially during the dry to wet season transition. Finally, the results are verified with a statistical analysis performed using Coefficient of Variation (CV) and Scale Factor. The scope of the present study can be extended to the utility of roll variant parameters along with polarimetric decomposition derived parameters for better characterization of target scatterers.

TI  - Wavelet-based spatiotemporal analyses of climate and vegetation for the Athabasca river basin in Canada
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring spatiotemporal changes in climate and vegetation coverage are crucial for various purposes, including water, hazard, and agricultural management. Climate has an impact on vegetation, however, studying their relationship is challenging. We implemented the Least-Squares Wavelet (LSWAVE) software for investigating trend, coherency, and time lag estimation between climate and vegetation time series. We utilized Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series provided by the Terra satellite and hybrid climate time series. We found that the seasonal cycles of climate and NDVI are coherent with time delay. For the entire Athabasca River Basin (ARB), the most coherent component was the annual cycle with 84% annual coherency between vegetation and temperature and 46% between vegetation and precipitation. The annual cycles of temperature and precipitation led the ones in vegetation by about two and three weeks, respectively. Relatively lower coherency was observed in the mountainous region (upper ARB) and higher coherency in the middle ARB. From the cross-spectrograms, a clear time delay pattern was observed between the annual cycles of climate and vegetation since 2000 but not for other high-frequency seasonal cycles. The results also highlighted the advantages of LSWAVE algorithms over traditional algorithms, such as linear regression and correlation. Furthermore, we analyzed the annual land use and land cover data provided by the Terra and Aqua satellites and discussed their linkage with the climate and NDVI results.

TI  - Trends and drivers of land use/cover change in W National park in Burkina Faso
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Burkina Faso's W National Park (WNPB) is one of the country's biodiversity hotspots. Despite this Park's protection, illegal human activities threaten its vegetation, and little information about the on-site causes of degradation is available. Here we explored the extent and drivers of changes in land use/land cover (LULC) in the WNPB. For this purpose, we used Landsat (1988, 2001 and 2016), and ancillary data to determine the spatial structure and changes in LULC with a random forest classifier. We identified socio-economic factors influencing LULC by conducting household surveys, focus groups, and field observations. We used the ranking and binary logistic regression methods to analyze the socio-economic data. A logistic regression model assessed the relationship between land cover change and socio-economic factors. The results showed that multi-temporal classification performed significantly better than mono-temporal one in the study area. However, the combination of mono-temporal reflectances and vegetation indices for LULC classification significantly enhanced the accuracy to the level of multi-temporal classification. This result in-dicates that this combination is an efficient alternative to multi-temporal classification in the study area where cloud-free imagery is rare. In the WNPB, LULC dynamics from 1988 to 2001 was mainly characterized by reduction of tree savannas (9.4%) and woodland (8.8%) and expansion of bare soil (0.1%) and mixed vegetation (18.1%). From 2001 to 2016, croplands increased by 102.1%. Bush fire (77.19%), wood harvesting (48.25%), lack of rain (48.25%) and elephants' impact (20.18%) were the leading direct causes of LULC change. In general, the perceptions of local populations about vegetation trends were in line with the observations from remote sensing. Altogether, the tree vegetation in the study area decreased significantly between 2001 and 2016, and the cause of this change appears to be unsustainable land-use rather than rainfall conditions. According to these findings, land-use management practices in this park should be more sus-tainable and provide education (and changing habits) to the surrounding population. It is therefore suggested that the government regulate illegal activities through forest law enforcement to protect the WNPB from over-exploitation.

M3  - Article
AB  - A combination of in-situ climatic variables and remote sensing data could provide dynamic information that facilitates to get effective dryness or wetness situations for planetary ecosystems. Thus, the traditional stan-dardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was revisited by drought index (DI) using satellite soil moisture data and land surface evapotranspiration from Penman-Monteith-Leuning Version 2 (PML_V2) datasets to assess the dryness over 2417 station's grid points in China. DI was compared with the self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index (scPDSI), SPEI and composite drought index (CDI) for three major land cover classes (croplands, grasslands, and forests) area. The independent evaluation was carried out using sun-induced chlo-rophyll fluorescence (vegetation photosynthesis), and normalized difference vegetation index datasets including crop yield. Results exhibited that DI performance was comparable with CDI than scPDSI and SPEI to capture the impact of drought on vegetation photosynthesis. Vegetation productivity assessed by NDVI was significantly affected by dryness in the northern and southern part of China using DI, CDI and scPDSI and compared to SPEI. DI displayed a positive correlation with wheat, maize, and rice yield. Revisited drought index showed significant results for vegetation productivity but still necessitate future work to improve DI for agricultural drought research.

TI  - Interactions between precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil-moisture-based indices to characterize drought with high-resolution remote sensing and land-surface model data
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Iberian Peninsula is prone to drought due to the high variability in the Mediterranean climate with severe consequences for drinking water supply, agriculture, hydropower and ecosystem functioning. Because of the complexity and relevance of droughts in this region, it is necessary to increase our understanding of the temporal interactions of precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture that originate from drought within the Ebro basin, in northeastern Spain, as the study region. Remote sensing and land-surface models provide high-spatial-resolution and high-temporal-resolution data to characterize evapotranspiration and soil moisture anomalies in detail. The increasing availability of these datasets has the potential to overcome the lack of in situ observations of evapotranspiration and soil moisture. In this study, remote sensing data of evapotranspiration from MOD16A2 and soil moisture data from SMOS1km as well as SURFEX-ISBA land-surface model data are used to calculate the evapotranspiration deficit index (ETDI) and the soil moisture deficit index (SMDI) for the period 2010-2017. The study compares the remote sensing time series of the ETDI and SMDI with the ones estimated using the land-surface model SURFEX-ISBA, including the standardized precipitation index (SPI) computed at a weekly scale. The study focuses on the analysis of the time lags between the indices to identify the synchronicity and memory of the anomalies between precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture. Lag analysis results demonstrate the capabilities of the SPI, ETDI and SMDI drought indices computed at a weekly scale to give information about the mechanisms of drought propagation at distinct levels of the land-atmosphere system. Relevant feedback for both antecedent and subsequent conditions is identified, with a preeminent role of evapotranspiration in the link between rainfall and soil moisture. Both remote sensing and the land-surface model show capability to characterize drought events, with specific advantages and drawbacks of the remote sensing and land-surface model datasets. Results underline the value of analyzing drought with dedicated indices, preferably at a weekly scale, to better identify the quick self-intensifying and mitigating mechanisms governing drought, which are relevant for drought monitoring in semi-arid areas.

TI  - Lake Chad vegetation cover and surface water variations in response torainfallfluctuations under recent climate conditions (2000-2020) br
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the evolution of the Sahelian environment is a major challenge because the great Sahelian droughts,marked by significant environmental consequences and social impacts, contributed, for example, to the drying up ofLake Chad. We combined remote sensing images with a water level database from the Hydroweb project to determinethe response of Lake Chad vegetation cover and surface water variations to rainfallfluctuations in the Lake Chad wa-tershed under recent climate conditions. The variance in lake surface water levels was determined by computing themonthly anomaly time series of surface water height and area from the Hydroweb datasets. The spatiotemporal vari-ability of watershed rainfall and vegetation cover of Lake Chad was highlighted through multivariate statistical anal-ysis. The spatial distribution of correlations between watershed rainfall and Lake Chad vegetation cover wasinvestigated. The results show an increase in watershed rainfall, vegetation cover, and surface water area and height,as their slopes were all positive i.e., 5.1 10-4(mm/day); 4.26 10-6(ndvi unit/day); 1.2 10-3(km2/day) and 6 10-5(m/day), respectively. The rainfall variations in the watershed drive those of Lake Chad vegetation cover and surfacewater, as the rainfall trend was strongly and positively correlated with those of vegetation cover (0.79), surface waterheight (0.57), and area (0.53). The time lag between the watershed rainfallfluctuations and lake surface water varia-tions corresponded to approximately similar to 112 days. Between rainfall variations and vegetation cover changes, the spatialdistribution of the time lag showed a response time of<16 days in the western shores of the lake and on both sides ofthe great barrier, about 16 days in the bare soils of the northern basin and the eastern part of the south basin, and>64 days in the marshlands of the southern basin. For the analysis of lakes around the world, this research provides a robust method that computes the spatiotemporal variances of their trends and seasonality and correlates these withthe spatiotemporal variances of climate changes. The correlations obtained have strong potential for predicting futurechanges in lake surface water worldwide

T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought as a natural disaster is one of the human's ecological, hydrological, agricultural, and economic concerns. In this study, multiscale intelligence methods were proposed for drought severity detection and mapping in the northwest part of Iran for the years of 2007 to 2020. In the modeling process two scenarios were considered and in-situ and remote sensing datasets were adopted with two machine learning models namely M5 Pruning tree (M5P) and Random Forest (RF). In the first scenario, the in-situ datasets including the precipitation, relative humidity, evaporation, and temperature were used as inputs of the intelligence models to assess drought severity in terms of the Standardized Precipitation Index. In the second scenario, the SM2RAIN-ASCAT precipitation product and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) products of the MODIS were considered as inputs. During the drought severity modeling process, the input time series were first broken down into several subseries via the Variational Mode Decomposition; then, the most effective subseries were selected and imposed into the M5P and RF as inputs. Also, the potential of the relatively new TemperatureVegetation Water Stress Index (T-VWSI), which has developed based on the NDVI and LST, was assessed in drought severity monitoring. The results proved the appropriate efficiency of the proposed multiscale methods in effectively detecting drought severity. Also, it was observed that the T-VWSI could be successfully used for detecting drought occurrences in areas without meteorological datasets.

TI  - Remote sensing-based evapotranspiration modeling using geeSEBAL for sugarcane irrigation management in Brazil
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigated agriculture requires the implementation of innovative tools to improve irrigation water management and accurate estimation of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) such as remote sensing-based methodology. This study aimed to evaluate the irrigation management and estimating evapotranspiration through the geeSEBAL, a new tool for automated estimation of ETa based on the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and a simplified version of the Calibration using Inverse Modeling at Extreme Conditions (CIMEC) process for the endmembers selection, implemented into the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment. GeeSEBAL has not been used yet in Brazil for irrigation proposes, and in this research, it was applied to estimate ETa using Landsat images and ERA5-Land as meteorological inputs in the largest sugarcane producing region of the world in Brazil for two ratoon seasons by comparing daily ETa with values obtained from eddy covariance (EC) data, Energy balance components using geeSEBAL were consistent with the measured data and daily ETa presenting RMSE of 0.46 mm with R2 = 0.97. Modeled ETa and Kc were similar for the two seasons, although somewhat over-estimated for the fifth ratoon when compared to the EC data, mainly during high atmospheric demand (crop mid -stage). Still, the Kc values were similar to the standard values available in the literature and measured flux tower data for the two ratoons seasons. With ETa from geeSEBAL it was possible to identify water stress over the growing seasons using the remote sensing-based soil water balance, which occurred mainly during the phase after the crop reached the peak Kc (full cover stage) when the irrigation depth required was very high. This analysis showed that geeSEBAL has a significant potential for assessment of ETa for irrigation monitoring and management, even in missing climate data areas, allowing important advances in water resources management for sugarcane and other irrigated crops at field or regional scales.

TI  - Using Google Earth Engine and GIS for basin scale soil erosion risk assessment: A case study of Chambal river basin, central India
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, soil loss by water in the Chambal river basin (CHB) has been estimated using Google Earth Engine and Geographic Information System platforms employing the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Google Earth Engine, a cloud-based platform, has been used for generating land use/land cover map from the voluminous satellite remote sensing data. The observed mean rate of soil erosion in the CHB is 1.17 t/ha/yr. The study reveals that very severe type of soil erosion in the Chambal river basin is found in the gullies/ravines and barren lands with the highest mean rate of soil erosion in the gully areas at 13.44 t/ha/yr. Catchment-wise soil loss estimates suggest that the four catchments namely Kali Sindh, Lower Chambal, Upper Chambal and Parbati are experiencing much higher soil loss in comparison to others; hence these catchments are prioritised for soil conservation efforts. Sensitivity analysis of individual factors and their interaction effect indicates that LS factor is the most influential factor in the study area followed by C factor.

TI  - Descartes vs. the Scholastics: Lessons from Contemporary Philosophy and Cognitive Neuroscience
T2  - ACTA ANALYTICA-INTERNATIONAL PERIODICAL FOR PHILOSOPHY IN THE ANALYTICAL TRADITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The demise of the scholastic worldview and the rise of the mechanistic one may give the impression of a parallel demise of the scholastic explanatory framework. In this paper, I argue that this impression is wrong. To this end, I first outline Descartes' representative and particularly sharp mechanistic criticism of the scholastic notion of explanation. Deploying conceptual machinery from contemporary philosophy of science, I then suggest a reconstruction of the scholastic notion that is immune to Descartes' criticism. Based on this reconstruction, I reinterpret the dispute between Descartes and the scholastics as one that concerns the extent of two legitimate conceptions of explanation. Finally, I outline a contemporary dispute within cognitive neuroscience that reflects the Cartesian-scholastic one as thus reinterpreted, thereby showing that aspects of the world may well require a scholastic-like approach for their explanation. The aim of this paper, then, is to shed light on a most important philosophical-cum-scientific historical controversy from a modern perspective, but also to highlight the deep historical roots of a related contemporary dispute. Based on this, the paper also seeks to draw a substantial philosophical conclusion concerning the issue under dispute in both controversies.

TI  - Aerosol-cloud interactions over the Tibetan Plateau: An overview
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reviews progress in the study of aerosol-cloud interactions over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in the past decade. Clarifying the aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions over the TP is an important issue for both local and downstream precipitation forecasts. By exerting a "dynamic pump" effect due to the elevated heat source in summer, the TP acts as a "transfer station" for aerosols and water vapor, possessing abundant water vapor and enough cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN) in cloud physical processes. We found that mixtures of aerosols and clouds are frequently observed over the margin areas of the TP, especially the mixture between aerosols and ice clouds. The convective clouds over the TP could be affected by the Taklimakan dusts lifted from the north slope of the TP, inducing higher and more invigorated convective clouds locally. Furthermore, the dust -polluted convective clouds can continuously move eastward and merge with the convective cloud clusters along their motion paths, inducing more intensive rainfall over the downstream regions of the TP. Finally, challenges to further understanding aerosol-cloud interactions over the TP in the future are discussed.

TI  - Carbon uptake of the sugarcane agroecosystem is profoundly impacted by climate variations due to seasonality and topography
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane is an economically important crop whose growth and carbon uptake play vital roles in the carbon cycle, food security, and global trade development. However, the response of the carbon uptake of sugarcane to climate variations and the influencing factors are still unclear. In this study, seven sugarcane plantation distri-bution maps during 2000 and 2018 in Guangxi, China, were generated using time series Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery, and these maps were used to produce stable sugarcane sites by identifying pixels without land cover transformation. Time series gross primary production (GPP) and climate datasets were used to analyze the response of annual GPP to temperature, precipitation, and their interacting effects under different landforms (rugged ground and flat ground) and growing periods. The results showed a significantly positive correlation between annual GPP change and temperature variations. Extreme precipitation, including extreme drought and extreme wetness, caused the annual GPP to decrease sharply, except for extreme wetness in the early growing period. The decrease in annual GPP mainly appeared when extreme drought and hot conditions or extreme wet and cold conditions coexisted, ranging from-20.37% to-0.23%, while the increase in annual GPP especially appeared when non-extreme precipitation and high temperature co-occurred, ranging from 0.02% to 8.44%. In addition, the responses of sugarcane annual GPP change to extreme temperature and precipitation were significantly different between rugged and flat ground. Overall, this study indicated that spatiotemporal het-erogeneities existed in the response of sugarcane carbon uptake to climate variations. In the future, effective measures should be adopted in sugarcane management and cultivation to reduce the negative effects of climate change on crop production.

TI  - Global volcano monitoring through the Normalized Hotspot Indices (NHI) system
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Normalized Hotspot Indices (NHI) is a multi-channel algorithm developed to map thermal anomalies through the Multispectral Instrument onboard the Sentinel-2 satellite and the Operational Land Imager onboard the Landsat-8 satellite. The algorithm runs operationally under the Google Earth Engine platform and allows the analysis of volcanic thermal features (e.g. lava flows/lakes) through plots of the number of hot pixels, the total shortwave infrared radiance and the area of the hotspot. We present here the automated module of this tool: the NHI system. This system provides automated notifications about volcanic thermal anomalies detected at the global scale over the previous 48 h whenever the NHI web site (https://sites.google.com/view/nhi-tool) is accessed. The results of the first six months of operation are assessed through the analysis of satellite imagery and comparison with well-established programmes for global volcano monitoring. The low false positive rate (around 15%, including vegetation fires and data issues) and the successful identification of small, high-temperature features show that the NHI system may successfully integrate information from high temporal/low spatial resolution satellite data, despite some limitations (e.g. temporal sampling of the combined Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 observations; delay of data ingestion in the Google Earth Engine platform). The recent ingestion of Landsat-9 data within the system has further extended the performance of the NHI system in supporting the surveillance of active volcanoes from space.

TI  - Assessment of land surface temperature and carbon sequestration using remotely sensed satellite data in the Imphal-West district, Manipur, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The interrelationship between the land use and land cover (LULC) pattern, land surface temperature (LST), carbon stock, and sequestration has been assessed using satellite data and Geographical Information System (GIS) tools in Imphal-West district, Manipur, India (North Eastern region of India). LST for the past 10 years (2011-2021) was calculated using three retrieval methods such as Mono Window Algorithm (MWA), Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) and Single Channel Algorithm (SCA). The calculated LST (temperature varies in the range of 10 degrees-40 degrees C) was compared with atmospheric temperature values obtained from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data as well as field (ground station) data collected. From the comparison, it was observed that the SCA method obtained a minimum mean temperature difference (minimum error) as compared to MODIS data, while the MWA method obtained a minimum mean temperature difference as compared to field data. The calculated (generated) results were again compared and validated using measured soil temperature data and observed similar trend showing MWA and SCA slightly efficient than RTE method. In order to understand the LULC change pattern in the study area as well as to estimate the aboveground biomass, LULC for the years 2011, 2016, 2021, and 2030 were also generated. Then, carbon stock for the years 2011, 2021, and 2030 and sequestration for the year 2030 were calculated using the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) model. It is concluded that the study area has witnessed a gradual increase in urbanisation (built-up area increases by up to 2.9% in 10 years, i.e., between 2011 and 2021, but significantly decreases in barren land, 9.9%), but not an abrupt change in LST and carbon storage. However, the significant spatial change distribution of LST and carbon stock with the change in LULC pattern was observed.

TI  - Deep semantic segmentation of mangroves in Brazil combining spatial, temporal, and polarization data from Sentinel-1 time series
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The automatic and accurate detection of mangroves from remote sensing data is essential to assist in conser-vation strategies and decision-making that minimize possible environmental damage, especially for the Brazilian coast with continental dimensions. In this context, deep learning segmentation techniques are powerful tools with successful applications in several fields. However, few studies used deep learning for mangrove areas, and none considered radar time series. The present research has the following objectives: (a) develop a deep learning mangrove dataset in the Southeast region of Brazil considering the spatial, temporal, and polarization di-mensions; (b) evaluate the U-net architecture with three backbones (ResNet-101, VGG16, and Efficient-net-B7); (c) compare the VV and VH polarizations and their combination; (d) evaluate the time series composition with a varying number of images (29, 15, 8, 4 images); and compare the sliding windows approach using five stride values (8, 16, 32, 64, and 128) for large image classification. This research used the annual Sentinel-1 time series for the period 2017-2020. Image annotation used manual interpretation, and the developed dataset has 2886 images with spatial dimensions of 128 x 128 pixels (2136 for training, 450 for validation, and 300 for testing). We found that the best results considered: (a) both polarizations (VV&VH), (b) the maximum number of images in the time series images (29), (c) the U-net with the Efficient-net-B7 backbone (97.35% overall accuracy, 85.77% precision, 84.96% recall, 85.36% F-score, and 74.46% IoU), and (d) the smallest stride value (8) pre-sented the best results for large image classification. The proposed method is suitable and effective for moni-toring mangrove patterns over time, providing accurate maps of these ecosystems.

TI  - A Comparison of Image-Based and Physics-Based Atmospheric Correction Methods for Extracting Snow and Vegetation Cover in Nepal Himalayas Using Landsat 8 OLI Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Applying atmospheric corrections on satellite images is an important step before using the satellite image for any further processing. These atmospheric corrections are broadly classified as either image-based or physics-based atmospheric corrections. From a plethora of such corrections, which is best suited for vegetation and snow mapping in the mountainous Himalayan region needs to be decided. Hence, in this work, we evaluated a total of eight atmospheric corrections models including 5 image-based namely DOS (dark object subtraction method), improved dark object subtraction method (DOS3), COST (cosine theta), apparent reflectance (Aref), QUAC (QUick Atmospheric Correction), and 3 physics-based methods, namely SIAC (Sensor Invariant Atmospheric Correction), 6SV (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum) and FLAASH (Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes). We found that 6SV and FLAASH were better than other methods and QUAC was the worst performer when applied to Landsat 8 OLI images of the Nepal Himalayan region which has dense vegetation and snow-covered areas. The better snow reflectance values were observed for FLAASH (B, G, R: 0.88, 0.89, 0.9; NIR: 0.83), SIAC (B, G, R: 0.85, 0.89, 0.89; NIR: 0.83) and 6SV (B, G, R: 0.87, 0.89, 0.89; NIR: 0.8) methods, whereas the FLAASH and SIAC methods exhibited higher vegetation reflectance values in the NIR band than other methods. The spectra from the standard spectral library were compared with the values of vegetation and snow spectral reflectance produced from corrected reflectance images. The mean values of snow and vegetation reflectance were higher for FLAASH, 6SV, and SIAC methods as compared to other methods. Therefore, FLAASH, 6SV, and SIAC methods, in contrast to other used atmospheric correction methods, have a high possibility of giving accurate snow and vegetation cover mapping. The snow cover and vegetation cover map prepared using NDSI and NDVI showed that areas covered under thin clouds and haze were better extracted when FLAASH, SIAC, and 6SV methods are applied as compared to other methods. Thus, this study confirms that physics-based atmospheric correction models such as FLAASH, SIAC, and 6SV methods should be used while working on satellite images of the Himalayan region where the focus is on snow and vegetation cover mapping.

TI  - Intraoperative near-infrared lymphography with indocyanine green may aid lymph node dissection during robot-assisted resection of gastroesophageal junction cancer
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Adequate lymphadenectomy during gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer resection is essential, because lymph node (LN) metastasis correlates with increased recurrence risk. Fluorescence lymphography with indocyanine green (ICG) has been used for LN mapping in several surgical specialties; however, reports on GEJ cancer are lacking. Therefore, we investigated whether intraoperative ICG lymphography could facilitate LN harvest during robot-assisted resection of GEJ cancer. Methods Patients scheduled for robot-assisted resection of GEJ cancer were included, and outcomes were compared with historical controls. After intraoperative endoscopic submucosal ICG injection, standard D1 + LN dissection was performed under white light. Then, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging was activated, and each LN dissection area was re-examined. Any tissue within the D1 + field exhibiting distinctly increased ICG fluorescence compared with background tissue was dissected and sent for pathology review. Results We included 70 patients between June 2020 and October 2021. Three cases were aborted due to disseminated disease, and two were converted to open resection and excluded from the analysis. Additional tissue was dissected after NIR review in 34 of 65 (52%) patients. We dissected 43 fluorescent tissue samples, and after pathology review, 30 were confirmed LNs; none were metastatic. The median number of LNs harvested per patient (34, interquartile range [IQR] = 26-44) was not significantly different from that harvested from historical controls (32, IQR = 24-45; p = 0.92), nor were there any differences between these two groups in the duration of surgery, intraoperative blood loss, or comprehensive complication scores (p = 0.12, p = 0.46, and p = 0.41, respectively). Conclusions Intraoperative NIR lymphography with ICG may aid LN detection during robot-assisted resection of GEJ cancer without increasing surgical risk. Although NIR lymphography may facilitate LN dissection, none of the LN removed after the NIR review was metastatic. Hence, it remains uncertain whether NIR lymphography will improve oncological outcomes.

TI  - Knowledge discovery of Middle East dust sources using Apriori spatial data mining algorithm
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the areas susceptible to dust storm formation is one effective way of dealing with this destructive environmental phenomenon. This study is the first attempt to employ the Apriori spatial data mining algorithm to dust source susceptibility mapping (DSSM). The research process was based on extracting association rules between spatial-temporal patterns of dust drivers (including soil, vegetation, and climate parameters) in the Middle East's hotspots dust sources (HDSs). For this purpose, HDSs were identified using visual interpretation of sub-daily MODIS-Terra/Aqua RGB images from 2000 to 2021. The Middle East's HDSs mainly correspond to desert areas with poor vegetation cover and ephemeral/dried-up water bodies. A total of three million rules were extracted by running the Apriori algorithm. Accordingly, bare and non-vegetated lands, high soil thickness, low soil moisture, very high wind speed, and high temperature were identified as the most common features of HDSs. Using three measures including support, confidence, and lift, 54 frequent, reliable, and logical rules were selected, and the related maps were generated. Then, the susceptible dust sources (SDSs) map of the Middle East was produced in five classes of extreme (13% of the areas), high (14%), moderate (16%), low (17%), and no (40%) susceptibility through the weighted linear combination of the rule maps. The accuracy of the identified SDSs was estimated at 83.7% using the verification points. A sensitivity analysis was performed using the leave -one-out method to determine the isolated effect of the selected rules on the produced SDSs map. The model uncertainty varied between 15.7% and 16.8% for different rules. The variation range of uncertainty was 1.1%, demonstrating that a single rule does not significantly affect the model's performance; however, some rules have a more influential role. Our results revealed that Apriori's ability to provide generalizable association rules is a robust algorithm for DSSM.

TI  - Genetic Algorithm Based Model for Optimal Selection of Open Channel Design Parameters
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Open channels are one of the most used water conveyance systems for delivering water for different purposes. Existing models for the design of open channels mainly assume uniform flow, focus on cross-section sizing, and generally decouple cross-section sizing from the selection of channel alignment and profile. In this study, we developed an optimization model for a comprehensive design of transmission channels. The model minimizes the sum of costs for earthwork, lining, water losses, and land acquisition; accounts for non-uniform, mixed-regime flow; and considers multiple geometric and hydraulic constraints. The model was validated using several idealized scenarios. The model potential in minimizing the cost of real open channel projects was demonstrated through application to an existing irrigation water transmission canal in Egypt (the Sheikh Zayed Canal). The results of validation scenarios matched the anticipated outcomes for channel profile and alignment and reproduced analytical solutions given in the literature for channel cross-section design. Application of the model to the Sheikh Zayed Canal gave a more optimal design; the OCCD model produced a design alternative with similar to 27% less cost than the constructed alternative.

M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial information on land and soil resources are critical towards addressing land degradation for ensuring sustainable soil and crop management. To address these needs, digital soil mapping techniques have emerged as an efficient and low-cost solution. Although digital soil mapping has typically leveraged geospatial environmental variables (e.g. remote sensing), the application and integration of spectroscopic data with those environmental variables remain limited. Hence, this study combines visible and near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy, remote sensing, and topographic data and applies random forests, hybridized with particle swarm optimization algorithm (RF + PSO), to predict the spatial variability of soil clay content, electrical conductivity (EC), and calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) for 370 km(2) of agricultural land in western Iran. Using a conditioned Latin hypercube approach, 220 soil samples at the 0-20 cm depth increment were acquired throughout the study area. Three sets of environmental covariates were tested: Scenario A (Vis-NIR spectroscopy data), Scenario B (environmental data), and Scenario C (Vis-NIR spectroscopy + environmental data). According to the 10-fold cross-validation procedure with 100 replications, the RF + PSO model showed an acceptable level accuracy for all scenarios, although the accuracy of the RF + PSO model using the Scenario C data was higher than all other scenarios: the Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient values were 0.77, 0.83, and 0.74 for the clay contents, EC, and CCE, respectively. The results demonstrated that the combination of Vis-NIR spectroscopic data and commonly available environmental covariates provided the best input data for the hybridized model and enhanced its performance.

TI  - An integrated source apportionment method by incorporating spatial location information and source-transfer-sink simulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Source apportionment is key to water quality protection, but most researches ignore the specific location of nonpoint sources and the source-transfer-sink processes that led to inaccurate results of source apportionment. Thus, a new source apportionment method was developed by integrating the location information and the interaction of sources as well as the source-transfer-sink processes. The source layers were generated by the integrated disparate and spatially distributed datasets that included remote sensing data, low-cost information, and considered the interaction between sources. The transfer layers were generated by the application of a physicsbased model with derived inputs from models. The sink layer was constructed based on a laconic matrix calculation. The new method was applied in the Hangbu River of Chaohu Lake basin, China. Based on the results, the new method showed advantages of a more precise location, such as the sub-watershed No. 4 was no longer the key source area of total nitrogen (TN) using traditional method. The planting industry was the largest source accounting for 37.33% of TN contribution and 37.40% of total phosphorus (TP) contribution. The concise structure of the new method can also reduce the operation time by 93%. The hotspot grids were identified, which only cover 27.52% and 21.97% of the total watershed but contribute to over half of the TN and TP loads. This new method can be applied to other large watersheds, and provide management advice that span farm-girdwatershed scales for landowners and producers.

TI  - Respiratory microbiota as a good predictor of outcome in humoral immunodeficiency. Methodological and conceptual difficulties in comprehensive microbiome analysis.
T2  - Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The microbiome as a broad term defines the most dynamic ecological system in which, apart from the biocenosis, there is unique niche for its development, equally dynamic, because host-derived, contrary to physical environment in ecology. Although for years, antibodies, was recognized as a key element of the mucosal barrier, there is still no progress in comprehensive linking microbes and humoral elements. Which organism is a pathogen and which is a commensal - there are still no exact answers (and criteria). Also the discrepancy between experimental research, using more and more sophisticated techniques -showing the existence of nearly 900 bacterial species in our mouth was observed. On the contrary, bacterial infections caused by novel species have not been recognised in patients with humoral immunodeficiencies, apart from the capsular cocci and H. influenzae. Research on human virome, including CMV, is also focused on the cellular immunity, but in many situations in the clinic the humoral compartment are the exclusive, still effective, barrier against viral replication.AIM: The aim of study was to perform an integrated microbiome analysis (microbiota and host) for strict linking various microbiota constelation and end-stage clinical manifestation in humoral immunodeficiency.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-study based on own clinical experience reveal crucial gap in the literature.RESULTS: It indicate the natural competition: why the sentinel microorganism in humoral deficiency - S. pneumoniae dominates in some patients, and in others - Viridans Group Streptococci. Crucial role of high specific IgM level in several CVID complication was described. Furthermore, respiratory microbiota translocation with cancer regression and influence of therapeutic regimen on clinical sequel (predominantly infectious or malignant) were presented. The studies indicates numerous methodological and microecological classification difficulties, which are the source of inadequate, often contradictory conclusions from experimental research.CONCLUSIONS: Microecology describe ecosystem that consists of all the organisms and the abiotic physical environment with which they interact: i.e. biocenosis and biotope but clinical immunology -microorganisms in biotic (cellular) niche in host. Unfortunately, these studies are focused on the anecdotal "healthy" biocenosis (healthy microbiome), without analyzing other elements of the niche, for example cancer. Overall, focusing on the gut microbiota clearly restrict our knowledge on the manifestation of humoral deficiencies in respiratory system. The work is a summary of the search for representative clinical models and microbiological methods (diagnostic chain) in clinical immunology practice.

TI  - Retrieval of land surface temperature from FY3D MERSI-II based on re-fitting Split Window Algorithm
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Medium Resolution Spectral Imager II (MERSI-II) is one of the core sensors mounted on the FengYun-3D (FY3D) satellite. Two adjacent 250 m long-wave thermal infrared (TIR) channels provide a considerable opportunity for retrieving Land Surface Temperature (LST) with high spatiotemporal resolution. In this paper, Thermodynamic Initial Guess Retrieval (TIGR) dataset and MODTRAN 4.0 model were used to re-fit the parameters of the Split-Window (SW) algorithm suitable for MERSI-II TIR channels, and then the daily 250 m resolution MERSI-II LST product was retrieved. The Radiance-based (R-based) method results showed that the bias value between LSTs simulated by MODTRAN4.0 and the input LSTt is 0.16 K, and the MAE value is 0.38 K. Inter-comparison method results showed that the MERSI-II LST and MODIS LST products were consistent in spatial distribution, but there were certain differences between MODIS LST and MERSI-II LST at different land cover types. T-based method results showed that R values between the site-observed LST and MERSI-II LST retrieved by SW algorithm exceeded 0.92, the bias value was between 3.6 K and 4.4 K, and the MAE value was between 2.6 K and 4.5 K. The above results indicating that the SW algorithm proposed in this study has good accuracy and applicability.

TI  - Toward Targeted Change Detection with Heterogeneous Remote Sensing Images for Forest Mortality Mapping
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several generic methods have recently been developed for change detection in heterogeneous remote sensing data, such as images from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral radiometers. However, these are not well-suited to detect weak signatures of certain disturbances of ecological systems. To resolve this problem we propose a new approach based on image-to-image translation and one-class classification (OCC). We aim to map forest mortality caused by an outbreak of geometrid moths in a sparsely forested forest-tundra ecotone using multisource satellite images. The images preceding and following the event are collected by Landsat-5 and RADARSAT-2, respectively. Using a recent deep learning method for change-aware image translation, we compute difference images in both satellites' respective domains. These differences are stacked with the original pre- and post-event images and passed to an OCC trained on a small sample from the targeted change class. The classifier produces a credible map of the complex pattern of forest mortality.

TI  - Time series analysis of the Caspian Sea shoreline in response to sea level fluctuation using remotely sensed data
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Caspian Sea (CS), biggest inland water worldwide has experienced around 3 m oscillation in sea level during the 20th century. These rapid sea level fluctuations have had a great impact on the coastal habitat around this sea. Therefore, this study is aimed to investigate the long-term changes of the western part of the Caspian Sea shoreline and Anzali lagoon and their dynamic responses to the sea level fluctuation using time series analysis of remotely sensed data over the 40-years. To this end, the long-term Caspian Sea shoreline and the area and perimeter of the Anzali Lagoon were extracted from the time series of Landsat satellite imagery (1975 till 2016) by using an automatic procedure including the combination of the Tasseled-Cap and texture filter methods. Afterwards, shoreline erosion/accretion rates were evaluated by using the Net Shoreline Movement (NSM) and End Point Rate (EPR) techniques. Finally, the sea level changes of the CS, were extracted through the multiple altimetry satellite data and the relationship between the relative sea level fluctuation and CS shoreline and Anzali lagoon area were studied. Results of the changes of shoreline positions over the study period (1975-2016) indicate that the whole coastal study area is subjected to accretion and erosion of 20.37 and-19.22 (m/year) respectively. There is balance between the whole EPR in all transects and periods between 1975 and 2016. This shows that when erosion happens in a region, accretion will be happened in another region, and this behavior is symmetrical. When the sea level decreased, the EPR values showed the accretion/seaward and vice versa. So, the shoreline movement has a strong nonlinear response to the sea level fluctuation with a coefficient of determination of -0.66. Also results show the strong response of the Anzali lagoon to the sea level fluctuation with a coefficient of determination of 0.78 for a nonlinear relationship between the changes of area of Anzali Lagoon and the CS fluctuation. This lagoon experienced the greatest and lowest values of its area on 2003 and 1985, respectively, which are matched with the high and low stands of the Caspian Sea Level. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A simple model for daily basin-wide thermodynamic sea ice thickness growth retrieval
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - As changes to Earth's polar climate accelerate, the need for robust, long-term sea ice thickness observation datasets for monitoring those changes and for verification of global climate models is clear. By linking an algorithm for retrieving snow-ice interface temperature from passive microwave satellite data to a thermodynamic sea ice energy balance relation known as Stefan's law, we have developed a retrieval method for estimating thermodynamic sea ice thickness growth from space: Stefan's Law Integrated Conducted Energy (SLICE). With an initial condition at the beginning of the sea ice growth season, the method can model basin-wide absolute sea ice thickness by combining the one-dimensional SLICE retrieval with an ice motion dataset. The advantages of the SLICE retrieval method include daily basin-wide coverage, lack of atmospheric reanalysis product input requirement, and a potential for use beginning in 1987. Validation of the retrieval against measurements from 10 ice mass balance buoys shows a mean correlation of 0.89 and a mean bias of 0.06 m over the course of an entire sea ice growth season. Despite its simplifications and assumptions relative to models like the Pan-Arctic Ice-Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS), basin-wide SLICE performs nearly as well as PIOMAS when compared against CryoSat-2 and Operation IceBridge using a linear correlation between collocated points.

TI  - Localizing the analysis of drought impacts on KwaZulu-Natal?s commercial forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern African countries are susceptible to recurrent droughts which enhance forest degrada-tion and destructive pest outbreaks, which then significantly hinder the productivity of these forests. It is understood that drought impacts could be experienced within high rainfall regions and at a plantation level. However, very few studies have analyzed droughts within a plantation level in humid subtropical regions. Hence, there is a demand for efficient methods of analyzing droughts and the impacts they impose on forest vegetation within catchments that receive high rainfall. This study utilized a Kernel-support vector machine (SVM), random forests (RF), rotation forests (RTF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to classify drought-damaged trees. The 2013 to 2017 study period is inclusive of the intense and prolonged 2015-2016 drought expe-rienced in Southern Africa. The algorithms were employed on the vegetation moisture condition index (VMCI), vegetation condition index (VCI), normalized vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI) derived from Landsat 4 and 5, 7 and 8 imageries. Results showed that all four algorithms were capable of effectively detecting trees that exhibit drought damage, especially RF and RTF and when classifying using conditional drought indices. This was based on the accuracy achieved by these algorithms where RTF and RF both achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 96.30%, which was better than Kernel-SVM's 94.44% and the XGBoost's 90.74%. Overall, the study demonstrated that machine learning algorithms (MLAs), conditional drought indices and Landsat data could be used to classify drought damage on commercial forest vegetation within a high rainfall catchment.

TI  - Free-indocyanine green-guided pelvic lymph node dissection during radical prostatectomy
T2  - UROLOGIC ONCOLOGY-SEMINARS AND ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction and objectives: Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection (ePLND) remains the most accurate technique for the detection of occult lymph node metastases (LNMs) in prostate cancer (CaP) patients. Here we aim to examine whether free-Indocyanine Green (F-ICG) could accurately assess the pathological nodal (pN) status in CaP patients during real-time lymphangiography as a potential replacement for ePLND. Materials and methods: 219 consecutive patients undergoing F-ICG-guided PLND, ePLND and radical prostatectomy (RP) for clinical -localized CaPwere included in this prospective single-center study. The pathological outcomes of F-ICG-guided PLND were compared to confirmatory ePLND. Parameters of a binary diagnostic test for the proper classification of the pN status of patients ('per-patient' analysis) and for the probability of detecting all the metastatic LNs ('per-node' analysis) were calculated. Outcome measures were prevalence, accuracy (Acc), sensitivity (Se), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratio of a negative F-ICG-guided PLND test result [LR(-)]. Results: F-ICG-guided PLND successfully visualized LNs in all procedures with no adverse events. The overall per-patient F-ICG stag-ing Acc was 97.7%, Se was 91.4%, with a NPV of 97.0%, and LR(-) of 8.6%. At the overall per-node level, 4,780 LNs were removed and 1,535 (32.1%) were fluorescent in vivo. F-ICG-guided PLND identified LNMs with a Se of 63.4%. Conclusions: This study confirms that F-ICG-guided lymphangiography correctly staged almost 98% of patients. The high per-patient NPV suggested that avoiding ePLND is safe for most patients when F-ICG stained nodes were pN0. Thus, more conservative approaches might minimise perioperative morbidity during LNMs diagnosis in selected patients. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Multi-scale change monitoring of water environment using cloud computing in optimal resolution remote sensing images
T2  - ENERGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Water is the source of life and a very important part of life. However, the current water resources security is facing global challenges. Affected by climate change and human factors, how to quickly realize the continuous monitoring of water resources changes is crucial to the sustainable management of water resources. In recent years, the amount of multi-temporal remote sensing data has grown rapidly, which has caused problems such as weak single-computer processing for change detection and difficulty in mass image storage management. Traditional single-computer processing methods can no longer meet the needs of remote sensing big data change detection. It provides cutting-edge methods and means for monitoring large-scale changes in water resources. Therefore, a distributed parallel method for remote sensing image change detection based on cloud computing is proposed. Through this method, the change detection efficiency of massive remote sensing images is improved, and the high-resolution remote sensing image change detection based on fully connected conditional random fields is deeply analyzed. By summarizing the experimental data of this method and comparing with other data, it can be seen that when the parallelism is higher, the advantage of running time is more obvious. The performance improvement is also as high as 89.49%. Therefore, distributed parallel processing through cloud computing can complete the efficient change detection of massive remote sensing images without affecting the accuracy. This helps us to better monitor and monitor water resources at multiple scales.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BRAND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The aim of this Special Edition of six papers is to advance our knowledge of the role that brands can adopt in meeting various objectives of sustainability. Each article advances important insights on complementary aspects of sustainability and branding which we frame around a capabilities framework that reflects the dynamic need to meet shifting societal expectations. Specifically, the papers highlight the need to critically research, understand and communicate effectively to key audiences before investing in sustainability or corporate social responsibility (CSR). Each of the papers represents one or more capabilities. The first capability represents achieving a relevant brand fit of values-whether via green environmentalism, via establishing corporate brand impressions, or through adopting types of CSR whose effectiveness might vary between luxury and mass-market brands. The second capability represents acquiring sensitivity to worldview beliefs or through careful framing of CSR that can impact differentially on commitment and brand attitudes. The third capability represents alignment of stakeholder values through collaboration. Finally, we suggest future research directions of sustainable brand practices, including studies into the internal capabilities of brands and how different groups of stakeholders might interact with brands.

TI  - Regressive Erosion at River Coca in Northeast Ecuador: Landslide Monitoring with Sentinel-1 to Support Disaster Risk Management
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - After the collapse of the San Rafael waterfall in Northeast Ecuador on 2 February 2020, a regressive erosion started along the River Coca putting national infrastructure, the environment and indigenous communities at risk. A fast monitoring of areas exposed to landslides on local scales therefore is necessary to provide adequate risk management for the region. The study area, located in the Andean tropics close to the volcano Reventador, is characterized by steep slopes, seismic activity and high rainfall throughout the year. Sentinel-1 SAR data provide a solution for time-series monitoring in the region as imagery is available day and night and not affected by cloud cover. Landslide monitoring with Sentinel-1 SAR data was implemented using a bi-temporal change detection (BCD) with SNAP and a sequential change detection (SCD) with EESA Docker and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) aiming at the identification of a suited approach for fast disaster monitoring and management. The SCD showed an overall accuracy of 0.91 compared to 0.88 using the BCD approach validated with high-resolution imagery. Based on the landslide detection, hazard variables could be further identified to support future hazard and risk assessment. Fast processing of Sentinel-1 time-series data in a cloud-based environment allows for near real-time monitoring of ongoing erosion and provides a potential for pro-active measures to protect the national economy, the environment and the society.

TI  - Blood concentrations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances are associated with autoimmune-like effects in American alligators from Wilmington, North Carolina
T2  - FRONTIERS IN TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface and groundwater of the Cape Fear River basin in central and coastal North Carolina is contaminated with high levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Elevated levels of PFAS have also been found in blood of fish and wildlife from the Cape Fear River, and in the blood of human populations reliant on contaminated well or surface water from the Cape Fear River basin as a source of drinking water. While the public and environmental health impacts of long-term PFAS exposures are poorly understood, elevated blood concentrations of some PFAS are linked with immunotoxicity and increased incidence of some chronic autoimmune diseases in human populations. The goal of this One Environmental Health study was to evaluate PFAS exposure and biomarkers related to immune health in populations of American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis), a protected and predictive sentinel species of adverse effects caused by persistent toxic pollutants. We found that serum PFAS concentrations in alligator populations from the Cape Fear River were increased compared to a reference population of alligators from the adjoining Lumber River basin. The elevated serum PFAS concentrations in the Cape Fear River alligators were associated with increased innate immune activities, and autoimmune-like phenotypes in this population. In addition to evidence of significantly higher double stranded-DNA binding autoantibodies in adult Cape Fear River alligators, our qRT-PCR analysis found remarkably high induction of Interferon-a signature genes implicated in the pathology of human autoimmune disease. We interpret the association of increased PFAS exposure with disrupted immune functions to suggest that PFAS broadly alters immune activities resulting in autoimmune-like pathology in American alligators. This work substantiates and extends evidence from experimental models and human epidemiology studies showing that some PFAS are immune toxicants.

TI  - Monitoring the spatiotemporal change of Dongting Lake wetland by integrating Landsat and MODIS images, from 2001 to 2020
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dongting Lake wetland provides critical ecological functions in the Yangtze River Basin, however its landscape pattern has changed during the past 20 years due to both climate change and the human activities such as the operation of the Three Gorges dam (TGD). Numerous studies have used remote sensing technology to monitor such changes. However, most of studies were conducted at low spatial resolutions (250-1000 m) or low temporal resolutions (few images per year), which can introduce a degree of unreliability as regards the associated con-clusions. To thoroughly analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of Dongting Lake wetland, high spatiotem-poral resolution images from 2001 to 2020 have been produced by a modified version of the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion method (cuFSDAF 2.0) developed in this paper. This method is able to retrieve both phenology and land-cover changes both quickly and accurately. In addition, a tailored category by category extraction mapping method (CCEMM) is proposed to reliably classify wetland cover types. The mapping results show that the water area expanded by 66.43 Km2 in the wet season, and shrank by 132.86 Km2 in the dry season, between and including the years, 2001 to 2020. It appeared that the water area in the dry season declined obviously from 2003 to 2010 due to the operation of the TGD and is gradually stabilized after 2010. The reed area increased by 279.59 Km2 and the grass area decreased by 220.46 Km2 in the dry season, from 2001 to 2020. The shrinkage of the water area in the dry season may be one of the main factors driving reeds to occupy the previous grass growth area.

TI  - Effects of the Nature of Urban Development on Land Surface Temperature (LST) at the Neighbourhood Scale in Dhaka City, Bangladesh
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION ASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the effects of the nature of urban development on land surface temperature (LST) and the strengths of different biophysical and anthropogenic factors in explaining the spatial variation of LST at the neighbourhood scale in Dhaka city, Bangladesh. Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were used to retrieve LST. The study found that the mean LST in Dhaka increased at a rate of 1.26 degrees C per decade between 1991 and 2014. LST is found to be higher in the built-up areas, particularly in informally developed areas (i.e., slum settlements) and unplanned mixed-use areas. The OLS analysis indicates that along with bio-physical factors population density, building density and slum concentrations also have a significant effect on the spatial variation of LST at neighbourhood scales. The study findings suggest a planned development with the provision of vegetation cover and water bodies can significantly reduce the LST in Dhaka.

TI  - Reprogramming of sentinel lymph node microenvironment during tumor metastasis
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Metastasis is a major cause of death in patients with cancer. The two main routes for cancer cell dissemination are the blood and lymphatic systems. The underlying mechanism of hematogenous metastasis has been well characterized in the past few decades. However, our understanding of the molecular basis of lymphatic metastasis remains at a premature stage. Conceptually, cancer cells invade into lymphatic capillary, passively move to collecting lymphatic vessels, migrate into sentinel lymph node (SLN;, the first lymph node to which cancer cells spread from the primary tumor), and enter the blood circulatory system via the subclavian vein. Before arriving, cancer cells release specific soluble factors to modulate the microenvironment in SLN to establish a beachhead for successful colonization. After colonization, cancer cells inhibit anti-tumor immunity by inducing the recruitment of regulatory T cell and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, suppressing the function of dendritic cell and CD8(+) T cell, and promoting the release of immunosuppressive cytokines. The development of novel strategies to reverse cancer cell-triggered SLN remodeling may re-activate immunity to reduce beachhead buildup and distant metastasis. In addition to being a microanatomic location for metastasis, the SLN is also an important site for immune modulation. Nanotechnology-based approaches to deliver lymph node-tropic antibodies or drug-conjugated nanoparticles to kill cancer cells on site are a new direction for cancer treatment. Conversely, the induction of stronger immunity by promoting antigen presentation in lymph nodes provides an alternate way to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint therapy and cancer vaccine. In this review article, we summarize recent findings on the reprogramming of SLN during lymphatic invasion and discuss the possibility of inhibiting tumor metastasis and eliciting anti-tumor immunity by targeting SLN.

TI  - Pyruvate carboxylase promotes malignant transformation of papillary thyroid carcinoma and reduces iodine uptake
T2  - CELL DEATH DISCOVERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have shown that pyruvate carboxylase (PC) plays a key role in the occurrence and progression of thyroid cancer (TC); however, the relationship between PC and iodine-refractory TC is unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of PC in the malignant progression and loss of iodine uptake in papillary TC (PTC) and to explore the potential therapeutic effect of PC inhibitors in iodine-refractory PTC. PC increased cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, inhibited expression of the iodine metabolism-related genes TSHR, NIS, TPO, and TG, and decreased the iodine-uptake capacity by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in PTC cell lines. Furthermore, the PC inhibitor ZY-444 effectively inhibited the activation of PC, reduced the malignant invasiveness, and restored the expression of iodine metabolism-related genes and the iodine-uptake capacity in PTC cells. These findings suggest that PC activation is involved in the progression of iodine-refractory TC and that PC inhibitors may represent a potentially novel targeted therapy for iodine-refractory TC.

TI  - Accumulation of Postoperative Unexpected Events Assessed by the Comprehensive Complication Index as Prognostic Outcome Parameters for Kasai Procedure.
T2  - Children (Basel, Switzerland)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Introduction The Kasai procedure in children with biliary atresia (BA) is associated with several complications in the short-term. The Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) is a validated metric in adult surgery for the analysis of complications and morbidity in surgical patients. We aimed to analyze the CCI for the first time in BA infants and to correlate its association with outcomes. Material and Methods We conducted a retrospective review of medical records of infants with type III BA undergoing the Kasai procedure between January 2011 and December 2021 at our institution. All unexpected events were ranked according to the ClavienDindo classification, and the CCI per patient was subsequently calculated. ClavienDindo grades, individual events, CCI, and total event numbers per patient were correlated with one- and two-year outcomes post-surgery. Results A total of 131 events were identified in 101 patients (ranging 011 per patient). Forty-four Grade I (33.6%), 67 Grade II (51.1%), 18 Grade III (13.7%), and two sentinel events [>Grade IV] (1.5%) were documented according to ClavienDindo, including one death in a cardiac-associated BA patient. None of the complications significantly correlated with a poor outcome. Sixty-three (62.4%) CCI scores were calculated (range 0100). The mean CCI score during the in-patient treatment post-surgery was significantly higher in patients with a poorer outcome than patients with native liver survival at one- and two-year follow-up (22.7 ± 21.7 vs. 13.2 ± 18.1; p = 0.02). Conclusion Not the severity of complications, but the accumulation of numerous events related to Kasai procedure were associated with a poorer outcome. Therefore, the CCI is an excellent instrument for the postoperative morbidity assessment of BA patients.

TI  - High-resolution soil moisture mapping using PSO-based optimized cerebellar model articulation controller (CMAC)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A good knowledge in eco-hydrological processes requires significant understanding of geospatial distribution of soil moisture (SM). However, SM monitoring remains challenging due to its large spatial variability and its dynamic time response. This study was performed to assess the performance of a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based optimized Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) in generating high-resolution surface SM estimates using sentinel-2 imagery over a Mediterranean agro-ecosystem. Furthermore, the results were compared with those of PSO-based optimized group method of data handling (GMDH) as a more common data-driven method. Two different modeling approaches i.e. modeling in homogenous clusters (local approach) and modeling in entire area as an entity (global approach) were examined. Candidate predictors namely sentinel-2 spectral bands, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI), digital elevation model (DEM), slope and aspect were used as the input variables to estimate SM. An intensive field survey had been done to gather in-situ SM data using a time-domain reflectometer (TDR). K-fold validation based on in-situ SM measurements demonstrated the reasonability of the SM estimation of the proposed methodology. Detecting homogeneous areas was done using genetic and particle swarm optimization algorithms. Synthesized SM product of PSO-GMDH showed a mean Normalized Root-Mean-Square Error (NRMSE) of 13.6 to 8.91 for global and local approaches in the test phase. PSO-CMAC method with an average NRMSE of 12.47 to 8.72 for global and local approaches shows the highest accuracy and outperforms the PSO-GMDH method at both local and global approaches. Overall, results revealed that clustering study area prior to running machine learning (ML) models coupled with optical satellite imagery and geophysical properties, boosts their predictive performance and can lead to more accurate mapping of SM with more heterogeneity. The results also showed that the global approach had a moderate performance in capturing the SM heterogeneity.

TI  - Multifractal and Long-Term Memory of Impervious Surface Spatial Patterns in a Coastal City in China
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An understanding of the multifractal and long-range dependence of impervious surfaces (IS) spatiotemporal patterns is helpful for regional environmental assessment and urban planning. Linear spectral-mixture analysis has been applied to compute IS in the coastal city of Xiamen, China, based on Landsat TM/OLI/TIRS images, and then the long-term trends and multifractal characteristics of IS patterns have been investigated using two-dimensional multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. The IS spatial distribution displayed similar positive long-range correlations in study areas during the 1994-2015 period. IS have a long-memory characteristic within a certain spatial range, with an increase in the value of a pixel likely to cause an increment in the value of its neighbors. The multifractality of the IS distribution increased in Xiamen City during 1994-2015, but was lower than those in Xiamen Island. The multifractal spectra in Xiamen City vary in shape between years, capturing its evolution from right truncation with a long left tail to left truncations and long right tails and then a symmetrical shape. The fractal structure for Xiamen Island exhibits similar patterns of long right tails and left truncations. Economic and political considerations coupled with natural geographic conditions dominate the long-range trends in the IS spatial patterns.

TI  - Mapping tropical forest functional variation at satellite remote sensing resolutions depends on key traits
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although tropical forests differ substantially in form and function, they are often represented as a single biome in global change models, hindering understanding of how different tropical forests will respond to environmental change. The response of the tropical forest biome to environmental change is strongly influenced by forest type. Forest types differ based on functional traits and forest structure, which are readily derived from high resolution airborne remotely sensed data. Whether the spatial resolution of emerging satellite-derived hyperspectral data is sufficient to identify different tropical forest types is unclear. Here, we resample airborne remotely sensed forest data at spatial resolutions relevant to satellite remote sensing (30 m) across two sites in Malaysian Borneo. Using principal component and cluster analysis, we derive and map seven forest types. We find ecologically relevant variations in forest type that correspond to substantial differences in carbon stock, growth, and mortality rate. We find leaf mass per area and canopy phosphorus are critical traits for distinguishing forest type. Our findings highlight the importance of these parameters for accurately mapping tropical forest types using space borne observations.Functional variations in tropical forests can be determined from remotely sensed forest trait and structural attributes at spatial resolutions relevant to satellite-based observations, according to a coarse resolution analysis of airborne remotely sensed data in Malaysian Borneo.

TI  - Dual-wavelength self-mode-locked semiconductor disk laser
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Dual-wavelength mode-locked lasers can be widely used in optical communication, pump-probe experiment, nonlinear frequency conversion, etc. In this paper, a dual-wavelength self-mode-locked semiconductor disk laser is reported for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. A simple linear resonator is formed by using a high reflectivity distributed Bragg reflector at the bottom of the gain chip, and an external output mirror; the cavity length is about 135 mm, with no need of additional inserted elements. Based on the Kerr effect of the gain medium and the soft aperture formed by the pump spot on the gain chip, along with the fine adjustment of cavity length and pump intensity, the mode-locking process can be started from the free running and the stable self-mode-locking can be realized. The mode-locked pulse width is 4.3 ps, the repetition rate is 1.1 GHz, and the maximum output power is 323.9 mW, which corresponds to a peak power of 68 W. After the laser is mode locked, a readily available blade, which can introduce a wavelength-dependent loss for different laser modes, resulting in a lager cavity loss for a longer-wavelength mode and a smaller cavity loss for a shorter-wavelength mode, is used as a wavelength tuning element, and is inserted into the cavity in the direction perpendicular to the optical axis of the resonator. By changing the depth of the blade inserted into the cavity, the laser wavelength can be continuously tuned from the initial oscillating wavelength (longer-wavelength) to a shorter wavelength, a stable dual-wavelength output with equal intensity can be obtained at a specific position, and the stable continuous-wave mode-locking can be maintained simultaneously. The steady dual-wavelengths in the experiment are 951 and 961 nm, and the corresponding output power is 32 mW. The above dual-wavelength outputs have good coherence since they are stimulated radiations from the same gain chip. Meanwhile, they have relatively high peak power and strictly meet the coaxial conditions, and these are all advantages for the difference frequency generation (DFG). The frequency of the DFG in the experiment is approximately 3.3 THz, which can be widely used in laser radar, remote sensing, homeland security, counter-terrorism, atmospheric and environmental monitoring and otherareas.

TI  - Estimation of greenhouse gas emissions from Iran's gas flaring by using satellite data and combustion equations
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In addition to the waste of resources and economic losses, environmental damage by gas flaring is widespread and significant. Since flaring the associated gas gives no added value in exchange for its pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it could be identified as a top priority for mitigation. Iran is the third gas flaring country after Russia and Iraq among those facing this issue, and is responsible for 12.1% of the world's gas flaring. While the necessity of developing a method for the precise estimation of flaring GHG emissions is clear, especially for evaluating the result of countries' efforts to meet their nationally determined contribution target, there are huge uncertainties and discrepancies in the values of emission factors among various data sources due to the lack of actual measurements of the volume and diversity of the composition of flare gas. This study aimed to fill the gap in providing authentic data on Iran's gas flaring GHG and air pollutant emissions by developing a model based on satellite data on flare volumes, gas compositions, and combustion equations. Our results revealed that based on 2021 data on flaring volume, Iranian gas flares are emitting approximately 50 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent to the atmosphere annually, which could be reduced to 43 by only enhancing the flares' efficiency. It accounted for 5.5%-6% of the total GHG emissions of the country. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2022;00:1-14. (c) 2022 SETAC.

TI  - Spatio-temporal habitat assessment of the Gangetic floodplain in the Hastinapur wildlife sanctuary
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing provides multi-dimensional and multi-temporal information about habitat, insights into the significant drivers of change, and the key factors affecting landscape dynamics. Such information is crucial to provide perspective and a more profound understanding of ecological surveys. This study utilizes Google Earth Engine's capability to assess a riverine wetland grassland floodplain in Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary (HWS) along the Ganga River, which is a critical habitat for wintering migratory birds, the critically endangered gharial, turtles, aquatic mammals such as otters and dolphins, and cervid species such as swamp deer. We have developed a framework for regular monitoring through rapid habitat assessment, which visualizes the spatio-temporal change in land cover, the seasonal dynamics in water and vegetation, changes due to anthropogenic in-fluences on the landscape, and finally, how these factors affect the habitat availability of species of concern in the HWS. The results show a dynamic river system with high seasonal variations. The vegetation trend shows increasing greenness, indicative of the conversion of grassland, scrubland, and herbaceous cover to more per-manent vegetation, which will adversely affect the riparian habitat structure. A habitat suitability index generated through geospatial analysis using the weighted overlay method suggests that 40.07% of the HWS, nearly 767.12 km2, comprising mainly the riverscape, wetland, and riparian grasslands, is suitable habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic species. However, only 9.93% of the sanctuary comprising 197.27 km2, is available as a core habitat. Further, the area is threatened by encroachment evident from the rapidly increasing land-use in-tensity and night light pollution, which puts the grasslands sheltered to swamp deer and other wildlife at higher risk leaving almost 27.9% of the area comprising 533.63 km2 unsuitable for wildlife. Urban and agricultural land use has taken over 67% of the sanctuary. An increase in minimum radiance value representing ALAN, from 0.41 to 0.73 W/m2-sr in just six years from 2015 to 2021, shows a reduction in nocturnal darkness, reducing safe niches for wildlife. The study results provide critical baseline information for ecological surveys and a rapid assessment platform for future sanctuary management. Constant monitoring of anthropogenic activities such as farming, settlements, and transport routes threatening the habitat is essential for informed conservation man-agement decisions.

TI  - Visible green space predicts emotion: Evidence from social media and street view data
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Social media data are increasingly used to examine associations between environmental exposures and mental wellbeing. In particular, studies highlight that exposure to natural outdoor environments (NOEs) is associated with fewer negative emotions. Also, people in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods tend to benefit more from NOEs than their counterparts in more privileged neighbourhoods ("equigenic" effects). However, exposure to NOEs is principally studied with remotely sensed data that fail to measure peoples' lived experience and the visible environment at eye-level. The current study explored relationships between two forms of NOEs (green and blue spaces) using Tencent Map street view imagery and negative emotions from social media Weibo microblogs in 1540 neighborhoods of Guangzhou, China. Negative emotions and exposure to visible green and blue space were assessed at the neighborhood-level (averaged by neighborhood). Higher levels of visible green space were associated with lower levels of negative emotions (3rd quartile: coefficient [coef.] =-0.006, 95% confidence interval [CI] =-0.012 to-0.000; 4th quartile: coef. =-0.007, CI =-0.013 to-0.001), and these associations were stronger during non-work times. No associations were observed for visible blue space except in interactions with socioeconomic status (SES); blue space provided an equigenic effect whereby people in lower-SES neighborhoods expressed fewer negative emotions than other lower-SES neighbourhoods without blue space. Because negative emotions are strongly linked to depression and anxiety, the importance of green and blue space visible at eye-level should be considered when promoting equitable public health.

TI  - Evaluating spatial and temporal variations in sub-field level crop water demands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Variable rate irrigation (VRI) requires accurate knowledge of crop water demands at the sub-field level. Existing VRI practices commonly use one or more variables like soil electrical conductivity, historical yields, and topographic maps to delineate variable rate zones. However, these data sets do not quantify within season variability in crop water demands. Crop coefficients are widely used to help estimate evapotranspiration (ET) at different stages of a crop's growth cycle, and past research has shown how remotely sensed data can identify differences in crop coefficients at regional and field levels. However, the amount of spatial and temporal variation in crop coefficients at the sub-field level (i.e. within a single center pivot system) has not been widely researched. This study aims to compare sub-field ET estimates from two remote sensing platforms and quantify spatial and temporal variations in aggregated sub-field level ET. Vegetation indices and reference ET data were collected at Kansas State University's Southwest Research Extension Center (SWREC) and two Water Technology Farms during the 2020 corn growing season. Weekly maps of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) from aerial imagery are combined with empirical equations from existing literature to estimate both basal and combined crop coefficients at a 1-meter resolution. These ET estimates are aggregated to a 30 m resolution and compared to the Landsat Provisional Actual ET dataset. Finally, actual ET estimates from aerial images were aggregated using k-means clustering and stationary variable speed zones to determine if there is enough variation in actual ET at the sub-field level to build variable rate irrigation schedules. An equivalence test demonstrated that the aerial imagery and Landsat data sources produce significantly different crop coefficient estimates. However, the two datasets were moderately correlated with Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficients ranging from -0.95 to 0.86. Both the aerial imaging and Landsat datasets showed high variability in crop coefficients during the first 5-6 weeks after emergence, with these coefficients becoming more spatially uniform later in the growing season. These crop coefficients may help irrigators make more informed irrigation management decisions during the growing season. However, more research is needed to validate these remotely sensed ET estimates and integrate them into an irrigation decision support system.

TI  - Evaluating fine-scale phenology from PlanetScope satellites with ground observations across temperate forests in eastern North America
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In temperate forests, leaf phenology is a sensitive indicator of climate change and a major regulator of seasonal carbon and water cycling. Many studies have documented large intra-site leaf phenology variability across in-dividual trees but conventional approaches for monitoring individual tree-scale leaf phenology are often limited to a small spatial extent and sample size. Recent availability of PlanetScope satellite data with a 3 m spatial resolution, near-daily revisiting frequency, and global coverage provides opportunities to overcome this limi-tation. It also has the advantage of providing spatially explicit information across large spatial coverages compared with ground methods. However, comprehensive assessments of PlanetScope's capacity and scalability for individual tree-scale leaf phenology monitoring remain lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we propose an approach that integrates 0.1 m resolution airborne imagery and ground phenology records of individual trees with PlanetScope image time series, testing it at six NEON forest sites in eastern North America. We first extracted key phenological metrics at the individual tree scale from PlanetScope satellites and then evaluated the metrics with corresponding phenological metrics derived from ground observations over 2018 and 2019. Our results show that PlanetScope-derived fine-scale land surface phenology is able to 1) characterize significant leaf phenology variability at the individual tree scale across all forest sites and years, with r ranging from 0.21 to 0.42 when comparing PlanetScope-derived individual tree-scale phenological metrics with their ground correspon-dences. The accuracy is improved at the species level (r = 0.57-0.82) when more PlanetScope pixels are included; and 2) capture relatively more variations in fall phenology but also with larger uncertainties (e.g., r = 0.82 and RMSE = 2.14; species level) relative to spring phenology (r = 0.76 and RMSE = 0.72). Collectively, this study presents a comprehensive evaluation of PlanetScope's capacity for individual tree/species-scale leaf phenology monitoring and highlights the potential of PlanetScope to provide rich fine-scale phenology infor-mation to significantly advance the field of plant phenology research.

TI  - An improved multi-criteria decision analysis approach for watershed soil erosion susceptibility assessment
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion within watersheds is a common phenomenon worldwide, and many scientific efforts have been made to address this problem. The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model has been widely employed in soil erosion estimation. However, several studies have highlighted its limitations and the need to account for some key aspects of soil erosion which are not considered in the model. This study explores the potential of utilizing locally dominant soil erosion driving factors alongside the RUSLE model for soil erosion susceptibility assessment within the OIO watershed. Landsat 8 OLI image for the year 2020, DEM, soil data, Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) datasets coupled with field observed datasets were employed to derive these factors. They include soil loss, sediment yield, sediment transport index, and runoff. Numerical rankings that represent the level of contribution of each factor and their attributes to soil erosion within the watershed were generated using the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP). Each factor was reclassified according to these rankings and overlaid using the GIS-based weighted overlay technique to model soil erosion within the OIO watershed. Finally, we employed a statistical combination of the modelled soil erosion map and Hydrological Response Unit (HRU) to assess erosion susceptibility within the watershed. Initial results from the study highlighted the variabilities in annual soil loss (min: < 6.0 t ha(-1) yr(-1), max: >= 58.0 t ha(-1) yr(-1), mean: 13.55 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) and identified areas with high predispositions to soil loss within the OIO watershed. The annual sediment yield of the entire OIO watershed ranged between <= 14.04 to 715.10 t ha(-1)yr(-1) with an annual average of 14.88 t ha(-1)yr(-1). In addition, the sediment transport index and runoff volume for the OIO watershed range between 0.00-69.07 and 0.00-70.00 mm, respectively. Five erosion susceptibility levels were delineated: very slight, slight, moderate, severe, and severe. They occupied 65.00%, 24.43%, 7.69%, 2.63%, and 0.23% of the watershed, respectively. Accuracy assessment conducted using the Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) showed that the soil erosion susceptibility map has an AUC value of 0.86, indicating acceptable results. Our methodological approach improves the RUSLE model, especially regarding preliminary soil susceptibility assessment for watershed development under typical data-scarce conditions.

TI  - Multi-output regression with structurally incomplete target labels: A case study of modelling global vegetation cover
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Weakly-supervised learning has recently emerged in the classification context where true labels are often scarce or unreliable. However, this learning setting has not yet been extensively analyzed for regression problems, which are typical in macroecology. We further define a novel computational setting of structurally noisy and incomplete target labels, which arises, for example, when the multi-output regression task defines a distribution such that outputs must sum up to unity. We propose an algorithmic approach to reduce noise in the target labels and improve predictions. We evaluate this setting with a case study in global vegetation modelling, which in-volves building a model to predict the distribution of vegetation cover from climatic conditions based on global remote sensing data. We compare the performance of the proposed approach to several incomplete target baselines. The results indicate that the error in the targets can be reduced by our proposed partial-imputation algorithm. We conclude that handling structural incompleteness in the target labels instead of using only complete observations for training helps to better capture global associations between vegetation and climate.

TI  - Agents for sustainable futures? The (unfulfilled) promise of sustainability at leading business schools
T2  - FUTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Present and future business leaders might be amongst the most important actors in initiating and managing a transition towards a sustainable economy and society in general. Preparing them for such a role has to be a central task of higher education institutions, especially business schools. Our paper maps how business schools frame sustainability in relation to probable and possible futures by examining the external online communication of the TOP100 business schools. Close to half of these institutions do not address sustainability in their education-related online communication, while the other half emphasize its economic dimension almost exclusively. We found little proof in their education-related communication that business schools attempt to stray from the path of the status quo, accordingly they continue to strengthen a neo-liberal worldview, only incorporating those aspects of sustainability which are compatible with this perspective. We also have to acknowledge, however, that business schools are `open institutions' attempting to meet the expectations of their stakeholders. This may result in numerous and even conflicting goals. Choosing only a few of them as a communicative focus, (e.g., promoting individual strategies for career enhancement), wrings out the larger organisational and social issues like sustainability in its holistic sense.

TI  - The flat-field method based on rotated images for FY-3E/X-EUVI
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm to calculate the flat-field coefficient based on the series of rotated images captured by the solar X-ray and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (X-EUVI) onboard the Fengyun-3E satellite is proposed in this article. The method includes determination of the solar disk centers and radiuses, calculation of the rotation angles, coordinate transformation to expand the solar disk into rectangles, and derivation of the flat matrix using the KLL algorithm. The accuracy of determination of the solar disk center and radius tested by the Hough gradient method and the least-squares method is at sub-pixel, and the precision of the calculated rotation angle based on the log-polar transform is less than 0.025 & DEG;. Since the X-EUVI rotates relative to the Sun in real time, multiple rotating images can be obtained and used for flat-field calibration at any time, and the tested accuracy is estimated at 0.79-3.42%. This flat-field method will provide reference and support for solar image processing and research.

TI  - Phytoplankton assemblage shifts with dissolved organic matter properties: A functional perspective for sentinel lakes
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is altering both dissolved organic matter (DOM) properties and phytoplankton dynamics in lakes. High-altitude lakes are good sentinels of global change. However, their value as sentinels depends on how well we understand their functioning. This study analysed physical, chemical and biological data during three pre-defined periods running from complete ice-cover right to the end of the ice-free season, in a high-altitude oligotrophic lake. A functional approach was used to assess how relationships between DOM and the planktonic community vary over time. Phytoplankton functional change was found to occur with shifts in DOM. During the ice-influenced period, from February to the end of the thaw, the phytoplankton community was dominated by small autotrophs and mixotrophic flagellates and DOM from sediment and terrestrial origin dominated the DOM pool of the lake. Phytoplankton diversity and richness increased during the post-snowmelt overturn period, when terrestrial DOM dominated the DOM pool. Finally, large siliceous autotrophs, competitive under low nitrogen concentrations and high temperature, dominated almost exclusively during the late summer period (LSP). Increased phytoplankton biomass meant that phytoplankton-derived DOM was dominant during the LSP. These phenological changes in the phytoplankton community resulted in functional shifts at the base of the food web. Based on the relationships between the variables in the study, it can be deduced that the nature of the relationship between phytoplankton and bacteria progressively shifted from strong top-down control exerted by phytoplankton over bacteria towards predominantly bottom-up control at the end of the ice-free season. Synthesis. Using a field survey starting from complete ice-cover and lasting right to the end of the ice-free season in a sentinel lake, we show seasonal shifts in the link between DOM properties and plankton community traits. Differences in environmental conditions and DOM origin explained variation in phytoplankton community structure and function, pointing to seasonal shifts in microbial food web interactions. Our research suggests that, under climate change, the balance between mixotrophy and autotrophy and the control exerted by phytoplankton over bacterioplankton will change in oligotrophic high-altitude lakes with large, vegetated catchments.

TI  - Occurrence of breast-cancer-related lymphedema after reverse lymphatic mapping and selective axillary dissection versus standard surgical treatment of axilla: A two-arm randomized clinical trial
T2  - CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The need for axillary dissection (AD) is declining, but it is still essential for many patients with nodal involvement who risk developing breast-cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) with lifelong consequences. Previous nonrandomized studies found axillary reverse mapping and selective axillary dissection (ARM-SAD) a safe and feasible way to preserve the arm's lymphatic drainage. Methods The present two-arm prospective randomized clinical trial was held at a single comprehensive cancer center to ascertain whether ARM-SAD can reduce the risk of BCRL, compared with standard AD, in patients with node-positive breast cancer. Whatever the type of breast surgery or adjuvant treatments planned, 130 patients with nodal involvement met our inclusion criteria: 65 were randomized for AD and 65 for ARM-SAD. Twelve months after surgery, a physiatrist assessed patients for BCRL and calculated the excess volume of the operated arm. Lymphoscintigraphy was used to assess drainage impairment. Self-reports of any impairment were also recorded. Results The difference in the incidence of BCRL between the two groups was 21% (95% CI, 3-37; p = .03). A significantly lower rate of BCRL after ARM-SAD was confirmed by a multimodal analysis that included the physiatrist's findings, excess arm volume, and lymphoscintigraphic findings, but this was not matched by a significant difference in patients' self-reports. Conclusions Our findings encourage a change of surgical approach when AD is still warranted. ARM-SAD may be an alternative to standard AD to reduce the treatment-related morbidity.

TI  - Managing nature-based solutions in fire-prone ecosystems: Competing management objectives in California forests evaluated at a landscape scale
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - California's cap-and-trade compliance offset market incentivizes forest managers to maintain elevated carbon stocks. It provides these incentives without enforcing standardized fire mitigation practices despite many projects being located in fire prone regions. Here, we evaluated the difference between management actions in California forests that participated in the carbon offset market versus those that engaged with state programs to reduce wildfire risk via fuel reduction treatments. Using remotely sensed data from the California Forest Observatory and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, we compared the vertical forest structure and vegetation canopy trends on forest offsets with forests that are receiving fuel treatment. We found California forests managed for carbon under the Improved Forest Management (IFM) program by the California Air Resources Board had higher levels of biomass than forests managed for fire risk reduction as indicated by 2016 lidar-estimated fuel loads. In addition, IFM-participating forests did not reduce their fuel loads between 2016 and 2020, whereas lands receiving grants for fuel management did, indicating that on average, the IFM projects were not engaging in fuel reduction efforts. However, despite the differences in fuel management between IFM projects and active fuel treatments, we found that both types of management saw a declining trend in vegetation greenness between 2015 and 2021. While declining greenness is expected of active fuel treatments associated with vegetation removal, such a trend in the case of IFM indicates additional wildfire risk. Managing forests for long-term carbon storage and sequestration requires consideration of fire risk mitigation. Given the little evidence of fuel reduction in the first decade of IFM projects implementation we question whether the century-long duration of carbon stocks in these offsets is realistic. We recommend that policymakers reevaluate the incentives directed at carbon stock preservation or expansion to better encompass the growing wildfire risk in California.

TI  - Ozone depletion events in the Arctic spring of 2019: a new modeling approach to bromine emissions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ozone depletion events (ODEs) are a common occurrence in the boundary layer during Arctic spring. Ozone is depleted by bromine species, which are most likely emitted from snow, sea ice, or aerosols in an autocatalytic reaction cycle. Previous three-dimensional modeling studies of ODEs assumed an infinite bromine source at the ground. In the present study, an alternative emission scheme is presented in which a finite amount of bromide in the snow is tracked over time. For this purpose, a modified version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) is used to study ODEs in the Arctic from February to May 2019. The model data are compared to in situ measurements, ozone sonde flights, and satellite data. A simulation of the ODEs in the Arctic spring of 2009 using the infinite-bromide assumption on first-year (FY) ice is transferred to the spring of 2019, which achieves good agreement with the observations; however, there is some disagreement in April 2009 and 2019 with respect to an overestimation concerning both the magnitude and the number of ODEs. New simulations using the finite-bromide assumption greatly improve agreement with in situ observations at Utqiagvik, Alaska, Zeppelin Mountain, Svalbard, and Pallas, Finland, in April 2019, suggesting that bromide on the sea ice is depleted to an extent that reduces the bromine release. The new simulations also slightly improve the agreement with observations at these sites in February and March. A comparison to measurements near Eureka, Canada, and Station Nord, Greenland, shows that multi-year ice and possibly snow-covered land may be significant bromine sources. However, assuming higher releasable bromide near Eureka does not remove all disagreement with the observations. The numerical results are also compared to tropospheric-BrO vertical column densities generated with a new retrieval method from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) observations. BrO vertical column densities (VCDs) above 5x10(13) molec. cm(-2) observed by the satellite agree well with the model results. However, the model also predicts BrO VCDs of around 3x10(13) molec. cm(-2) throughout the Arctic and patches of BrO VCDs of around 10(14) molec. cm(-2) not observed by the satellite, especially near Hudson Bay. This suggests that snow at Hudson Bay may be a weaker bromine source in late spring compared to snow in the north.

TI  - Claudin-3 inhibits tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis via regulating the PI3K signaling pathway in lymphatic endothelial cells
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Claudin-3 is a tight junction protein that has often been associated with the progression and metastasis of various tumors. Here, the role of claudin-3 in tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis is investigated. We found an increased lymphangiogenesis in the B16F10 tumor in claudin-3 knockout mice, accompanied by augmented melanoma cell metastasis into sentinel lymph nodes. In vitro, the overexpression of claudin-3 on lymphatic endothelial cells inhibited tube formation by suppressing cell migration, resulting in restricted lymphangiogenesis. Further experiments showed that claudin-3 inhibited lymphatic endothelial cell migration by regulating the PI3K signaling pathway. Interestingly, the expression of claudin-3 in lymphatic endothelial cells is down-regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor C that is often present in the tumor microenvironment. This study indicates that claudin-3 plays an important role as a signaling molecule in lymphatic endothelial cell activity associated with tumor lymphangiogenesis, which may further contribute to melanoma metastasis.

TI  - Vegetation Changes Following Large-scale Fence Removal Across a Protected Area Network Within the Kruger to Canyons Biosphere Reserve, South Africa
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the early 1990's, reserves adjacent to Kruger National Park (KNP) removed their fences to create a continuous landscape within the Kruger to Canyons Biosphere Reserve. Understanding how these interconnected multi-management systems responded to changes in environmental factors and management regimes can help to maintain natural large-scale landscape heterogeneity and ecological resilience. Our objective was to analyze remote sensing-derived vegetation metric changes between the different management types pre- and post-fence removal. The study area included fourteen reserves and the central section of KNP. We calculated the residuals between TIMESAT-derived metrics (from AVHRR NDVI time series) and rainfall to analyze changes in vegetation from 1985 to 2006. We then compared vegetation-rainfall residuals between different management types pre- and post-fence removal using mean-variance plots, nonmetric multidimensional scaling plots, and permutational multivariate analysis of variance to statistically identify and analyze changes. All management types experienced increased greenness. Reserves that removed their fences had greater changes in vegetation post-fence removal compared to reserves that remained fenced and KNP. Our findings suggest managers may need to address landscape changes by implementing management regimes such as reducing artificial surface water to counterbalance increased grazing pressure as a result of increased animal mobility across artificially created resource gradients. Habitat connectivity within and between protected area networks can be achieved by removing fences across adjacent conservation areas thus potentially increasing ecological resilience, which is vital to effective long-term conservation.

TI  - Towards lithology mapping in semi-arid areas using time-series Landsat-8 data
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous remote sensing studies have used optical images to map lithology, commonly based on a single-date product to extract spectral diagnostic features or other geology-related features to aid interpretation. Yet, the performance of time-series or multi-date optical images in lithology mapping has rarely been discussed. In this study, we employed time-series (TS) Landsat-8 products to map the lithology in a semi-arid area of Xinjiang, China. First, we extracted TS reflectance from Landsat-8 multispectral data, and then extracted TS surface moisture, greenness, and brightness via tasseled cap transformation (TCT), a method for transforming the spectral bands of optical images into components (brightness, greenness, and moisture) that can be physically interpreted. Moreover, the land surface temperature (LST) was directly extracted from Landsat-8 Collection 2 products. In total, five surface parameters (TS reflectance, TS moisture, TS greenness, TS brightness, and TS LST), were collected. Then, the rank-based non-parametric Kruskal Wallis rank-sum statistical test was applied, which demonstrated a significant difference between the TS surface parameters among different rock units. Further-more, different combinations of the TS surface parameters were stacked separately and served as different input features for the random forest classifier. Finally, the performance of TS surface parameters in mapping lithology was evaluated. The classification results showed that (1) TS reflectance outperformed single-date reflectance for mapping rock units; (2) the combination of TS brightness, greenness, and moisture gave a comparable classifi-cation result, relative to TS reflectance; (3) TS LST performed best when only one single surface parameter was used to map lithology, and (4) the combined use of LST and all three TCT components achieved the highest accuracy (85.26%) with a kappa coefficient of 0.77. Although surface parameters derived from rock units changed inconspicuously or irregularly over time, these variations captured by TS Landsat-8 data enabled the improvement of the classification accuracy. Overall, our study illustrates the great potential and benefits of using TS Lansat-8 data to map rock units in arid domains.

TI  - A review of methods for scaling remotely sensed data for spatial pattern analysis
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Context Landscape ecologists have long realized the importance of scale when studying spatial patterns and the need for a science of scaling. Remotely sensed data, a key component of a landscape ecologist's toolbox used to study spatial patterns, often requires scaling to meet study requirements. Objectives This paper reviews methods for scaling remote sensing-based data, with a specific focus on spatial pattern analysis, and distills the numerous approaches based on data type. It also discusses knowledge gaps and future directions. Methods Key papers were identified through a systematic review of the literature. Trends, developments, and key methods for scaling remotely sensed data and spatial products derived from these data were identified and synthesized to detail the general progression of a science of scaling in landscape ecology. Results Upscaling both continuous and categorical data can oversimplify data, creating challenges for spatial pattern analysis. Object-based and neighborhood approaches can help, and since patch boundaries are more likely to align with objects than pixels, these may be better options for landscape ecologists. Many downscaling methods exist, but these approaches are not being widely employed for spatial pattern analysis. Conclusions A diverse range of scaling methods are available to landscape ecologists, but work remains to integrate them into spatial pattern analysis. Moving forward, advances in computer science and engineering should be explored and cross-disciplinary research encouraged to further the science of scaling remotely sensed data.

TI  - Potential role of high-altitude wetlands in preservation of plant biodiversity under changing climatic conditions in the arid Eastern Pamir
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - High-altitude wetlands in the Eastern Pamir are habitat islands located in an arid landscape. They play several important roles, including that of water sources and forage grounds for people and their livestock. Considering high variation in micro-relief and complexity of water supplies observed in these wetlands, we assessed their potential to play a role of refugia for species whose present ranges may be limited by climate changes projected for Central Asia. Such species currently occur typically in less moist habitats, often located at lower elevations (e. g. steppe and meadow species). To perform this assessment, we analyzed current spatial structure and species diversity of vegetation accompanying selected water bodies in the studied catchments, identified present changes in temperature and precipitation in these catchments and analyzed alterations in area of lakes and small water bodies located in the vegetation mosaic. Presently, the biodiversity of the studied wetlands comprises 110 species of vascular plants from 26 families, forming ten distinct vegetation types, over 40 recorded species are typical for steppes and various types of alpine meadows. Both meteorological data and satellite data on open water area indicated that with growing temperatures, areas of the studied lakes and small water bodies in the vegetation mosaic increase. This effect is probably caused by thawing of ground ice and permafrost, whose occurrence helps mitigate the effects of the ongoing warming and lessening precipitation. Thus, the wetlands may temporarily maintain their cold, wet and mesic characteristics under the changing climatic conditions and, as such, poten-tially become refugia for steppe and meadow species. However, after the period of intense thawing, lowering of groundwater level and huge surface water fluctuations may occur, potentially resulting in a decrease in the total vegetated area on lacustrine and riverine terraces in the Eastern Pamir.

TI  - Epidemiology of acute gastroenteritis in France from November 2019-August 2021, in light of reported adherence to COVID-19 barrier measures
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, French health authorities have encouraged barrier measures and implemented three lockdowns to slow SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We aimed to examine the impact of these measures on the epidemiology of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in France, from November 2019 to August 2021. We describe trends in AGE indicators from syndromic surveillance and a sentinel surveillance network. Additionally, we describe reported AGE illness data from a community based cohort, and frequencies of adherence to COVID-19 barrier measures from repeated quantitative surveys. From week 7 in 2020, all AGE indicators reached the lowest levels observed since the last decade. During the first lockdown, the median incidence rate reported by the sentinel network was 32 per 100,000 inhabitants, 1.9 times lower than the minimum registered during the 2010-2019 period. Low activity persisted until April 2021. Reported illness from the community cohort mirrored these trends. Adherence to COVID-19 barrier measures was highest during the first lockdown, coinciding with the steep decrease in AGE incidence. Among children under 5 years, AGE incidence increased after the third lockdown in June and July 2021, but remained lower than previous winter-season peaks. Our study indicates that a reduction in adherence to COVID-19 barrier measures, and the end of the lockdowns, coincided with an increase in AGE incidence, particularly among young children. We therefore strongly recommend maintaining adherence to barrier measures in order to in order to limit the transmission of AGE related pathogens.

TI  - Land use land cover representation through supervised machine learning methods: sensitivity on simulation of urban thunderstorms in the east coast of India
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the sensitivity of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) representation on the evolution of mesoscale convective systems over Bhubaneswar, a rapidly growing city (similar to 77% growth in the last two decades) in India. In this study, three types of LULC maps have been prepared using supervised machine learning (ML) methods such as Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Naive B ayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform using Landsat 8 for 2014. A high accuracy score (87%) and kappa coefficient (84%) revealed the best performance of CART in generating the LULC map. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at 6 and 2 km horizontal resolution is forced with these LULC maps. Model results highlight that the CART experiment exhibits relatively less bias in 2 m relative humidity (similar to- 10% to - 5%), 2 m temperature (similar to 2.5 degrees C to 0 degrees C), and 10 m wind speed (- 1 to similar to 1.8 m s(-1) up to peak stage of the thunderstorms. The CART performs better with less rainfall error (similar to- 16 mm) than CNTL (similar to- 33 mm), NB (similar to- 37 mm), and SVM (similar to- 38 mm) and is supported by the quantitative statistical analysis, viz. less false alarm ratio, critical success index for different thresholds. LULC class-wise analysis indicates a higher variation in surface and lower atmospheric parameters over urban, shrubland, and cropland while less variation over barren, forest, and water. Thus, the study highlights the credibility of ML models in representing LULC information to input the high-resolution models.

TI  - 3D radiative transfer modeling of structurally complex forest canopies through a lightweight boundary-based description of leaf clusters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer simulations are critical for studying the radiometric properties of canopies. Efficient and easy-to-use 3D radiative transfer models are required by remote sensing inversion and many validation applications. Extensive efforts have been made to improve the computational effi-ciency, accuracy, and useability of 3D radiative transfer models. This study focuses on the abstraction of canopies for 3D radiative transfer simulations by proposing a lightweight boundary-based description of leaf clusters (B-cluster) to ease the creation of 3D scenes while keeping the simulation as accurate as possible. B -cluster partitions a tree crown into sub-crown leaf clusters and abstracts each of them into a turbid medium enclosed by a complex and tight boundary, while terrain and branches are described with precise mesh surfaces. The radiative transfer simulation within B-cluster has been developed based on an efficient Monte Carlo path-tracing algorithm and implemented in the LargE-Scale remote sensing data and image Simulation framework (LESS) model by considering the presence of both turbid medium and surface scattering. The performance of the model was assessed by comparing with original LESS version, which describes all landscape elements with mesh surfaces (here called M-surface approach), and with a uniform voxel-based approach (U-voxel) in terms of the multiangle bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) as well as with pixel -wise images. Results show that B-cluster is highly consistent with M-surface in abstract canopies (mean normalized absolute BRF differences delta) < 2%) and in realistic forest stand (delta) < 5% at 5-m resolution) with considerably reduced requirements for computational memory. Compared with U-voxel, B-cluster is also more robust and better at describing canopy structures with different levels of detail. B-cluster enables to quickly construct accurate 3D scenes with reduced requirements of computational resources. It is also a unified and scale-adaptive approach that can describe crowns as simple as geometric primitives and as complex as explicitly described meshes. The newly proposed approach has been released in new LESS ver-sions at http://lessrt.org/.

TI  - Application of a Distributed Hydrologic Model to Assess the Impact of Climate and Land-use Change on Surface Runoff from a Small Urbanizing Watershed
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of future land-use and climate changes on the surface hydrology of a watershed was studied using an event-based hydrological model. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Monte-Carlo Cellular Automata (CA) based model was used to generate future land-use scenarios of an urbanizing watershed. Simulations were thereafter performed using a hydrological model to assess the expected changes in runoff. The spatial data inputs for the hydrological model were generated using satellite data, field observations, and data obtained from government agencies. Sensitivity analysis, calibration, and validation of the model were carried out using the observed storm and flow hydrographs, and the model performance was assessed using various statistical performance metrics. Historical land-use data for 2005, 2013, and 2017 was prepared using Landsat satellite imageries and Google Earth images. The land-use scenario generated for the year 2021 exhibited good agreement with the actual land-use map, with a Kappa value above 0.8. Future land-use scenarios were generated to assess the short-term (2025 and 2029) and long-term (2037, 2045, and 2053) changes in the characteristics of the flow hydrographs. The expected changes in the hydrographs due to urbanization were analyzed by applying a selected storm event and considering 2005 as the baseline year using the Two-Dimensional Runoff Erosion and Export (TREX) model. Results indicate that the peak discharge is likely to increase by 29%, and the time to peak is likely to decrease by 6% in 2053 when only land use change is considered. The corresponding values in the worst case considering the combined effect of climate and land use changes are 34.63% and 8.28%, respectively.

TI  - Seeing from space makes sense: Novel earth observation variables accurately map species distributions over Himalaya
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Topical advances in earth observation have enabled spatially explicit mapping of species' fundamental niche limits that can be used for nature conservation and management applications. This study investigates the possibility of applying functional variables of ecosystem retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard sensor data to map the species distribution of two alpine treeline species, namely Betula utilis D.Don and Rhododendron campanulatum D.Don over the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we have developed forty-nine Novel Earth Observation Variables (NEOVs) from MODIS products, an asset to the present investigation. To determine the effectiveness and ecological significance of NEOVs combinations, we built and compared four different models, namely, a bioclimatic model (BCM) with bioclimatic predictor variables, a phenology model (PhenoM) with earth observation derived phenological predictor variables, a biophysical model (BiophyM) with earth observation derived biophysical predictor variables, and a hybrid model (HM) with a combination of selected predictor variables from BCM, PhenoM, and BiophyM. All models utilized topographical variables by default. Models that include NEOVs were competitive for focal species, and models without NEOVs had considerably poor model performance and explanatory strength. To ascertain the accurate predictions, we assessed the congruence of predictions by pairwise comparisons of their performance. Among the three machine learning algorithms tested (artificial neural networks, generalised boosting model, and maximum entropy), maximum entropy produced the most promising predictions for BCM, PhenoM, BiophyM, and HM. Area under curve (AUC) and true skill statistic (TSS) scores for the BCM, PhenoM, BiophyM, and HM models derived from maximum entropy were AUC >= 0.9 and TSS >= 0.6 for the focal species. The overall investigation revealed the competency of NEOVs in the accurate prediction of species' fundamental niches, but conventional bioclimatic variables were unable to achieve such a level of precision. A principal component analysis of environmental spaces disclosed that niches of focal species substantially overlapped each other. We demonstrate that the use of satellite onboard sensors' biotic and abiotic variables with species occurrence data can provide precision and resolution for species distribution mapping at a scale that is relevant ecologically and at the operational scale of most conservation and management actions.

TI  - Radio-isotope occult lesion localization (ROLL) techniques to identify the clipped node for targeted axillary dissection (TAD) in breast cancer
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Breast cancer patients having neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) who have a positive (clipped) lymph node (CN) at presentation must have that CN removed to assess pathologic response at later surgery. Multiple techniques for localizing the CN have been described. We describe a novel ROLL-based approach. Methods Consecutive patients between 2018 and 2021, having NAST with biopsy proven positive lymph node(s), had a clip placed into the most abnormal node(s). At later surgery sentinel node and occult lesion localization (SNOLL) was performed with peritumoral radio-isotope (Tc-99m-Nanoscan) injected under ultrasound guidance. Planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT) images were used to identify sentinel nodes (SN) and the CN. If the CN was not a SN, then additional Tc-99m-Nanoscan was injected directly into the CN using ultrasound (ROLL). TAD was performed using a gamma probe and intra-operative specimen radiographs to confirm excision of the CN. Results Thirty-eight patients underwent TAD. 20/38 CNs were SNs on SPECT-CT. 17/38 CN were localized separately. 1/38 CN was not a SN and could not be identified on ultrasound. The remaining 37/38 (97.4%) of the CNs were removed intra-operatively. Pathological complete response in the axilla was identified in 18/38 cases. The CN was the only positive node in 10/20 cases. In 18/20 cases the CN contained the largest tumour deposit. Conclusion Combining SNOLL and ROLL techniques to identify the SNs and, if separate, the CN for TAD is very reliable and logistically robust, especially for units already performing peritumoral lymphoscintigraphy.

TI  - A full resolution deep learning network for paddy rice mapping using Landsat data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is the most important food crop in the developing world, and more than half of the global population consumes it as a staple food. Mapping the area of rice cultivation in a timely and accurate manner is essential to ensure food safety and evaluate its environmental impact. Deep learning performs very well in high-resolution remote sensing classification; however, due to lack of high-quality training datasets and spatial semantic in-formation of Landsat data, paddy rice mapping based on deep learning and Landsat data has received less attention. In this study, we constructed the first large-scale training dataset and a deep learning network, named full resolution network (FR-Net), for mapping paddy rice based on Landsat 8 OLI data. The pixel-wise annotated dataset is composed of 64 Landsat 8 OLI scenes covering the main areas producing rice in northeast China. To overcome the coarse segmentation borders resulting from other deep learning models, and especially with the low-resolution Landsat data, a new multi-resolution fusion unit (MRFU) was proposed to fuse different resolution streams and maintain the high-resolution streams of the model. In comparison with other models, the FR-Net acquired the highest accuracy, with MCC of 0.893 and F1 score of 0.898, and in particular, the results of different band combinations showed that the FR-Net perform better for feature extraction than other models. Without using the sensitive bands, i.e., short-wave infrared 1 and 2, the MCC of FR-Net was slightly decreased by 4.14%, smaller than other models, e.g., 8.51% for U-Net and 11.76% for RS-Net etc. The comparison showed the proposed FR-Net presented highest spatial precision among all these models, by which a fine boundary could be obtained for Landsat data to achieve high quality mapping result. The analysis of the performance in different temporal showed that FR-Net performed better at the beginning or the ending of growth stages, and the omission or false alarm main occurred in small size patches or the boundaries. In all, low-resolution characteristics of Landsat data should be more extensively investigated when developing and using deep learning in classification.

TI  - Amphiphilic stilbene derivatives attenuate the neurotoxicity of soluble Aβ<sub>42</sub> oligomers by controlling their interactions with cell membranes
T2  - CHEMICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The misfolded proteins or polypeptides commonly observed in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are promising drug targets for developing therapeutic agents. To target the amyloid-beta (A beta) peptide plaques and oligomers, the hallmarks of AD, we have developed twelve amphiphilic small molecules with different hydrophobic and hydrophilic fragments. In vitro fluorescence binding assays demonstrate that these amphiphilic compounds show high binding affinity to both A beta plaques and oligomers, and six of them exhibit selective binding toward A beta oligomers. These amphiphilic compounds can also label the A beta species in the brain sections of transgenic AD mice, as shown by immunostaining with an A beta antibody. Molecular docking studies were performed to obtain structure-affinity relationships. To our delight, four amphiphilic compounds can alleviate the Cu2+-A beta induced toxicity in cell viability assays. In addition, confocal fluorescence imaging studies provide evidence that two compounds, ZY-15-MT and ZY-15-OMe, can disrupt the interactions between A beta oligomers and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell membranes. Overall, these studies strongly suggest that developing compounds with amphiphilic properties that target A beta oligomers and modulate the A beta oligomer-cell membrane interactions can be an effective strategy for the development of small molecule AD therapeutics.

TI  - TrackMatcher - a tool for finding intercepts in tracks of geographical positions
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Working with measurement data in atmospheric science often necessitates the co-location of observations from instruments or platforms at different locations with different geographical and/or temporal data coverage. The varying complexity and abundance of the different data sets demand a consolidation of the observations. This paper presents a tool for (i) finding temporally and spatially resolved intersections between two- or three-dimensional geographical tracks (trajectories) and (ii) extracting observations and other derived parameters in the vicinity of intersections to achieve the optimal combination of various data sets and measurement techniques. The TrackMatcher tool has been designed specifically for matching height-resolved remote sensing observations along the ground track of a satellite with position data of aircraft (flight tracks) and clouds (cloud tracks) and is intended to be an extension for ships (ship tracks) and air parcels (forward and backward trajectories). The open-source algorithm is written in the Julia programming language. The core of the matching algorithm consist of interpolating tracks of different objects with a piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial with the subsequent identification of an intercept point by minimising the norm between the different track point coordinate pairs. The functionality wrapped around the two steps allows for the application of the TrackMatcher tool to a wide range of scenarios. Here, we present three examples of matching satellite tracks with the position of individual aircraft and clouds that demonstrate the usefulness of TrackMatcher for application in atmospheric science.

AB  - Sentinel surveillance of influenza-like illnesses revealed an increase in the cases of influenza C virus in children and adults in Austria, 2022, compared to previous years, following one season (2020/2021), wherein no influenza C virus was detected. Whole-genome sequencing revealed no obvious genetic basis for the increase. We propose that the reemergence is explained by waning immunity from lack of community exposure due to restrictions intended to limit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spread in prior seasons, pending further investigation.

TI  - Habitat quality dynamics in China?s first group of national parks in recent four decades: Evidence from land use and land cover changes
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As the most biodiversity-rich part of the protected areas system, habitats within the pilot national parks have long been threatened by drastic human-induced land use and land cover changes. The growing concern about habitat loss has spurred China's national park project to shift from pilot to construction phase with the official establishment of China's first group of national parks (CFGNPs) in October 2021. But far too little attention has been paid to the synergistic work concerning the habitat quality (HQ) dynamics of all five national parks. Here, the InVEST model, combined with a satellite-derived land use and land cover product and a hot spot analysis (HSA) method, was used to investigate the HQ dynamics at the park- and pixel-scale within the CFGNPs. Our results demonstrate that the past ecological conservation practices within national parks have been unpromising, especially in Giant Panda National Park, Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park (NCTL), and Wuyi Mountain National Park (WYM), where HQ as a whole showed a significant decline. Furthermore, more than half of Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park (87.2%), WYM (77.4%), and NCTL (52.9%) showed significant HQ degradation from 1980 to 2019. Besides, increasing trends in the area shares of HQ degraded pixels were observed in all five national parks from 1980-1999 to 2000-2019. The HSA implied that the hot spots of high HQ degradation rates tend to occur in areas closer to urban settlements or on the edge of national parks, where human activities are intensive. Despite these disappointing findings, we highlighted from the observed local successes and the HQ plateau that the construction of CFGNPs is expected to reverse the deteriorating HQ trends. Thus, we concluded our paper by proposing an HSA-based regulatory zoning scheme that includes five subzones to guide the future construction of China's national park system.

M3  - Article
AB  - In addition to several recent articles devoted to the rare event of ground-level enhancement of the solar relativistic proton flux observed on 2021 October 28 - GLE73, we study the 10-100 MeV solar energetic particle (SEP) component of this event. Based on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite data for 26 GLEs recorded since 1986, we have formed a scatter plot displaying the ratio of the peak fluxes of the >10 MeV (J(10)) and >100 MeV (J(100)) protons and their energy spectra. Two extreme characteristics of the prompt component of the SEP-GLE73 event were revealed: (1) very small J(10) and J(1)(00) proton fluxes and (2) a very hard energetic spectrum in the 10-100 MeV range. There are only two events with these characteristics similar to SEP-GLE73, namely GLE40 (1989 July 25) and GLE46 (1989 November 15). A correspondence was demonstrated between the hard frequency spectrum of microwave radio bursts of initiating flares and the hard SEP energy spectrum of these two and other GLEs. These results suggest that the flare magnetic reconnection both in the impulsive and post-eruption phases plays an important role in the acceleration of the SEP-GLE protons.

TI  - Revising digital elevation models generation from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar and interferometric technique in densely-vegetated humid tropical environment
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Generation of digital elevation models (DEM) over densely vegetated humid tropics using Sentinel-1 data and Interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique is revised based on recommended optimum perpendicular baselines, and accuracy assessment based on coherence cells is introduced. Six pairs of Sentinel-1 data within the optimum perpendicular baseline of 150 - 400 m and different temporal baselines acquired between 2015 and 2021 were processed using Sentinel Application Platform. Results revealed: that due to the extreme difficulty of achieving good coherence, interferograms are characterized by noise, generated DEMs are dominated by artefacts, higher elevation accuracy can be achieved within coherence cells, and within the recommended optimum perpendicular baseline range, elevation accuracy within coherence cells is mainly determined by the perpendicular baseline compared to temporal baseline. Therefore, this study can provide practical guide for InSAR generated DEMs evaluation in densely vegetated environments, and remote sensing method for regional-scale measurement and mapping of spots heights.

TI  - River avulsions and megafan development triggered by high recurrent explosive volcanism
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Megafans are ever-evolving landforms and sedimentary bodies produced by rivers that regularly change their courses through avulsions, in which the processes that cause the avulsions and their rates are tightly linked to the formation and evolution of the fans. The commonly cited condition required for the formation of megafans is a highly variable climate setting (monsoonal) which results in variable discharge and sediment transport capacity. However, some megafans occur in tropical settings in rivers with lower discharge variability but high sediment loads due to input from volcanic or tectonically active sources. We examine the Santa Clara Megafan (Costa Rica) to establish a model of explosive volcanism-driven megafan evolution, an alternative model to the climate-driven one. Studying chronological, archaeological, historical and remote sensing data we infer that major avulsions and shifts in the main rivers of this megafan are temporally and spatially correlated to strong eruptions (VEI >= 3). Furthermore, a period of ca. 1700 years with few changes in the fluvial system of the eastern sector of the megafan coincides with a low volcanic activity in its source area (i.e. Turrialba Volcano). The megafan avulsion rate was estimated as-1 major avulsion per century in the last five centuries, when four strong eruptions (-0.8 eruptions/century) took place. These shifts in the rivers in response to the volcanic activity produced the acti-vation or abandonment of megafan sedimentary lobes at a secular pace. The record of these changes will support future archaeological studies and lahar hazard assessments. Furthermore, the Santa Clara Megafan provides a model to explain the formation of megafans on Earth or on other planets through non-climatic processes.

TI  - Earthquake-induced landslides in Haiti: analysis of seismotectonic and possible climatic influences
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - First analyses of landslide distribution and triggering factors are presented for the region affected by the 14 August 2021 earthquake (M-w = 7.2) in the Nippes Department, Haiti. Landslide mapping was mainly carried out by comparing pre- and post-event remote imagery (similar to 0.5-1 m resolution) available on Google Earth Pro (R) and Sentinel-2 (10 m resolution) satellite images. The first covered about 50 % of the affected region (for post-event imagery and before completion of the map in January 2022), and the latter were selected to cover the entire potentially affected zone. On the basis of the completed landslide inventory, comparisons are made with catalogs compiled by others both for the August 2021 and the January 2010 seismic events, including one open inventory (by the United States Geological Survey) that was also used for further statistical analyses. Additionally, we studied the pre-2021 earthquake slope stability conditions. These comparisons show that the total number of landslides mapped for the 2021 earthquake (7091) is larger than the one recently published by another research team for the same event but slightly smaller than the number of landslides mapped by a third research team. It is also clearly smaller than the one observed by two other research teams for the 2010 earthquake (e.g., 23 567, for the open inventory). However, these apparently fewer landslides triggered in 2021 cover much wider areas of slopes (> 80 km(2)) than those induced by the 2010 event (similar to 25 km(2) - considering the open inventory). A simple statistical analysis indicates that the lower number of 2021 landslides can be explained by the missing detection of the smallest landslides triggered in 2021, partly due to the lower-resolution imagery available for most of the areas affected by the recent earthquake; this is also confirmed by an inventory completeness analysis based on size-frequency statistics. The much larger total area of landslides triggered in 2021, compared to the 2010 earthquake, can be related to different physical reasons: (a) the larger earthquake magnitude in 2021, (b) the more central location of the fault segment that ruptured in 2021 with respect to coastal zones, (c) and possible climatic preconditioning of slope instability in the 2021 affected area. These observations are supported by (1) a new pre-2021 earthquake landslide map; (2) rainfall distribution maps presented for different periods (including October 2016 - when Hurricane Matthew had crossed the western part of Haiti), covering both the 2010 and 2021 affected zones; and (3) shaking intensity prediction maps.

TI  - Regional monitoring of biomass burning using passive air sampling technique reveals the importance of MODIS unresolved fires
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Field-based sampling can provide more accurate evaluation than MODIS in regional biomass burning (BB) emissions given the limitations of MODIS on unresolved fires. Polyurethane foam-based passive air samplers (PUF-PASs) are a promising tool for collecting atmospheric monosaccharides. Here, we deployed PUF-PASs to monitor monosaccharides and other BB-related biomarkers and presented a dataset of 31 atmospheric BB-related biomarkers in the Indo-China Peninsula (ICP) and Southwest China. The peak concentrations of monosaccharides in the ICP occurred before monsoon season. The highest concentrations were in the eastern Mekong plain, while the lowest were along the eastern coast. BB-related biomarkers displayed elevated concentrations after April, particularly in the monsoon season; however, fewer active fires were recorded by MODIS. This revealed the importance of MODIS unresolved fires (e.g., indoor biofuel combustion, small-scale BB incidents, and charcoal fires) to the regional atmosphere. The PAS derived levoglucosan concentrations indicated that, with the inclusion of MODIS unresolved fires, the estimated top-down emissions of PM (4194-4974 Gg/yr), OC (1234-1719 Gg/yr) and EC (52-384 Gg/yr) would be higher than previous bottom-up estimations in the ICP. Future studies on these MODIS unresolved fires and regional monitoring data of BB are vital for improving the modeling of regional BB emissions.

TI  - A framework of correcting the angular effect of land surface temperature on evapotranspiration estimation in single-source energy balance models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an essential parameter connecting the hydrological cycle, energy balance and carbon cycle. The angular effect (AE) of remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST), one of the obstacles hindering the application of single-source energy balance models in continental and global ET estimates, is a long-standing issue that has rarely been witnessed in the last decade. In this study, we propose a general framework for correcting the angular effect that could be practically applied to reduce the uncertainties in the ET estimations with any single-source energy balance-based model, under the guidance of simulation of thermal radiation directionality through the integration of a directional module from the soil-canopy spectral radiances, photosynthesis, fluorescence, temperature, and energy balance (SCOPE) and an artificially added ET estimation module. The correction was conducted by adjusting the directional reflectance and then the reflectance-based fractional vegetation coverage to the view zenith angle of interest, together with estimating the soil and vegetation component temperatures. This framework was later tested on the widely applied surface energy balance system (SEBS) driven by the directional LST from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) collected on 94 clear-sky days between 2009 and 2010 at the Yucheng site. The simulation results indicated that (1) the AE obviously increased as the view zenith angle increased; (2) the AE was more apparent in the backward scattering direction than in the forward scattering direction; and (3) most of the AE first increased evidently and then decreased with the increase in the leaf area index. The correction results related to the SEBS-based ET estimations, compared to the in situ ET measurements, showed that the proposed framework greatly improved the estimations of ET, with the root mean square error decreasing by 27.6 W/m(2)(similar to 8%, relative to the average 339 W/m(2)) from 86.8 W/m(2) (similar to 25%) to 59.2 W/m(2) (similar to 17%) and the bias decreasing from 49.7 W/m(2) (similar to 15%) to similar to 6.5 W/m(2) (similar to 2%). In conclusion, the proposed framework efficiently corrected the angular effect of remotely sensed LST on ET estimation. We expect more attention to be paid to the angular effect and hope our work could provide insight for solving this pendent issue.

TI  - A comparative study of the surface level changes of Urmia Lake and Aral Lake during the period of 1988 to 2018 using satellite images
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Internal lakes are considered as the ecological environments and the monitoring and evaluation of which can be considered as a matter in the national development and natural resources management (Rasouli et al., 2008). The changes in the water levels of lakes and the variations of the land use and cover along with the margins and the association of these changes with natural and human factors in Urmia Lake and Aral Lake are much-discussed and taken into consideration. In this study, a comparison was made between Urmia Lake and the Aral Lake over a period of 28 years, and the first one being suffered from declining water levels and drastic changes due to many factors, including, most specifically, human intrusion and mismanagement. For this purpose, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat 5 and 8 satellite images were utilized for 1988 and 2018 and object-based image classification was applied in six classes, i.e. water body, arid, agriculture, salt marsh, salt wet and built with the acceptable accuracy of 89.23 (1988) and 85.8 (2018) percent for land use maps of the Urmia Lake and 92.46 (1988) and 95.15 (2018) percent for the Aral Lake. The overall accuracy of classification which represents the functioned credit classification for the maps should be more than 85% (Anderson et al., 1976). The classification showed that during the study period both of the lakes faced declination of water and increasing of salt levels. The trend of agricultural and built-in lands has been rising especially in Urmia Lake. Results indicated that the creation of the agricultural lands and human levels in recent decades has caused the increase in water consumption which in turn has reduced the amount of water entering to the Urmia Lake and has created hard conditions such as the dryness of the lake today.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of air quality and its relationship with COVID-19 lockdown over Dublin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution has become one of the biggest challenges for human and environmental health. Major pollutants such as Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Ozone (O3), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) are being ejected in a large quantity every day. Initially, authorities did not implement the strictest mitigation policies due to pressures of balancing the economic needs of people and public safety. Still, after realizing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world imposed a complete lockdown to contain the outbreak, which had the unexpected benefit of causing a drastic improvement in air quality. The present study investigates the air pollution scenarios over the Dublin city through satellites (Sentinel-5P and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and ground-based observations. An average of 28% reduction in average NO2 level and a 27.7% improvement in AQI (Air Quality Index) was experienced in 2020 compared to 2019 during the lockdown period (27 March-05 June). We found that PM10 and PM2.5 are the most dominating factor in the AQI over Dublin.

TI  - Multi-scale spatial analysis of satellite-retrieved surface evapotranspiration in Beijing, a rapidly urbanizing region under continental monsoon climate
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the important components of hydrological cycle, evapotranspiration spatial distribution is of great significance to regional water resources planning and rational utilization. This research used Surface Energy Balance System model to estimate the daily evapotranspiration (ET) in Beijing based on Landsat 8 observations. Results showed that the daily ET in Beijing ranged from 3.469 to 5.474 mm/day. ET is known to decrease with the increase of land surface temperature (LST) and to increase with the increase of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). NDVI primarily decreased from the northwest to the southeast. When the NDVI value was 0.4-0.6, the average ET peaked at 4.88 mm/day, and then slightly decreased by 3.7%. The coefficient of determination of NDVI (0.95) was much greater than that of LST (0.30) upon linear fitting, showing LST was not the main factor controlling ET in Beijing. In contrast to the linear fitting results, the spatial correlation between LST and ET is more significant than that between NDVI and ET in the global bivariate spatial analysis, where the absolute value of global bivariate Moran's I of LST (0.51) was higher than that of NDVI (0.21) at a resolution of 150 m. And the univariate spatial autocorrelation indices of LST, ET, and NDVI equaled 0.84, 0.65, and 0.51, respectively. Furthermore, the complex spatial distribution pattern of variables could significantly affect the correlation analysis results. Local bivariate spatial analysis showed that over 60% of the Beijing area had a significant correlation, of which the negative correlation area of LST accounted for about 85%, and the positive correlation area of NDVI accounted for 74%. By improving the correlation analysis accuracy, the regional conditions for the establishment of correlation analysis results were clarified from the overall correlation analysis results.

TI  - Remote Estimation of the Chlorophyll-a Concentration in Lake Dianshan, China Using High-Spatial-Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The high spatial resolution of satellite data and the capability of physics-based approaches are considered highly suitable for testing the integration of remote sensing technologies into the water quality monitoring of small and medium-sized inland lakes. This research thus aimed to investigate an operational algorithm for chlorophyll-a (Chla) estimation based on China's recently launched high-spatial-resolution GF-1 satellite data for Lake Dianshan, a eutrophic lake in Shanghai city, eastern China. For the calibration of the empirical model, an enhanced three-band model and an improved four-band model (IFB) developed by model derivation and statistical analysis based on in situ water sampling and satellite reflectance data were proposed. The IFB model could account for more than 90% of the Chla variation in the GF-1 satellite data. For the calibration of the semi-empirical model, the performance of Delta phi and an improved NCI model (NCI') were analyzed and validated with field spectral measurements and GF-1 satellite data. The corresponding GF-1 satellite Delta phi model and NCI' model reached high estimation accuracies of R-2 = 0.80 and 0.76, respectively. The good estimated results indicate that the established GF-1 satellite models are promising and applicable to estimating Chla in small and medium-sized eutrophic inland lakes.

TI  - Natural hydrogen emanations in Namibia: Field acquisition and vegetation indexes from multispectral satellite image analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural hydrogen exploration is now active in various places of the world. Onshore, cor-relation between natural H2 generation and the presence of iron rich rocks especially from Archean and Neoproterozoic cratons have been observed. Emanations and accumulations of H2 have already been confirmed in such geological settings in Australia, South Africa and Brazil. The geological similitude and the presence of numerous sub circular depressions that are a good proxy for hydrogen emanations suggest that hydrogen resources may also exist in Namibia. We present here the results of a data acquisition campaign which allowed us to confirm the presence of natural hydrogen in this country in the vicinity of Neo-proterozoic Banded Iron Formation. The H2 content in the soil, as in Brazil, is variable within the depressions in time and space and is particularly time sensitive across the day. Comparison of the H2 signal versus time within these two regions shows a similar behavior of the soils with an increase of the H2 flow at the middle of the day. In addition, these new data allow us to better constrain the morphological characteristics of such H2-emiting depressions. By using satellite images and digital elevation model we propose a new proxy to differentiate potentially H2-emiting features from other type of depressions such as Salt Pan. The Landsat multispectral images and their processing through NDVI and SAVI in-dexes, that highlight a ring of healthy vegetation around the sub circular area with scarce vegetation already observed appear able to discriminate between H2 emitting structures and other soft depressions.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Exploring gender relations in Paul's use of salutations to house churches and the<i> ubuntu</i> oral praxis of sereto or isiduko
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Paul usually ends his letters with salutations to believers who meet in someone else's house. Far from being individualistic, these greetings also include people from different house churches. Considered from a functional angle, these greetings cement relationships between house churches. Within an ubuntu worldview, the oral praxis of sereto (Sepedi) or isiduko (IsiXhosa) (praise-poetry) establishes and confirms relationships between members of the same community (family, clan or tribe). The question is how such praxes affect women who belong to such communities.Contribution: This article is a comparative analysis of how some of the salutations used at the end of some of Paul's epistles touch on gender relations in the same way as the ubuntu oral praxis of sereto or isiduko touches on gender relations among members of a community (family, clan or tribe).

TI  - Doping control analyses during the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games
T2  - DRUG TESTING AND ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The doping control analyses at the XXXII Olympic Games (July 23 to August 8, 2021) and the XVI Paralympic Games (August 24 to September 5, 2021) held in Tokyo, Japan, after a year of delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic are summarized in this paper. A new satellite facility at the existing World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)-accredited Tokyo laboratory was established and fully operated by 278 staff, including 33 Tokyo laboratory staff, 49 international experts, and 196 Japanese temporary staff. The numbers of urine samples were 5081 (Olympics) and 1519 (Paralympics), and the numbers of blood samples were 1103 (Olympics) and 500 (Paralympics). The laboratory could prepare for analysis in advance using a paperless chain-of-custody system, allowing for faster turnaround time reporting. For the first time, a new polymerase chain reaction method for detecting erythropoietin (EPO) gene doping was used. The laboratory also analyzed blood samples for detecting steroid esters following the spotting of collected venous EDTA blood onto dried blood spot cards. Moreover, full-scan data acquisition using high-resolution mass spectrometers was performed for all urine samples, allowing for detecting traces of doping substances, which are not currently analyzed in the subsequent data processing. The presence of some prohibited substances was confirmed, resulting in 8 atypical findings (ATFs) and 11 adverse analytical findings (AAFs), including homologous blood transfusion (2 cases) and recombinant EPO in the blood (1 case), at the Olympics, whereas 2 ATFs and 10 AAFs were reported at the Paralympics.

TI  - Improved Accuracy of Lymph Node Staging and Long-Term Survival Benefit in Colorectal Cancer With <i>Ex Vivo</i> Arterial Methylene Blue Infiltration
T2  - PATHOLOGY & ONCOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Ex vivo methylene blue (MB) injection into the main supplying arteries of the colorectal specimen after surgical removal is an uncomplicated technique to support lymph node harvest during pathological evaluation. The primary aim of this randomized, interventional, bicentric trial was to evaluate the impact of MB injection on lymph node yield, with secondary aims assessing the accuracy of lymph node staging and the effect on 5-year overall survival for patients undergoing resection of colorectal cancer.Methods: In the study period between December 2013 and August 2015, 200 colorectal resections were performed at two independent onco-surgery centers of Hungary. Following surgical resection, each specimen was randomly assigned either to the control (standard pathological work-up) or to the MB staining group before formaldehyde fixation. Patient-level surgical and clinical data were retrieved from routinely collected clinical datasets. Survival status data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Fund of Hungary.Results: A total of 162 specimens, 82 in the control and 80 in the MB groups, were included for analysis. Baseline characteristics were equally distributed among study groups, except for specimen length. Both the median of total number of lymph nodes retrieved (control 11 +/- 8 [0-33] nodes vs. MB 14 +/- 6 [0-42] nodes; p < 0.01), and the ratio of cases with at least 12 removed lymph nodes (36/82, 43.9% vs. 53/80, 66.3%; p < 0.01) were higher in the MB group. The rate of accurate lymph node staging was non-significantly improved. As for rectal cancer, nodal staging accuracy (16/31, 51.6% vs. 23/30, 76.7%; p = 0.04) and the proportion with minimum 12 lymph node retrieval (7/31, 22.6%, vs. 18/30, 60%; p < 0.01) was improved by MB injection. In Mantel-Cox regression, a statistically significant survival benefit with methylene blue injection at 5 years post-surgery was proven (51.2% vs. 68.8%; p = 0.04).Conclusion: In our experience, postoperative ex vivo arterial methylene blue injection appears to be an uncomplicated technique, improving lymph node yield and decreasing the chance of insufficient nodal staging. The technique might also associate with a 5-year overall survival benefit.

TI  - A Bayesian approach for remote sensing of chlorophyll<i>-a</i> and associated retrieval uncertainty in oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing of chlorophyll-a concentration (chla) in oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes faces un-certainties from sources such as atmospheric correction, complex inherent optical property compositions, and imperfect algorithmic retrieval. To improve chla estimation in oligo-and mesotrophic lakes, we developed Bayesian probabilistic neural networks (BNNs) for the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Cover Instrument (OLCI) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imager (MSI). The BNNs were built using an in situ dataset of oligo-and mesotrophic water bodies (1755 observations from 178 systems; median chla: 5.11 mg m- 3, standard deviation: 10.76 mg m-3) and provide a per-pixel uncertainty percentage associated with retrieved chla. Shifts of oligo-and meso-trophic systems into the eutrophic regime, characterised by higher biomass levels, are widespread. To account for phytoplankton biomass fluctuation, a set of eutrophic lakes (167 observations from 31 systems) were included in this study (maximum chla 68 mg m-3). The BNNs were evaluated through five assessments including single day and time series match-ups with OLCI and MSI. OLCI BNN accuracy gains of >25% and MSI BNN accuracy gains of >15% were achieved in the assessments when compared to chla reference algorithms for oligotrophic waters (chla <= 8 mg m-3). In comparison to the reference algorithms, the accuracy gains of the BNNs decreased as chla and trophic levels increased. To measure the quality of the provided BNN uncertainty estimate, we calculated the prediction interval coverage probability (PICP), Sharpness and mean absolute calibration difference (MACD) metrics. The associated BNN chla uncertainty estimate included the reference in situ chla values for most ob-servations (PICP >= 75%) across the different performance assessments. Further analysis showed that the BNN chla uncertainty estimate was not constantly well-calibrated across different evaluation strategies (Sharpness 1.7-6, MACD 0.04-0.25). BNN uncertainties were used to test two chla improvement strategies: 1) identifying and filtering uncertain chla estimates using scene-specific thresholds, and 2) selecting the most accurate prior atmospheric correction algorithm per individual satellite observation to retain chla with the lowest BNN un-certainty. Both strategies increased the quality of the chla result and demonstrated the significance of uncertainty estimation. This study serves as research on Bayesian machine learning for the estimation and visualisation of chla and associated retrieval uncertainty to develop harmonised products across OLCI and MSI for small and large oligo-and mesotrophic lakes.

TI  - UPanGAN: Unsupervised pansharpening based on the spectral and spatial loss constrained Generative Adversarial Network
T2  - INFORMATION FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - It is observed that, in most of the CNN-based pansharpening methods, the multispectral (MS) images are taken as the ground truth, and the downsampled panchromatic (Pan) and MS images are taken as the training data. However, the trained models from the downsampled images are not suitable for the pansharpening of the MS images with rich spatial and spectral information at their original spatial resolution. To tackle this problem, a novel iterative network based on spectral and textural loss constrained Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for pansharpening. First, instead of directly outputting the fused imagery, the GAN focuses on generating the mean difference image. The input of the GAN is a good initial difference image, which will make the network work better. Second, the coarse-to-fine fusion framework is designed to generate the fused imagery. It uses two optimized discriminators to distinguish the generated images, and performs multi-level fusion processing on PAN and MS images to generate the best pansharpening image in full resolution. Finally, the well-designed loss functions are embedded into both the generator and the discriminators to accurately preserve the fidelity of the fused imagery. We validated our method by the images from QuickBird, GaoFen-2 and WorldView-2 satellites. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method obtained a better fusion performance than the state-of-the-art methods in both visual comparison and quantitative evaluation.

TI  - Prolonged coastal inundation detected with synthetic aperture radar significantly retarded functional recovery of mangroves after major hurricanes
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Hurricanes are major threats to coastal mangrove ecosystems. Inundation has been implicitly reported to associate with mangrove damages and mortality. However, there have been no spatial statistical analyses of the impact of inundation on mangrove recovery at landscape scales. Objectives Our objectives are to detect spatiotemporal patterns of inundation after major hurricanes and to explore explicitly the role of inundation in mangrove recovery at landscape scale. Methods Using C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar images, we detected the spatiotemporal pattern of surface flood and derived the spatial distribution of inundation depth under mangrove canopies based on surrounding surface flood and elevation along northern Puerto Rico coasts after major hurricanes in 2017. Based on the Enhanced Vegetation Index, we derived the short-term hurricane impact and the recovery ratio from 2018 to 2021, and analyzed the impact and the recovery of mangrove greenness by means of spatial error models. Results The identification of surface flood reached very high accuracy. The severe impact is significantly explained by greater gust windspeed during the hurricane and lower elevation. More importantly, retarded mangrove greenness recovery is significantly explained by severer impacts, longer and deeper inundation, and heavier hurricane rainfall. Conclusions Spatiotemporal heterogeneity in flood depth plays a significant and essential role in mangrove recovery and delayed mortality after major hurricanes. The derived flood depth turns out to be a better explanator of mangrove recovery than elevation, which highlights importance of landscape hydrology and topography with respect to mangrove response and restoration after major hurricanes.

TI  - A novel red-edge spectral index for retrieving the leaf chlorophyll content
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf chlorophyll content (Chl(leaf)) is a crucial vegetation parameter in carbon cycle modelling and agricultural monitoring at local, regional and global scales. The red-edge spectral region is sensitive to variations in Chl(leaf.) An increasing number of sensors are capable of sampling red-edge bands, providing opportunities to estimate Chl(leaf). However, the contributions of canopy/foliar/soil factors are always combined in the reflectance signal, which limits the generalizability of vegetation index (VI)-based Chl(leaf) inversions. This study aims to propose a new red-edge chlorophyll index to decouple the effects of the canopy and soil background from the Chl(leaf) estimation. The chlorophyll sensitive index (CSI) was proposed, and the regression equations between the CSI and Chl(leaf) were acquired using PROSAIL (PROSPECT + SAIL) and the 4-Scale-PROSPECT model. Sensitivity analyses showed that the CSI is resistant to variations in the canopy structure and soil background. Validation results obtained using 308 ground-measured samples over nine sites world-wide revealed that CSI improves the Chl(leaf) retrieval accuracy (root mean square error (RMSE = 9.39 mu g cm(-2)) compared with the existing Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI; RMSE = 13.00 mu g cm(-2)). Moreover, the CSI method steadily achieves a highly accurate inversion under different LAI and Chl(leaf) conditions. Based on the CSI regression method, a Chl(leaf) product with a 30-m/10-day resolution across China was generated. The CSI is sensitive to Chl(leaf) but resistant to canopy structure and soil moisture parameters, and it has the potential to explicitly retrieve leaf-scale biochemistry in ecosystem modelling and ecological applications.

TI  - Mapping coastal upwelling in the Baltic Sea from 2002 to 2020 using remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal upwelling (CU) is an elementary phenomenon in coastal waters. CU brings up deep, often cold, saline water rich of nutrients and carbon, and plays a vital role in local air-sea exchange of gases and heat, marine ecosystem maintenance, and ocean physical dynamics. In this study, regional CU in the Baltic Sea was mapped on the daily MODIS SST from 2002 to 2020, using a method modified developed by Lehmann et al. (2012). Based on the individual CU event detected, the spatiotemporal distribution of CU in the Baltic Sea was depicted, the CUwind relationship and potential CU drivers in the Baltic Sea on different temporal scale were analyzed. The results found that: 1) The modified approach can effectively delineate the CUs formed by upwelled cold water; 2) The 19 zones delineated with frequent CU occurrences aligned well with previous study and the overall CU occurrence spatial heterogeneity was casted by the different directional relationship between the local coastline and wind; 3) The occurrences of the CU detected in this study showed strong seasonality and primarily driven by SST seasonality and then intensified by local wind in fall; 4) The interannual difference of CU occurrences were affected by heatwaves and its monthly timing. The CUs detected in this study have a high potential for facilitating investigations with respect to oceanic modeling, air-sea exchange of heat and greenhouse gases, and physical dynamics in the Baltic Sea.

TI  - Detection and counting of meadow cuts by copernicus sentinel-2 imagery in the framework of the common agricultural policy (CAP)
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Greening is a subsidy provided by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), related to mowing and designed to protect environment. National or regional paying agencies (PP) monitor and verify compliance of farmers' declarations with CAP rules. In this work, an operational procedure is proposed aimed at supporting PPs in detecting, mapping and quantifying the number of times mowing occurred in a meadow field. In particular, 72,539 meadows fields within the Piemonte region (NW - Italy) were analysed with a time series of Sentinel-2 (S2) data. The procedure is based on the processing of filtered and regularized time series of NDVI maps. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied at field level to decompose the local NDVI temporal profile. The frequency (omega(peak)) corresponding to the maximum amplitude (A(peak)) was therefore considered. A(peak) value was used to detect not-mowed meadows by thresholding based on the application of the non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Mowing counting were achieved with reference to omega(peak) and the correspondent map (called MCM) generated for the study area. MCM was, finally, tested against the validation set (285 fields). Results showed an Overall Accuracy (OA) > 87%, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed procedure in detecting, mapping and quantifying the number of times mowing occurred.

TI  - Do Things "Hang Together"? Naturalism, Pluralism, and the World
T2  - SOUTHERN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Philosophical naturalism in the spirit of Wilfred Sellars has historically sought to present a unified picture of the world, in which values, meanings, and minds find a place in the natural universe. But a number of recent thinkers have questioned the very idea of "the world" as a unified whole, arguing instead for disunity in the various discourses human beings use to talk about things. In this article I consider three such pluralist views. First, I take up the work of Huw Price, who combines pluralism and naturalism; then, I look at Markus Gabriel and Raymond Geuss, whose rejection of the ideas of "world" and "worldview" is not tied to naturalist presuppositions. In response to these views, I defend weaker conceptions of "the world" and "worldview," utilizing Hans-Georg Gadamer's idea of the "medium of language" and making the case for the unifying effects of language across the plurality of discourses.

The classic approach partitions an area based on species composition, whereas more recent methods based on remotely sensed data classify biogeographic regions on biophysical and structural variables of vegetation. Another, yet to be explored opportunity, is offered by identifying distinct ecological strategies of plants inhabiting a given area, that is, a functional trait-based bioregionalisation. Here, we propose such a bioregionalisation using trait hypervolumes. We also compare the proposed functional bioregionalisation with established classifications based on species composition or on remotely sensed data to identify spatial congruence among them, and suggest possible reasons behind observed patterns.2. Natural history collections represent an underexploited resource, despite holding both trait and locality information and being taxonomically comprehensive. We compile values of traits (leaf size, plant height, seed number per fruit, seed volume) derived from natural history collections for a random sample of African angiosperm species (similar to 1% of the continental flora) to estimate a trait hypervolume. We use hierarchical clustering to divide the hypervolume into four segments (each representing a distinct ecological strategy), whose spatial intersections produced 12 putative biogeographic regions, each containing one or more of these strategies. We spatially map the hypervolume segments onto the entire African continent and calculate the spatial congruence of the putative functional biogeographic regions with previous bioregionalisations.3. We identify values and combinations of traits that can be indicative of biogeographic regions. This functional bioregionalisation shows greater spatial congruence with that derived from species composition than from remote sensing. However, spatial congruence is low at the continent scale (19%-37%), and varies greatly among regions and in pairwise comparisons between bioregionalisations.4. Synthesis. Plant traits from natural history collections offer an underused source of information for biogeographic analyses. We demonstrate potential applications of trait hypervolumes in functional biogeography, and outline strengths and drawbacks of the different bioregionalisation methods. Finally, we suggest that key ecological strategies could be used in future models as proxies to anticipate shifts of species assemblages and biogeographic regions.

TI  - Comparative assessment of satellite images spectral characteristics in identifying the different levels of soil salinization using machine learning techniques in Google Earth Engine
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing salt-affected land (SAL) remains a major challenge worldwide, especially in developing countries due to limited data availability. The development of remote sensing (RS) digital satellite data and their spectral characteristics pave the way to assess soil salinity. A comparative assessment has been carried out between two different spatial resolution satellite images to find out the most suitable satellite image for assessing soil salinity. Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data of 2020 were imported from Google Earth Engine (GEE) data catalog. Spectral indices of vegetation (Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices, Enhanced Vegetation Indices, Soil Adjusted Vegetation Indices, Generalized Difference Vegetation Index) and soil salinity (Normalized Difference Salinity Index, Canopy Response Salinity Index, Salinity Index (SI), SI-I, SI-II, SI-III, Salinity index 1 (SI1), SI2, SI3, SI4, SI5) were calculated. The Random Forest model was used for the analysis. Collected soil samples' electrical conductivity values were used to train and validate the model. 70% of the soil samples were used for model training and 30% for validation. The result shows Sentinel-2 is more capable of detecting saline soil regions compared to Landsat-8. Based on 5-fold cross-validation, the overall accuracy of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 were assessed as 98.31% and 97.19%. The total SAL area using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 were 12,446 ha and 13,225 ha respectively. The study showed the effectiveness of RS techniques to detect the SALs in different spatial resolutions, which can help to evaluate unproductive land and its management at the state or regional level for the creation of alternative livelihood options.

TI  - Separating soil evaporation from vegetation transpiration by remotely sensed one-phase and two-phase trapezoids
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Partition of land surface evapotranspiration (ET) into soil evaporation (ETsoil) and vegetation transpiration (ETveg) is of great significance for scheduling agricultural irrigation, improving water-use efficiency of crop, and managing water resources. This study made a comprehensive evaluation of one-phase and two-phase surface temperature versus fractional vegetation cover trapezoids in the separation of soil evaporation from vegetation transpiration through analytical deductions and model applications, with surface temperatures at four endmembers determined from the layered approach and the patch approach. The two trapezoids were tested on the MODIS data during June to September in 2012 at Daman superstation in Northwest China. The trapezoidestimated ratios of transpiration to total ET (ETveg/ET) were intercompared with the ETveg/ET from five typical partitioning methods, namely, the stable isotope-method, the underlying water-use efficiency (uWUE) method, the transpiration estimation algorithm (TEA), the Pe ' rez-Priego method, and the Wei method. Results showed that: 1) The two-phase trapezoid integrated with the layered approach and the one-phase trapezoid integrated with the layered approach performed the best and worst with root-mean-square errors of 52.6 W/m2 and 78.6 W/m2, respectively, when the estimated total ET was validated against the Bowen Ratio corrected eddy covariance measurements. 2) The five partitioning methods produced largely different ETveg/ET, with the highest values from the TEA method and the lowest values from the Pe ' rez-Priego method. 3) The estimated vegetation transpiration and ETveg/ET by the two-phase trapezoid were generally higher than those by the one-phase trapezoid. 4) In the intercomparison of ETveg/ET, the layered approach agreed better with the five partitioning methods than the patch approach. 5) The two-phase trapezoid integrated with the layered approach overall produced the most consistent estimates of ETveg/ET with those from the five partitioning methods, with the lowest bias varying between -30.9% and 8.7% and root-mean-square differences varying between 16.8% and 36.8%. In summary, the two-phase trapezoid is theoretically more rational and appears to outperform the onephase trapezoid. This study is beneficial for a better understanding of the differences, similarities, advantages and weaknesses of the one-phase and two-phase trapezoids in the partition of total ET to its soil and vegetation components.

TI  - Quality control based Chlorophyll-a estimation with two-band and three-band algorithms using Sentinel-2 MSI data in a complex inland lake, China
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of Chlorophyll-a concentration remains challenging for inland waters owing to the optical complexity. Hence, a quality control-based Chlorophyll-a retrieval approach was proposed for the Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument. Two algorithms were selected: 2-band algorithm, which is suitable for extremely turbid waters, and improved 3-band algorithm designed for moderately turbid waters. Two scatter plots between Rrs560/Rrs490 and Rrs412/Rrs443 and between Rrs560/Rrs490 and Rrs560 were generated to determine boundary lines of the quality control test for the two selected algorithms. The quality control test was calibrated using 188 groups of field data collected from Daihai Lake. Results show that the two selected algorithms were considerably improved after the quality control test. The retrieval of Chlorophyll-a concentration was further enhanced by integrating the improved algorithms. The quality control test was also evaluated against twelve Sentinel-2 images. The integrated algorithm was found to be suitable for most areas in Daihai Lake.

TI  - Associations between Google Street View-derived urban greenspace metrics and air pollution measured using a distributed sensor network
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - With urbanisation occurring at an unprecedented rate worldwide, there is an urgent need to address air pollution-related health risks in urban areas. Although urban greenspace presents an opportunity to balance those risks, little research investigates the association between urban greenspace and air pollution. As such, in this first-of-a-kind study, we examined associations between street-level urban greenspace and air pollution metrics at multiple spatial scales using largescale Information Communications Technology (ICT) derived environmental datasets in an urban area. Urban greenspace was modelled using Google Street View images and computer vision methods in high spatial resolution and termed the Green View Index (GVI). Another greenspace metric, the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, was quantified using Landsat satellite imagery and computational algorithms. Particulate matter (PM) air pollution of varying size fractions (PM2.5, PM10, PM1) was measured using a distributed network of air pollution sensors. Higher levels of urban greenspace were associated with decreases in PM air pollution. For example, an interquartile range (5.44) increase in GVI, within a buffer radius of 2000m around air pollution sensors, was significantly (p<0.01) associated with a 1.94 mu g/m3 [95% Confidence Interval:-3.03,-0.85] decrease in PM2.5. The findings will inform the planning and design of smart, sustainable and healthy future cities.

TI  - Improvement of spatial-temporal resolution of aerosol profile by using multi-source satellite data over the Persian Gulf
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing observations have enormous advantages in aerosol studies since aerosols' space and time variation. MODIS and CALIOP are two independent instruments with different design principles that provide aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals and scan the same points on the Earth's surface within a 2-min interval. Due to predefined aerosol models and fixed vertical profiles in the MODIS algorithm and AOD CALIOP resolu-tion, MODIS and CALIOP cannot give suitable spatial-temporal coverage in related studies. This paper proposes a method based on Bayesian networks to retrieve the AODs by the synergy of CALIOP and MODIS in two vertical layers, 1.5 and 3 km. We applied the Bayesian network for three days in 2018 over the Persian Gulf. The overall analyses reveal that estimated AOD by the seasonal networks correlates with obtained retrieval CALIOP AODs. The correlation values, 0.94 and 0.84, are obtained for the first layer in the summer and winter. These values for the second layer are 0.88 and 0.82. The observed differences in the estimated AOD with the actual measured AOD values and the overall correlation results demonstrate that the proposed networks are sufficient to provide accurate AODs in the two, 1.5, and 3 km vertical layers. According to the experimental results, the layering MAIAC AOD product becomes more suitable for monitoring and studying aerosol phenomena by applying the proposed networks.

TI  - Using drone mapping to evaluate error of plot-based field surveys and its effects on moderate spatial resolution remote sensing retrieval of lichen cover
T2  - ARCTIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Effective plot-based field sampling involves a trade-off between implementation efficiency and sample error. Optimal field sampling therefore requires quantifying the sample error under various sampling designs. For remote sensing applications, it is also important to understand how field sample error and training sample size (the number of pixels) affect the retrieval of surface properties. In this research, drone imagery was used to simulate field plots and investigate plot sampling error for forage lichen cover in relation to plot size, number of plots, and sampling strategy. The effect of this error on remote sensing based lichen cover retrieval was evaluated using varying training sampling sizes in two different study regions in northern Canada. Results showed that cover with high spatial variability increased the number of plots or plot size required to achieve a specified level of error. For lichen cover retrieval at moderate spatial resolution (10-30 m), field sampling (plot size and number of plots) did not have as significant of an effect as regional differences (spectral separability of cover types), sensor, and the number of pixels used for model training. This plot simulation approach using drone images can be applied to other surface properties and regions to provide field sampling guidance.

TI  - Measurement of surface deformation related to the December 2018 Mt. Etna eruption using time-series interferometry and magma modeling for hazard zone mapping
T2  - GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mount Etna has erupted several times since it was first formed. Recently, Mount Etna began erupting again over 24-27 December 2018. Because it erupts frequently, Mount Etna should be observed on a frequent basis. From June 2018 to October 2019, 34 and 56 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images were acquired from the ascending and descending tracks of the Sentinel-1 satellite, respectively. We employed the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS) and a refined small baseline subset (SBAS) InSAR method to produce a surface deformation time-series map. In the time-series analysis, the phase signal remained unaltered with time. The Okada model was then applied to the result to generate a modeled interferogram, and the Q-LavHA program was run to generate a lava flow prediction model. A direct comparison of the results showed that Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI)-StaMPS and the refined SBAS technique were comparable in terms of the displacement pattern, with slightly different velocity values obtained for individual points. In particular, a velocity range of -25 to 21 cm/yr was obtained from PSI-StaMPS, whereas a range of -30 to 25 cm/yr was obtained from the refined SBAS method. Upon computation of the vertical and east-west displacement components based on ascending and descending track data using both methods, deformation velocities of 51.5 and 52.5 cm/yr in the westerly direction on the western flank of Mount Etna were obtained from PSI-StaMPS and the refined SBAS method, respectively, whereas on the eastern flank, deformation toward the east was estimated to occur at a velocity of 50.1 or 54.2 cm/yr, respectively. PSI-StaMPS estimated a vertical deformation velocity of -5.3 to 18.3 cm/yr, whereas the refined SBAS method produced a velocity range of approximately -7 to 19 cm/yr. The interferogram obtained via Okada modeling showed two fault sources in the 2018 Mount Etna eruption and a total volume change of approximately 12.39 x 10(6) m(3). From the modeling results, a lava flow prediction model was generated using the Q-LavHA program. The approaches described in this study can be used by government officials, authorities, and other decision-makers to monitor and assess the risk of volcanic activity in the region.

TI  - An automated prediction of remote sensing data of Queensland-Australia for flood and wildfire susceptibility using BISSOA-DBMLA scheme
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In past few decades, there was a tremendous enhancement in natural disaster and their effects on economy and population. An adverse events like floods, wildfires, cyclones, earthquakes, tsunamis, etc., are regarded as a natural disaster once it strikes the vulnerable population areas. An early tracking of susceptibility areas and immediate tracking of affected areas might help in facilitating rescue and early warnings to the public. To achieve autonomous natural disaster prediction, this paper makes use of current developments in remote sensing, which speed up the availability of aerial/satellite data and are reinforced by progress in the computing sector. The aerial/satellite imageries are employed for acquiring the data from areas of Queensland-Australia that are more prone to natural disaster in an eagle-eye perspective. Since there were several techniques employed so far for the automatic prediction of natural disaster susceptibilities, there were some limitations like reduced rate of accuracy and so on. So as to overcome these limitations, deep learning based automated process is employed for predicting the natural disaster areas and probability of event occurrences. The main intention of the work is to detect the natural disaster occurrence from the sensed data which aids in providing warning to public and to safeguard them by taking necessary actions. Initially, remote sensing data is pre-processed and the features are extracted using Adaptive linear Internal embedding algorithm-based feature extraction (ALIE-FE). The extracted features are selected using Recursive Wrapper-based feature subset selection. To estimate best fitness function and to enhance the prediction accuracy, the optimization process is carried using Bio-Inspired Squirrel Search Optimization algorithm (BI-SSOA). Finally, the classification is carried by means of Deep learning based Multi-layer Alex Net classifier (DBMLA) approach. The simulation is carried and the outcomes attained are estimated for predicting flood susceptibility and wildfire susceptibility. The proposed BISSOA-DBMLA offers sensitivity of 98%, specificity of 99%, and TSS of 97%. The proposed system offers 98.99% classification accuracy. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, TSS, and area under the curve (AUC) are used to evaluate the efficacy of the suggested system in light of the achieved results from other approaches. To demonstrate the efficacy of the suggested mechanism, the achieved results are compared with those of current approaches.

T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Seagrass beds are essential habitats in coastal ecosystems, providing valuable ecosystem services, but are threatened by various climate change and human activities. Seagrass monitoring by remote sensing have been conducted over past decades using satellite and aerial images, which have low resolution to analyze changes in the composition of different seagrass species in the meadows. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have allowed us to obtain much higher resolution images, which is promising in observing fine-scale changes in seagrass species composition. Furthermore, image processing techniques based on deep learning can be applied to the discrimination of seagrass species that were difficult based only on color variation. In this study, we conducted mapping of a multispecific seagrass bed in Saroma-ko Lagoon, Hokkaido, Japan, and compared the accuracy of the three discrimination methods of seagrass bed areas and species composition, i.e., pixel-based classification, object-based classification, and the application of deep neural network.Methods: We set five benthic classes, two seagrass species (Zostera marina and Z. japonica), brown and green macroalgae, and no vegetation for creating a benthic cover map. High-resolution images by UAV photography enabled us to produce a map at fine scales (<1 cm resolution).Results: The application of a deep neural network successfully classified the two seagrass species. The accuracy of seagrass bed classification was the highest (82%) when the deep neural network was applied.Conclusion: Our results highlighted that a combination of UAV mapping and deep learning could help monitor the spatial extent of seagrass beds and classify their species composition at very fine scales.

TI  - Mapping water clarity in North American lakes and reservoirs using Landsat images on the GEE platform with the RGRB model
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes and reservoirs provide important ecosystem services that support human welfare and socio-economic activities. However, in many world regions, the ecological integrity of lakes and reservoirs is threatened by human perturbations and climate change. The Secchi disk depth (SDD) is a widely-used proxy representing the trophic status of lakes and reservoirs and can be retrieved from remote sensing data. Despite their potential for large-scale (regional, global) and long-term lake and reservoir water clarity assessment, the transferability of remote sensing-based models has been a major limitation. In this study, we assembled in situ SDD in lakes and reservoirs across North America (NA) from five different sources. We identified a subset of 3235 samples collected within +/- 7 days of a Landsat satellite overpass. Relationships between various spectral index models calculated from Landsat top-of-atmosphere reflectance and in situ SDD were analyzed. A model based on Landsat blue/green plus blue/red ratios (denoted as RGRB) was selected to retrieve the SDD of all NA lakes and reser-voirs. The RGRB model performed well during calibration (R-2 = 0.81) and validation (R-2 = 0.78, MAPE = 30.85 %). This model also exhibited stable and reliable performances regardless of the Landsat sensors (TM, ETM+, and OLI), despite spectral configuration differences among these sensors. RGRB was implemented to generate SDD maps for all lakes and reservoirs (water surface area >= 1 ha) across NA in 2019. More than 2.9 million lakes and reservoirs were mapped with Landsat OLI images, resulting in an average SDD of 3.84 +/- 1.77 m. A strong positive relationship between average SDD and log-transformed water surface area (R-2 = 0.80, p < 0.001) indicated that large lakes and reservoirs tend to be more transparent than small ones. Latitudinal variations were found in the water clarity gradient, with maximum SDD recorded at the 35 degrees N-60 degrees N latitude and lower SDD at the 10 degrees N-30 degrees N latitude. This model can be implemented using the Google Earth Engine platform to derive SDD for NA lakes and reservoirs at annual or even seasonal time steps to assess water eutrophication variation in both time and space at the continental scale.

TI  - Comparison of machine learning models for predicting the risk of breast cancer- related lymphedema in Chinese women
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Predictive models for the occurrence of cancer symptoms by using machine learning (ML) algorithms could be used to aid clinical decision-making in order to enhance the quality of cancer care. This study aimed to develop and validate a selection of classification models that used ML algorithms to predict the occurrence of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) among Chinese women. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of consecutive cases that had been diagnosed with breast cancer, stages I-IV. Forty-eight variables were grouped into five feature sets. Five classification models with ML algorithms were developed, and the models' performance and the variables' relative importance were assessed accordingly. Results: Of 370 eligible female participants, 91 had BCRL (24.6%). The mean age of this study sample was 49.89 (SD = 7.45). All participants had had breast cancer surgery, and more than half of them had had a modified radical mastectomy (n = 206, 55.5%). The mean follow-up time after breast cancer surgery was 28.73 months (SD =11.71). Most of the tumors were either stage I (n =49, 31.2%) or stage II (n = 252, 68.1%). More than half of the sample had had postoperative chemotherapy (n = 227, 61.4%). Overall, the logistic regression model achieved the best performance in terms of accuracy (91.6%), precision (82.1%), and recall (91.4%) for BCRL. Although this study included 48 predicting variables, we found that the five models required only 22 variables to achieve predictive performance. The most important variable was the number of positive lymph nodes, followed in descending order by the BCRL occurring on the same side as the surgery, a history of sentinel lymph node biopsy, a dietary preference for meat and fried food, and an exercise frequency of less than three times per week. These factors were the most influential predictors for enhancing the ML models' performance.Conclusions: This study found that in the ML training dataset, the multilayer perceptron model and the logistic regression model were the best discrimination models for predicting the outcome of BCRL, and the k-nearest neighbors and support vector machine models demonstrated good calibration performance in the ML validation dataset. Future research will need to use large-sample datasets to establish a more robust ML model for predicting BCRL deeply and reliably.

TI  - Mining the drivers of forest cover change in the upper Indus Valley, high Asia region from 1990 to 2020
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The high Asia region is the water tower for many river valleys in East and South Asia, which has vital significance for regional environmental conservation and ecological security. In the upper Indus Valley, the role of forests is often overlooked, and their loss will lead to a reduction in ecological services, such as water conservation and disaster prevention, and will indirectly affect the water and food security of 230 million people in South Asia. Quantifying the drivers of forest cover change is a prerequisite for ensuring sustainable development in the upper Indus Valley. This study used forest disturbance and recovery data, history fire data, topographic data, and land use data to construct a decision tree model for mining the of drivers of forest cover change. Classification of the drivers of forest disturbance and recovery was achieved in the upper Indus Valley. The results showed that (1) disturbance mainly occurred in the central region of the upper Indus Valley, where forest degradation was the main driver accounting for 69.0%, and agricultural transfer was the secondary driver accounting for 21.6%; commercial cultivation and deforestation drivers both disturbed about 4% of the area, and fire, human activities, and natural hazards disturbed only a small area of forest accounting for less than 1%; (2) the spatial distribution of recovery was basically consistent with the disturbance, with natural recovery being the main driver of forest recovery, accounting for 60.1%, and artificial recovery being the secondary driver, accounting for 39.9%; (3) relevant governance measures or forest conversation policies in the Indus Valley were recommended, such as increasing the supply of non-biomass energy, controlling the scale of livestock, and establishing friendly land use policies, to maintain the growth and balance of forest area and quality.

TI  - Temperature dependent behaviors of electro-elastic properties of NdCa4O(BO3)3 crystal with monoclinic symmetry
T2  - JOURNAL OF RARE EARTHS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rare-earth calcium oxyborate crystals (RECa4O(BO3)3, RECOB, RE: rare-earth elements) are a kind of multifunctional crystal materials. In this work, the temperature dependent behaviors of the electro-elastic constants of NdCOB crystal were investigated over the temperature range of-80-200 degrees C, and their temperature coefficients were evaluated. It is found that NdCOB crystal possesses minimal variation of relative dielectric permittivities (<3%). The temperature coefficient of frequency for ZY cut with width shear vibration mode is in the order of 0.07 x 10-4/degrees C. The temperature coefficients of the elastic compliances are obtained to be in the range of-33.0 x 10-4/degrees C-32.2 x 10-4/degrees C. Particularly, the s44 and s66 were found to show low temperature coefficients of the elastic compliances, i.e. 1.0 x 10-4/degrees C and-0.4 x 10-4/degrees C, respectively, indicating the existence of zero temperature coefficient of frequency crystal cut. Furthermore, the electromechanical coupling factors and piezoelectric coefficients as a function of temperature were studied. The electromechanical coupling factor k26 and piezoelectric co-efficient d26 are determined to be-30.8% and-15.2 pC/N at room temperature, respectively. The large piezoelectric response and zero temperature coefficient of frequency indicate the potential usage of NdCOB crystal for piezoelectric frequency devices over a wide temperature range.(c) 2021 Chinese Society of Rare Earths.

TI  - An optimal method for validating satellite-derived land surface phenology using in-situ observations from national phenology networks
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based land surface phenology (LSP) products play an important role in understanding atmosphere-vegetation carbon and energy exchanges. These products have been widely calculated from various satellite observations from local to global scales. However, the quality and accuracy of LSP products are often poorly quantified due to spatial mismatch between satellite observed pixels and in-situ observations. In the present study, we demonstrate an optimal algorithm leveraging the scalability, consistency, and representativeness of rich in-situ observations from national phenology networks to validate LSP products. Specifically, we demon-strate two approaches for validating the phenological timing of greenup onset in the operational Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) LSP product developed at NASA using in-situ observations collected from the Pan European Phenological database (PEP725, 9664 site-years) and the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN, 3144 site-years) spanning 2013-2020. The first approach assumes that in-situ data contain observations of phenological transitions (e.g., leaf-out) that are directly comparable with satellite detections. Accordingly, in-situ data were aggregated using four upscaling methods (mean, median, 30th percentile, and minimum bias) to directly compare with VIIRS LSP. The second approach assumes that species-specific phenological timing in in-situ data is basically impossible to spatially reconcile VIIRS LSP, but phenological events in a local area are driven by the same or very similar weather conditions. Therefore, interannual variations and long-term trends were applied to compare VIIRS LSP with in-situ data. The result shows first that the 30th percentile method is more promising in aggregating in-situ observations than the commonly used mean method. Second, direct comparison indicates that VIIRS greenup onset has a mean absolute difference of 13.9 +/- 9.8 days with PEP725 in-situ observations and 12.3 +/- 10.9 days with USA-NPN observations in well-selected deciduous forest sites. Third, the interannual comparison reveals that VIIRS greenup onset exhibits the same directions of multi-year anomalies and long-term trends as those of both PEP725 and USA-NPN observations in over 70% of sample sites. These findings improve our understanding of the scale mismatch and sample representativeness of species-specific phenology and the uncertainties of long-term LSP detections from remote sensing data.

TI  - Enhanced dust emission following large wildfires due to vegetation disturbance
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large wildfires reduce vegetation cover and soil moisture, leaving the temporally degraded landscapes an emergent source of dust emission. However, the global extent of post-fire dust events and their influencing factors remain unexplored. Using satellite measurements of active fires, aerosol abundance, vegetation cover and soil moisture from 2003 to 2020, here we show that 54% of the examined similar to 150,000 global large wildfires are followed by enhanced dust emission, producing substantial dust loadings for days to weeks over normally dust-free regions. The occurrence and duration of post-fire dust emission is controlled primarily by the extent of precedent wildfires and resultant vegetation anomalies and modulated secondarily by pre-fire drought conditions. The intensifying wildfires and drying soils during the studying period have made post-fire dust events one day longer, especially over extratropical forests and grasslands. With the predicted intensification of regional wildfires and concurrent droughts in the upcoming decades, our results indicate a future enhancement of sequential fire and dust extremes and their societal and ecological impacts.

TI  - Investigating the long-term trends in aerosol optical depth and its association with meteorological parameters and enhanced vegetation index over Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) provides useful information on particulate matter pollution at both regional and global levels. In this study, the long-term datasets of aerosols, meteorological parameters, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were used from September 2002 to December 2021 over Turkey. This study examined the spatiotemporal distribution of aerosols and their association with meteorological parameters (temperature (Temp), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS)), and EVI over Turkey from 2002 to 2021. Moreover, this study also performed a comparison of AOD retrieved from Aqua with other satellites (Terra, SeaWiFS, and MISR) and ground-based (AERONET) products. The higher mean seasonal AOD (> 0.3) was observed over Southeastern Anatolia Region due to the dust transport from the Saharan Desert and Arabian Peninsula. Moreover, AOD was positively correlated with Temp and WS in the east of Turkey, while negative correlations were observed in the coastal regions. The correlation between AOD and RH was also observed negative in most parts of Turkey. Furthermore, in the coastal region, the correlation between AOD and EVI was found to be positive, whereas a negative correlation was seen over less vegetative areas. The multi-seasonal AOD averages were calculated as 0.187, 0.183, 0.138, and 0.104 for the spring, summer, autumn, and winter seasons, respectively. The most important result of this study is the regional differences in AOD over Turkey. For new studies, AOD should be observed separately for coastal areas and the eastern part of Turkey.

TI  - Mapping Chinese annual gross primary productivity with eddy covariance measurements and machine learning
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual gross primary productivity (AGPP) is the basis for grain production and terrestrial carbon sequestration. Map-ping regional AGPP from site measurements provides methodological support for analysing AGPP spatiotemporal var-iations thereby ensures regional food security and mitigates climate change. Based on 641 site-year eddy covariance measuring AGPP from China, we built an AGPP mapping scheme based on its formation and selected the optimal map-ping way, which was conducted through analysing the predicting performances of divergent mapping tools, variable combinations, and mapping approaches in predicting observed AGPP variations. The reasonability of the selected op-timal scheme was confirmed by assessing the consistency between its generating AGPP and previous products in spa-tiotemporal variations and total amount. Random forest regression tree explained 85 % of observed AGPP variations, outperforming other machine learning algorithms and classical statistical methods. Variable combinations containing climate, soil, and biological factors showed superior performance to other variable combinations. Mapping AGPP through predicting AGPP per leaf area (PAGPP) explained 86 % of AGPP variations, which was superior to other ap-proaches. The optimal scheme was thus using a random forest regression tree, combining climate, soil, and biological variables, and predicting PAGPP. The optimal scheme generating AGPP of Chinese terrestrial ecosystems decreased from southeast to northwest, which was highly consistent with previous products. The interannual trend and interan-nual variation of our generating AGPP showed a decreasing trend from east to west and from southeast to northwest, respectively, which was consistent with data-oriented products. The mean total amount of generated AGPP was 7.03 +/- 0.45 PgC yr-1 falling into the range of previous works. Considering the consistency between the generated AGPP and previous products, our optimal mapping way was suitable for mapping AGPP from site measurements. Our results provided a methodological support for mapping regional AGPP and other fluxes.

TI  - Estimation of soil erosion in indo-gangetic region using revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model and geospatial technology
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the effect on land degradation, soil fertility, and agricultural production, the soil erosion becomes one of the major environmental problems and concerning issues of the world in the twenty-first century. Thus the investigation of soil erosion loss and risk is very crucial. The present study aims to estimate the potential and actual soil erosion in Haryana (covering a part of Indo-Gangetic regions) using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model integrated with geospatial technology. Input datasets for RUSLE model were taken from various sources includes rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K), topographic factor (LS), cover management factor (C), and support practice (P) and processed in GIS software platform. The values for these parameters were ranging from 160 to 683, 0.000 to 0.065, 0.0 to 232, 0 to 0.95, and 0.55 to 1 respectively. An updated LULC were mapped using Landsat-8 satellite data of 2021, with an overall accuracy of 84.89% (Kappa = 0.82) covering 8 categories. The erosion rates were varying from 0 to 130 t ha(-1) y(-1) for both the actual and potential soil erosion. A total of 19,289,370 t y(-1) soil erosion was estimated in the State. Most of the State area (99.27%) was under the low-erosion zone (0-5 t ha(-1) y(-1)) due to flat terrain, uniform C factor, and lower P values. The obtained results also reveal that the high/extreme severe soil erosion is spread in the northwest, northern, and eastern parts of Haryana, especially in the hills and riverine areas of Yamuna and Ghaggar watersheds (20-130 t ha(-1) y(-1)) due to high magnitude of R, K, and C. The RUSLE model integrated with geospatial technology provides a quantitative approach to estimate soil erosion, which can be applicable for a large landscape and supports the implementation of conservation and management planning at the local and regional levels.

TI  - Improving Dynamic Vegetation Modeling in Noah-MP by Parameter Optimization and Data Assimilation Over China's Loess Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate modeling of vegetation dynamics is needed to improve our understanding of and ability to predict the impacts of vegetation changes on terrestrial water-energy-carbon cycles. Parameter optimization (PO) and data assimilation (DA) are widely used to improve the performance of dynamic vegetation modules in land surface models (LSMs). However, their effectiveness is unclear. Here we analyze their impacts on the performance of the dynamic vegetation module of the Noah with multiparameterization options (Noah-MP) LSM over the Chinese Loess Plateau, which is an ideal study case because it is a large region that has undergone dramatic vegetation change. We first optimize these parameters that strongly affect the predicted vegetation dynamics based on the results of sensitivity analysis using PO. In addition, we evaluate the effect of DA by assimilating leaf area index (LAI) remote sensing data into Noah-MP without PO. Finally, we investigate the effect of applying PO and DA together. PO increases the predicted rates of carbon assimilation and turnover and thus reduces the underestimation of LAI and the lag in vegetation seasonality. DA has a weaker impact than PO: it only reduces the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predicted LAI in around 49.76% of the studied region and is mainly beneficial in the growing phase. Combining PO and DA compensate the limitations of each other, and gives the most significant reduction in RMSE (median: -0.24 m(2)/m(2)) and increase in R-2 (+0.44). The improved vegetation dynamics with different optimization methods thus improve the modeling of water and carbon cycle processes.

TI  - Monitoring Evolution of Coastline along Mto Tamamba Delta in Kenya North Coast Using Satellite Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal zones are the epicenter of economic activities in most developing countries in the world hence are bound to change. With advancement in technology, monitoring degradation of coastal zones using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) has become a critical subject for scientific research. RS refers to the process of detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at a distance (typically from satellite or aircraft) while GIS is a system that creates, manages, analyzes, and maps all types of data. This paper reports an evolving Kenyan coastline over the past three decades using RS and GIS. Literature on chronological evolution and its impacts along this coastline is scanty and it is therefore envisaged that this work will instigate more enquiry into factors that were involved in landscape formation along the Kenyan coast. Prior reports indicate that research work done along this coastline were by field survey. We report a prograding beach on Mto Tamamba delta as displayed by multispectral Landsat imagery. The marine ecosystems, riparian communities and tourism industry are facing a major threat. The finding establishes hydrodynamic effects and human influence as key contributors of this menace. This study is aimed at detecting the coastline change using multispectral Landsat images from the years 1990 to 2021. For this purpose, coastlines belonging to these years were drawn numerically with the aid of GIS and RS on ENVI 5.3 software. We utilized maximum likelihood algorithm to categorize the images, and employed a time series methodology on classified endmembers to infer the presence of erosion and accretion. Using the image subset technique, areas prone to erosion and accretion within the coastal datum were identified and cut. The patterns of spatiotemporal trend of these endmembers were effectively employed to corroborate these findings. Change in distribution of endmembers over the 31 years' period was assessed using thematic change technique; an approach not previously applied in this study area. From the classified Mto Tamamba image, the pixel coverage area for each endmember was extracted. Validation using field campaign data gave an overall accuracy of 84% and kappa coefficient of 0.799. Taking into account that, the traditional methods of monitoring land degradation over a large area are time consuming and expensive; remote sensing data used in this study has offered alternatively cheap, consistent, reliable and retrievable data.

TI  - Simulation of Sentinel-1A observations and constraint of water cloud model at the regional scale using a discrete scattering model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective calibration of microwave scattering model and accurate simulation of backscattering coefficient (sigma o) at the regional scale are essential for improving soil moisture retrieval based on active microwave remote sensing. This study investigates the potential of simulating the Sentinel-1A observations and constraining the coefficients of the water cloud model (WCM) at the regional scale based on a theoretical microwave scattering model named Tor Vergata model. The Tor Vergata discrete scattering model is firstly calibrated at both site-and regional-scale to find a single set of model parameters for capturing the Sentinel-1A observations at the regional scale. Sub-sequently, the coupled WCM and Oh model is calibrated at the regional scale based on three strategies, i.e., using either the calibrated Tor Vergata simulations or the Sentinel-1A observations, or with the assumption that the sigma o only comes from the vegetation contribution during the peak growth period. The investigation is conducted in a Tibetan meadow ecosystem configured with a long-term regional-scale soil moisture monitoring network. The results show the optimized parameter values obtained for the Tor Vergata model are consistent with each other based on both calibration methods, leading to comparable performances in simulating well the Sentinel-1A observations and scattering components. These results demonstrate the transferability of model parameters under similar land condition and the feasibility of simulating the regional-scale sigma o based on a single set of model parameters using the Tor Vergata model. The sigma o simulated by the coupled WCM and Oh model based on the three calibration strategies are comparable to each other and well agree with the calibrated Tor Vergata simulations as well as Sentinel-1A observations. However, the traditional calibration method using the Sentinel-1A observations tends to produce unreasonable WCM coefficients and thus unrealistic simulation of vegetation transmissivity. Above deficiencies are largely addressed by other two calibration strategies, whereby the first one preserves the physical mechanism of the Tor Vergata model and reduces the computation cost, and the assumption made by the other strategy may provide a new sight to solve the unknown WCM coefficients. These positive results warrant further investigation for developing new parameterization of WCM to improve soil moisture retrieval at the regional scale based on active microwave remote sensing.

TI  - Interpretation of hydrothermal alteration and structural framework of the Huize Pb-Zn deposit, SW China, using Sentinel-2, ASTER, and Gaofen-5 satellite data: Implications for Pb-Zn exploration
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Huize Pb-Zn deposit is one of the largest and high-grade Pb-Zn deposits in the world, containing more than 7 Mt Pb and Zn reserves at an ore grade of similar to 30-35 % Pb + Zn. Therefore, brownfield exploration of additional Pb and Zn orebodies at Huize Pb-Zn deposit is of high priority. Hydrothermal alteration minerals and structural features are typically associated with Pb-Zn mineralization, which can be identified quickly and economically using a multi-source remote sensing satellite dataset. In this study, Sentinel-2, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and Gaofen-5 (GF-5) satellite remote sensing imagery were employed for brownfield exploration of additional Pb-Zn orebodies in the Huize Pb-Zn deposit. The Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing imagery was used to interpret the structure and map oxides/hydroxides by implementing the band ratio (BR) and principal components analysis (PCA) method; the ASTER satellite data were applied to map argillic, quartz, and carbonate hydrothermal alteration minerals using the PCA method; the GF-5 satellite data were utilized to map hematite, kaolinite, calcite, and dolomite minerals by the mixture tuned matched filtering (MTMF) method; and the mapped hydrothermal alteration information was verified by field reconnaissance and laboratory analysis. Finally, remote sensing geological exploration characteristics of the Huize Pb-Zn deposit were summarized by comprehensively analyzing the hydrothermal alteration minerals and structural characteristics, and three new brownfield exploration target zones of Pb-Zn mineralization were delineated. The study can provide a reference for the brownfields exploration in the vicinity of an existing Pb-Zn deposit around the world.

TI  - Original Malignant breast myoepithelioma: A systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY OBSTETRICS AND HUMAN REPRODUCTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: We performed a systematic review in order to describe the clinical presentation, therapeutic man-agement and outcomes of malignant myoepitelioma of the breast.Search Strategy: A systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE references from January 1980 to Marsh 2020 was performed. We included articles that reported cases of malignant breast myoepithelioma. Data from eli-gible studies were independently extracted onto standardized forms by two reviewers.Results: 31 articles including 47 cases of malignant breast myoepithelioma and 3 other unpublished cases man-aged in our establishment were included in this systematic review. The average age at diagnosis was 60.7 years old [range 30-81]. The average size of the tumor was 46mm [range 10-230]. 30 patients had a partial mastec-tomy and 18 a total mastectomy. Only 15% of patient (7/48) had an axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy of whom one was positive. 33% of patients (16/48) had an axillary lymph node dissection which was positive for one patient. 19% (n=9) had adjuvant radiotherapy and 15% (n=7) had adjuvant chemotherapy. 33% (n=10) of patients with partial mastectomy had at least one recurrence, versus 5.5% (n=1) after a total mastectomy. The average time between the diagnosis and the first recurrence was 25.4 months [range: 1-50]. 64% (n=7) had a second partial mastectomy and only 18% (n=2) had a total mastectomy. 27% of patient had chemotherapy after their first recurrence and 27% had radiotherapy if it was not received in first line treatment. 40% (n=4/10) of patients with partial mastectomy who recurred have had at least 2 breast recurrences. 28% (n=14) of all patients had distant metastases. 20% of patients (n=10) died whose 80% (n=8) had distant metastatic disease. Conclusions: This systematic review provided a precise summary of the clinical characteristics and treatment of patients presenting with Malignant breast myoepithelioma in the past 40 years. We anticipate that these results will help inform current investigations and treatment. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Estimating crop coefficients and actual evapotranspiration in citrus orchards with sporadic cover weeds based on ground and remote sensing data
T2  - IRRIGATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimations of actual crop evapotranspiration are of utmost importance to evaluate crop water requirements and to optimize water use efficiency. At this aim, coupling simple agro-hydrological models, such as the well-known FAO-56 model, with remote observations of the land surface could represent an easy-to-use tool to identify biophysical parameters of vegetation, such as the crop coefficient K-c under the actual field conditions and to estimate actual crop evapotranspiration. This paper intends, therefore, to propose an operational procedure to evaluate the spatio-temporal variability of K-c in a citrus orchard characterized by the sporadic presence of ground weeds, based on micro-meteorological measurements collected on-ground and vegetation indices (VIs) retrieved by the Sentinel-2 sensors. A non-linear K-c(VIs) relationship was identified after assuming that the sum of two VIs, such as the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI, and the normalized difference water index, NDWI, is suitable to represent the spatio-temporal dynamics of the investigated environment, characterized by sparse vegetation and the sporadic presence of spontaneous but transpiring soil weeds, typical of winter seasons and/or periods following events wetting the soil surface. The K-c values obtained in each cell of the Sentinel-2 grid (10 m) were then used as input of the spatially distributed FAO-56 model to estimate the variability of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and the other terms of water balance. The performance of the proposed procedure was finally evaluated by comparing the estimated average soil water content and actual crop evapotranspiration with the corresponding ones measured on-ground. The application of the FAO-56 model indicated that the estimated ETa were characterized by root-mean-square-error, RMSE, and mean bias-error, MBE, of 0.48 and -0.13 mm d(-1) respectively, while the estimated soil water contents, SWC, were characterized by RMSE equal to 0.01 cm(3) cm(-3) and the absence of bias, then confirming that the suggested procedure can produce highly accurate results in terms of dynamics of soil water content and actual crop evapotranspiration under the investigated field conditions.

TI  - Regionalization and Analysis of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> Synergetic Prevention and Control Areas Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Site-based air pollution monitoring data cannot support the regionalization of air pollution prevention and control areas. Faced with this problem, this study proposed a method of regionalizing synergetic prevention and control areas based on multi-source remote sensing data and GIS spatial statistical analysis methods and carried out quantitative analyses of PM2.5 and O-3 air pollution in China from 2015 to 2020. The results showed that there was an obvious decrease in PM2.5 concentrations, and O3concentrations remained stable; PM2.5 pollution mostly occurred in autumn and winter, and O-3 pollution occurred in spring and summer. A significant spatial inconsistency was shown between the change rate of PM2.5 and O-3 concentrations, in which the proportions of PM2.5 decreasing and O-3 increasing, PM2.5 and O-3 both decreasing, PM2.5 and O-3 both increasing, and PM2.5 increasing and O-3 decreasing accounted for 38.34%, 35.12%, 15.24%, and 10.89%, respectively. The results also showed that the boundary of PM2.5 and O-3 synergetic prevention and control areas was dynamic during 2015 and 2020, showing a trend of expanding from 2015 to 2018 and then becoming smaller after 2019. Generally, the scope of PM2.5 and O-3 synergetic prevention and control areas was concentrated in "2+26" cities, Fenwei plain, north of the Yangtze River Delta, and Shandong. In contrast, the regional scopes of "PM2.5 first" and "O-3 first" were relatively stable. Areas of "PM2.5 first" were mainly carried out in Liaoning-Jilin, Hubei-Hunan-Jiangxi, Chengdu-Chongqing, and Taklimakan-Hexi Corridor, whereas "O-3 first" areas were mainly in specific regions of the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta, and surrounding areas of Bohai Bay. Remote sensing-based PM2.5 and O-3 mapping has the advantages of full-coverage and fine spatial simulation, which can support the regionalization of synergetic prevention and control areas and implementation of policies

TI  - Impact of adaptively thinned GOES-16 all-sky radiances in an ensemble Kalman filter based WoFS
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The ability to forecast severe weather events can be improved by assimilating GOES-16 satellite observations into high-resolution convective scale numerical weather prediction models. In this study, multiple sensitivity experiments were performed for four severe weather events that occurred on 7 May, 21 June 2020; and 7, 23 May 2021. Our goal is to assess how the application of data thinning techniques on the GOES-16 all-sky radiance data assimilated by the National Severe Storms Laboratory's ensemble-based Warn-on-Forecast System (WoFS) affect subsequent weather forecasts. A total of three experimental configurations are considered for this analysis: (1) ABI-TH, an adaptive-based data thinning method used in the cloudy region; (2) ABI-ALL, in which all available all-sky radiances were assimilated; and (3) CNTL, a control experiment that used cloud water path (CWP) data but assimilated no radiance data. All three experiments assimilated conventional, radar reflectivity, and radial velocity observations. For each experiment, multiple sensitivity tests are performed to assess the effect of thinning the GOES-16 all-sky radiance data assimilated by the WoFS using an object-based verification method in which model-simulated composite reflectivity and 2-5 km Updraft Helicity (UH) fields were compared to Multi Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) reflectivity and rotation objects. In addition, synthetic satellite images from the WoFS output are generated and compared with the synthetic visible and infrared images from GOES-16. Results show that the ABI-TH approach produced better forecasts relative to ABI-ALL for high-impact weather events. The results from ABI-TH are also similar to results from CWP assimilation (CNTL).

TI  - Proximal and remote sensor data fusion for 3D imaging of infertile and acidic soil
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) and pH affect the condition of soil. To improve soil capability in sugarcane growing areas, Sugar Research Australia introduced the Six-Easy-Steps Nutrient Guidelines based on CEC and pH of topsoil (0-0.3 m). A three-dimensional digital soil mapping (DSM) framework has been used to predict CEC and pH by fitting equal-area splines to four depth intervals (i.e., topsoil, subsurface [0.3-0.6 m), shallow [0.6-0.9 m), and deep subsoil [0.9-1.2 m)) to resample soil data at 0.01 m increments. A single quantile regression forest (QRF) was calibrated to model the relationship between spline-fitted soil data and individual digital data. These included proximal soil sensing (PSS) data such as electromagnetic (EM) induction and gamma-ray (gamma-ray) spectrometry, remote sensing (RS) Sentinel-2 imagery, a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) based digital elevation model (DEM), and soil depth. Various data fusion methods and minimum calibration size have been evaluated, including concatenation and model averaging approaches, namely, simple averaging (SA), Bates-Granger averaging (BGA), Granger-Ramanathan averaging (GRA), and bias-corrected eigenvector averaging (BC-EA). In all cases, an independent validation was used to assess prediction agreement (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient-LCCC) and accuracy (ratio of performance to deviation-RPD). For CEC, gamma-ray (LCCC = 0.82) was the best, with EM (0.78) and Sentinel-2 (0.77) producing similar agreement, whereas DEM (0.64) had worst performance. For pH, EM, gamma-ray, and Sentinel-2 were similar (0.69, 0.73, and 0.77, respectively), and DEM poor (0.48). Optimum results were achieved when PSS, Sentinel-2, and DEM were fused using GRA; CEC agreement (0.88) and accuracy (RPD = 2.14) were strong, while for pH, concatenation had good agreement (0.79) and accuracy (1.59). Neither agreement nor accuracy varied among sample size, with a minimum of 30 (CEC) and 80 (pH) sites necessary (0.4 and 1.1 sampling sites ha(-1), respectively). The final DSM for topsoil CEC and pH, were useful for lime application; the northern fields required 2.5 t ha(-1) of lime, whereas the southern fields required variable rates (4 and 5 t ha(-1)).

TI  - Enhanced all-weather precipitable water vapor retrieval from MODIS near-infrared bands using machine learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Four novel PWV retrieval approaches based on machine learning methods are for the first time developed to estimate all-weather precipitable water vapor (PWV) from near-infrared (NIR) measurements of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. The four retrieval approaches are Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The transmittance, latitude, longitude, elevation, cloud, season, and solar zenith angle information, in association with the MODIS NIR PWV's performance, are utilized. The in-situ one-year PWV data collected in 2017 from 453 Global Positioning System (GPS) sites in Australia and 214 GPS sites in China are utilized as target water vapor estimates for model training. Independent of the 2017 training data, two-year data observed in 2018-2019 in Australia and China are utilized to validate the four models' performance. The results indicate that the retrieval algorithms can greatly improve the PWV retrieval accuracy from MODIS NIR observations under all-weather conditions, reducing the impact of clouds on NIR PWV retrieval. The new all-weather PWV estimates obtain R2 in the range of 0.83 - 0.86, root-mean-square-error (RMSE) in the range of 4.71 mm - 5.28 mm, and mean bias (MB) in the range of 0.18 mm - 0.51 mm, significantly outperforming the official MODIS NIR PWV product (R2 = 0.31, RMSE = 12.03 mm, and MB = -3.04 mm). The reduction in RMSE is 60.85 % for BPNN, 59.68 % for GBDT, 56.69 % for GRNN, and 57.27 % for XGBoost. The new all-weather PWV results show a superior retrieval accuracy compared to the official MODIS NIR confident-clear PWV product, illustrating the effectiveness of the models. This could be because the retrieval models have considered multiple dependence parameters that affect the performance of MODIS-observed NIR PWV. The retrieval algorithms exhibit little spatial or temporal dependence and they can be applied to other regions and periods. This work provides a more accurate way to retrieve all-weather PWV estimates from satellite NIR measurements considering multiple dependence parameters - location, cloud, season, and solar zenith angle information.

TI  - Structural Characteristics of Phytoplankton Communities and Its Relationship with Environmental Factors in a Group of Drinking Water Reservoirs by Water Transmission from Modaomen Waterway in Zhuhai
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Modaomen Waterway is the main outlet of the Pear River system and an important water source for Zhuhai and Macao. The water quality of 13 sampling sites in Modaomen Waterway, phytoplankton, and environmental factors were investigated at 21 sampling sites in 4 drinking water source groups, which transport water from Modaomen Waterway and connect with each other, in August and October of 2021. A total of 73 genera of phytoplankton in eight phyla were identified, with a total of 150 species, most of them belonging to Cyanophyta , Chlorophyta , and Bacillariophyta. The relative abundance of Cyarwphyta was higher than 90% in the DJS and YL reservoirs during flood and dry seasons; Cyanophyta , Chlorophyta , and Bacillariophyta were dominant phyla during different seasons; and their distribution was balanced in the ZXD and ZY reservoirs. The Shannon-Wiener index, Pielous uniformity index, and Margalef richness index showed that the ZY reservoir had the most abundant biodiversity, which indicated the best water quality, followed by the ZXD and YL reservoirs. Conversely, the DJS was the least diverse reservoir for phytoplankton. The PCoA analysis indicated significant differences in plankton structures in ZXD and ZY with the other two reservoirs (P <0. 05 ) , respectively. Redundancy analysis ( RDA) showed that the main environmental factors affecting the distribution of the phytoplankton community were NO3-, TOC, TP, Cl-, and NH4+-N. These results indicated that the phytoplankton community of the four reservoirs were greatly affected by the nutrient salt caused by water transport, which suggested that the water quality of Modaomen Waterway should be improved to increase reservoir water nutrition to ensure the safety of drinking water sources.

TI  - Expansion of Moraine-Dammed Glacial Lakes and Historical GLOF Events in Cordillera Blanca Region of Peruvian Andes
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The dramatic mass loss of Tropical Andean glaciers under the influence of climate change has caused alterations in regional hydrological regimes, including development and expansion of glacial lakes, especially moraine-dammed lakes, supraglacial lakes and ice-dammed lakes. There is a broad consensus on Moraine-Dammed Glacial Lakes (MDGLs) to be commonly understood as potentially most dangerous lakes that can trigger Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs). The GLOF event in that process is expected to negatively impact the downstream communities, agricultural assets and infrastructure. In this study, we have prepared an updated and detailed inventory of MDGLs in the Cordillera Blanca region of the Peruvian Andes. The multi-temporal satellite data (TM, ETM, OLI and Sentinel-2A) was used to analyze the changes in lake area over a period of 40 years from 1980 to 2020. A total of 38 MDGLs (size > 0.05 km(2)) covering an area of 10.30 km(2), and located in the altitudinal zone ranging from 4155 to 4960 masl were identified and mapped. From 1980 (6.59 km(2)) to 2020 (10.3 km(2)), an expansion of 3.7 km(2) (35%) at an annual rate of 0.09 km(2)/year was observed in the lake area. This study also contributes in terms of developing a database of past GLOF events from an extensive literature survey to understand the hazard and disaster profile of the region for the period 1702-2020. A total of 28 GLOF events have been reported in the region which brought devastation to the surrounding communities. We conclude that the region is highly prone to GLOFs as understood from the occurrence of GLOFs in the past as well as from the current scenario of MDGLs.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping with superparamagnetic iron oxide for melanoma: a pilot study in healthy participants to establish an optimal MRI workflow protocol
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Current pre-operative Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) mapping using dual tracing is associated with drawbacks (radiation exposure, logistic challenges). Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) is a non-inferior alternative for SLN mapping in breast cancer patients. Limited research has been performed on SPIO use and pre-operative MRI in melanoma patients to identify SLNs. Methods Healthy participants underwent MRI-scanning pre- and post SPIO-injection during 20 min. Workflow protocols varied in dosage, massage duration, route of administration and injection sites. The first lymph node showing a susceptibility artefact caused by SPIO accumulation was considered as SLN. Results Artefacts were identified in 5/6 participants. Two participants received a 0.5 ml subcutaneous injection and 30-s massage, of which one showed an artefact after one hour. Four participants received a 1.0 ml intracutaneous injection and two-minute massage, leading to artefacts in all participants. All SLNs were observed within five minutes, except after lower limb injection (30 min). Conclusion SPIO and pre-operative MRI-scanning seems to be a promising alternative for SLN visualization in melanoma patients. An intracutaneous injection of 1.0 ml SPIO tracer, followed by a two-minute massage seems to be the most effective technique, simplifying the pre-operative pathway. Result will be used in a larger prospective study with melanoma patients.

TI  - Measuring results of humanitarian action: adapting public health indicators to different contexts
T2  - CONFLICT AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Humanitarian crises represent a significant public health risk factor for affected populations exacerbating mortality, morbidity, disabilities, and reducing access to and quality of health care. Reliable and timely information on the health status of and services provided to crisis-affected populations is crucial to establish public health priorities, mobilize funds, and monitor the performance of humanitarian action. Numerous efforts have contributed to standardizing and presenting timely public health information in humanitarian settings over the last two decades. While the prominence of process and output (rather than outcome and impact) indicators in monitoring frameworks leads to adequate information on resources and activities, health outcomes are rarely measured due to the challenges of measuring them using gold-standard methods that are difficult to implement in humanitarian settings. We argue that challenges in collecting the gold-standard performance measures should not be a rationale for neglecting outcome measures for critical health and nutrition programs in humanitarian emergencies. Alternative indicators or measurement methods that are robust, practical, and feasible in varying contexts should be used in the interim while acknowledging limitations or interpretation constraints. In this paper, we draw from existing literature, expert judgment, and operational experience to propose an approach to adapt public health indicators for measuring performance of the humanitarian response across varied contexts. Contexts were defined in terms of parameters that capture two of the main constraints affecting the capacity to obtain performance information in humanitarian settings: (i) access to population or health facilities; and (ii) availability of resources for measurement. Consequently, 2 x 2 tables depict four possible scenarios: (A) a situation with accessible populations and with available resources; (B) a situation with available resources but limited access to affected populations; (C) a situation with accessible populations and limited resources; and (D) a situation with both limited access and limited resources. Methods and data sources can vary from large population-based surveys, rapid assessments of populations or health facilities, routine health management information systems, or data from sentinel sites in the community or among facilities. Adapting indicators and methods to specific contexts of humanitarian settings increases the potential for measuring the performance of humanitarian programs beyond inputs and outputs by assessing health outcomes, and consequently improving program impact, reducing morbidity and mortality, and improving the quality of lives amongst persons affected by humanitarian emergencies.

TI  - Spatial patterns and climatic drivers of leaf spring phenology of maple in eastern North America
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The resurgent frequency of extreme weather events and their strongly distinctive spatial patterns lead to a growing in-terest in phenology as an indicator of tree susceptibility. Using a long-term chronology of observations collected in situ, we predicted and investigated the spatial patterns and environmental drivers of spring leaf phenology across maple stand polygons dominated by Acer saccharum Marsh. and/or Acer rubra L. in eastern North America for 2000-2018. Model' calibration was based on Bayesian ordinal regressions relating the timing of the phenological events' observa-tions to the MODIS vegetation indices EVI, NDVI and LAI. DAYMET data have been extracted to compute temperature and precipitation during spring phenology. Model accuracy increased as the season progressed, with prediction uncer-tainty spanning from 9 days for bud swelling to 4 days for leaf unfolding. NDVI and LAI were the best predictors for the onset and ending of spring phenology, respectively. Bud swelling occurred at the end of March in the early stands and at the onset of May in the late stands, while leaf unfolding was completed at the beginning of April for the early and in mid-June for the late stands. Early and late stands polarized towards a south-west-north-east gradient. In the south-western regions, which are also the driest, total precipitation and minimum temperature explained respectively 73 % and 25 % of the duration of spring phenology. In the north-eastern regions, precipitation and minimum temper-ature explained 62 % and 26 % of the duration of spring phenology. Our results suggest high vulnerability to extreme weather events in stands located in the south-west of the species distribution. The increasing incidence of drought in these locations might affect spring phenology, decreasing net primary production in these stands. Warmer nights might expose the buds to late frosts, events that are expected to become more frequent in the coming years.

TI  - The potential of tailoring the gut microbiome to prevent and treat cardiometabolic disease
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS CARDIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - In this Review, Backhed and colleagues summarize the evidence for gut microbiome alterations in cardiometabolic and cardiovascular diseases and the rationale and potential benefit motivating translational approaches to target the gut microbiota and its metabolites for prevention and treatment.Despite milestones in preventive measures and treatment, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains associated with a high burden of morbidity and mortality. The protracted nature of the development and progression of CVD motivates the identification of early and complementary targets that might explain and alleviate any residual risk in treated patients. The gut microbiota has emerged as a sentinel between our inner milieu and outer environment and relays a modified risk associated with these factors to the host. Accordingly, numerous mechanistic studies in animal models support a causal role of the gut microbiome in CVD via specific microbial or shared microbiota-host metabolites and have identified converging mammalian targets for these signals. Similarly, large-scale cohort studies have repeatedly reported perturbations of the gut microbial community in CVD, supporting the translational potential of targeting this ecological niche, but the move from bench to bedside has not been smooth. In this Review, we provide an overview of the current evidence on the interconnectedness of the gut microbiome and CVD against the noisy backdrop of highly prevalent confounders in advanced CVD, such as increased metabolic burden and polypharmacy. We further aim to conceptualize the molecular mechanisms at the centre of these associations and identify actionable gut microbiome-based targets, while contextualizing the current knowledge within the clinical scenario and emphasizing the limitations of the field that need to be overcome.

TI  - Analysis of Flavonoid Metabolism during the Process of Petal Discoloration in Three<i> Malus</i> Crabapple Cultivars
T2  - ACS OMEGA
M3  - Article
AB  - Malus crabapple has high ornamental and ecological value. Here, the flavonoids in the petals of three pink Malus crabapple cultivars, Malus 'Strawberry Parfait' (GD), M. 'Pink Spire' (FY), and M. 'Hongyi' (HY), at the bud stage (flower buds are swollen, and the pistils and stamens are about to appear; L), full bloom stage (the flowers are fully open, and the stigma and anthers have recently appeared; S), and end bloom stage (the stigma and anthers are dry; M) were identified, and their abundances were determined. First, Kodak Color Control Patches were used to describe the colors of petals, and a colorimeter was used to determine the phenotypic values of flower colors. Flavonoids were determined using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). In all three crabapple cultivars, the red and yellow hues of the petals gradually disappeared, the color of the flowers changed from bright to dull, and the petals gradually faded. The extent of fading of the red hue of the petals was highest in GD, followed by FY and HY. A total of 302 metabolites were detected in the three cultivars. The content of total flavonoids in the three cultivars significantly differed, but there were no significant differences among species. The total flavonoid content of the three crabapple varieties was highest in HY, followed by FY and GD. The content of the anthocyanins delphinidin-3-O-sophoricoside-5-O-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-O-(6 ''-O-malonyl)glucoside, pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside, peonidin-3-O-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-O-arabinoside decreased significantly, which resulted in the discoloration of GD petals from L to M. The flavonoids and flavonols in FY might interact with anthocyanins in metabolic pathways. The content of these five anthocyanins decreased slowly, which resulted in the weaker discoloration of FY and HY compared with GD. The content of the five anthocyanins in HY did not decrease significantly, but the content of chalcone increased significantly, which might facilitate the production of anthocyanin auxiliary pigments and result in less pronounced fading of the petals. Cyanidin-3-O-arabinoside and pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside were the key flavonoids of the three crabapple cultivars. The total content and changes in anthocyanins were the key factors affecting petal color development and fading. Nonanthocyanin polyphenols, such as flavonoids, flavonols, and chalcone, are auxiliary pigments that affect petal fading. Overall, the results of this study provide new insights into the mechanism underlying the fading of the color of Malus crabapple flowers, and these new insights could aid the breeding of cultivars with different flower colors.

TI  - Analysis of time-space dynamic simulation on urban expansion in mountainous area based on the weight-CA model
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the central cities in the Wuling Mountains, Huaihua is regarded as the main body and core economic development area in the process of Wuling's future new urbanization, exerting a pivotal influence on the five provincial border areas (Hunan, Hubei, Chongq-ing, Guizhou and Guangxi). But studies on urban expansion in this city are few, so this paper makes efforts to simulate its urban land expansion by constructing the Cellular Automata model (the Weight-CA model) taking into account differences in land types conversion. Firstly, the paper obtains the time-series Landsat spectral bands (Red, NIR) and NDVI images using the time-space fusion model; then the optimal combination of classification features is screened based on JBh distance and the object-oriented random forest algorithm is applied for land cover classification; the paper finally constructs the Weight-CA model for the simulation and validation of urban land expansion in Huaihua. Study results in the paper have shown that the Landsat spectral bands obtained with the ESTARFM have a rel-atively high correlation with real Landsat images. The land cover classification based on the optimal classification feature combination and the object-oriented random forest algorithm is high in accuracy, the total of which exceeding 84 % over 4 years. Meanwhile, based on the Weight-CA model, the simulation accuracy of urban land expansion in Huaihua in 2010 and 2015 reached 89.98 % and 89.60 % compared with the real values. It is operationally ready and practical and of strong practical significance to extract land cover types by Landsat and MODIS data fusion, and simulate urban land expansion using the Weight-CA method.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Modelling <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> stem growth along a wide thermal gradient in Italy by incorporating dendroclimatic classification and land surface phenology metrics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Calibrating land surface phenology (LSP) with tree rings is important to model spatio-temporal variations in forest productivity. We used MODIS (resolution: 250 m) NDVI, WDRVI and EVI series 2000-2014 to derive LSP metrics quantifying phenophase timing and canopy photosynthetic rates of 26 European beech forests covering a large thermal gradient (5-16 degrees C) in Italy. Average phenophase timing changed greatly with site temperature (e.g. growing season 70 days longer at low- than high-elevation); average VI values were affected by precipitation. An annual temperature about 12 degrees C (c. 1100 m asl) represented a bioclimatic threshold dividing warm from cold beech forests, distinguished by different phenology-BAI (basal area increment) relationships and LSP trends. Cold forests showed decreasing VI values (browning) and delayed phenophases and had negative BAI slopes. Warmer forests tended to increase VI (greening), and positive BAI slopes. NDVI peak, commonly used in global trend assessments, changed with elevation in agreement with changes in wood production. A cross-validation modelling approach demonstrated the ability of LSP to predict average BAI and its interannual variability. Merging sites into bioclimatic groups improved models by amplifying the signal in growth or LSP. NDVI had highest performances when informing on BAI trends; WDRVI and EVI were mostly selected for modelling mean and interannual BAI. WDRVI association with tree rings, tested in this study for the first time, showed that this VI is highly promising for studying forest dynamics. MODIS LSP can quantify forest functioning changes across landscapes and model interannual spatial variations and trends in productivity dynamics under climate change.

TI  - The reproductive climate concerns of young, educated Chinese: 'when the nest is upset, no egg is left intact'
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An emerging area of research concerns the phenomenon of young people factoring climate change into their reproductive plans and choices, but existing scholarship and popular discourse have focused exclusively on Western and developed countries. This paper examines whether young people in China are also connecting their reproductive plans and choices to climate change, and why. Based on the quantitative and qualitative results from an exploratory survey of 173 young, educated, climate-alarmed or climate-concerned Chinese, we found that reproductive climate concerns are reported by many young Chinese. Respondents expressed deep and multi-layered concerns about the wellbeing of their (potential) children in a climate-changed future, though they did not rank climate change highly among other factors that might influence their reproductive choices. Climate-alarmed Chinese reported lower levels of reproductive climate concerns and more positive visions of the future than a similar group of US-Americans. We attribute these findings to China's history of family planning, state-constructed climate discourse, stage of development, and hierarchical cultural worldview. As the first study on reproductive climate concerns in Asia, this research addresses a major gap in our knowledge, with implications for the sociology of climate change, the sociology of reproduction, environmental psychology, Asian studies, and demography.

TI  - Oncologic safety of axillary lymph node dissection with immediate lymphatic reconstruction
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Immediate lymphatic reconstruction (ILR) at the time of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can reduce the incidence of lymphedema in patients with breast cancer. The oncologic safety of ILR is unknown and has not been reported. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if ILR is associated with increased breast cancer recurrence rates. Methods Patients with breast cancer who underwent ALND with ILR from September 2016 to December 2020 were identified from a prospective institutional database. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and operative details were recorded. Follow-up included the development of local recurrence as well as distant metastasis. Oncologic outcomes were analyzed. Results A total of 137 patients underwent ALND with ILR. At cancer presentation, 122 patients (89%) had clinically node positive primary breast cancer, 10 patients (7.3%) had recurrent breast cancer involving the axillary lymph nodes, 3 patients (2.2%) had recurrent breast cancer involving both the breast and axillary nodes, and 2 patients (1.5%) presented with axillary disease/occult breast cancer. For surgical management, 103 patients (75.2%) underwent a mastectomy, 22 patients (16%) underwent lumpectomy and 12 patients (8.8%) had axillary surgery only. The ALND procedure, yielded a median of 15 lymph nodes pathologically identified (range 3-41). At a median follow-up of 32.9 months (range 6-63 months), 17 patients (12.4%) developed a local (n = 1) or distant recurrence (n = 16), however, no axillary recurrences were identified. Conclusion Immediate lymphatic reconstruction in patients with breast cancer undergoing ALND is not associated with short term axillary recurrence and appears oncologically safe.

TI  - Occluded object detection and exposure in cluttered environments with automated hyperspectral anomaly detection
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI
M3  - Article
AB  - Cluttered environments with partial object occlusions pose significant challenges to robot manipulation. In settings composed of one dominant object type and various undesirable contaminants, occlusions make it difficult to both recognize and isolate undesirable objects. Spatial features alone are not always sufficiently distinct to reliably identify anomalies under multiple layers of clutter, with only a fractional part of the object exposed. We create a multi-modal data representation of cluttered object scenes pairing depth data with a registered hyperspectral data cube. Hyperspectral imaging provides pixel-wise Visible Near-Infrared (VNIR) reflectance spectral curves which are invariant in similar material types. Spectral reflectance data is grounded in the chemical-physical properties of an object, making spectral curves an excellent modality to differentiate inter-class material types. Our approach proposes a new automated method to perform hyperspectral anomaly detection in cluttered workspaces with the goal of improving robot manipulation. We first assume the dominance of a single material class, and coarsely identify the dominant, non-anomalous class. Next these labels are used to train an unsupervised autoencoder to identify anomalous pixels through reconstruction error. To tie our anomaly detection to robot actions, we then apply a set of heuristically-evaluated motion primitives to perturb and further expose local areas containing anomalies. The utility of this approach is demonstrated in numerous cluttered environments including organic and inorganic materials. In each of our four constructed scenarios, our proposed anomaly detection method is able to consistently increase the exposed surface area of anomalies. Our work advances robot perception for cluttered environments by incorporating multi-modal anomaly detection aided by hyperspectral sensing into detecting fractional object presence without need for laboriously curated labels.

TI  - Assessing the impact of Sentinel-1 derived planting dates on rice crop yield modeling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Planting date (PD) is one of the critical component in crop modeling that has a large-scale impact on seasonal yield estimation. Here, we aimed to estimate the various paddy/rice attributes (particularly, acreage and PD) using the Sentinel-1A observations, and assessing the impact of such key parameters on end-of-season yields. The method comprises: (1) a multi-temporal time-series analysis algorithm of Sentinel-1A observations for rice mapping, (2) a PD retrieval algorithm, and (3) rice yield estimation using the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-derived PD in a modeling system. Our study was implemented over the rainfed paddy fields in Cambodia be-tween 2017 thru 2020. We demonstrated that the backscatter ratio (sigma VH 0 sigma VV 0) from Sentinel-1A can improve the accuracy of rice mapping, while sigma VH0 backscatter can provide PD estimations. Our results showcased reasonable/ good performance in mapping the paddy fields and estimating PD in the study area. PD found in March and April were indicative of irrigation application in some parts of Cambodia, specifically in the southeastern part (also part of the Mekong delta) where irrigation in paddy fields is a common practice. Differences between the crop -calendar based PD (June 1) and the SAR-derived PD can range as much as 75 days. In the rice-dominated provinces such as Banteay-Meanchey and Svay-Rieng of Cambodia, when SAR-derived PD are used, rice yield normalized bias improved compared to the fixed PD data by a mean of 7-12 % and 30-48 % respectively within the study period. In addition, the PD derived from SAR also significantly reduced the uncertainty in yield esti-mation. Overall, this study demonstrated the potential of using the SAR-derived PD in improving the rice yield estimation over rainfed paddy fields.

TI  - Estimating 10-m land surface albedo from Sentinel-2 satellite observations using a direct estimation approach with Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo plays an important role in controlling the surface energy budget and regulating the bio-physical processes of natural dynamics and anthropogenic activities. Satellite remote sensing is the only practical approach to estimate surface albedo at regional and global scales. It nevertheless remains challenging for current satellites to capture fine-scale albedo variations due to their coarse spatial resolutions from tens to hundreds of meters. The emerging Sentinel-2 satellites, with a high spatial resolution of 10 m and an approximate 5-day revisiting cycle, provide a promising solution to address these observational limitations, yet their potentials remain underexplored. In this study, we integrated the Sentinel-2 observations with an updated direct estimation approach to improve the estimation and monitoring of fine-scale surface albedo. To enable the capability of the direct estimation approach at a 10-m scale, we combined the 10-m resolution European Space Agency (ESA) WorldCover land cover data and the 500-m resolution Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/albedo product to build a high-quality and representa-tive BRDF training database. To evaluate our approach, we proposed an integrated evaluation framework leveraging 3-D physical model simulations, ground measurements, and satellite observations. Specifically, we first simulated a comprehensive dataset of Sentinel-2-like surface reflectance and broadband albedo across a variety of geometric configurations using the MODIS BRDF training samples. With this dataset, we built the Look -Up-Tables (LUTs) that connect surface broadband albedo and Sentinel-2 reflectance through a direct angular bin -based linear regression approach, and further coupled these LUTs with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud -computing platform. We next evaluated the proposed algorithm at two spatial levels: (1) 10-m scale for abso-lute accuracy assessment using the references from the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) simu-lations and flux-site observations, and (2) 500-m scale for large-scale mapping assessment by comparing the estimated albedo with the MODIS albedo product. Lastly, we presented four examples to show the capability of Sentinel-2 albedo in detecting fine-scale characteristics of vegetation and urban covers. Results show that: (1) the proposed algorithm accurately estimates surface albedo from Sentinel-2-like reflectance across different land-scape configurations (overall root-mean-square-error (RMSE) = 0.018, bias = 0.005, and coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.88); (2) the Sentinel-2-derived surface albedo agrees well with ground measurements (overall RMSE = 0.030, bias =-0.004, and R2 = 0.94) and MODIS products (overall RMSE = 0.030, bias = 0.021, and R2 = 0.97); and (3) Sentinel-2-derived albedo accurately captures seasonal leaf phenology and rapid snow events, and detects the interspecific (or interclass) variations of tree species and colored urban rooftops. These results demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to map high-resolution surface albedo from Sentinel -2 satellites over large spatial and temporal contexts, suggesting the potential of using such fine-scale datasets to improve our understanding of albedo-related biophysical processes in the coupled human-environment system.

TI  - Assessing mass balance-based inverse modeling methods via a pseudo-observation test to constrain NOx emissions over South Korea
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the mass balance-based inverse modeling method, this study constrains NOx emissions and then examines the optimization of inverse modeling conditions via a pseudo-observation test for South Korea, a country with complex topography. We apply the following mass balance-based inverse modeling methods: basic mass balance (BMB), finite difference mass balance (FDMB), and iterative finite difference mass balance (IFDMB). We perform a numerical simulation of air quality using the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to calculate the NO2 column density required for the inverse modeling. Then we conduct a pseudo-observation test according to the season, the modeling resolution, and the regridding methodology of satellite observational data to identify various conditions while applying inverse modeling for South Korea. Comparing the inverse modeling results from the BMB, FDMB, and IFDMB methods, we find IFDMB the most effective method for constraining NOx emissions in the South Korean region since it minimizes the smearing effect (i.e., transport-induced errors) through iterative calculations. Our findings show that the accuracy of the constrained NOx emissions using mass balance-based inversions in South Korea is the highest in the summer season, in which the lowest smearing effect occurs, and the most efficient resolution for the inverse modeling of the region is 9 km. In addition, the results of inverse modeling differ depending on the regridding method, suggesting that the use of a regridding method

TI  - Differentiating grazing-induced rangeland grass nutrition status<i> in</i><i> situ</i> using near infrared reflectance
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the nutrient content of rangeland grass using earth observation technologies presents opportunities for non-destructive, rapid and repetitive appraisals in support of rangeland management. The biochemical-related concentrations of macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) are among the factors that influence near infrared reflectance (pNIR) by a turgid leaf. High grazing intensity (GI) enhances nutrient recycling in rangelands, resulting in high concentrations in aboveground grass tissue. This study sought to establish whether grazing-induced macronutrient abundance in rangeland grass can be remotely sensed in situ through pNIR in the multiple species natural settings. Sampling was conducted at peak grass growth stage in large savannah rangelands with similar grass species mixtures, in low moisture stress conditions. The sampling was widely distributed in GI-contrasted livestock and wild grazer rangelands, and in grazing-restricted control sites. Two species representing high and low nutrient grass species, respectively, were sampled. At each sam-pling site (N = 116), reflectance was measured in the 350-2500 nm range from leaf and stem tissue of healthy-looking specimens of the two species (<= 10 m apart), using a 1.1 nm - 1.4 nm resolution spectroradiometer. Macronutrient concentrations (MNC) in the tissue were then determined in the laboratory. For each species, the hyperspectral NIR (A 700 - 1100 nm) reflectance was averaged per sampling site. Individual and total MNC, respectively, were correlated with the hyperspectral pNIR, and then with atmospheric effect-corrected pNIR from 10 m-resolution, field sampling-concurrent Sentinel-2 MSI multispectral images. For each sampling site, the two species' hyperspectral pNIR values, individual and total MNC, respectively, were then averaged. Respective models relating the paired hyperspec-tral pNIR and averaged MNC were developed, by linear regression and partial least squares regression (PLSR). Tissue MNC were lowest in the control sites and higher in the grazed rangelands. Covariance in MNC in the two species suggested location-context similarities in all grasses. Individual and total MNC, respectively, had statistically significant (p < 0.01) negative correlations with both tissue level hyperspectral and multispectral pNIR. The negative relationship was detected on empirical line-retrieved pNIR on historical Hyperion hyperspectral images. PLSR yielded a more accurate predictive model (R2 = 0.760) than linear regression (R2 = 0.601, F = 138.415, p < 0.0001). The study shows that there are possibilities to remotely sense grazing-induced MNC in aboveground grass tissue through changes in pNIR.(c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Assessing spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture has a great role in different applications, such as natural resource management, flood-risk prediction, irrigation development, hydrology, and climatology. The current study is focusing on investigating the spatial relationship between soil moisture and vegetation cover. The Delta index model was applied using Sentinel-1 images to estimate soil moisture, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was applied using Sentinel-2 images to assess vegetation cover. Besides, regression analysis was conducted to investigate the spatial relationship between soil moisture and vegetation cover. The derived soil moisture ranges from 0% to 48.4811%. Most areas with high elevation had high soil moisture, and low elevation had low soil moisture. In most part of the study area, vegetation cover and soil moisture have a direct relationship. Thus, higher vegetation cover was observed in areas with higher soil moisture; and lower vegetation cover was observed in areas with lower soil moisture.

TI  - Emergentist Integrated Information Theory
T2  - ERKENNTNIS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The integrated information theory (IIT) is an ambitious theory of consciousness that aims to provide both a neuroscientific and a metaphysical account of consciousness by identifying consciousness with integrated information. In the philosophical literature, IIT is often associated with a panpsychist worldview. In this paper, I show that IIT can be considered, instead, as a form of emergentism that is incompatible with panpsychism. First, I show that the panpsychist interpretation of IIT is based on two properties of integrated information: intrinsicality and fundamentality. I show that the way IIT deals with these two properties, however, aligns better with emergentism than panpsychism. Then, after plugging some anti-panpsychist assumptions into IIT's structure, I analyse different philosophical options for interpreting the formal result of causal emergence of integrated information in terms of dependence on and autonomy from its physical substrate. The upshot is that integrated information can be seen as dependent upon the fusion of the cause-effect powers of a physical substrate, and as autonomous in virtue of global-to-local determination. According to this interpretation, consciousness is the constraining power of the system as a whole upon itself, when this power emerges from the fusion on the cause-effect powers of the system's components.

TI  - A stochastic cellular automaton model to describe the evolution of the snow-covered area across a high-elevation mountain catchment
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in the extent and duration of snow cover impinge on surface albedo and snowmelt rate, influencing the energy and water budgets. Monitoring snow coverage is therefore crucial for both optimising the supply of snowpack-derived water and understanding how climate change could impact on this source, vital for sustaining human activities and the natural environment during the dry season.Mountainous sites can be characterised by complex morphologies, cloud cover and forests that can introduce errors into the estimates of snow cover obtained from remote sensing. Consequently, there is a need to develop simulation models capable of predicting how snow coverage evolves across a season. Cellular Automata models have previously been used to simulate snowmelt dynamics, but at a coarser scale that limits insight into the precise factors driving snowmelt at different stages.To address this information gap, we formulate a novel, fine-scale stochastic Cellular Automaton model that describes snow coverage across a high-elevation catchment. Exploiting its refinement, the model is used to explore the interplay between three factors proposed to play a critical role: terrain elevation, sun incidence angle, and the extent of nearby snow. We calibrate the model via a randomised parameter search, fitting simulation data against snow cover masks estimated from Sentinel-2 satellite images. Our analysis shows that:-The three simple assumptions are sufficient to yield a close correspondence between model output and the esti-mated snow cover masks. -Across the study area, elevation and neighbouring snow appear to be particularly influential, with incidence playing a relatively minor role for much of the process. -Incidence, though, plays a significant role early in the process, and allows the identification of regions that receive sufficient solar energy to trigger snowmelt. -Discrepancies between model output and satellite data indicate other potential factors at play, the identification of which will demand future attention.

TI  - Cash transfers, climatic shocks and resilience in the Sahel
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Policy makers search for strategies to promote resilience and mitigate the effects of future climatic shocks. In this paper, we assess whether small regular cash transfers strengthen poor households' ability to mitigate the welfare effects of drought shocks. We analyze mechanisms through which cash transfers contribute to resilience, including savings, asset accumulation as well as income smoothing in agriculture and off-farm activities. We combine household survey data collected as part of a randomized control trial in rural Niger with satellite data used to identify exogenous rainfall shocks. The results show that cash transfers increase household consumption by about 10 percent on average. Importantly, this increase is mostly concentrated among households affected by drought shocks, for whom welfare impacts are larger than transfer amounts due to households' enhanced ability to protect earnings in agriculture and off-farm businesses when shocks occur. The results suggest that multi-year cash transfer programs can foster poor households' resilience by facilitating savings and income smoothing.

TI  - Chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Arabian Gulf waters of arid region: A case study from the northern coast of Qatar
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of spectrally active Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the gulf water of an arid region is important to understand the spatial and temporal variations of phytoplankton and biomass in the water. This study characterizes the spectral absorption of Chl-a and detects and maps the Chl-a of Al Arish-Al Ghariyah coastal region of northern Qatar using the data of Hyperion of EO-1, MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) of Sentinel-2, and Operational Land Imager (OLI) of Landsat-8 satellites. The study of image spectra of Chl-a of coastal water of the Al Ghariyah region using the Hyperion image showed spectral band absorptions near 450 and 475 nm in the blue region and around 640, 730, 760, and 830 nm in the red region. The analysis of Hyperion data using image spectra by linear spectral unmixing (LSU) method showed the occurrence of Chl-a in very shallow and shallow water. The mapping of Chl-a of the Al Arish-Al Ghariyah coastal region was carried out using MSI and OLI data by NDCI, 2BDA, 3BDA, and FLH violet algorithms, which showed the concentrations and distributions of the Chl-a in the region. The performance of the algorithms was studied using WorldView-3 data, which provided the R-2 values of 60% and the best suitability of the NDCI algorithm and MSI data to map the concentration of Chl-a. All the results were validated using field measurements, in-situ measurements, and laboratory analyses of field samples. The measurements of Chl-a showed the occurrence of poor occurrence of Chl-a and confirmed the imagery results. The remote sensing results with physical and chemical parameters of water samples allowed us to assess Chl-a concentrations in the region. This study evaluates the sensor's capability and applications of satellite data and algorithms to map concentrations of Chl-a in the Gulf waters of the arid region. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Sentinel p16<SUP>INK4a+</SUP> cells in the basement membrane form a reparative niche in the lung
T2  - SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We engineered an ultrasensitive reporter of p16(INK4a), a biomarker of cellular senescence. Our reporter detected p16(INK4a-)expressing fibroblasts with certain senescent characteristics that appeared shortly after birth in the basement membrane adjacent to epithelial stem cells in the lung. Furthermore, these p16(INK4a+) fibroblasts had enhanced capacity to sense tissue inflammation and respond through their increased secretory capacity to promote epithelial regeneration. In addition, p16 (INK4a) expression was required in fibroblasts to enhance epithelial regeneration. This study highlights a role for p16(INK4a+) fibroblasts as tissue-resident sentinels in the stem cell niche that monitor barrier integrity and rapidly respond to inflammation to promote tissue regeneration.

TI  - Understanding the scale effects of topographical variables on landslide susceptibility mapping in Sikkim Himalaya using deep learning approaches
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In geomorphological hazard studies, selecting DEM data with the proper spatial resolution is necessary for optimal analysis of prediction performance. Henceforth, accurate resolution of DEM data in landslide susceptibility study is also crucial in this perspective. This study determines the scale effects of DEM derived hydro-topographic factors in LS mapping in the Rangpo river basin, Sikkim Himalaya, India. Five different DEM data i.e., ALOS (12.5 m), and AW3D30, SRTM, ASTER and Cartosat-1 with each 30 m resolution were used in this study. Three neural network algorithms were applied to produce LSM. The results of this investigation revealed that, among the three employed neural network techniques, the deep learning algorithm with ALOS DEM data performed the best. The proposed unique approach i.e., combination of scale effects and deep learning algorithm can be useful to produce precise LSMs in hilly areas around the globe, and will be helpful for sustainable development.

TI  - Controlling factors in the interferometric coherence derived from Sentinel-1 images: an example from the Rio Chubut Lower Valley, Argentina
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, controlling factors on radar interferometric coherence (IC) in a region of the Chubut River are analysed, since its variations could indicate potential sediment transfer zones. Studied control factors are vegetation cover, development of the drainage network, rainfall and winds. The results show that the major control over IC loss is given by rainfalls. A secondary control is exerted by the drainage networks development; whereas the limited changes in the vegetation cover and winds regime would not exert significant control. In addition, a permanent IC loss tendency was recognized in channelized areas whereas temporal IC variations were recognized in non-channelized areas. Finally, as different sectors of the study area under the same known conditions (meteorological phenomena, drainage network and vegetation cover) present different IC variations, the existence of at least a third control factor -likely linked to the geology of the landscape-, is deduced from this research.

TI  - Prediction of leaf area index using thermal infrared data acquired by UAS over a mixed temperate forest
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a crucial biophysical variable for remote sensing vegetation studies. LAI estimation through remote sensing data has mostly been investigated using visible and near-infrared (0.4-1.3 mu m, VNIR) and Shortwave Infrared (1.4-3 mu m, SWIR) data. However, Thermal Infrared (3-14 mu m, TIR) data for LAI retrieval has rarely been explored. This study aims to predict LAI by integrating VNIR and TIR data from Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in a mixed temperate forest, the Haagse Bos, Enschede, the Netherlands. The VNIR and TIR images were acquired in September 2020, in conjunction with fieldwork to collect LAI in situ data for 30 plots. TIR images were acquired at two heights (i.e., 85 m and 120 m above ground) to investigate the effect of flight height on the LAI prediction accuracy by means of UAS data. Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) were computed and extracted from the collected images. LAI was estimated using seven vegetation indices and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). LAI prediction accuracy using VNIR reflectance spectra was compared to the accuracy achieved by integrating VNIR data with LST or LSE applying vegetation indices as well as PLSR. Among the applied vegetation indices, the Reduced Simple Ratio (RSR) gained the highest prediction accuracy using VNIR data (R2 = 0.5815, RMSE = 0.6972); the prediction accuracy was not improved when LST was integrated with VNIR data but increased when LSE was included (RSR: R2 = 0.7458, RMSE = 0.5081). However, when LST from 85 m altitude and VNIR data was applied as an input using PLSR (R2 = 0.5565, RMSECV = 0.7998), the LAI prediction accuracy was slightly increased compared to when only VNIR data was used (R2 = 0.4452, RMSECV = 0.8668). Integrating VNIR data with LSE significantly improved the LAI retrieval accuracy (R2 = 0.7907, RMSECV = 0.8351). These findings corroborate prior research indicating that combining LSE with VNIR data can increase the prediction accuracy of LAI. However, LST was found to be ineffective for this purpose. The relationship between LAI and LSE should be the subject of more investigation through various approaches to bridge the existing scientific gap.

TI  - Hybrid global gridded snow products and conceptual simulations of distributed snow budget: evaluation of different scenarios in a mountainous watershed
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering snowmelt in mountainous areas as the important source of streamflow, the snow accumulation/melting processes are vital for accurate simulation of the hydrological regimes. The lack of snow-related data and its uncertainties/conceptual ambiguity in snowpack modeling are the different challenges of developing hydroclimatological models. To tackle these challenges, Global Gridded Snow Products (GGSPs) are introduced, which effectively simplify the identification of the spatial characteristics of snow hydrological variables. This research aims to investigate the performance of multi-source GGSPs using multi-stage calibration strategies in hydrological modeling. The used GGSPs were Snow-Covered Area (SCA) and Snow Water Equivalent (SWE), implemented individually or jointly to calibrate an appropriate water balance model. The study area was a mountainous watershed located in Western Iran with a considerable contribution of snowmelt to the generated streamflow. The results showed that using GGSPs as complementary information in the calibration process, besides streamflow time series, could improve the modeling accuracy compared to the conventional calibration, which is only based on streamflow data. The SCA with NSE, KGE, and RMSE values varying within the ranges of 0.47-0.57, 0.54-0.65, and 4-6.88, respectively, outperformed the SWE with the corresponding metrics of 0.36-0.59, 0.47-0.60, and 5.22-7.46, respectively, in simulating the total streamflow of the watershed. In addition to the superiority of the SCA over SWE, the two-stage calibration strategy reduced the number of optimized parameters in each stage and the dependency of internal processes on the streamflow and improved the accuracy of the results compared with the conventional calibration strategy. On the other hand, the consistent contribution of snowmelt to the total generated streamflow (ranging from 0.9 to 1.47) and the ratio of snow melting to snowfall (ranging from 0.925 to 1.041) in different calibration strategies and models resulted in a reliable simulation of the model.

TI  - Comparing Landsat Dynamic Surface Water Extent to alternative methods of measuring inundation in developing waterbird habitats
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the applicability of the Landsat Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE) science product for waterbird habitat modeling in multiple non-canopied habitat types. We compare surface water distribution estimates derived from DSWE to two site-specific survey methods: visual surveys and digitized aerial imagery. These site-specific surveys were conducted on Poplar Island, a restoration island project in the Chesapeake Bay, USA. Visual surveys were collected bimonthly from 2006 to 2013, and digitized aerial imagery was collected annually from 2006 to 2015. As a restoration island, Poplar Island presents a unique opportunity to analyze DSWE in a rapidly changing site. We structure our analysis based on the procedural development of individual sub-island cells developed from unconsolidated dredge material into fully restored wetlands that have independent hydrologic connection to the surrounding bay. Each development status is analyzed using our three DSWE classifications: Open Water (OW), a conservative estimate; Wetland Inclusive (WI), an aggressive estimate; and Development Dependent (DD), a landcover adaptive estimate. The OW classification consistently underestimates surface water coverage especially in the more complex, fully developed cells. The WI classification is better able to capture the tidal channels in these cells, but marginally overestimates surface water coverage in more sparsely vegetated cells. The DD classification does not significantly improve upon the estimations of the WI classification. Our data indicate that DSWE can be a capable alternative to our site-specific survey methods. However, the product is limited by Landsat's 30 m spatial resolution, especially in more structurally complex wetlands. A recommended classification method for characterizing waterbird habitats would depend on the goals and targeted scale of analysis, for which DSWE may be a viable option.

TI  - Crop residual burning correlations with major air pollutants in mainland China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have established the correlation between crop residual burning (CRB) and air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM) pollutants. However, few studies have compared CRB's correlations with all major air pollutants, including PM with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 mu m (PM10) and 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O-3), and carbon monoxide (CO), during open-field CRB seasons. This study monitored daily CRB spots from 2015 to 2016 in China, together with daily concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, NO2, and 8 h average O3 provided by the China National Environmental Monitoring Center. Temporal changes in air pollutant concentration at the provincial level and spatial contributions of CRB to air pollution at the monitoring-site level were analyzed. The results indicated that the decrease in CRB from 2015 to 2016 probably led to a decrease in the mean air pollutant concentration and maxima; it also probably led to more outliers at the provincial level in the CRB seasons, especially in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning. Spatial contributions suggest that the Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces experienced a regional increase in the concentrations of almost all major air pollutants during the CRB seasons. In Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning, 67.88%, 72.12%, 80.00%, 77.58%, and 69.09% of the monitoring sites recorded higher concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O-3 , and CO, respectively, in the winter CRB season of 2015 compared to other periods. In contrast, in other provinces with fewer and more widely distributed CRB spots, only the monitoring sites close to or on CRB spots experienced increases.

TI  - Deformation monitoring and influence factor analysis of expressway over strong saline soil based on an advanced multi-temporal InSAR technique
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Saline soil harbors crystallized salt in the solid phase and salt solution in the liquid phase. By the natural environmental and human activity factors, migration and accumulation of the salt and crystallization process alternated with dissolving, which makes saline soil with significant seasonal differences appear in the deformation and regional scattering characteristic. These phenomena raise the limitation of conventional multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) technique and consequently high-precision deformation monitoring of strong saline soil subgrade and pavement. To overcome the limitations, this study aimed to propose an advanced MT-InSAR method, which considers the seasonal interferometric coherences caused by precipitation and the temporal physical deformation evolution of the subgrade and pavement over strong saline soil. To present the better performance of the advanced method, a segment of the Qarhan-Golmud Expressway (QGE), which is the first expressway built in the strong saline soil area in China, was selected for this study. Two sets of SAR images acquired from January 2018 to January 2022 from Sentinel-1A ascending and descending orbits over the QGE were utilized, 774 and 928 seasonal filtered interferograms are optimized for deformation monitoring based on the deformation Poisson curve (PC) model. Compared with the method in the previous studies, the accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of the monitoring results increased dramatically. Subsequently, further discussions are conducted in detail on the regularity of expressway deformation over strong saline soil, especially from physical and chemical perspectives. Findings show that the ratio between Cl- and SO42- determines the deformation distribution and morphology. Also, the precipitation and temperature affect the seasonal characteristics. The contributions of this investigation might provide technical references for related expressway management and policy-making departments to ensure the long-term safe operation and stability of the QGE.

AB  - In this study, diurnal, monthly, seasonal, and annual variations in the behavior of Integrated Precipitable Water Vapour (IPWV) were estimated from the ground-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations network of India Meteorological Department (IMD) over the Indian region from 2017 to 2020. It is noticed in the study that the availability of moisture for coastal, inland, and desert stations are different and mainly influenced by horizontal advection or deep convection (when it occurs) by local as well as global weather systems affecting throughout the year over Indian region. These changes are also reflected in GNSS IPWV retrievals and behave differently for inland, coastal and desert locations. The diurnal variation (maximum, minimum) shows that the minimum value of IPWV occurred almost the same time for inland (0000-0002 UTC), coastal (0002-0004 UTC) stations except for Dwarka (1500 UTC), and one dessert station Sri Ganganagar (1800 UTC) whereas the maximum value varying from 0800 to 1000 UTC at inland & desert stations except for Pune (1200 UTC) and coastal stations (0700-1500 UTC). The monthly variation of highest/lowest IPWV values occurred in June, July & August/December & January respectively for all the stations of the Indian region (>60 mm for inland & desert, and for coastal stations it ranges between 55 and 61 mm). The station-wise seasonal distributions are further grouped as high and low-value regions of IPWV for all the seasons. The value of the seasonal mean IPWV was observed highest in the monsoon season (June to August), followed by post-monsoon (September to November) and pre-monsoon (March to May), and winter (December to February). It is noticed that the stations situated in North India (Sri Ganganagar) registered the lowest values of IPWV in -all seasons, whereas the highest IPWV values are registered at the stations Jalpaiguri of the North East with 66.16 mm, Nagpur of Central India with 65.47 mm in monsoon season. The lowest values of the annual mean of IPWV were noticed at the inland stations in Sriganganagar (23.86 mm) and the highest ones at the stations on the Thiruvananthapuram (47.59 mm) on the west coast of India.This study will be useful to understand the relationship between precipitation and the IPWV up to some extent and helpful in operational forecasting by considering other parameters like combining background circulation, thermodynamic conditions, etc., especially during convective weather events. In this paper, 4 case studies (event-wise) are presented for New Delhi GNSS stations and statistical skill scores were calculated which agree reasonably well with the actual occurrence. All the rainfall correlated events of the year 2021 were analyzed based on the monthly threshold of IPWV and the correct rate & false alarm rate were observed as 86 % & 14 % for station Delhi and similarly 85% & 15% for station Jalpaiguri respectively.

TI  - Quantifying emission fluxes of atmospheric pollutants from mobile differential optical absorption spectroscopic (DOAS) observations
T2  - SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART A-MOLECULAR AND BIOMOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrates a mobile passive differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) based remote sensing method for quantifying the emission fluxes of soot pollutants. First, the mobile DOAS system scans the plume emitted from urban sources. Then, the DOAS method retrieves the total columns of pollutant gases along the measurement path. Combining the longitude, latitude, and mobile speed recorded by vehicle GPS, the net emission fluxes of NO2 and SO2 in the measurement area are calculated by coupling with the wind field data. The NO2 flux in the region is combined with the NO to NO2 concentration ratio in the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS) model to calculate NOx net emission flux in the measurement period. We conducted the mobile DOAS measurements in the coal production area and obtained the distribution of pollutant gases along the measurement path. Meanwhile, the NO2 concentration distribution of the city and surrounding areas were reconstructed by using TROPOMI satellite data. During the mobile measurement, the net NO2 emission flux measured by mobile DOAS are in good agreement with satellite observations (R2 = 0.66). This study verified that the flux calculation method based on mobile DOAS can be used to detect urban soot pollutant gas emissions.

TI  - Aerosol Load-Cloud Cover Correlation: A Potential Clue for the Investigation of Aerosol Indirect Impact on Climate of Europe and Africa
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a key parameter in atmospheric pollution and climate processes. In this paper, we compared the aerosol loading (550 nm) from 2000-2001 to 2017-2018 and total cloud cover using seasonal, latitudinal and solar activity cycle data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and determined the spectral optical range from the region of relatively clear air (Europe) to the region of more considerable biomass burning activity (Africa). To remove the large annual cycle influence, the data were deseasonalized, allowing exploration of inter-annual variability. Deseasonalization obtains the time series AOD monthly average anomaly over the years for each grid cell. We employ the solar flux index over the regions by correlating the absolute percentage mean difference of aerosol and cloud interactions and validate the result by modeling aerosol and cloud data from 2020 to 2021 using a neural network. AOD and solar flux for Africa show correlations of - 0.638 for 2000-2001 and - 0.218 for Europe, and at the same time, AOD with cloud cover for Africa shows correlations of - 0.129 and 0.360 for Europe. The analysis confirmed an inverse weak correlation of aerosols with cloud cover. This would help resolve the knowledge gap by demonstrating that aerosol and cloud interactions are not only dependent on region but also more dependent on the solar activity cycle and seasons. We observed dependence by the latitude of the aerosol load and solar flux index.

TI  - Glacier extraction based on high-spatial-resolution remote-sensing images using a deep-learning approach with attention mechanism
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and rapid extraction of glacier boundaries plays an important role in the study of glacier inventory, glacier change and glacier movement. With the successive launches of high-resolution remote-sensing satellites and the increasing abundance of available remote-sensing data, great opportunities and challenges now exist. In this study, we improved the DeepLab V3+ as Attention DeepLab V3+ and designed a complete solution based on the improved network to automatically extract glacier outlines from Gaofen-6 panchromatic and multispectral (PMS) images with a spatial resolution of 2 m. In the solution, test-time augmentation (TTA) was adopted to increase model robustness, and the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) was added into the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) structure in DeepLab V3+ to enhance the weight of the target pixels and reduce the impact of superfluous features. The results show that the improved model effectively increases the robustness of the model, enhances the weight of target image elements and reduces the influence of non-target elements. Compared with deep-learning models, such as full convolutional network (FCN), U-Net and DeepLab V3+, the improved model performs better in the test dataset. Moreover, our method achieves superior performance for glacier boundary extraction in parts of the Tanggula Mountains, the Kunlun Mountains and the Qilian Mountains based on Gaofen-6 PMS images. It could distinguish glaciers from terminal moraine lakes, thin snow and clouds, thus demonstrating excellent performance and great potential for rapid and precise extraction of glacier boundaries.

TI  - Pre-collapse motion of the February 2021 Chamoli rock-ice avalanche, Indian Himalaya
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are a major geohazard that cause thousands of fatalities every year. Despite their importance, identifying unstable slopes and forecasting collapses remains a major challenge. In this study, we use the 7 February 2021 Chamoli rock-ice avalanche as a data-rich example to investigate the potential of remotely sensed datasets for the assessment of slope stability. We investigate imagery over the 3 decades preceding collapse and assess the precursory signs exhibited by this slope prior to the catastrophic collapse. We evaluate monthly slope motion from 2015 to 2021 through feature tracking of high-resolution optical satellite imagery. We then combine these data with a time series of pre- and post-event digital elevation models (DEMs), which we use to evaluate elevation change over the same area. Both datasets show that the 26.9 x 10(6) m(3) collapse block moved over 10 m horizontally and vertically in the 5 years preceding collapse, with particularly rapid motion occurring in the summers of 2017 and 2018. We propose that the collapse results from a combination of snow loading in a deep headwall crack and permafrost degradation in the heavily jointed bedrock. Despite observing a clear precursory signal, we find that the timing of the Chamoli rock-ice avalanche could likely not have been forecast from satellite data alone. Our results highlight the potential of remotely sensed imagery for assessing landslide hazard in remote areas, but that challenges remain for operational hazard monitoring.

TI  - MODIS-based smoke detection shows that daily smoke cover dampens fire severity in initial burns but not reburns in complex terrain
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Wildfire smoke may dampen fire severity through effects on weather and the persistence of atmospheric inversions, but empirical work on the link between smoke and fire severity is scarce. Aims. To assess the influence of daily smoke characteristics on wildfire severity in complex terrain. Methods. A customised smoke detection algorithm based on MODIS imagery was integrated into statistical models of fire severity across 106 wildfires between 2002 and 2018 in the Klamath Mountains, USA. Key results. Smoke characteristics improved predictions of fire severity in non-reburn areas but not in reburns. Maximum daily smoke cover interacted with elevation, showing a strong dampening effect of high smoke cover on fire severity at low elevations consistent with prior work and a weaker amplifying effect on fire severity at middle elevations with low smoke cover. Conclusions. Feedbacks between smoke and atmospheric inversions dampen fire severity in valleys but may amplify fire severity at middle elevations above inversion layers. Implications The influence of smoke on fire severity may strengthen in the future as large fires and extreme fire weather become more common, yet may also weaken as reburns become more prevalent.

TI  - Monitoring bank-line movements of the rivers flowing across the Sundarbans using remote sensing and GIS techniques
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest decussated by a network of alluvial rivers upon the Ganges- Brahmaputra-Meghna basin outlined by recurrent bank erosion and accretion leading to channel pattern modification. Standing against various natural disasters, frequent bank-line changes associated with land loss or gain were observed along the main rivers of Sundarbans, causing major changes in river patterns over decades. Monitoring the morphological changes of the river is the main purpose of this research. The present study has undertaken steps to investigate the bank-line shifting of the eight main rivers located within Sundarbans over the past thirty years. The courses of main rivers from Baleswar to Bidyadhari were analyzed using a combined approach of remote sensing and GIS. Landsat images from USGS Earth Explorer were collected, sorted based on almost identical tidal conditions and digitized along the river banks to quantify and observe the dynamic behaviors of the river bank lines. Critical zones were observed in some parts of the river banks which were classified based on large lateral movements along both the left and right banks. The lateral movement of the river banks observed ranging between 160-1600 meters. Analysis has shown that most of the river banks have shifted land-ward which indicates loss of land except Pussur, Arpangasia and few regions of Baleswar River. The collected satellite data provided useful information on river bank configuration as well as changes in river morphology within the Sundarbans. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Potential biomonitoring of the environmental contamination using snails as sentinel organism: A case study from the Manzala Lagoon, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - For the first time, historical and recent records on fascioliasis in Egypt reveal the results of sympatric and allopatric fluke/snail interactions in the Manzala Lagoon area by exploring the susceptibility of the spe-cies Pseudosuccinea columella after exposure to the Fasciola hepatica isolates from Egypt. Many factors influence trace metal accumulation in Pseudosuccinea columella, including temperature and salinity. Meanwhile, other factors are important in decreasing the bioaccumulation of heavy metals as low pH, low temperature, and high organic content of the substrate. It is indicated, from this study, that the Fe and Cu contamination can be detected in Pseudosuccinea columella species. The abundance of these snails varied all over the seasons where the minimum value was recorded in summer while reaching the max-imum in autumn. Moreover, the abundance increased with increasing rainfall and humidity during the winter season.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

TI  - Papillary Carcinoma of Breast: Clinicopathological Characteristics, Management, and Survival
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To study clinicopathological features, treatment strategies, and prognosis of papillary carcinoma of breast. Material and Methods. Data from 58 patients were retrospectively reviewed from January 2010 to December 2016. Four types of papillary carcinoma (on final resected specimen) were included, i.e., invasive papillary carcinoma (IPC), intracystic (encapsulated) papillary carcinoma (EPC), solid papillary carcinoma (SPC), and papillary DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ). Various features of the four types were observed and compared. Results. Of the 58 patients, 8 were males (13.7%). The mean age at presentation was 61 years; the mean tumor size was 33 mm. The frequency of each histological type was as follows: IPC (n=22/38%), EPC (n=22/38%), SPC (n=12/20.6%), and papillary DCIS (n=2/3.4%). Only two patients were ER negative (both IPC). HER-2 Neu was positive in 3 patients only, out of which 2 died of progressive disease (one EPC and one IPC). LN metastasis was present in 3 (5%) patients (one in each of 1st three types) and only one died of bone metastasis that was also Her-2Neu positive. All patients underwent upfront surgery except two patients who had synchronous IDC on the contralateral side. Breast conservation surgery (BCS) was performed in 34 (58.6%) and mastectomy in 22 (37.9%) patients. 13 patients did not undergo invasive axillary staging; the rest of 43 (74%) patients did (32 sentinel biopsy and 11 axillary dissection). Chemotherapy was given to 18 patients (31%), mostly to IPC (n=12). Only 2 patients had bone metastasis (one was IPC and one EPC). Cancer-related death was observed in 3 patients. For all groups combined, 5-year OS was 98% and DFS was 92%. Conclusion. Overall, papillary carcinoma of the breast has an excellent prognosis, even though less intense treatment modalities were used. It is still difficult to define the optimum management and avoid overtreatment, given the limited data in the literature.

TI  - Assessment of a dual-frequency multi-GNSS smartphone for surveying applications
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the application of a smartphone with dual-frequency multi-constellation GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) receiver in surveying. Measurements are made with the Pixel 5 from the manufacturer Google LLC. The recorded satellite data is evaluated in post-processing with positioning methods based on code and phase observations. The focus here is led on the achievable positioning accuracies and resulting deviations of the different estimated solutions from reference points serving as ground truth. It could be shown that the Pixel 5, although it enables the recording of satellite data on two frequency bands, can only be used to a limited extent in practical surveying tasks because it does not met the accuracy requirements in the centimetre range in our experiments. The low quality of the measurement data is problematic, which is why solutions over two frequency bands and based on phase observations are only possible to a limited extent. Nevertheless, with long observation times, results with a positioning accuracy of less than half a metre can be achieved with the smartphone. Thus, the Pixel 5 can be used for applications with lower accuracy requirements such as data acquisition for Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

TI  - Monitoring the marine invasive alien species <i>Rugulopteryx okamurae</i> using unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rugulopteryx okamurae is a species of brown macroalgae belonging to the Dictyotaceae family and native to the north-western Pacific. As an Invasive Alien Species (IAS), it was first detected in the Strait of Gibraltar in 2015. Since then, R. okamurae has been spreading rapidly through the submerged euphotic zone, colonizing from 0 to 50 m depth and generating substantial economic and environmental impacts on the Andalusian coasts (southern Spain). More than 40% of marine IAS in the European Union (EU) are macroalgae, representing one of the main threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in coastal habitats. This study presents a monitoring pilot of beached R. okamurae and fresh R. okamurae down to 5 m depth in Tarifa (Cadiz, Spain), combining multispectral remote sensing data collected by sensors on-board Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and satellites, and how this information can be used to support decision-making and policy. We used an UAV flight carried out at Bolonia beach (Tarifa, Spain) on 1(st) July 2021 and Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat-8 (L8) image acquisitions close to the drone flight date. In situ data were also measured on the same date of the flight, and they were used to train the supervised classification Super Vector Machine (SVM) method based on the spectral information obtained for each substrate cover. The results obtained show how multispectral images allow the detection of beached R. okamurae, and the classification accuracy for water, land vegetation, sand and R. okamurae depending on the image resolution (8.3 cm/pixel for UAV flight, 10 m/pixel for S2 and 30 m/pixel for L8). While the UAV imagery precisely delimited the area occupied by this macroalgae, satellite data were capable of detecting its presence, and able to generate early warnings. This study demonstrates the usefulness of multispectral remote sensing techniques to be incorporated in continuous monitoring programmes of the marine IAS R. okamurae in coastal areas. This information is also key to supporting regional, national and European policies in order to adapt strategic management of invasive marine macrophytes.

TI  - Remote sensing of aerosols due to biomass burning over Kanpur, Sao-Paulo, Ilorin and Canberra
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol affect the climate in number of ways. In order to investigate these effects, we need a deep insight into aerosols optical, physical and radiative properties. So, to understand aerosols climatology, we investigate the properties of aerosols such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) (500 nm), Angstrom exponent (AE) (440-870 nm), single scattering albedo (SSA), refractive index (RI) and aerosols radiative forcing (ARF). For this purpose, we select four different AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sites located in four different continents; Kanpur, (India) Asia, Sao-Paulo, (Brazil) Southern America, IIorin, (Nigeria) Africa and Canberra, Australia. High AOD and AE is found (AOD = 0.90, AE = 1.31) in November at Kanpur and in September (AOD = 0.39, AE = 1.48) at Sao-Paulo. High AOD (1.06 and 1.12) over IIorin in January and February is found because of fog and haze. SSA shows decreasing trend with increasing wavelengths having minimum value (0.88 and 0.78 at 1020 nm) during the months of DJF and SON over Sao-Paulo and Canberra respectively. The highest value of SSA (similar to 0.96) is found during the months of MAM over IIorin because of presence of coarse aerosols. The low value of SSA over Kanpur during DJF months shows dominance of fine urban/ biomass burning aerosols. Based on the values of AOD, AE and SSA, Canberra is the most pristine site. The estimated ARF values indicate that Kanpur and Ilorin sites exhibit higher TOA and BOA values as compared to Sao-Paulo. ARF at ATM is observed to be 7.4 Wm(-2) higher during JJA months and 10.1 Wm(-2) during SON months than MAM months over Kanpur. We have also observed lowest ARF efficiency (F-BOA(eff)) of - 181 Wm(-2) AOD(550 nm)(-1) during MAM months for Sao-Paulo while the highest value of - 297 Wm(-2) AOD(550 nm)(-1) is observed during DJF months for Kanpur.

TI  - Tree-ring and remote sensing analyses uncover the role played by elevation on European beech sensitivity to late spring frost
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme climate events such as late spring frosts (LSFs) negatively affect productivity and tree growth in temperate beech forests. However, detailed information on how these forests recover after such events are still missing. We inves-tigated how LSFs affected forest cover and radial growth in European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) populations located at different elevations at four sites in the Italian Apennines, where LSFs have been recorded. We combined tree-ring and remote-sensing data to analyse the sensitivity and recovery capacity of beech populations to LSFs. Using daily temper-ature records, we reconstructed LSF events and assessed legacy effects on growth. We also evaluated the role played by elevation and stand structure as modulators of LSFs impacts. Finally, using satellite images we computed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and LAI (Leaf Area Index) to evaluate the post-LSF canopy recovery. The growth reduction in LSF-affected trees ranged from 36 % to 84 %. We detected a negative impact of LSF on growth only during the LSF year, with growth recovery occurring within 1-2 years after the event. LSF-affected stands featured low vegetation indices until late June, i.e. on average 75 days after the frost events. We did not fnd a clear relationship between beech forest elevation and occurrence of LSFs defoliations. Our results indi-cate a high recovery capacity of common beech and no legacy effects of LSFs.

TI  - Role of housing in blood pressure control: a review of evidence from the Smart Wellness Housing survey in Japan
T2  - HYPERTENSION RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Current countermeasures for preventing hypertension emphasize only improvements to lifestyle. Recently, improving life environment has attracted attention, in parallel with publication of the WHO Housing and health guidelines. We quantitatively evaluated the relationship between housing thermal environment and blood pressure (BP) in a real-world setting. We conducted a nationwide, prospective intervention study-the Smart Wellness Housing survey-in Japan, as a non-randomized controlled trial. The intervention was the retrofitting of thermal insulation in houses. Participant recruitment was done by construction companies in all 47 prefectures of Japan. Measurements of home BP and indoor temperature at 1.0 m above the floor in the living room, changing room, and bedroom were taken for 2 weeks before and after the intervention each winter (November-March) of FY 2014-2019. As of July 2022, over 2500 households and 5000 participants were registered in the database. We found that (1) about 90% of Japanese lived in cold homes (minimum indoor temperature <18 degrees C), (2) indoor temperature was non-linearly associated with home BP, (3) morning systolic BP (SBP) was more sensitive than evening SBP to changes in indoor temperature, (4) SBP was influenced by indoor temperature change particularly in older participants and women, (5) unstable indoor temperature was associated with large BP variability, and (6) insulation retrofitting intervention significantly reduced home BP, especially in hypertensive patients. We proposed that the BP reduction effect of the life-environment is comparable to that achievable by lifestyle.Hypertension and cardiovascular diseases are not only lifestyle diseases but also life-environment diseases.

TI  - The impact of VEGF on cancer metastasis and systemic disease
T2  - SEMINARS IN CANCER BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality and the underlying mechanisms of cancer metastasis remain elusive. Both blood and lymphatic vasculatures are essential structures for mediating distal metastasis. The vasculature plays multiple functions, including accelerating tumor growth, sustaining the tumor microenvironment, supplying growth and invasive signals, promoting metastasis, and causing cancer-associated systemic disease. VEGF is one of the key angiogenic factors in tumors and participates in the initial stage of tumor development, progression and metastasis. Consequently, VEGF and its receptor-mediated signaling pathways have become one of the most important therapeutic targets for treating various cancers. Today, anti-VEGF-based antiangiogenic drugs (AADs) are widely used in the clinic for treating different types of cancer in human patients. Despite nearly 20-year clinical experience with AADs, the impact of these drugs on cancer metastasis and sys-temic disease remains largely unknown. In this review article, we focus our discussion on tumor VEGF in cancer metastasis and systemic disease and mechanisms underlying AADs in clinical benefits.

TI  - Spatial and temporal dynamics of <i>aufeis</i> in the Tso Moriri basin, eastern Ladakh, India
T2  - PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aufeis is a common phenomenon in cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere that develops during winter by successive water overflow and freezing on ice-covered surfaces. Most studies on aufeis occurrence focus on regions in North America and Siberia, while research in High Mountain Asia (HMA) is still in an exploratory phase. This study investigates the extent and dynamics of icing processes and aufeis in the Tso Moriri basin, eastern Ladakh, India. Based on a combination of 235 Landsat 5 TM/8 OLI and Sentinel-2 imagery from 2008 to 2021 the occurrence of icing and aufeis was classified using a random forest classifier. A total of 27 frequently occurring aufeis fields with an average maximum extent of 9 km(2) were identified, located at a mean elevation of 4,700 m a.s.l. Temporal patterns show a distinct accumulation phase (icing) between November and April, and a melting phase lasting from May until July. Icing is characterized by high seasonal and inter-annual variability. Successive water overflow mainly occurs between January and March and seems to be related to diurnal freeze-thaw-cycles, whereas higher daytime temperatures result in larger icing areas. Aufeis feeding sources are often located within or in close vicinity to wetland areas, while vegetation is largely absent on surfaces with frequent aufeis formation. These interactions require more attention in future research. In addition, this study shows the high potential of a machine learning approach to monitor icing processes and aufeis, which can be transferred to other regions.

TI  - Revealing spatiotemporal dynamics of forest plantation harvesting practices at landscape level using satellite time series data
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest landscapes dominated by commercial plantations are managed using intensive silvicultural schemes that involve a harvesting-replanting cycle, with clearcutting being one of the most used harvesting methods. Clearcutting has several negative effects, both biotic and abiotic, and to control them, many countries have established exclusion periods and restrictions regarding the amount and distribution of clearcutting areas at landscape level. However, Chile still does not have such restrictions. The main purpose of the study was to analyse forest area trends and to identify the spatiotemporal scales at which clustering of clearcutting areas occurred, between 1999 and 2017. The study area was the coastal zone of the Region of Maule, Chile, dominated by Monterey pine (Pinus radiate D. Don) plantations. We used Landsat 5, 7 and 8 to produce yearly land cover maps to differentiate clearcutting areas from other classes. By using Emerging Hot Spot Analysis, we calculated the spatiotemporal trends of these clearcut areas. We found that harvest clusters have an oscillatory behaviour, ranging from Hot to Cold Spots over the time with an average size of 46.8 km(2) and being active for 2 years (+/- 1.7). Our results support the claim to introduce new regulations to the current Chilean legislation regarding explicit exclusion periods and multiscale forest management.

TI  - Multispectral UAV and satellite images for digital soil modeling with gradient descent boosting and artificial neural network
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensor technology and machine learning (ML) enable rapid and accurate estimation of soil properties. This study aimed to estimate some soil characteristics with different ML algorithms using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Sentinel 2A optical satellite images. Four spectral indices and soil data were statistically compared to assess the performance of estimation. The ML algorithms including Multi-Layer Perception Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN) and Gradient Descent Boosting Tree (GDBT)ML were employed to improve the estimation. Bayesian optimization was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the GDBT ML algorithm. The relationships between vegetation indices calculated using the UAV and Sentinel 2A (S2A)satellite images were examined. Total of 122images were taken for 1.66 ha land with a spatial resolution of 3.99 cm. The Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), and Transformed Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TSAVI) from UAV in rangeland and olive orchards were highly correlated with the same vegetation indices calculated using the S2A image. The RMSE values improved between 23.23 and 35.66% for sand, silt and soil organic matter content in MLP-UAV networks, while the MLP-S2A networks provided 9.73 to 19.85% improvement for pH, clay and soil moisture (SM). The RMSE values in UAV-based GBDT ML algorithms were more successful in estimation of pH, sand, silt, CaCO3, and SM than the S2A models and the relative improvement was between 12.16 and 93.66%. The results showed that (i) estimation success is affected by the spectral response of the soil property as well as statistical characteristics of the observation values, (ii) different optimization techniques as well as the estimation algorithm affect the estimation accuracy, (iii) land use types play an important role in the estimation variance, and (iv) the estimation performance of UAV based models is compatible with the S2A.

TI  - Estimation of Japanese encephalitis virus infection prevalence in mosquitoes and bats through nationwide sentinel surveillance in Indonesia.
T2  - PLoS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia belongs to endemic areas of Japanese encephalitis (JE), yet data regarding the true risk of disease transmission are lacking. While many seroprevalence studies reported its classic enzootic transmission, data related to the role of bats in the transmission of JE virus are limited. This current study aimed to identify the potential role of bats in the local transmission of the JE virus to aid the ongoing active case surveillance in Indonesia, in order to estimate the transmission risk. Mosquitoes and bats were collected from 11 provinces in Indonesia. The detection of the JE virus used polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Maps were generated to analyze the JE virus distribution pattern. Logistic regression analysis was done to identify risk factors of JE virus transmission. JE virus was detected in 1.4% (7/483) of mosquito pools and in 2.0% (68/3,322) of bat samples. Mosquito species positive for JE virus were Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. vishnui, whereas JE-positive bats belonged to the genera Cynopterus, Eonycteris, Hipposideros, Kerivoula, Macroglossus, Pipistrellus, Rousettus, Scotophilus and Thoopterus. JE-positive mosquitoes were collected at the same sites as the JE-positive bats. Collection site nearby human dwellings (AOR: 2.02; P = 0.009) and relative humidity of >80% (AOR: 2.40; P = 0.001) were identified as independent risk factors for JE virus transmission. The findings of the current study highlighted the likely ongoing risk of JE virus transmission in many provinces in Indonesia, and its potential implications on human health.

TI  - Daily Satellite Observations of Nitrogen Dioxide Air Pollution Inequality in New York City, New York and Newark, New Jersey: Evaluation and Application
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Urban air pollution disproportionately harms com-munities of color and low-income communities in the U.S. Intraurban nitrogen dioxide (NO2) inequalities can be observed from space using the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). Past research has relied on time-averaged measurements, limiting our understanding of how neighborhood-level NO2 inequalities co-vary with urban air quality and climate. Here, we use fine-scale (250 m x 250 m) airborne NO2 remote sensing to demonstrate that daily TROPOMI observations resolve a major portion of census tract-scale NO2 inequalities in the New York City-Newark urbanized area. Spatiotemporally coincident TRO-POMI and airborne inequalities are well correlated (r = 0.82-0.97), with slopes of 0.82-1.05 for relative and 0.76-0.96 for absolute inequalities for different groups. We calculate daily TROPOMI NO2 inequalities over May 2018-September 2021, reporting disparities of 25-38% with race, ethnicity, and/or household income. Mean daily inequalities agree with results based on TROPOMI measurements oversampled to 0.01 degrees x 0.01 degrees to within associated uncertainties. Individual and mean daily TROPOMI NO2 inequalities are largely insensitive to pixel size, at least when pixels are smaller than similar to 60 km(2), but are sensitive to low observational coverage. We statistically analyze daily NO2 inequalities, presenting empirical evidence of the systematic overburdening of communities of color and low-income neighborhoods with polluting sources, regulatory ozone co-benefits, and worsened NO2 inequalities and cumulative NO(2 )and urban heat burdens with climate change.

TI  - Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) of Swat District, Hindu Kush Himalayan region of Pakistan, using GIS-based bivariate modeling
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are a recurrent environmental hazard in hilly regions and affect the socioeconomic development in Pakistan. The current study area is the tourism and hydro energy hub of Pakistan and is affected by environmental hazard. A landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) of the Hindu Kush Himalayan, Swat District, Pakistan, can be created to reduce demographic losses due to landslides. This current study is conducted to apply three bivariate models, including weights of evidence (WOE), frequency ratio (FR), and information value (IV) for an LSM that has not been explored or applied in the current study area. For this purpose, first, an inventory map of 495 landslides was constructed from both ground and satellite data and randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) datasets. Furthermore, 10 conditioning factors (elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, fault, rainfall, land use land cover (LULC), lithology, road, and drainage) used for the mapping of landslides were prepared in ArcGIS 10.8. Finally, LSM is generated based on WOE, FR, and IV models and validated the performance of LSM models using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The findings of success rate curve (SRC) of the WOE, FR, and IV models were 67%, 93%, and 64%, respectively, while the prediction rate curves (PRCs) of the three models were 87%, 95%, and 73%, respectively. The validation results for WOE, FR, and IV justified that the FR model is the most reliable technique of all three of these models to produce the highest accuracy LSM for the present study area. Policymakers can use the findings of current research work to mitigate the loss due to landslide hazard.

TI  - Network analysis to identify symptoms clusters and temporal interconnections in oncology patients
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oncology patients experience numerous co-occurring symptoms during their treatment. The identification of sentinel/core symptoms is a vital prerequisite for therapeutic interventions. In this study, using Network Analysis, we investigated the inter-relationships among 38 common symptoms over time (i.e., a total of six time points over two cycles of chemotherapy) in 987 oncology patients with four different types of cancer (i.e., breast, gastrointestinal, gynaecological, and lung). In addition, we evaluated the associations between and among symptoms and symptoms clusters and examined the strength of these interactions over time. Eight unique symptom clusters were identified within the networks. Findings from this research suggest that changes occur in the relationships and interconnections between and among co-occurring symptoms and symptoms clusters that depend on the time point in the chemotherapy cycle and the type of cancer. The evaluation of the centrality measures provides new insights into the relative importance of individual symptoms within various networks that can be considered as potential targets for symptom management interventions.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Accurate estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) using satellite information is crucial for quantitatively evaluating forest carbon stock for climate change mitigation. However, with the emergence of an enormous number of identical data, selecting the most valuable dataset for estimation is essential to improve model efficiency and accuracy. Here, we present a novel framework using principal component analysis (PCA)-derived textures to tackle redundant variables and the integration of multisource satellite images using the random forest regression algorithm with recursive feature elimination to map the AGB of deciduous broadleaf forests in Oita prefecture, Japan. Our results highlighted that the model using PCA and derivative features had the best performance [R-2 = 0.69, root mean square error (RMSE) = 33.59 Mg/ha, mean absolute error = 25.01 Mg/ha, relative RMSE = 0.27]. In this case, of the 34 variables selected by RFE for the model, 19 were derived from principal components and corresponding textures, indicating a considerable improvement in using our novel framework to estimate AGB. Together, this study provides a valuable strategy for feature selection to lessen multicollinearity and redundancy.

In this paper, a global annual surface water cover frequency dataset (GLOBMAP SWF) was generated from the MODIS land surface reflectance products during 2000-2020 to describe the seasonal and interannual dynamics of surface water. Surface water cover frequency (SWF) was proposed as the percentage of the time period when a pixel is covered by water in a year. Instead of determination of the water directly, the SWF was estimated indirectly by identifying land observations among annual clear-sky observations to reduce the influence of clouds and variability of water bodies and surface background characteristics, which helps to improve the applicability of the algorithm for different regions across the globe. The generated dataset shows better performances for frozen water, saline lakes, bright surfaces and regions with frequent cloud cover compared with the two high-frequency surface water datasets derived from MODIS data, and it captures more intermittent surface water but may underestimate small water bodies when compared with two high-resolution datasets derived from Landsat data. Compared with the high-resolution SWF maps extracted from Sentinel-1 data in eight regions that cover lakes, rivers and wetlands, the R-2 reaches 0.46 to 0.97, RMSE ranges from 7.24% to 22.62 %, and MAE is between 2.07% and 7.15 %. In 2020, the area of global maximum surface water extent is 3:38 x 10(6) km(2), of which the permanent surface water accounts for approximately 54% (1:83 x 106 km2), and the other 46% is intermittent surface water (1:55 x 10(6) km(2)). The area of global maximum and permanent surface water has been shrinking since 2001, with a change rate of 7577 and 4315 km(2) yr(-1) ( p < 0 :05), respectively, while the intermittent surface water with the SWF above 50% has been expanding (1368 km(2) yr(-1), p < 0 :01). This dataset can be used to analyze the interannual variation and change trend of highly dynamic inland waters extent with consideration of its seasonal variation. The GLOBMAP SWF data are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6462883 (Liu and Liu, 2022).

TI  - Endocannabinoid signaling in microglia
T2  - GLIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), execute their sentinel, housekeeping and defense functions through a panoply of genes, receptors and released cytokines, chemokines and neurotrophic factors. Moreover, microglia functions are closely linked to the constant communication with other cell types, among them neurons. Depending on the signaling pathway and type of stimuli involved, the outcome of microglia operation can be neuroprotective or neurodegenerative. Accordingly, microglia are increasingly becoming considered cellular targets for therapeutic intervention. Among signals controlling microglia activity, the endocannabinoid (EC) system has been shown to exert a neuroprotective role in many neurological diseases. Like neurons, microglia express functional EC receptors and can produce and degrade ECs. Interestingly, boosting EC signaling leads to an anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective microglia phenotype. Nonetheless, little evidence is available on the microglia-mediated therapeutic effects of EC compounds. This review focuses on the EC signals acting on the CNS microglia in physiological and pathological conditions, namely on the CB1R, CB2R and TRPV1-mediated regulation of microglia properties. It also provides new evidence, which strengthens the understanding of mechanisms underlying the control of microglia functions by ECs. Given the broad expression of the EC system in glial and neuronal cells, the resulting picture is the need for in vivo studies in transgenic mouse models to dissect the contribution of EC microglia signaling in the neuroprotective effects of EC-derived compounds.

TI  - Echo chambers and opinion dynamics explain the occurrence of vaccination hesitancy
T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vaccination hesitancy is a major obstacle to achieving and maintaining herd immunity. Therefore, public health authorities need to understand the dynamics of an anti-vaccine opinion in the population. We introduce a spatially structured mathematical model of opinion dynamics with reinforcement. The model allows as an emergent property for the occurrence of echo chambers, i.e. opinion bubbles in which information that is incompatible with one's entrenched worldview, is probably disregarded. We scale the model both to a deterministic limit and to a weak-effects limit, and obtain bifurcations, phase transitions and the invariant measure. Fitting the model to measles and meningococci vaccination coverage across Germany, reveals that the emergence of echo chambers dynamics explains the occurrence and persistence of the anti-vaccination opinion in allowing anti-vaxxers to isolate and to ignore pro-vaccination facts. We predict and compare the effectiveness of different policies aimed at influencing opinion dynamics in order to increase vaccination uptake. According to our model, measures aiming at reducing the salience of partisan anti-vaccine information sources would have the largest effect on enhancing vaccination uptake. By contrast, measures aiming at reducing the reinforcement of vaccination deniers are predicted to have the smallest impact.

TI  - Mapping Dominant Boreal Tree Species Groups by Combining Area-Based and Individual Tree Crown LiDAR Metrics with Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data are increasingly used to inform sustainable forest management practices. Information about species composition is needed for a range of applications; however, commonly used area-based summaries of LiDAR data are limited to accurately differentiate tree species. The objective of this study was to map dominant species groups across a large (>580,000 ha) boreal forest by combining area-based and individual tree metrics derived from single photon LiDAR data with multispectral information derived from Sentinel-2 imagery. Classification of the forest into jack pine (Pinus banksiana), black spruce (Picea mariana), mixed conifer, mixedwood, and hardwood species groups resulted in an overall accuracy of 67.8% compared with field data. A more generalized classification into softwood, hardwood, and mixedwood had an overall accuracy of 83.2%. The reflectance in the red edge region of the electromagnetic spectrum (lambda = 740 nm), the area and volume of tree crowns, and the cumulative distribution of LiDAR returns in the canopy were particularly important variables to discriminate between species groups. Wall-to-wall predictions of species groups based on remotely sensed data-as derived herein-could provide a spatially-detailed alternative to stand-level species composition information traditionally derived from photo-interpreted aerial imagery.

TI  - Lymph Node Metastases Detection Using Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>@PCD as Novel Multifunctional Contrast Imaging Agent in Metabolic Magnetic Resonance Molecular Imaging
T2  - CONTRAST MEDIA & MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary lymph node detection is crucial to staging and prognosis of the lymph node metastatic spread in breast cancer. Currently, lymphoscintigraphy and blue dye, as the conventional methods to localize sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), are invasive and can only be performed during surgery. This study has had a novel hybrid gadolinium oxide nanoparticle coating with Cyclodextrin-based polyester as a high-relaxivity T-1 magnetic resonance molecular imaging (MRMI) contrast agent (CA). Twelve female BALB/c mice were randomly divided into three groups of four mice; each group was injected with 4T(1) cells to obtain metastasis lymph nodes and diagnosed by using the 3D T1W (VIBE) MRI (Siemens 3T, Prisma). The synthesized Gd2O3@PCD nanoparticles with a suitable particle size range of 20-40 nm have had much higher longitudinal relaxivity (r(1)) for Gd2O3@PCD and Gd-DOTA (Dotarem) with the values of 3.98 mM(-1)center dot s(-1) +/- 0.003 and 2.71 mM(-1)center dot s(-1) +/- 0.005, respectively. Identical MR images in coronal views were subsequently obtained to create time-intensity curves of the right axillary lymph nodes and to measure the contrast ratio (CR). The peak CR and qualitative assessment of axillary lymph nodes at five-time points were evaluated. After subcutaneous injection, the contrast ratio of axillary lymph node and tumor in mice exhibited CR peak of Gd2O3@PCD and Dotarem with the values of 2.21 +/- 0.06 and 0.40 +/- 0.004 for lymph node and 2.54 +/- 0.04 and 1.21 +/- 0.007 for the tumor, respectively. Furthermore, the lumbar-aortic lymph node is weakly visible in the original coronal image. In conclusion, the use of Gd2O3@PCD nanoparticles as novel MRMI CAs enables high resolution for the detection of lymph node metastasis in mice with the potential capability for breast cancer diagnostic imaging.

TI  - Effects of climate change on vegetation and snow cover area in Gilgit Baltistan using MODIS data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalaya (HKH) mountain ranges are the sources of Asia's most important river systems, which provide fresh water to 1.4 billion inhabitants in the region. Environmental and socioeconomic conditions are affected in many ways by climate change. Globally, climate change has received widespread attention, especially regarding seasonal and annual temperatures. Snow cover is vulnerable to climate warming, particularly temperature variations. By employing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets and observed data, this study investigated the seasonal and interannual variability using snow cover, vegetation and land surface temperature (LST), and their spatial and temporal trend on different elevations from 2001 to 2020 in these variables in Gilgit Baltistan (GB), northern Pakistan. The study region was categorized into five elevation zones extending from < 2000 to > 7000 masl. Non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend tests and Sen's slope estimates indicate snow cover increases throughout the winter, but decreases significantly between June and July. In contrast, GB has an overall increasing annual LST trend. Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) reveals a significant positive relationship between vegetation and LST (PCC = 0.73) and a significant negative relationship between LST and snow cover (PCC = - 0.74), and vegetation and snow cover (PCC = - 0.78). Observed temperature data and MODIS LST have a coefficient of determination greater than 0.59. Snow cover decreases at 3000-2000 masl elevations while increases at higher 5000 masl elevations.The vegetation in low and mid-elevation < 4000 masl zones decreases significantly annually. The temperature shows a sharply increasing trend at lower 2000-3000 masl elevations in the autumn, indicating the shifting of the winter seasons at this elevation zone. These findings better explain the spatiotemporal variations in snow cover, vegetation, and LST at various elevation zones and the interactions between these parameters at various elevations across the HKH region.

TI  - How well do recently reconstructed solar-induced fluorescence datasets model gross primary productivity?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The collection of various long-term reconstructed solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) datasets derived at a range of spatio-temporal scales provides new opportunities for modelling vegetation dynamics, in particular, gross pri-mary productivity (GPP). Information about the proximity of the reconstructed SIF (SIFr) datasets to GPP across land cover types and climatic conditions provides important support for a better application of these products for modelling applications. We conducted a multiscale analysis of four different long-term (12 years, 2007-2018) high-resolution global SIFr datasets (0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees), namely - CSIF (Contiguous SIF), GOSIF (Global OCO-2 SIF), LUE-SIF (Light Use Efficiency SIF), and HSIF (Harmonized SIF) -at 4-day, 8-day, and monthly time scales and found that for the majority of sites, the SIFr is linearly related to ground-based GPP measurements with the eddy covariance method. While the relationship between SIFr and GPP (i.e., the slope -GPP/SIFr) varied significantly across the SIFr datasets, sites, and land cover types, all four SIFr datasets were unequivocally a better predictor of GPP compared to remotely sensed vegetation indices - NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and EVI (enhanced vegetation index), sensed by the MODIS satellite. Furthermore, we also analyzed SIF-GPP relation-ships during drought vs non-drought conditions and found that for about 30% of the sites, comprising mostly non-forests site, the SIF-GPP relationship became weaker (decreased R2) with a lower slope during drought conditions compared to non-drought conditions. Among the four different products, the CSIF (at 4-day timescale) and GOSIF (at 8-day timescale) predicted GPP better compared to LUE-SIF and HSIF across all land cover types. Owing to their long-term availability (since 2000 for CSIF and GOSIF), these SIFr datasets combined with proxies of ecosystem properties can be used to appropriately capture vegetation dynamics and the interannual vari-abilities across a wide range of climatic conditions.

TI  - Bioaccumulation of trace metals and genotoxicity responses in <i>Liza aurata</i> as an indicator of industrial pollution
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy metal contamination in the coastal and marine ecosystems is becoming a serious risk to aquatic organisms and humans. This study reports the effects, including genetic damage, of accumulations of trace metals on Liza aurata, which is used as a bio-indicator species, in the Payas coast of Iskenderun Bay, north-eastern Mediterranean by COMET Assay. L. aurata were seasonally collected from a sampling site and a reference site for one year. Physicochemical parameters in water and trace metals in the tissues of fish collected from these sites were determined by electrochemical techniques. High DNA damage frequency in L. aurata was observed along the Payas coast of Iskenderun Bay compared to the reference site because of pollutants. The detected high levels of Cd, Pb, Fe and Cu accumulation in L. aurata exceed the maximum levels allowed by the national and international limit values. Significant positive correlations between Cd, Pb, Hg, Cr, Fe, Zn, and Cu accumulations and DNA damage parameters were observed in the present study. Additionally, we first reported the successful use of the electrochemical technique in the determination of trace metal concentrations in mullet. Moreover, L. aurata constitutes a key tool as a sentinel organism for biomonitoring of coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Are the diets of sympatric Pygoscelid penguins more similar than previously thought?
T2  - POLAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, functional changes in Southern Ocean are becoming more noticeable, due to climate change and increasing human impacts, including a growing fishery that is concentrating in the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) region. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is often the primary prey species for animals such as Pygoscelis penguins, a sentinel species for ecosystem monitoring and management. During the last two decades in the AP gentoo penguin numbers (Pygoscelis papua) have increased and their range has shifted southward, in contrast to the decline in numbers of Adelie (P. adeliae) and chinstrap (P. antarcticus) penguins. Given divergent population trends, the goal of this study was to examine differences in their diet, and size structure of Antarctic krill recovered from penguin diet samples. The study is based on diet samples collected during the austral summers on King George Island (South Shetland Islands) where P. adeliae, P. antarcticus, and P. papua breed in mixed colonies. Results indicate that the penguins consumed krill of similar sizes during the breeding period. In contrast to prior diet studies, we found higher proportions of krill in the gentoo diet and changes in the percentage of krill in the diet relative obtained during 1970s. The similarity in diets among all three species suggests that the availability prey items (e. g., fishes) may be changing and driving higher dietary overlap. Moreover, we also check differences in krill length among penguin individuals and we did not find any statistically significant differences. We also found plastic debris in penguin stomachs during both summers.

TI  - Regional prediction of Fusarium head blight occurrence in wheat with remote sensing based Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fusarium head blight (FHB) is one of the major fungal diseases affecting wheat production worldwide, influencing kernel development and producing poisonous mycotoxins. Mechanistic models have been extensively used for plant disease simulation; however, regional disease prediction using these models is difficult because they simplify the heterogeneous plant growth conditions. Herein, we present a remote sensing based SusceptibleExposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model for regional prediction of FHB occurrence in wheat. Plant properties that are key to the development of FHB are extracted from remote sensing data or data products to initialize or drive the model. Fractional vegetation cover products, time-series curves from satellite images, and vegetation indices were used to indicate plant density, phenology, and vegetation vigor. We applied our model to a plain region in China that suffers greatly from FHB annually. The SEIR model was parameterized by incorporating remote sensing data products, and then calibrated and verified for regional FHB prediction. The model was trained and evaluated by comparing the results of its prediction of FHB incidence to field observations during the susceptible period for wheat; satisfactory results were observed with a correlation coefficient of 0.804, root mean-square error of 0.131, classification accuracy of 0.860, and missed detection rate of 0.035 when the model was initialized with the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI). The disease progress curves furnished by our model display an S-shape-a characteristic of polycyclic diseases-which matches the wheat FHB epidemiology. These results indicate that our remote sensing-based SEIR model is promising for the regional prediction of FHB occurrence in wheat.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) inversion using remote sensing is a crucial tool to study the land surface thermal environment. To improve the resolution of the inverted LST, a downscaling method is used but it often reduces the accuracy. Here, a difference mean distribution (DMD) method was developed to post-process the downscaled LST. Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 images were used to test and Field measured LSTs in Tianjin, China were used to verify the method. Results show DMD method reduces MAE and RMSE by 1.36 degrees C and 1.50 degrees C, respectively indicating that it can improve the accuracy of the downscaled LST.

TI  - Stannous colloid mixed with indocyanine green as a tracer for sentinel lymph node navigation surgery
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The combined use of a vital dye and radioactive colloid reportedly performs better in detecting sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) for cancers than the use of either of them alone. However, especially for gastric cancer, two endoscopic procedures are required to administer these two tracers, which burdens the patients and practitioners. Here we propose the use of stannous colloid (SnC) mixed with indocyanine green (ICG) as a new mixed tracer (SnC-ICG); its characteristics were investigated in vivo and in vitro to estimate its usefulness for SLN navigation. The tracers were administered to rats and the accumulation of radioactivity and/or near-infrared fluorescence were evaluated in the regional lymph nodes (LNs) using single positron emission computed tomography and near-infrared fluorescence imaging, respectively. SnC-ICG showed significantly better clearance from the injection site and better migration to primary LNs than the single administration of SnC or ICG aqueous solution. SnC-ICG demonstrated a wide particle size variability, stabilized to 1200-nm upon the addition of albumin in vitro; These properties could contribute to its behavior in vivo. The use of SnC-ICG could contribute better performance to detect SLNs for gastric cancer with less burden on both patients and medical practitioners.

TI  - Past and future impacts of urbanisation on land surface temperature in Greater Cairo over a 45 year period
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and unplanned urbanisation can lead to altered local climate by increasing land surface tempera-ture (LST), particularly in summer months. This study investigates the Urban Heat Island (UHI) in Greater Cairo, Egypt, using remote sensing techniques to estimate LST of summer months over 45 years (1986, 2000, 2017, and predicted year 2030). The research objectives and steps were, 1-mapped land use/ land cover (LULC), 2-conducted spatiotemporal analysis of LST, with a comparison of change in LST across dif-ferent land cover types, 3-predicted future LST for 2030, and 4-examined this temporal change for a hot-spot area (ring road) and a cool-spot area (the River Nile). The results showed that urban areas have increased over the last 30 years by 179.9 km2 (13 %), while agriculture areas decreased by 148 km2 (12 %) and water bodies decreased by 6 km2 (0.5 %). The mean LST over Greater Cairo increased over time, from 31.3 degrees C (1986) to 36.0 degrees C (2017) and is predicted to reach 37.9 degrees C in 2030. While a notable rise of mean LST in the Cairo ring road buffer zone (88 km2), where it was 31.1 degrees C (1986), and 37 degrees C (2017) due to the triple increase of urban areas on account of agriculture areas, and the LST it may reach 38.9 degrees C by 2030. The mean LST increased slightly more in urban hot-spot areas than in cooler cultivated areas. UHI may induce a modification in the local climate that can negatively affect agricultural land, and human thermal comfort and unfortunately lead to a less sustainable environment.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - The FoxP1 gene regulates lung function, production of matrix metalloproteinases and inflammatory mediators, and viability of lung epithelia
T2  - RESPIRATORY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Genes involved in lung development may become dysregulated in adult life and contribute to the pathogenesis of lung diseases. Multiple genes regulate lung development, including Forkhead box protein P1-4 (FoxP1-4). Methods We examined the association between variants in the FoxP1-4 genes and lung function using data from a GWAS that included close to 400,000 individuals and 20 million SNPs. Results More than 100 variants in the FoxP1 gene, but none in the FoxP2-4 genes, are associated with lung function. The sentinel variant in the FoxP1 gene associated with FEV1 was rs1499894 (C > T), while the sentinel variant in the FoxP1 gene associated with FVC was rs35480566 (A > G). Those with the T allele instead of the C allele for rs1499894, or the G allele instead of the A allele for rs35480566 had increased FoxP1 mRNA levels in transcriptomic data, higher FEV1 and FVC, and reduced odds of being diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Further, knockdown of FoxP1 in lung epithelial cells by RNA interference led to increased mRNA levels for matrix metalloproteinases 1, 2, 3 and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 & IL-8, as well as reduced cell viability after exposure to cigarette smoke-all processes implicated in the pathogenesis of COPD and IPF. Conclusions Our results suggest that the protein encoded by the FoxP1 gene may protect against the development of COPD and IPF. A causal role for FoxP1 in the pathogenesis of COPD and IPF may warrant further investigation, and FoxP1 may be a novel therapeutic target for these lung disorders.

TI  - Assessing bare-ice albedo simulated by MAR over the Greenland ice sheet (2000-2021) and implications for meltwater production estimates
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) has accelerated over the past decades, mainly due to enhanced surface melting and liquid water runoff in response to atmospheric warming. A large portion of runoff from the GrIS originates from exposure of the darker bare ice in the ablation zone when the overlying snow melts, where surface albedo plays a critical role in modulating the energy available for melting. In this regard, it is imperative to understand the processes governing albedo variability to accurately project future mass loss from the GrIS. Bare-ice albedo is spatially and temporally variable and contingent on non-linear feedbacks and the presence of light-absorbing constituents. An assessment of models aiming at simulating albedo variability and associated impacts on meltwater production is crucial for improving our understanding of the processes governing these feedbacks and, in turn, surface mass loss from Greenland. Here, we report the results of a comparison of the bare-ice extent and albedo simulated by the regional climate model Modele Atmospherique Regional (MAR) with satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the GrIS below 70 degrees N. Our findings suggest that MAR overestimates bare-ice albedo by 22.8 % on average in this area during the 2000-2021 period with respect to the estimates obtained from MODIS. Using an energy balance model to parameterize meltwater production, we find this bare-ice albedo bias can lead to an underestimation of total meltwater production from the bare-ice zone below 70 degrees N of 42.8 % during the summers of 2000-2021.

TI  - Global intellectual history in International Relations: Hierarchy, empire, and the case of late colonial Indian international thought
T2  - REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eurocentric critique of the International Relations discipline has brought welcome attention to non-European international thinkers, and anti-colonial or anti-imperial thinkers in particular. Frequently these thinkers and associated movements are rightly described in thematic terms of emancipation, equality, and justice, in opposition to the hierarchical worldview of empires and their acolytes. Notwithstanding the broad validity of this depiction, a purely oppositional picture risks obscuring those aspects of 'non-European' international thought that evade simple categorisation. Drawing upon archival material and historical works, this article applies approaches offered by global intellectual history to the works of late colonial Indian international thinkers, exploring the mixed registers of equality and hierarchy, internationalism and imperialism present in their writings. Concentrating on three 'sites' connected by the common themes of diaspora and mobility: the plight of Indians overseas in East Africa; the concept of 'greater India'; and the international political thought of Benoy Kumar Sarkar, the article complicates the internationalism/imperialism divide of the early twentieth century, showing how ostensibly opposed scholarly communities sometimes competed over similar forms of knowledge and ways of ordering the world. This offers a framework by which the contributions of global intellectual history can be applied to the study of international political thought.

TI  - The spatial-temporal consistency of chlorophyll-a and fishery resources in the water of the Zhoushan archipelago revealed by high resolution remote sensing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Details of the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) distribution in the water of the Zhoushan archipelago were analyzed based on data from the panchromatic multispectral sensor (PMS) of the GaoFen-6 (GF-6). A new Chl-a inversion model was built using in-situ Chl-a and the green-red bands of the 2 m spatial resolution GF-6/PMS image. Combined with fishery data, the relationship between Chl-a concentration and fish resources were revealed. The results show that: (1) High Chl-a concentration area was mainly concentrated in the nearshore intensive islands waters, and Chl-a concentration changes obviously with the change of tidal currents. Chl-a concentration around islands increases, especially downstream of islands. Seasonally, Chl-a concentration is higher in spring and summer, lower in autumn, and lowest in winter. (2) The change of fish eggs and larvae in the water of the Zhoushan archipelago shows consistency with the spatial distribution and seasonal variation of Chl-a. (3) The interaction between tidal currents and islands results in the diverse currents (upstream upwelling and downstream vortex currents) around the islands, promoting vertical water exchange and the uplifting of nutrients, resulting in a high overall Chl-a concentration in the waters around the islands. The diverse flow conditions, the ideal nutrient-rich environment, and the abundant phytoplankton attract a large number of fish to gather and breed in the waters around the islands. (4) Chl-a of intensive island waters is an essential indicator for fish spawning grounds.

TI  - Damage to anthropic elements estimation due to large slope instabilities through multi-temporal A-DInSAR analysis
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DsGSDs) are widespread phenomena in the Alpine environment. Their dynamics, although very slow, endanger human settlements and connecting infrastructures. Monitoring such phenomena is mandatory to evaluate the impact on infrastructure networks and inhabited areas. Nowadays, the implementation of a tool useful to define and manage the interactions of DsGSDs evolution and the anthropic element remains a challenge, particularly in land use planning. Apart from on-site monitoring, which is commonly poorly used for DsGSDs observation, satellite-based interferometry represents the most comprehensive instrument for an effective spatial and temporal characterization of these phenomena. This paper provides a dedicated procedure to assess the usability of Advanced Differential Interferometric SAR (A-DInSAR) techniques to explore the DsGSDs behaviour and investigate their local interaction along anthropic elements. Combining multi-temporal A-DInSAR data, ERS-1/2 (1992-2000), Radarsat-1/2 (2003-2010), COSMO-SkyMed (2011-2018) and Sentinel-1 (2014-2018), over the Motta de Plete and Champlas du Col DsGSDs, north-western Italy, a line-of-sight displacement investigation over a long-time span is implemented. Multi-temporal deformation maps are generated to define the deformation pattern and DsGSDs evolution over time. Subsequently, a local-scale analysis along the main anthropic elements is performed, exploiting V-slope values and ground deformation time series, integrated with ground-based ones, where available. This local analysis is aimed to recognize the most critical sections of the anthropic elements along with an higher level of damage, and potential risk is expected. Moreover, the obtained results are compared with a survey damage of the anthropic elements for a local cross-check and to strengthen the A-DInSAR methodology. Overall, the presented methodology provides a powerful tool to better define the DsGSDs local dynamics in correspondence of the main strategic infrastructures and inhabited areas, for a proper infrastructure maintenance and territorial planning strategy.

TI  - Identifying spatio-temporal trends in seagrass meadows to inform future restoration
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass restoration requires information on a range of factors including site environmental conditions, appropriate planting techniques, and the identification of sites most likely to support seagrass. To address the question of where to focus restoration efforts, a key first step is to identify trends in the spatio-temporal distribution of seagrasses to identify areas of persistence, loss, and recent gains. Areas of recent recovery (and adjacent areas), can then be targeted by practitioners for assisted recovery and restoration, whilst areas of persistent loss can be avoided. Here we identified the contemporary distribution, density, and species composition of seagrass ecosystems (using Sentinel 2 imagery and supervised object-based imagery analysis) and integrated these data with historic extents to identify spatio-temporal trends in seagrass distribution in Western Port, Victoria, Australia. Contemporary classifications demonstrated acceptable accuracies (Overall Accuracy 0.77-0.85, User Accuracy 0.76-0.97) and predicted a contemporary seagrass extent of 222 km(2); with 48 km(2) of low-density recovery predicted to have occurred since 1999. Comparisons with historical seagrass extents indicated some seagrass recovery since large-scale losses in 1983, although some areas of loss were also present. Recovery included a net gain of approximately 95 km(2) in the past 20 years and an eastward range expansion; suggesting environmental conditions have improved and are now conducive for restoration efforts in some areas. Results demonstrate that accurate, low-cost, remote sensing of seagrass ecosystems is possible and show how understanding spatio-temporal trends can guide the spatial allocation of resources by prioritizing areas for restoration where recovery is beginning to occur.

TI  - Quantifying international and interstate contributions to primary ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> in a complex metropolitan atmosphere
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We quantify the contributions of long-range and regionally transported aerosols to ambient primary PM2.5 and PM10 in a representative United States industrialized/urban atmosphere via detailed elemental analysis and chemical mass balance (CMB) modeling after identifying their presence using a variety of publicly available satellite data/information, software products, and synoptic-scale aerosol models. A year-long study in Houston, Texas identified North African dust as the principal long-range global source of primary particulate matter (PM). CMB estimated transatlantic dust from the Sahara-Sahel region to be dominant in the summer months contributing an average of 3.5 mu g m(-3) to PM2.5 and 7.9 mu g m(-3) to PM10 during May-August, i.e., the active Saharan dust season. Biomass burning was the chief source of regionally transported PM impacting air quality on different occasions throughout the year depending on the fire location. Four major biomass combustion events affecting air quality in Texas were calculated to contribute an average of 1.3 mu g m(-3) to PM2.5 and 1.4 mu g m(-3) to PM10 in corresponding samples whose origins were tracked to Canada, southeastern states of USA, and Central America using fire maps, HYSPLIT back trajectories, and the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System global aerosol model. Elemental concentrations and signature ratios revealed significant mixing of potassium, rare earth metals, and vanadium from proximal and distal crustal (natural) sources with anthropogenically emitted PM. This demonstrates the need to isolate the non-mineral components of these metals to employ them as tracers for primary PM emitted by biomass burning, petroleum refineries, and oil combustion. Transboundary contributions to primary PM2.5 were 1.5 mu g m(-3) and 3.1 mu g m(-3) to PM10 adding 16% to annual average mass concentration of both size fractions demonstrating that local sources were primarily responsible for ambient air quality with non-trivial contributions from international and interstate sources. Rigorously identifying and quantifying aerosol sources assists in improving air quality management policies designed to protect public health and comply with ever-decreasing federal PM standards that allow state agencies to exclude contributions that are not reasonably controllable or preventable from regulatory decisions and actions.

TI  - Applications of indocyanine green fluorescence imaging in colorectal surgery: a narrative review
T2  - ANNALS OF LAPAROSCOPIC AND ENDOSCOPIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background and Objective: The need to optimize visualization systems in minimally invasive surgery has given rise to a growing number of applications of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence. This narrative review aims to summarize the existing literature about the use of this fluorophore in colon and rectal surgery.Methods: A literature search was performed using PubMed database to identify relevant articles on ICG fluorescence guided surgery and colorectal surgery. Key Content and Findings: ICG fluorescent angiography has proved to be a useful tool to assess intestinal resection line perfusion, but study heterogeneity, low statistical power and confounding evidence have prevented demonstrating a decrease in anastomotic leak in colorectal surgery. Although the application of ICG near-infrared fluorescence is a safe and reliable technique for evaluating the lymphatic flow and detecting sentinel lymph nodes in colorectal surgery, especially in early cancer stage setting, current evidence does not allow to determine its use in routine clinical practice and it is far from being sufficient to establish ultra-selective colectomies programs. Endoscopic submucosal ICG injection allows intraoperative tumor site location when performed up to a week prior to surgery, but cost-effectiveness research need to define its advantage compared to traditional permanent dyes. Intraureteral ICG instillation may reduce ureteral iatrogenic lesions, but its invasive administration prevents its use in daily routine patients.Conclusions: ICG fluorescence-based technology represents a niche of opportunities for improved visualization in the field of minimally invasive surgery. However, with the exception of angiography for the intraoperative evaluation of intestinal perfusion, the currently available evidence limits the indication for routine use of the rest of the applications. Future development of quantitative fluorescence measurement methods and established protocols may achieve better performance of this tool.

TI  - Development of a Practical Screening Tool to Predict Sarcopenia in Patients on Maintenance Hemodialysis
T2  - MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sarcopenia is a common complication in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) and can increase patient hospital-ization and mortality. No simple and reliable tools to identify sarcopenia exist. We aimed to develop a screen-ing tool to predict MHD patients at high risk for sarcopenia.Material/Methods: This cross-sectional study included 589 and 216 MHD patients for training and validation sets, respectively. We used diagnostic criteria developed by the Asian Working Group on Sarcopenia to screen for sarcopenia. The risk prediction model was established by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), calibration curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and decision curve analysis (DCA) to evaluate the model's discrimination ability, calibration ability, and clinical utility.Results: The incidence of sarcopenia was 17.1% in the training set and 18.1% in the validation set. We constructed pre-diction models applying age, body mass index, calf circumference, and serum creatinine and plotted a nomo-gram. The training set model had an AUROC of 0.922, sensitivity of 85.1%, specificity of 85.9%, and chi-square value (Hosmer-Lemeshow test) of 5.603 (P>0.05); the DCA diagram showed that when the threshold probabil-ity was 0 to 0.95, the model predicted a net benefit for sarcopenia in MHD patients. The validation set mod-el had an AUROC of 0.913, sensitivity of 94.3%, specificity of 82.9%, and chi-square value (Hosmer-Lemeshow test) of 9.822 (P>0.05).Conclusions: The screening tool has good discrimination ability, calibration ability, and clinical utility. It could help to identi-fy MHD patients at a high risk for sarcopenia.

TI  - Multiscale mineralogical investigations for mineral potentiality mapping of Ras El-Kharit-Wadi Khashir district, Southern Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Through various scales of observation, ranging from remote sensing data, field investigations, hand spec-imens, microscopic petrographic examinations, XRD, to SEM, indicators of various mineralization types are highlighted in Ras El-kharit-wadi Khashir (Eastern Desert, Egypt). Systematic remote sensing explo-ration of the mineralized zones is performed through integrating Sentinel 2 and ASTER datasets. False -color combinations, informative band ratios, relative absorption band depth, and CEM techniques were applied to discriminate rock units and various types of hydrothermal alterations. Moreover, ALOS PALSAR DEM was utilized to decipher the structural lineaments. Intensive field investigations confirmed hydrothermally altered zones that were picked out through remote sensing analysis and revealed that the study area is affected by cataclastic metamorphism to some extent. Magmatic and metamorphic rock types are represented by propylitic, phyllic, argillic, and silicification zones. Sericitization, chloritization, epidotization, kaolinitization, carbonatization, and silicification are recorded utilizing petrographic and remote sensing investigations. Moreover, the current study reveals that the detected alteration is the main reason for the apparent wide range of petrographic characteristics of each rock type and bearing several opaque minerals, such as pyrite, magnetite, titanomagnetite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, covellite, galena, goethite, and hematite. Most of these opaques were identified using ore microscopy, XRD, and SEM. The distribution of hydrothermal alterations, representative samples bearing mineralization, struc-turally dissected zones are integrated to build a mineral potentiality map of the study area. The resultant MPM was confirmed via field survey and emphasized the usefulness of the current integrated approach besides highlighting about 125 km2 as potential mineralized zones.

TI  - Simulation of Forest Distribution in the Qilian Mountains of China with a Terrain-based Logistic Regression Model
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting vegetation distribution strengthens ecosystem management, protection, and restoration in arid and degraded areas. However, data quality and incomplete data coverage limit prediction accuracy for Picea crassifolia Kom. (Qinghai spruce) forest in the Qilian Mountains of China. Here, we used a logistic regression model combined with high-resolution vegetation distribution data for different sampling scales and digital elevation models (DEMs) to determine the potential distribution of P. crassifolia forest in the Dayekou catchment in the Qilian Mountains. We found that the model with the best simulation accuracy was based on data with a DEM scale of 30 m and a sampling accuracy of 90 m (Nagelkerke's R-2 = 0.48 and total prediction accuracy = 83.89%). The main factors affecting the distribution of P. crassifolia forest were elevation and potential solar radiation. We conclude that it is feasible to calculate the distribution of arid mountain forests based on terrain and that terrain data at 30 m spatial resolution can fully support the simulation of P. crassifolia forest distribution. Study Implications Data used for species predictions in mountainous areas are often scarce. Terrain data can be obtained relatively easily, and many factors, including temperature, soil moisture, solar radiation, and soil fertility, are influenced by and change with topography. Therefore, modeling vegetation distribution with topographic data alone may be highly desirable. However, data quality and scale limit the prediction accuracy of a model. Thus, we applied high-definition remote sensing data of Picea crassifolia Kom. forest at different digital elevation models (DEMs) and sampling scales to establish a DEM-based basic model of P. crassifolia forest distribution in the Qilian Mountains using a logistic regression equation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background Previous studies have explored the potential on radiomics features of primary breast cancer tumor to identify axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis. However, the value of deep learning (DL) to identify ALN metastasis remains unclear. Purpose To investigate the potential of the proposed attention-based DL model for the preoperative differentiation of ALN metastasis in breast cancer on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI). Study Type Retrospective. Population A total of 941 breast cancer patients who underwent DCE-MRI before surgery were included in the training (742 patients), internal test (83 patients), and external test (116 patients) cohorts. Field Strength/Sequence A 3.0 T MR scanner, DCE-MRI sequence. Assessment A DL model containing a 3D deep residual network (ResNet) architecture and a convolutional block attention module, named RCNet, was proposed for ALN metastasis identification. Three RCNet models were established based on the tumor, ALN, and combined tumor-ALN regions on the images. The performance of these models was compared with ResNet models, radiomics models, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) model, and three radiologists (W.L., H.S., and F. L.). Statistical Tests Dice similarity coefficient for breast tumor and ALN segmentation. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, intercorrelation and intracorrelation coefficients, area under the curve (AUC), and Delong test for ALN classification. Results The optimal RCNet model, that is, RCNet(-tumor+ALN), achieved an AUC of 0.907, an accuracy of 0.831, a sensitivity of 0.824, and a specificity of 0.837 in the internal test cohort, as well as an AUC of 0.852, an accuracy of 0.828, a sensitivity of 0.792, and a specificity of 0.853 in the external test cohort. Additionally, with the assistance of RCNet(-tumor+ALN), the radiologists' performance was improved (external test cohort, P < 0.05). Data Conclusion DCE-MRI-based RCNet model could provide a noninvasive auxiliary tool to identify ALN metastasis preoperatively in breast cancer, which may assist radiologists in conducting more accurate evaluation of ALN status.

TI  - An Early Warning Intelligent Algorithm System for Forest Resource Management and Monitoring
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of remote sensing technology has passed an effective means for forest resource management and monitoring, but remote sensing technology is limited by sensor hardware equipment, and the quality of remote sensing image data is low, which is difficult to meet the needs of forest resource change monitoring. This paper presents a remote sensing image classification method based on the combination of the SSIF algorithm and wavelet denoising. Forest information is extracted from PALSAR/PALSAR-2 radar remote sensing data. The forest distribution map is generated by pixel level fusion algorithm, and the accuracy of the forest distribution map is evaluated by a confusion matrix. The remote sensing image is spatio-temporal fused by the SSIF algorithm to capture more details of forest distribution. The simulation analysis shows that the overall accuracy of the forest classification results obtained by the fusion algorithm is 96% +/- 1, and the kappa coefficient is 0.66. The accuracy of forest recognition meets the requirements.

TI  - Pathological findings in stranded harbor porpoises (<i>Phocoena phocoena</i>) with special focus on anthropogenic causes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Humans impact natural systems at an unprecedented rate. The North Sea is one of the regions in the world with the highest levels of anthropogenic activity. Here, the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) is an abundant species and is often regarded as an ecosystem sentinel. A post-mortem surveillance program was established in the Netherlands aimed at increasing knowledge of the effects of human activities on harbor porpoises. In this study, we describe the pathological findings related to anthropogenic and natural causes of death categories in 612 harbor porpoises that stranded between 2008 and 2019, and assess their relations to age, sex, season, and location. The largest anthropogenic category was bycatch (17%), with mainly juveniles affected and peak periods in March and September-October. Other, infrequently diagnosed anthropogenic causes of death were trauma (4%), largely most likely due to ship collisions, and marine debris ingestion and entanglement (0.3%). The risk of dying from anthropogenic causes was highest for juveniles. Lesions compatible with noise-induced hearing loss were investigated in carcasses which were fresh enough to do so (n = 50), with lesions apparent in two porpoises. Non-direct human-induced threats included infectious diseases, which were by far the largest cause of death category (32%), and affected mainly adults. Also, gray seal (Halichoerus grypus) attacks were a frequently assigned cause of death category (24%). There were more acute predation cases in the earlier study years, while porpoises with lesions that suggested escape from gray seal attacks were diagnosed more recently, which could suggest that porpoises adapted to this threat. Our study contributes to understanding porpoise health in response to persisting, new, emerging, and cumulative threats. Building up such knowledge is crucial for conservation management of this protected species.

TI  - Towards realistic dynamic topography from coast to offshore by incorporating hydrodynamic and geoid models
T2  - OCEAN MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major factors preventing utilization of realistic sea-level data is that various sources are referred to inconsistent vertical reference datum (VRD). This study presents a methodology for deriving instantaneous and realistic sea level data from the coastal to offshore areas of the Baltic Sea, by synergizing different sources of sea level data (tide-gauge (TG), hydrodynamic model (HDM) and satellite altimetry (SA)). The key component being the geoid that links the VRD of these different sources.HDMs are known to be a representable source of sea level data, however their VRD is often undisclosed. Therefore, they are often spatially and temporally biased with respect to in-situ data. This study demonstrates that by using geoid-referenced TG data that represents 'realistic' sea level it is possible to correct HDM, by deriving and applying a spatial bias correction. Three interpolation methods (linear, thin plate spline regression, and inverse distance weighted) are examined to derive the corrected HDM. The results showed an improvement with respect to TG data, and the annual mean dynamic topography of corrected HDM was improved by a factor of almost 1.5. Examination of the Sentinel-3A satellite along-track data also confirms the corrected HDM data to be more accurate. The methodology applied also identified problematic locations of HDM, SA and geoid data along with unreliable TG. This accuracy and conformity in sea level data are urgently required for a comprehensive understanding of climate change, marine engineering and navigation applications, which can be achieved by adapting the uniquely defined geoid for the vertical reference datum.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In this research, the spatial distribution map of agricultural greenhouses in Tartus (Syria) was created using Sentinel-2 and high-resolution Google Earth Pro images in 2020. The potential expansion map of agricultural greenhouses was created by a set of topographic, climatic, ecological, infrastructure and land use-land cover criteria using GIS and remote sensing techniques. Our results show that the area covered by protected agriculture was about 5% of the total study area. Slightly more than half of the study area has constraints on the potential expansion of greenhouses, and two-third of the remaining area has high potential. Assessment of the methodology used in this research indicates high effectiveness with an overall accuracy of 96.6%. The obtained maps can provide vital information for land-use planning and management in Syria. The methodology proposed in this research could be used to map and assess the potential expansion of different cultivations.

TI  - Translation, an infinite process?
T2  - FRENCH CULTURAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - On the basis of the problematization of the relationships between translatability and untranslatability, tradition and translation, we try to clear the impact of cultural context on the translator's choices. This impact is illustrated through three French translations of the opening stanza of the famous Hamlet monologue (III, 1), those of Voltaire, Francois-Victor Hugo and Yves Bonnefoy. The adopted perspective focuses on the philosophical dimension, the cultural horizon and the historicity of the act of translating. The starting hypothesis postulates that the translation can be considered as a rewriting of the original, which reflects a poetics and a worldview that reveal the functioning of the literature of a language-culture at a given time. Then the translational analysis can shed some light on the mechanisms of this conditioning. The developed reasoning leads to the conclusion that even though any translation depends on its cultural and historical space, the ethical aim requires to preserve the letter and the spirit of the source text.

TI  - Multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry for the discovery of environmentally modulated proteins in an aquatic invertebrate sentinel species, Gammarus fossarum
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry is emerging as a relevant tool for measuring customized molecular markers in freshwater sentinel species. While this technique is typically used for the validation of protein molecular markers preselected from shotgun experiments, recent gains of MRM multiplexing capacity offer new possibilities to conduct large-scale screening of animal proteomes. By combining the strength of active biomonitoring strategies and MRM technologies, this study aims to propose a new strategy for the discovery of candidate proteins that respond to environmental variability. For this purpose, 249 peptides derived from 147 proteins were monitored by MRM in 273 male gammarids caged in 56 environmental sites, representative of the diversity of French water bodies. A methodology is here proposed to identify a set of customized housekeeping peptides (HKPs) used to correct analytical batch effects and allow proper comparison of peptide levels in gammarids. A comparative analysis performed on HKPs-normalized data resulted in the identification of peptides highly modulated in the environment and derived from proteins likely involved in the environmental stress response. Overall, this study proposes a breakthrough approach to screen and identify potential proteins responding to relevant environmental conditions in sentinel species.

TI  - Tracking vegetation phenology of pristine northern boreal peatlands by combining digital photography with CO<sub>2</sub> flux and remote sensing data
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology, which refers to the seasonal changes in plant physiology, biomass and plant cover, is affected by many abiotic factors, such as precipitation, temperature and water availability. Phenology is also associated with the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere. We employed digital cameras to monitor the vegetation phenology of three northern boreal peatlands during five growing seasons. We derived a greenness index (green chromatic coordinate, GCC) from the images and combined the results with measurements of CO2 flux, air temperature and high-resolution satellite data (Sentinel-2). From the digital camera images it was possible to extract greenness dynamics on the vegetation community and even species level. The highest GCC and daily maximum gross photosynthetic production (GPP(max)) were observed at the site with the highest nutrient availability and richest vegetation. The short-term temperature response of GCC depended on temperature and varied among the sites and months. Although the seasonal development and year-to-year variation in GCC and GPP(max) showed consistent patterns, the shortterm variation in GPP(max) was explained by GCC only during limited periods. GCC clearly indicated the main phases of the growing season, and peatland vegetation showed capability to fully compensate for the impaired growth resulting from a late growing season start. The GCC data derived from Sentinel-2 and digital cameras showed similar seasonal courses, but a reliable timing of different phenological phases depended upon the temporal coverage of satellite data.

TI  - Offshore wind farms changed the spatial distribution of chlorophyll-<i>a</i> on the sea surface
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Offshore wind farms (OWFs) have developed rapidly in recent years. However, it is difficult to accurately evaluate their impact on marine ecosystems and the marine environment due to the complexity of marine dynamic monitoring and various marine environment evaluation indicators. The spatial distribution of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) on the surface of seawater is one of basic spatial information of the sea area, which is the key determines the distribution and productivity of offshore biological resources at different spatial levels. Evaluating the impact of OWFs on the spatial distribution of Chl-a is of significance but the research carried out to date has been scarce. In this study, 682 Landsat images were selected from 1990 to 2021 as well as 38 OWFs from around the world as the research areas. The spatial distribution of Chl-a on the sea surface was calculated using the O'Reilly band ratio OC2 algorithm and HU color index (CI) algorithm and the influence of OWFs on the spatial distribution pattern of Chl-a was determined by using the global and local Moran Indexes. Among the 38 wind farms, it was found that: (1) the spatial autocorrelation of Chl-a concentration at 37 wind farms increased after the construction of the wind turbines; (2) the spatial distribution pattern of Chl-a at 28 wind farms showed pronounced aggregation after the construction of the wind turbines. Therefore, it was determined that the construction of OWFs will change the spatial distribution pattern of Chl-a, which may affect the original balance of local marine ecosystems.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in extramammary Paget disease: A 13-year institutional experience
T2  - JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Whether sentinel lymph node biopsy status is a prognostic factor or effective in determining treatment strategies in extramammary Paget disease remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the significance of sentinel lymph node biopsy in extramammary Paget disease. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical information of previously untreated patients with invasive extramammary Paget disease who underwent wide local excision of the primary tumor and sentinel lymph node biopsy at our hospital between April 2008 and March 2021. Clinical data including the baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and recurrence-free survival were analyzed. Sentinel lymph node metastases were classified as macrometastases and micrometastases, with a cut-off value for sentinel lymph node tumor burden of 2 mm. Univariate and multivariate analyses of factors affecting sentinel lymph node biopsy positivity and recurrence-free survival rates were performed. Overall, 85 patients were included in the analysis. Patients in the sentinel lymph node biopsy-positive group (n = 26) had a significantly higher invasion level and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. According to multivariate analyses, invasion level and a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were independent predictive factors for sentinel lymph node biopsy positivity, and the sentinel lymph node biopsy status was an independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival. In conclusion, sentinel lymph node biopsy provides an accurate risk classification and clinical indication for postoperative follow-up in patients with invasive extramammary Paget disease.

AB  - Influenza surveillance in the United States has expanded, resulting in increased ability to characterize circulating viruses and their impact. Selection of strains for vaccines is now based on enhanced viral characterization using immunologic, virologic, and computational techniques not previously available.The 10 years between the last influenza pandemic and start of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic have been marked by great advances in our ability to follow influenza occurrence and determine vaccine effectiveness (VE), largely based on widespread use of the polymerase chain reaction assay. We examine the results, focusing mainly on data from the United States and inactivated vaccines. Surveillance has expanded, resulting in increased ability to characterize circulating viruses and their impact. The surveillance has often confirmed previous observations on timing of outbreaks and age groups affected, which can now be examined in greater detail. Selection of strains for vaccines is now based on enhanced viral characterization using immunologic, virologic, and computational techniques not previously available. Vaccine coverage has been largely stable, but VE has remained modest and, in some years, very low. We discuss ways to improve VE based on existing technology while we work toward supraseasonal vaccines.

TI  - Quantifying the sources of uncertainty for hydrological predictions with WRF-Hydro over the snow-covered region in the Upper Indus Basin, Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Conceptual snowmelt runoff hydrological models involve uncertainties originating from various sources. For example, uncertainties related to the structure of hydrological models, robustness, parameters, calibration ap-proaches, and input and output datasets may lead to considerably uncertain hydrological predictions. Quanti-fying such uncertainties is an essential engineering and scientific endeavor. In this study, the newly developed Weather Research and Forecasting Model Hydrological Glacier (WRF-Hydro/Glacier) modeling framework was applied over the snow-fed Astore catchment in the Upper Indus Basin; the hydrological processes were simulated more effectively, while demonstrating their uncertainties as well as the overall model robustness. Three pre-cipitation datasets were used for calibrating and validating the WRF-Hydro/Glacier. The model parameters with different meteorological forcings were robust for simulating the hydrological processes in Astore. Furthermore, the uncertainty contributed by the optimized parameters and precipitation inputs was segregated to simulate the daily streamflow, snow-cover area (SCA), and evapotranspiration (ET). For streamflow, the optimized parame-ters were the primary source of uncertainty; for SCA and ET, the optimized parameters were a major source of uncertainty in spring and summer, whereas input precipitation was the key uncertainty in fall and winter. Overall, the robustness of the WRF-Hydro/Glacier was demonstrated using multiple optimized parameters from satellite-based precipitation datasets, while also demonstrating the uncertainties in the prediction of hydrological processes in Astore.

TI  - Role of atmospheric heat fluxes and ocean advection on decadal (2000-2019) change of sea-ice in the Arctic
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, role of ocean advection and atmospheric heat fluxes on recent decadal (2000-2019) decrease of sea-ice in the Arctic (60 degrees N-90 degrees N) has been investigated using an ocean sea-ice coupled model, known as Modular Ocean Model of version 5 with Sea Ice Simulator (MOMSIS). MOMSIS successfully simulates AVHRR observed decadal change of sea-ice concentration (SIC) and sea surface temperature (SST) in the Arctic during all four seasons; winter (December- February), spring (March-May), summer (June-August) and autumn (September-November) except few occasions. Also, best performance of the MOMSIS are restricted at south of 80 degrees N with statistical significance of more than 90%. We have also divided Arctic Ocean into eight sectors for our detailed analysis. Maximum decadal decrease of SIC and increase of SST has been observed in the Barents (sector 2), Kara (sector 3) and Laptev (sector 4) Sea regions of the Arctic using both AVHRR and MOMSIS with statistical significance of 90%. Also, very small decadal decrease (increase) of SIC (SST) has been observed in the Norwegian (sector 1) and Beaufort (sector 7) Sea regions of the Arctic using both AVHRR and MOMSIS. Mixed layer heat budget has been performed to understand role of thermodynamics processes on decadal change of SIC and SST in the Arctic. Strong decadal change of net atmospheric heat (NAH) fluxes are responsible for high decadal change of SIC and SST in the Barents (sector 2), Kara (sector 3) and Laptev (sector 4) Sea regions of the Arctic. In the Norwegian (sector 1) and Beaufort (sector 7) Sea, strong destructive interference between decadal change of NAH fluxes and ocean advection play an important role for small decadal change of SIC and SST during all four seasons. Also, for ocean advection, horizontal part dominate compared to vertical in all eight sector of the Arctic.

TI  - Geometric accuracy assessment and a framework for automatic sub-pixel registration of WFI images from CBERS-4, CBERS-4A, and Amazonia-1 satellites over Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Brazil faces the challenge of conciliating food production with natural vegetation preservation, and the government has been investing in Earth Observation satellites to assist in this task. In this context, images from the Wide-Field Imager (WFI) sensor onboard the China-Brazil Earth Re-sources Satellite (CBERS-4), CBERS-4A, and Amazonia-1 have been used in remote sensing appli-cations in Brazil. However, the geometric accuracy of the WFI data has not yet been documented in the literature, as it was done for other satellites/sensors such as TERRA/MODIS, Landsat-8/OLI, and Sentinel-2/MSI. This work presents the first study to assess the geometric accuracy of WFI images along different spectral channels, from multi-temporal images, and taking Sentinel-2/MSI images as a reference. Surface reflectance WFI images, Level-4 (orthorectified) with spa-tial resolution of 55 m (CBERS-4A) and 64 m (CBERS-4 and Amazonia-1) were analysed. Thou-sands of control points (CPs) were used to quantify the geometric accuracy of more than 300 WFI images and to construct multiple mapping functions to correct the displacements found. The NIR band was taken as a reference in the inter-channel (band-to-band) registration evaluation. In this case, all tiles had an RMSE average of fewer than 0.44 pixels. For the multi-temporal case, the CBERS-4A/WFI had the highest average RMSE (0.87 +/- 0.34 pixels). Considering the Sentinel-2/MSI as a reference, there were observed shifts up to 1.45 pixels for CBERS-4/WFI and Amazo-nia-1/WFI and 2.5 pixels for CBERS-4A/WFI. Given the displacements found, image registration is needed for further time series analysis of WFI images for several applications that requiring precise sub-pixel registration (i.e., land use cover change). As a result, we propose a framework for the automatic registration of WFI images to properly foster the use of WFI images. This frame-work substantially reduced the misregistrations, decreasing the RMSE average to less than 0.29 pixels for the WFI images from the three satellites. The use of the 2nd degree polynomial as a mapping function proved to be appropriate for registering the WFI data.

TI  - Evaluation of WRF-Chem-RTFDDA dust forecasts over the MENA region using in-situ and remote-sensing observations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We employed the combined WRF-Chem-RTFDDA model to forecast dust storms in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). WRF-Chem simulates the emission, transport, mixing, and chemical transformation of trace gases and aerosols simultaneously with the meteorology. RTFDDA continuously assimilates both conventional and nonconventional meteorological observations and provides improved initial conditions for dust analyses and forecasts. WRF-Chem-RTFDDA was run at a horizontal resolution of 9 km using the dust only option without inclusion of anthropogenic aerosols and chemical reactions. The synoptic conditions of the dust events were characterized by a cold front at the low level and an upper-level low-pressure system over the Western Mediterranean. WRF-Chem-RTFDDA was run in continuous assimilation mode, assimilating meteorological observations only, and launching 48-h free forecasts (FF) every 6 h. Two cold starts (CSs) for data assimilation and dust emissions initiation were performed during the study period. NCEP/GFS global analyses and forecasts provided initial and lateral boundary conditions. No global dust model was used for initialization and no dust observations were assimilated. We analyzed the skill of the WRF-Chem-RTFDDA system in reproducing the horizontal and vertical distributions of dust by comparing the FF to Meteosat SEVIRI dust images, MODIS AOD retrievals, CALIPSO extinction coefficients and CAMS aerosols-reanalysis AOD calculations. The skill was analyzed as a function of FF lead time and of the period of time from the CSs. RMSE, bias and correlation between the modeled and CALIPSO measured extinction coefficients were also examined. WRF-Chem-RTFDDA reproduced the main features of the studied dust storms reasonably well. The time distance from the CSs played a more significant role in determining the dust-forecast skill than free-forecast lead time. Since no external dust information was provided to the model, dust emissions and dust spin-up by WRF-Chem played a critical role in dust forecasts. The vertical extent of the CALIPSO extinction coefficients were reasonably well reproduced once model emissions were spun-up. False alarms rates range from 0.03 to 0.26, with many below 0.15, indicating satisfactory performance as a warning system. This study shows the feasibility of dust forecasts using minimal input data over the MENA region.

TI  - A GIS-based multicriteria decision analysis to reduce riparian vegetation hydrogeological risk and to quantify harvested biomass (Giant reed) for energetic retrieval
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation development in riverbeds creates obstructions to the regular water flow with the flooding hy-draulic risk increase. Giant reed (GR) (Arundo donax L.) is one of the most successful invasive species of riparian ecosystems in Mediterranean semi-arid climate conditions, with significant public administrations costs for its removal and disposal. At the meantime, due to its high biomass yield and adaption capacity to several conditions, GR is a very promising no-food crop to produce biogas by the anaerobic digestion (AD). The research activity provides for the involvement of territories belonging to the inner areas of Sicily, especially Calatino one, in which the SIMBIOSI Consortium operates an AD plant fed with agricultural by-products from other close agro-industrial companies. The aim of the study was to map and to quantify the actual spatial distribution of GR in watercourses embankments through Remote Sensing (RS) techniques applied in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment. In this regard, a method based on the automatic supervised classification, was applied on three different combinations of spectral bands (True Color Image - TCI; Near-Infrared, Green and Blue - NGB; Vegetation Red Edge - VRE) of Sentinel-2 satellite images related to the summer season (11th August 2019), with the aim of identifying the most suitable classification to map the GR. The results showed that the VRE compo-sition is the most accurate combination of spectral bands for the identification of GR, followed by the NGB image. The worst performance was obtained by using the TCI combination. A further elaboration was carried out combining the three classified images, in order to obtain a more accurate localization and quantification of GR. The final thematic map allowed to correctly classify GR for the 46 % of the cases, with an overall accuracy of 85.02 % and a high Kappa Coefficient of Agreement value equal to 0.81. Finally, the surface covered by GR in the study area (computed in the GIS environment) was about 2 km2 and the estimated GR biomass, available for the biomethane production, obtainable from watercourses embankments maintenance interventions would amount to about 11,780 tons year-1. The study could contribute to the development of a watercourses maintenance plan with the aim to reduce the risk of streams flooding in valley areas and at intersections with infrastructure works. Furthermore, the proposed methodology can be used by stakeholders in marginal areas, for the watercourses management, offsetting its costs through the energy use of the collected biomass.

TI  - Using Satellite Imagery to Determine Spatiotemporal Patterns of Built-Up Land Use in Relation to the Coastline: An Example from Xiamen, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study used four Landsat-TM satellite imageries (1989, 2000, 2010, and 2018) to detect the spatiotemporal change characteristics of built-up land by using variance and correlation analysis to ensure the ecological capacity and urban sustainable development in Xiamen. The results show that during the rapid urbanization period of 1989 to 2018, a large amount of farmland (70.7%) and the water body (64.4%) were lost. Among them, 43.8% of farmland and 33.6% of the water body have been converted to built-up land, producing great pressure on ecological security and sustainable development. On spatial distribution pattern, this research found that the built-up land expansion in Xiamen mainly occurred along the coastline. Preliminary statistics found that the built-up land is mainly concentrated in the coastal zone as far as 5 km (reaches maximum density of 0.37 6 0.16) from the coastline. In this zone, the built-up land is most compact and intensive, whereas most of the new built-up land increased 5 km to 9 km away to the coastline. Variance analysis shows that built-up land density at all distances of buffer lines are very significant differences (P , 0.01), and the difference reaches the maximum of 0.289 at a buffer line of 7 km. Correlation analysis shows that the built-up land density varies significantly and negatively correlated with the distance to the coastline (P , 0.01), indicating that the farther away from the coastline, the smaller the density of built-up land is. The final regression analysis shows that a significant relationship with cubic regression equation occurs between the built-up land area in 1989, the built-up land density in 2018, and the distance from the coastline. Based on this analysis, the possible impact factors of the spatial pattern and approaches to a compact city are discussed.

TI  - Analysis of univariate linear, robust-linear, and non-linear machine learning algorithms for satellite-derived bathymetry in complex coastal terrain
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The blue economic, maritime, and exploration activities rely on precise knowledge of coastal bathymetry. The recent trends in Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) research have focused on various methods of estimation using very high-resolution satellite imagery and in-situ data, but mostly in clear and transparent water. The Indian coastal region mostly has murky water, which is further constrained to employ SDB techniques in areas of river mouth and delta due to the presence of numerous underwater rocks and rich sediment carried by rivers. This study is focused on analyzing SDB in two study areas characterized as turbid, sediment-laden, and complex due presence of numerous underwater rocks. The objective of the research is to analyze and compare the performance of a few univariate Machine Learning (ML) regression algorithms in SDB estimation using ASTER, LANDSAT-8, and Sentinel-2A spectral bands with high resolution in-situ bathymetric data. This study evaluates linear, three robust linear Huber, RANSAC & ThielSen, and a non-linear Gaussian Process Regression ML algorithm, to analyze the efficacy in SDB estimation using a univariate spectral bandwidth of satellite imagery. The applied non-linear regression model has estimated SDB with the accuracy of R2 0.87, RMSE 1.77 m, and MAE 1.27 m for depth of 30 m in site A; and site B, R2 0.91, RMSE 1.51 m & MAE 1.17 m for depth of 22 m. The advantage offered by this approach includes; minimum required parameters, less processing time, and the potential to be an alternative to hydrographic surveys.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Current trends in diagnostic and therapeutic management of the axilla in breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy: results of the German-wide NOGGO MONITOR 24 survey
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose In the last 2 decades, the optimal management of the axilla in breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has been one of the most frequently discussed topics. Little is known about the attitudes of surgeons/radiologists towards new developments such as targeted axillary dissection. Therefore, the NOGGO conducted a survey to evaluate the current approach to axillary management. Methods A standardized digital questionnaire was sent out to > 200 departments in Germany between 7/2021 and 5/2022. The survey was supported by EUBREAST. Results In total, 116 physicians completed the survey. In cN0 patients scheduled to receive NACT, 89% of respondents recommended sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after NACT. In case of ypN1mi(sn), 44% advised no further therapy, while 31% proposed ALND and 25% axillary irradiation. 64% of respondents recommended a minimally invasive axillary biopsy to cN + patients. TAD was used at the departments of 82% of respondents and was offered to all cN + patients converting to ycN0 by 57% and only to selected patients, usually based on the number of suspicious nodes at time of presentation, by 43%. The most common marking technique was a clip/coil. 67% estimated that the detection rate of their marker was very good or good. Conclusion This survey shows a heterogenous approach towards axillary management in the neoadjuvant setting in Germany. Most respondents follow current guidelines. Since only two-thirds of respondents experienced the detection rate of the marker used at their department as (very) good, future studies should focus on the comparative evaluation of different marking techniques.

AB  - Like other workplaces, bullying occurs in academia. Additionally, women report more frequent and severe forms of bullying than men. The purpose of this qualitative study was to unearth women academics' learning because of being bullied. We discuss the learning context and explore the learning that occurred. Understanding these factors can augment the literature on bullying in academia. As a result of being bullied, women fundamentally changed their perceptions of themselves, others, their respective institutions, and their priorities. This study reveals how women can gain skills and have negative and positive changes in worldview. We offer practical suggestions for faculty, administrators, and institutions to promote learning from the experience of being bullied.

TI  - The Value of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound in the Detection of Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Malignant Melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To evaluate the location and characterization value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in the detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in malignant melanoma. Methods SLNs and the lymph node network were tracked by subcutaneous injection of ultrasonic contrast agent around the tumor and preoperative localization, and qualitative analyses were performed. The SLNs were also detected by the intraoperative subcutaneous injection of carbon nanoparticles, and the findings were compared with lymph nodes located by CEUS. The accuracy of the preoperative lymph node identification was evaluated by the results of postoperative pathology, which served as the gold standard of detection. Results In 47 patients with malignant melanoma, the mean number of SLNs detected by CEUS was 1.72 +/- 0.10, while that by carbon nanoparticle administration it was 1.79 +/- 1.07 (P = .371 > .05). Seven cases of lymph node metastasis were detected by CEUS, with a sensitivity of 70.0%, specificity of 97.3%, positive predictive value of 87.5%, negative predictive value of 92.3%, and accuracy of 91.5%. There was high consistency between the findings of CEUS and pathology in differentiating benign and malignant lymph nodes (kappa = 0.726, chi(2) = 25.243, P < .001). Conclusions CEUS can localize and differentiate SLNs in malignant melanoma, and thus, may potentially guide clinical treatment in the future.

TI  - Detection of sentinel lymph node with a novel near-infrared fluorescence spectrum system and indocyanine green fluorescence in patients with early breast cancer: First clinical experience
T2  - PHOTODIAGNOSIS AND PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for early breast cancer is common, and many studies have re-ported its usefulness with indocyanine green (ICG). However, in the case of sentinel lymph node (SNs) identi-fication using ICG, it is difficult to accurately identify the fluorescence signal of SNs through the skin because of the weakening of the signal due to the intervening tissue thickness. In this study, we examined whether fluo-rescence spectroscopy can detect weaker fluorescence signals and accurately identify SNs that have accumulated ICG.Methods: Six women with early breast cancer and clinically confirmed negative axillae were recruited. The periareolar region was subcutaneously injected with ICG (1 ml, 5 mg/mL). The identification rate of SNs in the skin was studied using the novel fluorescence spectroscopy (LumifinderTM, ADVANTEST, Tokyo, Japan).Results: LumifinderTM was able to identify 100% of SNs in the skin (6/6 patients). In addition, for SNs identifi-cation in deeper axillary areas, pressing the probe tip against the body surface allows clearer fluorescence observation.Conclusion: Novel fluorescence spectroscopy (LumifinderTM) may overcome the problem of SLNB using ICG for breast cancer.

TI  - ALOS-2 L-band SAR backscatter data improves the estimation and temporal transferability of wildfire effects on soil properties under different post-fire vegetation responses
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing techniques are of particular interest for monitoring wildfire effects on soil properties, which may be highly context-dependent in large and heterogeneous burned landscapes. Despite the physical sense of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter data for characterizing soil spatial variability in burned areas, this approach remains completely unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of SAR backscatter data in C-band (Sentinel 1) and L-band (ALOS-2) for monitoring fire effects on soil organic carbon and nutrients (total nitrogen and available phosphorous) at short term in a heterogeneous Mediterranean landscape mosaic made of shrublands and forests that was affected by a large wildfire. The ability of SAR backscatter coefficients and several band transformations of both sensors for retrieving soil properties measured in the field in immediate post-fire situation (one month after fire) was tested through a model averaging approach. The temporal transferability of SAR-based models from one month to one year after wildfire was also evaluated, which allowed to assess short-term changes in soil properties at large scale as a function of pre-fire plant community type. The retrieval of soil properties in immediate post-fire conditions featured a higher overall fit and predictive capacity from ALOS-2 L-band SAR backscatter data than from Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data, with the absence of noticeable under and overestimation effects. The transferability of the ALOS-2 based model to one year after wildfire exhibited similar performance to that of the model calibration scenario (immediate post-fire conditions). Soil organic carbon and available phosphorous content was significantly higher one year after wildfire than immediately after the fire disturbance. Conversely, the short-term change in soil total nitrogen was ecosystem-dependent. Our results support the applicability of L-band SAR backscatter data for monitoring short-term variability of fire effects on soil properties, reducing data gathering costs within large and heterogeneous burned landscapes.

TI  - Outlier removal and feature point pairs optimization for piecewise linear transformation in the co-registration of very high-resolution optical remote sensing imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Co-registration of very high-resolution images is a challenging and essential preprocessing step in remote sensing image analysis. Piecewise linear (PL) transformation has been shown to accurately handle the registration of very high-resolution images with various local deformations. However, the PL transformation has strict requirements on the structure of the local triangulated irregular network (TIN) and the position accuracy of feature point pairs (FPPs). Existing outlier removal methods barely consider the local TIN structure of FPPs, thus failing to meet the requirements of the PL transformation. Moreover, the inevitably remaining outliers lead to lower local regis-tration accuracy. This paper proposes an outlier removal method and an FPPs optimization method to improve the registration accuracy of the PL transformation. First, we developed a triangle-area representation ratio of the triangulated irregular network (TIN-TARR) descriptor to identify the outliers. Then, we divided these outliers into three types and removed them iteratively. Finally, we further optimized the FPPs by maximizing the sim-ilarity between the fixed and the registered images to improve the registration accuracy of the PL transformation. The proposed method was validated using three pairs of TripleSat-2 images with a spatial resolution of 3.2 m, one pair of WorldView-2 images with a spatial resolution of 1.6 m, and one pair of aerial images with a spatial resolution of 0.3 m. The results demonstrated that: (1) The obvious deformations in each registered image were eliminated after the outlier removal using TIN-TARR. (2) The FPPs optimization significantly improved the registration accuracy of the PL transformation. The average registration errors in five tests were 0.542, 0.389, 0.456, 0.420, and 0.592 pixels, respectively. (3) Different similarity metrics had various effects on the FPPs optimization, and structural similarity was the most effective measurement. (4) The proposed co-registration framework presented better registration accuracy than three state-of-the-art methods, especially in images with land cover changes and shadows.

TI  - A Longitudinal Analysis of the Association Between Long-Term Exposure to Air Pollution and Cognitive Function Among Adults Aged 45 and Older in China
T2  - JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES B-PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Evidence suggests long-term exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) is associated with a higher risk of cognitive impairment, especially among older adults. This study examines the relationship between PM2.5 exposure and cognitive function in China's aging population. Methods We used longitudinal data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (2011-2015) linked with historical PM2.5 concentrations (2000-2015) from remotely sensed satellite data. Growth curve models were applied to estimate associations between PM2.5 exposure (measured in intensity, duration, and a joint variable of intensity with duration for cumulative exposure) and cognitive function. Results Relative to the lowest exposure group, exposure in the second group of PM2.5 intensity (35-50 mu g/m(3)) is associated with poorer cognitive function, but higher levels of PM2.5 appear to be associated with better cognitive function, indicating a U-shaped association. Similar patterns are seen for fully adjusted models of PM2.5 duration: the second group (13-60 months) is associated with worse cognitive function than the first group (0-12 months), but coefficients are nonsignificant in longer duration groups. Joint analysis of PM2.5 intensity with duration suggests that duration may play a more detrimental role in cognitive function than intensity. However, we do not find a statistically significant association between PM2.5 exposure and the rate of cognitive decline. Discussion Our findings are mixed and suggest that some categories of higher and longer exposure to PM2.5 are associated with poorer cognitive function, while that exposures do not hasten cognitive decline. However, more work is necessary to disentangle PM2.5 exposure from individuals' background characteristics, particularly those jointly associated with cognitive function and urban living.

TI  - Digital mapping for soil texture class prediction in northwestern Turkiye by different machine learning algorithms
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil texture classes (STCs) influence the physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil, and accurate spatial predictions of STCs are essential for agro-ecological modeling. The purpose of this study was to assess the capabilities of environmental covariates derived from Landsat 8 OLI Science products and a digital elevation model (DEM), as well as three machine learning methods, to provide an accurate and reliable classification of soil texture classes. Estimation efficiency of soil texture classes was investigated using Decision tree (DT), Random forest (RF), and Support vector machine (SVM) algorithms in an area with Fluvisols and Vertisols as predominant reference soil groups in Northwestern Turkiye (Lake of Manyas). The models were validated using the leave-oneout, cross-validation technique. The best of the three machine learning models for soil texture classification was RF, with an overall accuracy of 0.63 and a kappa index value of 0.14, according to the accuracy evaluation. The RF algorithm generated a map whose findings were more consistent with the real environment using the confusion index (RF:0.30) and abundance index (RF:1.0) values as uncertainty criteria. The most important predictor of soil texture classes was the topographic wetness index (mean decrease accuracy: 3%) for tree-based learning algorithms, followed by other indexes based on satellite data. These findings will contribute to support sustainable soil management techniques in a location with a large degree of topsoil texture diversity.

TI  - Can We Forgo Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Women Aged ≥ 50 Years with Early-Stage Hormone-Receptor-Positive HER2-Negative Special Histologic Subtype Breast Cancer?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Breast cancer has significant biologic heterogeneity, which influences treatment decisions. We hypothesized that in postmenopausal women (>= 50 years) with clinical T1-2, N0, hormone receptor positive (HR+), HER2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer of special histology (mucinous, tubular, cribriform, papillary), information from sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) may not change adjuvant therapy recommendations. Patients and Methods We constructed a cohort from the National Cancer Database of women aged >= 18 years with cT1-2 N0 HR+ HER2- invasive breast cancer. We calculated the frequency of nodal positivity by histology. We measured the frequency of N2/N3 disease, the distribution of Oncotype DX 21-gene assay recurrence score (ODX RS) across special histology by nodal status, and frequency of chemotherapy use by ODX RS and pathologic N stage. Results In women with cN0 HR+/HER2- special histologic subtype breast cancer, the likelihood of pathologic nodal positivity is less than 5%, and 99.7% of patients had N0 or N1 disease. Among women aged >= 50 years with HR+/HER2- special histologic subtype breast cancer, there was low prevalence of high ODX RS > 25 in both N0 and N1 patients (7% overall). Receipt of chemotherapy correlated with Oncotype DX scores as anticipated, with the lowest use in women with a low/intermediate RS (from 2 to 6% for N0 and 6-24% for N1) and the highest use in women with high risk Oncotype scores (from 74 to 92%). Conclusions Our study suggests that SLNB could potentially be omitted in select postmenopausal women with cT1-2 N0 HR+/HER2- special histologic subtype breast cancer when ODX RS is available.

TI  - Spatial and temporal characteristics analysis for land subsidence in Shanghai coastal reclamation area using PS-InSAR method
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, large-scale reclamation projects have been performed in the intertidal flat area of Shanghai, China. Due to the self-weight consolidation of the foundation and dynamic load caused by human activities, the newly reclamation area will sink within a period of time after the land is formed. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out surface deformation monitoring for taking preventive measures in advance. In this research, the PS-InSAR technology, mostly used for urban subsidence monitoring, was applied to obtain the ground deformation information of Shanghai coastal area based on ENVISAT/ASAR (2007.07-2010.02) and Sentinel-1A (2017.07-2020.02) datasets. The results showed that: 1) Compared with ASAR data, the Sentinel-1A data could distinguish more coherent points and get more comprehensive deformation distribution characteristics. 2) Most high-coherent points were detected in artificial objects, especially airport runways, buildings, roads and seawalls. 3) There was obvious uneven land subsidence in the study area during the two monitoring periods, the PS points with high subsidence rates (<-20 mm/a) mainly distributed around Dishui Lake and artificial seawalls. 4) The ground subsidence velocity of the newly formed land gradually slowed down over times, with the average subsidence rate decreased from -10.45 mm/a to -4.94 mm/a. Our study proved that remote sensing monitoring for ground subsidence in reclaimed land could be realized based on PS-InSAR technology, which could provide the spatial distribution characteristics of subsidence in large-scale and long-term series and help the sustainable development of coastal engineering construction.

TI  - Study on the change monitoring of typical estuarine wetland and its effect on ecological factors in Bohai Rim region, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuarine wetlands provide an especially ecological home for various flora and fauna, with fragile ecological structures and functions easily affected by the external disturbances of both anthropogenic and natural activities. Recently, wetlands (such as water and marsh) of the Bohai Rim region have been, and continue to be, lost or altered under the influence of both local urbanization and economic development. There is an increasing need for crucial essential wetland change detection as one of the most critical works for relevant research. The paper's objective focuses on detecting the annual and interannual changes at a large spatial scale for understanding the mainly changed cover type of estuarine wetlands and measuring its impact on coastline ecological factors. Two typical study areas, including the Shuangtai Estuary wetland and Yellow River Delta, are selected for the assessment of changes to wetlands in Bohai Rim region, China. Additionally, Landsat TM/OLI images between 2005 and 2015, as the standard years for change detection, are used as the experimental data resources. To realize the rapid and automatic detection of change to wetland at a larger scale, a method is constructed to extract the change information from satellite images integrating the dynamic ratio and the max-difference algorithm. Based on the remote sensing base ecological index (RSEI), three ecological indexes include water body index, vegetation index, and soil index, calculated the annual maximum difference and the inter-annual dynamic rate of change to wetland. Furthermore, wetland changes are graded and evaluated five significant levels from the annual yearly and interannual scales. Results show several significant findings: (1) from 2005 to 2015, the ecological change with an overall improvement trend was in two monitoring areas of Bohai Rim region. The annual change of ecological factors in the positively changed area (improve) was more and more significant, with the mainly converted type of the expansion of paddy field. In the negatively changing area (degrade), annual ecological change was more and more insignificant, with the main expansion of bare land. (2) The significantly increased accumulation of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was the main ecological change feature of the Shuangtai Estuary wetland. The significant regional changes in the Yellow River Delta were the interaction of ecological factors, included modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), NDVI, and normalized difference soil index (NDSI). The study on the change detection of wetland and its influence on ecological factors in Bohai Rim region between two different periods enriches remote sensing monitoring technology of change to wetlands, betters quantitative evaluation of ecological factors, and provides updated data support for the wetland natural resource inventory at the various scales.

TI  - Impact of atmospheric thermodynamic structures and aerosol radiation feedback on winter regional persistent heavy particulate pollution in the Sichuan-Chongqing region, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Potential relationships among heavy air pollution, weather conditions, and meteorological effects are unclear and require further investigation, especially for areas with complex terrains, such as the Sichuan Basin (SCB), one of the most polluted regions in China. In this study, air pollution in the SCB was examined and 18 regional persistent heavy pollution events (RPHEs) were identified for the winters of 2014-2018. The average persistent period of the RPHEs was 8.89 days, and the number of affected cities was 17. Based on ground-based observations, CALIPSO satellite data, reanalysis data, and backward trajectory calculations, the synergistic effects of the thermodynamic structures, synoptic circulations and the radiative feedback of aerosols on the formation of RPHEs were revealed. The results can be summarized as follows: (1) An abnormal warming center, attributing to the warm southerly advection in the upper layer and the cold air dammed by the topography near the surface, always presented around 800-700 hPa to form a deep stable layer. (2) The diurnal variations in vertical motions triggered by the thermodynamic structures could regulate the pollution episodes. During the daytime, pollutants accumulated rapidly and thoroughly mixed under the control of sinking airflow from 800 hPa layer to the ground. At night, pollutants sometimes slowly diffused when weak ascending airflow appeared. (3) Forced by the stable layer and topography of the Tibetan Plateau, the local circulation was confined within SCB, resulting in the intensive mixing of local emissions and transport pollutants from other regions. This situation could be maintained for a long time with stable synoptic circulation in winter, leading to the formation of RPHEs. (4) The pollution episodes were featured with multi-layer pollutants above SCB according to the CALIPSO observations, including the local anthropogenic aerosols near the surface, dust aerosols originating from the Taklamakan Desert, and biomass burning aerosols from Southeast Asia. Solar absorption aerosols, including black carbon and dust above the region, could cause meteorological feedback, making the vertical layer more stable and enhancing the persistence and intensity of the pollution episodes. This study highlights the appreciable effects of synoptic circulations on the vertical thermodynamic structures of the atmosphere and air quality, and raises the understanding of the environmental and climate impacts of RPHEs in complex terrains.

TI  - Variation of Leaf Area Index (LAI) under Changing Climate: Kadolkele Mangrove Forest, Sri Lanka
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves are an essential plant community in coastal ecosystems. While the importance of mangrove ecosystems is well acknowledged, climate change is expected to have a considerable negative impact on them, especially in terms of temperature, precipitation, sea level rise (SLR), ocean currents, and increasing storminess. Sri Lanka ranks near the bottom of the list of countries researching this problem, even though the scientific community's interest in examining the variation in mangrove health in response to climate change has gained significant attention. Consequently, this study illustrates how the leaf area index, a measure of mangrove health, fluctuates in response to varying precipitation, particularly during droughts in Sri Lanka's Kadolkele mangrove forest. The measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to produce the leaf area index (LAI), which was then combined with the standard precipitation index (SPI) to estimate the health of the mangroves. The climate scenario, RCP8.5, was used to forecast future SPI (2021-2100), and LAI was modeled under the observed (1991-2019) and expected (2021-2100) drought events. The study reveals that the forecasted drought intensities modeled using the RCP8.5 scenario have no significant variations on LAI, even though some severe and extreme drought conditions exist. Nevertheless, the health of the mangrove ecosystem is predicted to deteriorate under drought conditions and rebound when drought intensity decreases. The extreme drought state (-2.05) was identified in 2064; therefore, LAI has showcased its lowest (0.04). LAI and SPI are projected to gradually increase from 2064 to 2100, while high fluctuations are observed from 2021 to 2064. Limited availability of LAI values with required details (measured date, time, and sample locations) and cloud-free Landsat images have affected the study results. This research presents a comprehensive understanding of Kadolkele mangrove forest under future droughts; thus, alarming relevant authorities to develop management plans to safeguard these critical ecosystems.

TI  - Mapping daytime thermal patterns of Bologna municipality (Italy) during a heatwave: A new methodology for cities adaptation to global climate change
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed Land Surface Temperature (LST) is widely used to characterize Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) intensity and spatial variability. SUHI may differ significantly from the Urban Heat Island (UHI), which is related to air temperature and is more representative of human wellbeing. The lack of information and results on UHI development is due to the difficulty in having measurements with high spatial density within the city and the uncertainties in finding relationships between air and surface temperatures. Characterizing UHI is fundamental when dealing with human thermal wellbeing especially when extreme events occur. A new index, named Urban Heatwave Thermal Index (UHTI), was presented here to quantify daytime air temperature variability patterns in an urban environment during a meteorological heatwave. UHTI integrates a) air temperature recorded by local sensors; b) structural microclimatic Envi-met fluidodynamic modeling simulations; and c) remotely sensed environmental indicators. UHTI is a reliable representation of thermal criticalities in the city for its inhabitants. A case study on Bologna (Italy) municipality is presented. Moreover, UHTI was calculated and compared with the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI), commonly used for urban climate character-ization. Results showed a high degree of correlation (R2 = 0.795) between the two indexes; re-sidual mapping and hot-spot detection indicated that their biggest differences are next to dense urban fabric areas like historical centers and water body areas.

TI  - Female physics students gain from facilitating informal physics programs
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Gender bias, reduced sense of belonging, and lower physics self-efficacy are among the challenges faced by women who choose to study physics. Prior studies focusing on this underrepresented group have examined the experiences and impacts of formal educational settings, leaving the impact of informal physics programs, frequently called outreach programs, as a relatively overlooked area. Existing research on the impact of informal physics programs indicates that student facilitators, who help run the programs, can experience positive impacts on their learning and sense of community beyond the formal setting of a classroom or laboratory. In this study we took a first step, narrowing our focus to explore the relation between facilitation of informal physics programs and female students' physics identity, persistence, mindset, and worldview. We analyzed a subset of survey responses (32) and interviews (11) with undergraduate and graduate female students collected as part of our prior study. Our analysis of this subset, based on self-reported data, showed a statistically significant shift in confidence of choice of major after facilitating informal physics programs. Analysis of interviews indicated a positive relation between facilitation of informal programs and female student interest and motivation with regards to the field of physics, improved performance and competence beliefs, and the development of characteristics indicative of a growth mindset. A semantic network analysis showed statistically significant interdependencies between positive persistence and constructs including growth mindset, important early undergraduate experiences, gender stereotype threat, external recognition, and confidence.

TI  - Three-dimensional nature of summertime aerosols over South Asia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional (temporal-spatial-vertical) climatology of South Asian summertime (MAMJ, 2010-2019) aerosols and aerosol sub-types was explored using multiple high-resolution satellite-based observations and reanalysis dataset. Vertical stratification of aerosol layer and aerosol sub-types was identified using observation from space-borne lidar. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) was particularly high across the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP; AOD +/- SD: 0.56 +/- 0.12) and over eastern coast of India (AOD: 0.6-0.8), with prevalence of heterogeneous aerosol sub-types having strong spatial gradient. Clearly, aerosols over north-western arid part were highly absorbing (Ultra-violet Aerosol Index, UVAI > 0.80) and coarse (angstrom ngstrom exponent, AE < 0.8), with an indication of desert/-mineral dust aerosols. In contrast, fine and moderate to non-absorbing aerosols (UVAI: 0.20-0.50 ) dominate from central to lower IGP, including in Bangladesh, with signature of anthropogenic emissions. Prevailing aerosols over twelve South Asian cities were classified into six aerosol sub-types constraining their particle size and UV-absorbing potential. Overall, mineral dust, smoke and urban aerosols were the three major aerosol sub-types that prevail across South Asia during summer. In particular, 58-70 % of retrieval days over Karachi and Multan were dust dominated; 57-64 % days were dust or urban aerosols dominated over Lahore, Delhi, Kanpur and Varanasi, and 56-77 % days were smoke or urban aerosols dominated over Dhaka, Kathmandu, Chennai, Mumbai, Colombo and Nagpur. Prevailing aerosols were vertically stratified as 50-70 % of total AOD was retrieved <2 km from the surface except in few cities where 70-80 % of AOD was retrieved <3 km height. Mineral dust and/or urban aerosols emerged as the most abundant aerosol types near the surface (<1 km) in all the cities except in Chennai, with their abundance remained as a function of emission sources and geographical location.

TI  - Automated snow avalanche release area delineation in data-sparse, remote, and forested regions
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Potential avalanche release area (PRA) modeling is critical for generating automated avalanche terrain maps which provide low-cost, large-scale spatial representations of snow avalanche hazard for both infrastructure planning and recreational applications. Current methods are not applicable in mountainous terrain where high-resolution (<= 5 m) elevation models are unavailable and do not include an efficient method to account for avalanche release in forested terrain. This research focuses on expanding an existing PRA model to better incorporate forested terrain using satellite imagery and presents a novel approach for validating the model using local expertise, thereby broadening its application to numerous mountain ranges worldwide. The study area of this research is a remote portion of the Columbia Mountains in southeastern British Columbia, Canada, which has no pre-existing high-resolution spatial datasets. Our research documents an open-source workflow to generate highresolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and forest land cover datasets using optical satellite data processing. We validate the PRA model by collecting a polygon dataset of observed potential release areas from local guides, using a method which accounts for the uncertainty in human recollection and variability in avalanche release. The validation dataset allows us to perform a quantitative analysis of the PRA model accuracy and optimize the PRA model input parameters to the snowpack and terrain characteristics of our study area. Compared to the original PRA model our implementation of forested terrain and local optimization improved the percentage of validation polygons accurately modeled by 11.7 percentage points and reduced the number of validation polygons that were underestimated by 14.8 percentage points. Our methods demonstrate substantial improvement in the performance of the PRA model in forested terrain and provide means to generate the requisite input datasets and validation data to apply and evaluate the PRA model in vastly more mountainous regions worldwide than was previously possible.

TI  - Remote sensing retrieval of inland water quality parameters using Sentinel-2 and multiple machine learning algorithms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has long been an effective method for water quality monitoring because of its advantages such as high coverage and low consumption. For non-optically active parameters, traditional empirical and analytical methods cannot achieve quantitative retrieval. Machine learning has been gradually used for water quality retrieval due to its ability to capture the potential relationship between water quality parameters and satellite images. This study is based on Sentinel-2 images and compared the ability of four machine learning algorithms (eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)) to retrieve chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), dissolved oxygen (DO), and ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) for inland reservoirs. The results indicated that XGBoost outperformed the other three algorithms. We used XGBoost to reconstruct the spatial-temporal patterns of Chl-a, DO, and NH3-N for the period of 2018-2020 and further analyzed the interannual, seasonal, and spatial variation characteristics. This study provides an efficient and practical way for optically and non-optically active parameters monitoring and management at the regional scale.

TI  - Association of Multimorbidity and Excess Mortality After Fractures Among Danish Adults
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Limited knowledge about interactions among health disorders impedes optimal patient care. Because comorbidities are common among patients 50 years and older with fractures, these fractures provide a useful setting for studying interactions among disorders.OBJECTIVE To define multimorbidity clusters at the time of fracture and quantify the interaction between multimorbidity and fracture in association with postfracture excess mortality.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This nationwide cohort study included 307 870 adults in Denmark born on or before January 1, 1951, who had an incident low-trauma fracture between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2014, and were followed up through December 31, 2016. Data were analyzed from February 1 to March 31, 2022.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Fracture and 32 predefined chronic diseases recorded within 5 years before the index fracture were identified from the Danish National Hospital Discharge Register. Death was ascertained from the Danish Register on Causes of Death. Latent class analysis was conducted to identify multimorbidity clusters. Relative survival analysis was used to quantify excess mortality associated with the combination of multimorbidity and fractures at specific sites.RESULTS Among the 307 870 participants identified with incident fractures, 95 372 were men (31.0%; mean [SD] age at fracture, 72.3 [11.2] years) and 212 498 were women (69.0%; mean [SD] age at fracture, 74.9 [11.2] years). During a median of 6.5 (IQR, 3.0-11.0) years of follow-up, 41 017 men (43.0%) and 81 727 women (38.5%) died. Almost half of patients with fractures (42.9%) had at least 2 comorbidities. Comorbidities at fracture were categorized as low-multimorbidity (60.5% in men and 66.5% in women), cardiovascular (23.7% in men and 23.5% in women), diabetic (5.6% in men and 5.0% in women), malignant (5.1% in men and 5.0% in women), and mixed hepatic and/or inflammatory (5.1% in men only) clusters. These clusters distinguished individuals with advanced, complex, or late-stage disease from those with earlier-stage disease. Multimorbidity and proximal or lower leg fractures were associated with increased mortality risk, with the highest excess mortality found in patients with hip fracture in the malignant cluster (1-year excess mortality: 40.8% [95% CI: 38.1%-43.6%]). The combination of multimorbidity and fracture compounded the association with mortality, conferring much greater risk than either alone.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Concomitant illnesses were common and clustered into distinct multimorbidity clusters that were associated with excess postfracture mortality. The compound contribution of multimorbidity to postfracture excess mortality highlights the need for more comprehensive approaches in these high-risk patients. The analytical approach applied to fracture could also be used to examine other sentinel health events.

AB  - Objective: To understand the related factors of new-type drug use and recent HIV infection among men who have sex with men (MSM), and provide a reference for formulating targeted strategies for HIV/AIDS prevention and control. Methods: MSM were recruited in sentinel surveillance sites of nine cities in Shandong province from April to July 2021, with a sample size of 400 in each city. A face-to-face questionnaire was conducted to collect demographic characteristics, high-risk behaviors, acceptance of HIV intervention services, etc. Blood samples were collected for HIV and syphilis antibodies detection. Limiting-antigen avidity enzyme immunoassay (LAg-Avidity EIA) was used to detect recent HIV infection, and the rate of recent HIV infection was calculated. Results: 3 624 MSM were under study with the following characteristics as: aged (32.70±9.33) years old, the aged 30 and above (59.52%, 2 157/3 624), with high school education or below (55.99%, 2 029/3 624), being unmarried/divorced/widowed (57.70%, 2 091/3 624) and as having homosexual orientation (86.26%, 3 126/3 624) accounted for the more mainly. Of 32.95% (1 194/3 624) had same-sex unprotected anal sex in recent six months; 27.48% (993/3 613) ever used new-type drugs, and the HIV antibody positive rate was 3.12% (113/3 624). The recent HIV infection rate appeared as 2.61% (95%CI: 1.73%-3.49%). The multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that the related factors of new-type drug use were unmarried/divorced/widowed (compared with being married/cohabitating, aOR=1.43, 95%CI: 1.22-1.69), educational level of college or above (compared with educational level of high school or below, aOR=1.47, 95%CI: 1.25-1.72), mainly through the Internet/dating software to find male sex partners (compared with mainly through bars/baths/parks and other places to find male sex partners, aOR=1.76, 95%CI: 1.41-2.19). Those who had unprotected anal sex in the last six months (compared with no unprotected anal sex, aOR=1.33, 95%CI: 1.13-1.57), had sexually transmitted diseases in the past year (compared with no sexually transmitted disease, aOR=2.77, 95%CI: 2.04-3.76) were more likely to use new-type drugs. The multinominal logistic regression showed that MSM who had unprotected anal sex in the last six months (compared with no unprotected anal sex, aOR=2.51, 95%CI: 1.25-5.01) or did not receive HIV intervention services in the past year (compared with those who received HIV intervention services, aOR=3.89, 95%CI: 1.30-11.60), were syphilis positive (compared with syphilis negative, aOR=8.18, 95%CI: 2.98-22.48), used new-type drugs (compared with those who did not use new-type drugs, aOR=4.75, 95%CI: 2.32-9.70) had a higher risk of recent HIV infection. Conclusions: New-type drugs have been widely used in MSM in Shandong province. The abuse of new-type drugs increases the risk of recent HIV infection.
AB  - 目的： 分析MSM新型毒品滥用和HIV新发感染的相关因素，为制定艾滋病防控措施提供参考依据。 方法： 2021年4-7月在山东省9个城市监测哨点招募MSM，每个城市招募样本量为400人。开展面对面问卷调查，收集MSM社会人口学特征、行为学和接受HIV干预服务等信息，采集血样进行HIV和梅毒抗体检测。采用限制性抗原亲和力酶联免疫法进行HIV新发感染检测，并计算HIV新发感染率指标。 结果： 共调查MSM 3 624人，年龄（32.70±9.33）岁，以≥30岁（59.52%，2 157/3 624）、高中及以下文化程度（55.99%，2 029/3 624）、未婚/离异/丧偶（57.70%，2 091/3 624）和性取向为同性恋者为主（86.26%，3 126/3 624）。最近6个月发生无保护肛交占32.95%（1 194/3 624）；曾使用新型毒品占27.48%（993/3 613）；HIV抗体阳性率为3.12%（113/3 624），HIV新发感染率为2.61%（95%CI：1.73%~3.49%）。多因素logistic回归分析结果显示，MSM新型毒品滥用的相关因素包括未婚/离异/丧偶（相比于已婚/同居，aOR=1.43，95%CI：1.22~1.69）、大专及以上文化程度（相比于高中及以下文化程度，aOR=1.47，95%CI：1.25~1.72）、主要寻找男性性伴场所为互联网/交友软件（相比于酒吧/浴池/公园等，aOR=1.76，95%CI：1.41~2.19）、最近6个月发生无保护肛交（相比于未发生无保护肛交，aOR=1.33，95%CI：1.13~1.57）、最近1年患过性病（相比于未患性病，aOR=2.77，95%CI：2.04~3.76）。MSM HIV新发感染的相关因素包括最近6个月发生无保护肛交（相比于未发生无保护肛交，aOR=2.51，95%CI：1.25~5.01）、最近1年未接受HIV干预服务（相比于接受HIV干预服务，aOR=3.89，95%CI：1.30~11.60）、梅毒阳性（相比于梅毒阴性，aOR=8.18，95%CI：2.98~22.48）、曾使用新型毒品（相比于未使用新型毒品，aOR=4.75，95%CI：2.32~9.70）。 结论： 山东省MSM新型毒品滥用现象较为普遍，新型毒品滥用会增加HIV新发感染风险。.

TI  - Left-sided excess in the laterality of cutaneous melanocytic nevi and melanomas
T2  - JOURNAL DER DEUTSCHEN DERMATOLOGISCHEN GESELLSCHAFT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives: Asymmetrical distribution of melanomas in favor of the left body half has been repeatedly described.Patients and methods: In a prospective cross-sectional study, we investigated the distribution of melanocytic nevi between the left and right halves of the body in 702 patients. In 2,004 consecutive cases with melanomas, we retrospectively determined left to right (L/R) ratios of primary melanomas, lymph node metastases, and melanocytic nevi in sentinel lymph nodes (SN).Results: The L/R ratios for cutaneous nevi and melanomas were 1.23 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.12-1.36) and 1.6 (95 % CI 1.37-1.88), respectively. In both cutaneous nevi and melanomas, the left-sided excess was mainly found in intermittently light-exposed skin. Of the nevus patients, 92.4 % were right-handed. Breslow thickness and rates of ulceration did not differ significantly between the two body halves.Conclusions: Melanocytic nevi and melanomas are more frequently found on the left body half. We assume asymmetric solar radiation as the causative factor. The vast majority of right-handed people might unconsciously align their posture during outdoor activities so that the light falls in from the left. This avoids shadow cast by the dominant arm, shoulder, or head.

TI  - Rapid Decline of <i>Calonectria pseudonaviculata</i> Soil Population in Selected Gardens Across the United States
T2  - PLANT DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Calonectria pseudonaviculata (Cps) poses a serious threat to boxwood, an iconic landscape plant in American and European gardens. Under the mild climatic conditions of the United Kingdom, Cps remained recoverable in infected leaf debris after being left on the soil surface or buried for 5 years. The primary objective of this study was to determine how this fungus may be affected by the warmer summers and colder winters in the United States by sampling and baiting soil with boxwood cuttings and by on-site testing with sentinel plants. Soil sampling started in a Virginia garden in January 2016 and was extended to California, Illinois, New York, and South Carolina in early summer of 2017 through late fall of 2018. The Cps soil population as measured by the percentage of infected bait leaves declined sharply within the first year of blighted boxwood removal and fell to an almost undetectable level at the end of this study. To validate these baiting results, the Virginia garden was tested on site four times with container-grown boxwood plants while the South Carolina garden and three New York gardens were tested once. Each test began with sentinel plants set out for field exposure, followed by evaluation on site and then in the laboratory after plants were retrieved from these gardens and incubated under conducive environments for 2 weeks. Cps was not observed on any sentinel boxwood plant on site or in the laboratory with one exception. These observations indicate that Cps did not survive in the United States garden soil over time as well as it did in the United Kingdom. These results have important practical implications while challenging the notion that fungi producing microsclerotia will always survive in the soil for many years.

TI  - Auditing the spatial and temporal changes in urban cropland in Harare metropolitan Province-<i>Zimbabwe</i>
T2  - AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Urban agriculture continues to play a key role in addressing food insecurity and poverty across developing countries. This study used Landsat 5 imagery to map the spatial and temporal distribution of cropland in Harare Metropolitan in Zimbabwe using the Random Forest classifier in Google Earth Engine. Results show that the area under cultivation fluctuated considerably between 1985 and 2019 and several factors account for this trend. The results of this study illustrate the increasing importance of remote sensing in assessing cropland in urban areas that provides insights into the contribution of urban agriculture to food security.

TI  - Advancing urban planning in arid agricultural-urbanized landscapes of Iran: Spatial modeling evidence from a rapidly developing region
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Binary agricultural-urbanized landscapes in the central arid zone of Iran are under the imminent threat of fragmentation and low crop yields due to uncontrolled low-density urban expansion. To characterize the current process in a case study area in Central Isfahan (1550 km2), two scenarios of Business As Usual (BAU) and Agricultural Land Protection (ALP) were simulated using the SLEUTH model and compared statistically to provide relevant urban planning insights. A time-series (1992-2022) Landsat NDVI-based procedure was developed to characterize the annual cropping intensity of land parcels as a surrogate for agricultural land suitability, showing that only 16.7% of the region (303 parcels with a mean cropping NDVI of 0.184) has a high agricultural suitability. Landsat-derived urban areas also showed a significant road-influenced outlying pattern during the study period, especially in high cropping intensity areas with the SLEUTH Breed and Road Gravity scores of 100 and 60, respectively. By reducing these scores to half, the ALP scenario was developed and together with the BAU was projected up to the year 2045. Results showed significant restrictive growth of new road -influenced urban patches under the APL scenario which also targeted least-suitable agricultural areas, espe-cially in high cropping intensity parcels (z=-6.657, p=0.000, sig <= 0.05, 2-tailed).

TI  - Environmental injustice among Hispanics in Santa Clara, California: a human-environment heat vulnerability assessment
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In the United States, there is a growing interest in understanding heat stress in lower-income and racially isolated neighborhoods. This study spatially identifies heat-vulnerable neighborhoods, evaluates the relationship between race/ethnicity and temperature exposure, and emphasizes differences among Hispanics by origin to capture environmental injustices in Santa Clara County (SCC), CA. The current methodology uses Landsat 8 via Google Earth Engine to measure the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to assess the physical environment. The human environment is evaluated using the Modified Darden-Kamel Composite Socioeconomic Index to determine the spatial variability of socioeconomic status (SES) and the Index of Dissimilarity to determine the level of segregation between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites and among Hispanics/Latinos. The combination of these assessments comprises a comprehensive human-environment approach for health exposure evaluation by which to define environmental injustice. Results reveal socioeconomic inequalities and an uneven residential distribution between Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites. Low NDVI and high LST values were found in Mexican neighborhoods, implying possible environmental racism. Almost half the Mexican population lives in highly segregated neighborhoods with low and very low SES, mainly located in East San Jose, where, historically, they have been ghettoized. Mexicans, in general, could be at a higher risk of heat stress and heat mortality during heat waves. Future work should examine additional variables (e.g., housing characteristics, crime, social cohesion, and collective behaviors) to comprehensively evaluate the at-risk Mexican population.

TI  - Assessment of aerosols over five cities of Angola based on MERRA-2 reanalysis data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) has been proven as an alternative to the traditional ground-level monitoring of air quality in many countries across the world. Therefore, this study based on MERRA-2 data aims: (i) to characterize the spatiotemporal and component variations of aerosols in the atmosphere over the capital cities (Luanda, Sumbe, Benguela, Huambo and Lubango) of the five most densely populated provinces of Angola from 2010 to 2020; (ii) to analyze the relationship between the monthly mean variation of the total AOD and the meteorological parameters (precipitation, temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity) in those five cities; and (iii) to assess the influence of emissions from the Nyamuragira volcano, located in the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the air quality at the five cities. The most significant contribution to the total AOD was derived from organic carbon, in all the cities, whereby the highest values (0.19-0.23) were in Luanda. Ranges of sulphates across the coastal cities were higher when compared to the interior cities caused by the emissions inventory data. The value of AOD in all the cities increased and reached the peak during the dry season. The HYSPLIT model showed that air masses from Nyamuragira at various heights in November 2011 reached Luanda and Sumbe, and CALIPSO could confirm the existence of volcanic aerosols in this same period. This study allowed to conclude that the variability of AOD loading depends on seasons and regions, thus providing a little more information about the matter.

TI  - Stacked spectral feature space patch: An advanced spectral representation for precise crop classification based on convolutional neural network
T2  - CROP JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral and spatial features in remotely sensed data play an irreplaceable role in classifying crop types for precision agriculture. Despite the thriving establishment of the handcrafted features, designing or selecting such features valid for specific crop types requires prior knowledge and thus remains an open challenge. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively overcome this issue with their advanced ability to generate high-level features automatically but are still inadequate in mining spectral features compared to mining spatial features. This study proposed an enhanced spectral feature called Stacked Spectral Feature Space Patch (SSFSP) for CNN-based crop classification. SSFSP is a stack of two-dimensional (2D) gridded spectral feature images that record various crop types' spatial and intensity distribution characteristics in a 2D feature space consisting of two spectral bands. SSFSP can be input into 2D-CNNs to support the simultaneous mining of spectral and spatial features, as the spectral features are successfully converted to 2D images that can be processed by CNN. We tested the performance of SSFSP by using it as the input to seven CNN models and one multilayer perceptron model for crop type classi-fication compared to using conventional spectral features as input. Using high spatial resolution hyper -spectral datasets at three sites, the comparative study demonstrated that SSFSP outperforms conventional spectral features regarding classification accuracy, robustness, and training efficiency. The theoretical analysis summarizes three reasons for its excellent performance. First, SSFSP mines the spec-tral interrelationship with feature generality, which reduces the required number of training samples. Second, the intra-class variance can be largely reduced by grid partitioning. Third, SSFSP is a highly sparse feature, which reduces the dependence on the CNN model structure and enables early and fast conver-gence in model training. In conclusion, SSFSP has great potential for practical crop classification in pre-cision agriculture.(c) 2022 2022 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

TI  - Differentiation of influenza B lineages circulating in different regions of Brazil, 2014-2016, using molecular assay
T2  - VACCINE: X
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Two antigenically and genetically distinct lineages of influenza B viruses (B/Victoria and B/ Yamagata) have been co-circulating worldwide since 2002. Virological surveillance is essential to differentiate between both lineages with a view to the annual updating of the B component for the trivalent or quadrivalent influenza vaccine composition. Methods: The samples analyzed in the present study were collected by influenza sentinel units located in the Southeast, Midwest, North, and Northeast regions of Brazil, part of the National Influenza Virus Surveillance Network, coordinated by the Ministry of Health of Brazil. A total of 870 influenza B positive samples by reverse transcription real - time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), collected during 2014, 2015, and 2016 influenza seasons, were submitted to the influenza B lineage genotyping panel for characterization as B/Yamagata or Victoria lineages using RT-qPCR. Results: Of the 197 samples analyzed in 2014, a total of 160 (81 %) corresponded to the B/Yamagata lineage, 19 (10 %) to the B/Victoria lineage, and 18 (9 %) to indeterminate lineages. Of the 190 samples analyzed in 2015, a total of 124 (65 %) corresponded to the B/Yamagata lineage; 55 (29 %) to the B/Victoria lineage, whereas 11 (6 %) were of indeterminate lineages. Of the 483 samples analyzed in 2016, a total of 297 (62 %) corresponded to the B /Victoria lineage; 174 (36 %) to the B/Yamagata lineage and 12 (2 %) to indeterminate lineages. This cross-sectional study revealed influenza B virus (IBV) infection in all age groups, and among them, the highest prevalence was observed in individuals between 11 and 49 years of age Our findings demonstrate the match between influenza B virus lineages recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the trivalent vaccine composition to be used in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) and the predominant circulating viruses during the 2014, 2015, and 2016 seasons.

TI  - Death and Sexuality: Mortality Salience Increases Heteronormative Preferences and Stereotyping among Those with High Need for Closure
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOMOSEXUALITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Terror Management Theory has shown that mortality salience can increase outgroup stereotyping and dislike of people who are different. We examined heterosexual participant reactions to profiles of homosexual and heterosexual men after mortality salience utilizing need for closure (NFC) as a moderating variable. We also examined the role of death-thought accessibility (DTA) in these effects. Among those with high NFC, mortality salience increased stereotyping and preference for the heterosexual individual. This effect only occurred when participants examined the profiles before completing the DTA measure. Control participants showed parallel reactions to the mortality salience condition when completing the DTA measure first. We found no reliable effects of mortality salience increasing DTA, and defensiveness decreasing DTA. The current findings demonstrate how two different death reminders can affect reactions to homosexual men among those in high NFC. Potential reasons for the lack of support for DTA in these effects are discussed.

TI  - Clinical factors associated with failed sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is a highly accurate surgical technique for detecting metastases in endometrial cancer. The objective of this study was to identify clinical factors associated with failed mapping. Methods: All patients with endometrial cancer undergoing minimally-invasive staging and planned SLN biopsy from 1/1/2017 to 12/31/2020 at a single institution were identified retrospectively. Demographic, clinicopathologic and treatment data were obtained. Data were compared using descriptive statistics. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were performed to identify predictors of failed mapping. Results: 819 patients were identified with a mean age of 64.6 years (range 26-93) and mean BMI of 35.6 kg/m2 (range 18-68). Most (88.5 %, 725/819) had early -stage disease and endometrioid histology (82.3 %, 674/819). A majority (74.2 %, 608/819) had successful bilateral mapping, and 54 (6.6 %) had unsuccessful bilateral mapping. Increasing BMI was significantly associated with unsuccessful bilateral mapping: patients with BMI > 30 were more likely to have unsuccessful SLN mapping (p = 0.033). Among patients with known lymph node status (799/819), patients with macrometastases and micrometastases were more likely to have failed bilateral mapping compared to those with negative SLNs or isolated tumor cells (p = 0.013). On multivariable analysis, higher BMI and histology were associated with failed bilateral mapping (OR = 1.023, 95 % CI (1.005, 1.041) and OR = 1.678, 95 % CI (1.177, 2.394), respectively). Conclusion: SLN mapping has a high success in patients undergoing minimally-invasive surgical staging for endometrial cancer. Increasing BMI, high risk histology, and lymph node metastases are risk factors for failed mapping.

TI  - A holistic assessment of the sources, prevalence, and distribution of bisphenol A and analogues in water, sediments, biota and plastic litter of the Ebro Delta (Spain)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the main ubiquitous compounds released from plastics in the environment. This compound, considered an endocrine disruptor, poses a risk to aquatic wildlife and human population, being included in multiple environmental monitoring programmes. Following the regulations restricting BPA use in the last years, BPA-like chemicals have been produced and used as BPA substitutes. However, they are not commonly included in monitoring programs yet and their presence is thus misrepresented, despite showing similar endo-crine disrupting potential. In this work, an analytical method for analysing bisphenol A and five of its analogues (Bisphenol S, B, F, AF and Tetrabromobisphenol A) is described, validated for water (riverine, sea and waste-water), sediment, and biota (fish and biofilm) and applied to monitor their presence in the Ebro River Delta (NE Spain). In addition, plastic litter was also collected to evaluate their role as potential source of bisphenols. All compounds except BPF were detected in the analysed samples. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were discarded as major sources of BPs into the natural aquatic environment, as no BPs were detected in treated ef-fluents. Indeed, the high levels of BPs in the natural environment could be related with direct discharge of raw wastewater from small rural population nucleus. The analysis of riverine plastic leachates yielded 4 out of the 6 BPs analysed, strengthening the hypothesis that plastic debris are also a source of BPs in the natural environment. Whereas Bisphenol S and BPA were detected in water and, to a limited extent, in biota, less polar analogues (mainly BPAF and TBBPA) were not found in any of the water samples. Instead, these hydrophobic BPs were found in fish tissues and biofilm, pointing out plastics and microplastics as their possible vectors. Finally, biofilm demonstrated its potential as sentinel of chemical contamination in freshwater environment.

TI  - Mapping rapeseed planting areas using an automatic phenology- and pixel-based algorithm (APPA) in Google Earth Engine
T2  - CROP JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The timely and rapid mapping of rapeseed planting areas is desirable for national food security. Most cur-rent rapeseed mapping methods depend strongly on images with good observations obtained during the flowering stages. Although vegetation indices have been proposed to identify the rapeseed flowering stage in some areas, automatically mapping rapeseed planting areas in large regions is still challenging. We developed an automatic phenology-and pixel-based algorithm (APPA) by integrating Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 satellite data. We found that the Normalized Rapeseed Flowering Index shows unique spectral characteristics during the flowering and post-flowering periods, which distinguish rapeseed parcels from other land-use types (urban, water, forest, grass, maize, wheat, barley, and soybean). To verify the robust-ness of APPA, we applied APPA to seven areas in five rapeseed-producing countries with flowering images unavailable. The rapeseed maps by APPA showed consistently high accuracies with producer accuracies of (0.87-0.93 and F-scores of 0.92-0.95 based on 4503 verification samples. They showed high spatial consistency at the pixel level with the land cover Scientific Expertise Centres (SEC) map in France, Crop Map of England in United Kingdom, national-scale crop-and land-cover map of Germany, and Annual Crop Inventory in Canada at the pixel level. We propose APPA as a highly promising method for automatically and efficiently mapping rapeseed areas.(c) 2022 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

TI  - Continental-scale evaluation of three ECOSTRESS land surface temperature products over Europe and Africa: Temperature-based validation and cross-satellite comparison
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial resolution land surface temperature (LST, <100 m) is crucial for agricultural water management, crop water stress monitoring, fire mapping, urban heat island study and volcano eruption detection. LST re-trievals from the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) launched in June 2018, together with the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER, launched in 1999) and the Landsat series (since 1972), comprise the state-of-the-art high spatial res-olution LST datasets publicly accessible. Recently, we generated the ECOSTRESS LST product over Europe and Africa using both the temperature and emissivity separation (TES) and split-window (SW) algorithms under the European ECOSTRESS Hub (EEH). Here, we validated the official Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) TES (Collection 1), EEH TES and EEH SW ECOSTRESS LST products over Europe and Africa between August 1, 2018 and December 31, 2021 by comparing against the in-situ measurements at 9 sites over a wide variety of land cover types. Meanwhile, the validation results were compared with those obtained for ASTER and Landsat LST at the same sites for a thorough understanding of the consistency among these high spatial resolution LST products. The results reveal that the three ECOSTRESS LST products have consistent performances, with an overall RMSE around 2 K. A cold bias around 1 K exists for all three ECOSTRESS LST, which is presumably originated from the radiometric calibration of the sensor in Collection 1 data. The Landsat LST shows a similar accuracy, with an RMSE of 2.20 K and bias of 0.54 K. The EEHSW LST show the highest consistency with Landsat LST, possibly due to the identical emissivity correction process. The performance of ASTER LST is also similar, with an RMSE of 1.98 K and bias of 0.9 K. The precisions of all the LST products are around 1.5 K. Future recalibration of the ECOSTRESS Level 1 radiance data in Collection 2 is expected to further improve the accuracy of ECOSTRESS LST. Overall, this study supports the adaptation of LST retrieval algorithms for the future thermal missions.

TI  - An Efficient Multispectral Image Classification and Optimization Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A significant amount of effort and cost is required to collect training samples for remote sensing image classifications. The study of remote sensing and how to read multispectral images is becoming more important. High-dimensional multispectral images are created by the various bands that show how materials behave. The need for more information about things and the improvement of sensor resolutions have led to the creation of multispectral data with a higher size. In recent years, it has been shown that the high dimensionality of these data makes it hard to preprocess them in multiple ways. Recent research has demonstrated that one of the most crucial methods to address this issue is by adopting a variety of learning strategies. But as the data gets more complicated, these methodologies are not adequate to support. The proposed methodology shows that the classification experiment using remote sensing images indicates the maximum likelihood classifier with different deep learning models; weight vector (WV) AdaBoost and ADAM can greatly limit overfitting, and it obtains high classification accuracy. Proposed VGG16 and Inception v3 increase classification accuracy along with optimization process produce 96.08%.

TI  - Quantifying the effects of stripe rust disease on wheat canopy spectrum based on eliminating non-physiological stresses
T2  - CROP JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The wheat canopy reflectance spectrum is affected by many internal and external factors such as diseases and growth stage. Separating the effects of disease stress on the crop from the observed mixed signals is crucial for increasing the precision of remote sensing monitoring of wheat stripe rust. The canopy spec-trum of winter wheat infected by stripe rust was processed with the difference-in-differences (DID) algo-rithm used in econometrics. The monitoring accuracies of wheat stripe rust before and after processing with the DID algorithm were compared in the presence of various external factors, disease severity, and several simulated satellite sensors. The correlation between the normalized difference vegetation index processed by the DID algorithm (NDVI-DID) and the disease severity level (SL) increased in comparison with the NDVI before processing. The increase in precision in the natural disease area in the field in the presence of large differences in growth stage, growth, planting, and management of the crop was greater than that in the controlled experiment. For low disease levels (SL < 20%), the R2 of the regression of NDVI-DID on SL was 38.8% higher than that of the NDVI and the root mean square error (RMSE) was reduced by 11.1%. The increase in precision was greater than that for the severe level (SL > 40%). According to the measured hyperspectral data, the spectral reflectance of three satellite sensor levels was simulated. The wide-band NDVI was calculated. Compared with the wide-band NDVI and vegetation indexes (VIS) before DID processing, there were increases in the correlation between SL and the various types of VIS-DID, as well as in the correlation between SL and NDVI-DID. It is feasible to apply the DID algo-rithm to multispectral satellite data and diverse types of VIS for monitoring wheat stripe rust. Our results improve the quantification of independent effects of stripe rust infection on canopy reflectance spectrum, increase the precision of remote sensing monitoring of wheat stripe rust, and provide a reference for remote sensing monitoring of other crop diseases.(c) 2022 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

TI  - Evaluation of UAV-derived multimodal remote sensing data for biomass prediction and drought tolerance assessment in bioenergy sorghum
T2  - CROP JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Screening for drought tolerance is critical to ensure high biomass production of bioenergy sorghum in arid or semi-arid environments. The bottleneck in drought tolerance selection is the challenge of accurately predicting biomass for a large number of genotypes. Although biomass prediction by low -altitude remote sensing has been widely investigated on various crops, the performance of the predic-tions are not consistent, especially when applied in a breeding context with hundreds of genotypes. In some cases, biomass prediction of a large group of genotypes benefited from multimodal remote sensing data; while in other cases, the benefits were not obvious. In this study, we evaluated the performance of single and multimodal data (thermal, RGB, and multispectral) derived from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for biomass prediction for drought tolerance assessments within a context of bioenergy sorghum breeding. The biomass of 360 sorghum genotypes grown under well-watered and water-stressed regimes was predicted with a series of UAV-derived canopy features, including canopy structure, spectral reflec-tance, and thermal radiation features. Biomass predictions using canopy features derived from the mul-timodal data showed comparable performance with the best results obtained with the single modal data with coefficients of determination (R2) ranging from 0.40 to 0.53 under water-stressed environment and 0.11 to 0.35 under well-watered environment. The significance in biomass prediction was highest with multispectral followed by RGB and lowest with the thermal sensor. Finally, two well-recognized yield -based drought tolerance indices were calculated from ground truth biomass data and UAV predicted bio-mass, respectively. Results showed that the geometric mean productivity index outperformed the yield stability index in terms of the potential for reliable predictions by the remotely sensed data. Collectively, this study demonstrated a promising strategy for the use of different UAV-based imaging sensors to quantify yield-based drought tolerance.(c) 2022 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

TI  - COVID-19 Restriction Movement Control Order (MCO) Impacted Emissions of Peninsular Malaysia Using Sentinel-2a and Sentinel-5p Satellite
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The unprecedented outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has impacted the whole world in every aspect including health, social life, economic activity, education, and the environment. The pandemic has led to an improvement in air quality all around the world, including in Malaysia. Lockdowns have resulted in industry shutting down and road travel decreasing which can reduce the emission of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) and air pollution. This research assesses the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on emissions using the Air Pollution Index (API), aerosols, and GHG which is Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) in Malaysia. The data used is from Sentinel-5p and Sentinel-2A which monitor the air quality based on Ozone (O-3) and NO2 concentration. Using an interpolated API Index Map comparing 2019, before the implementation of a Movement Control Order (MCO), and 2020, after the MCO period we examine the impact on pollution during and after the COVID-19 lockdown. Data used Sentinel-5p, Sentinel-2A, and Air Pollution Index of Malaysia (APIMS) to monitor the air quality that contains NO2 concentration. The result has shown the recovery in air quality during the MCO implementation which indirectly shows anthropogenic activities towards the environmental condition. The study will help to enhance and support the policy and scope for air pollution management strategies as well as raise public awareness of the main causes that contribute to air pollution.

T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The variability in changing climate has been predicted to lead to significant changes in the world's oceans primary productivity. Recent years have experienced more intense algal blooms during the spring-summer months in many coastal waters. Here we present results from the analysis of satellite ocean color products from MODIS-Terra datasets during June 2 to July 20, 2021, corresponding to the most intense period of the Enteromorpha (Ulva) prolifera algae (U. prolifera) bloom in the Yellow Sea. Because the studies on sea surface temperature (SST) variability over the U. prolifera bloom have not yet been fully explored by satellite measurements in the offshore waters of Qingdao, China, we analyzed the MODIS SST and their relationship with the U. prolifera blooms in the 2021 summer months. Analysis of SST showed a variation in the range of 18-24 degrees C in near-shore waters in response to the bloom of green algae. We find that a significant thermal front with a gradient magnitude of 0.03 degrees C/km was developed over the shelf and offshore regions during the algal bloom period. The observed changes in thermal fronts are driven by high-wind speed and Ekman pumping-velocity processes. We concluded that the changes in SSTs with a range of 20-23 degrees C, high-magnitude thermal fronts and wind speed, and Ekman pumping velocity resulted in the intensification of the largest bloom of U. prolifera in the Yellow Sea during the study period.

TI  - ConstraintID: An online software tool to assist grain growers in Australia identify areas affected by soil constraints
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil constraints, such as soil sodicity, salinity and acidity, are one cause of yield loss for grain growers globally. A first step towards reducing the associated yield gap is the identification of the area affected and the soil constraint/s responsible for the yield loss. Within a single field, persistent spatial variation of crop growth that repeats year after year is likely due to some form of soil constraint. Vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery can provide a valuable alternative to yield maps for assessing these persistent patterns. The variation identified from remote-sensing data can be compared with soil data from the field to help identify which soil constraints are potentially causing yield differences. This application note describes ConstraintID (www. constraintid.com.au), a web-based software tool that makes it easy for growers to use and interact with remote-sensing data to (1) reveal the persistent long-term variation of crop growth within their fields, (2) devise targeted soil sampling plans and (3) interpret the resulting soil data in view of critical values for certain soil constraints.

TI  - RaVæn: unsupervised change detection of extreme events using ML on-board satellites
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Applications such as disaster management enormously benefit from rapid availability of satellite observations. Traditionally, data analysis is performed on the ground after being transferred-downlinked-to a ground station. Constraints on the downlink capabilities, both in terms of data volume and timing, therefore heavily affect the response delay of any downstream application. In this paper, we introduce RaV ae n, a lightweight, unsupervised approach for change detection in satellite data based on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), with the specific purpose of on-board deployment. RaV ae n pre-processes the sampled data directly on the satellite and flags changed areas to prioritise for downlink, shortening the response time. We verified the efficacy of our system on a dataset-which we release alongside this publication-composed of time series containing a catastrophic event, demonstrating that RaV ae n outperforms pixel-wise baselines. Finally, we tested our approach on resource-limited hardware for assessing computational and memory limitations, simulating deployment on real hardware.

TI  - Comparison of algorithms for monitoring wheat powdery mildew using multi-angular remote sensing data
T2  - CROP JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Powdery mildew is a disease that threatens wheat production and causes severe economic losses world-wide. Its timely diagnosis is imperative for preventing and controlling its spread. In this study, the multi-angle canopy spectra and disease severity of wheat were investigated at several developmental stages and degrees of disease severity. Four wavelength variable-selected algorithms: successive projection (SPA), competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), feature selection learning (Relief-F), and genetic algorithm (GA), were used to identify bands sensitive to powdery mildew. The wavelength vari-ables selected were used as input variables for partial least squares (PLS), extreme learning machine (ELM), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms, to construct a suitable predic-tion model for powdery mildew. Spectral reflectance and conventional vegetation indices (VIs) displayed angle effects under several disease severity indices (DIs). The CARS method selected relatively few wave-length variables and showed a relatively homogeneous distribution across the 13 viewing zenith angles. Overall accuracies of the four modeling algorithms were ranked as follows: ELM (0.70-0.82) > PLS (0.63- 0.79) > SVM (0.49-0.69) > RF (0.43-0.69). Combinations of features and algorithms generated varied accuracies, with coefficients of determination (R2) single-peaked at different observation angles. The con-structed CARS-ELM model extracted a predictable bivariate relationship between the multi-angle canopy spectrum and disease severity, yielding an R2 > 0.8 at each measured angle. Especially for larger angles, monitoring accuracies were increased relative to the optimal VI model (40% at -60 degrees, 33% at +60 degrees), indi-cating that the CARS-ELM model is suitable for extreme angles of -60 degrees and +60 degrees. The results are proposed to provide a technical basis for rapid and large-scale monitoring of wheat powdery mildew.(c) 2022 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

TI  - Function fitting for modeling seasonal normalized difference vegetation index time series and early forecasting of soybean yield
T2  - CROP JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecasting crop yields based on remote sensing data is one of the most important tasks in agriculture. Soybean is the main crop in the Russian Far East. It is desirable to forecast soybean yield as early as possible while maintaining high accuracy. This study aimed to investigate seasonal time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to achieve early forecasting of soybean yield. This research used data from the Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS), an arable-land mask obtained from the VEGA-Science web service, and soybean yield data for 2008-2017 for the Jewish Autonomous Region (JAR) districts. Four approximating functions were fitted to model the NDVI time series: Gaussian, double logistic (DL), and quadratic and cubic polynomials. In the period from calendar weeks 22-42 (end of May to mid-October), averaged over two districts, the model using the DL function showed the highest accuracy (mean absolute percentage error -4.0%, root mean square error (RMSE) -0.029, P < 0.01). The yield forecast accuracy of prediction in the period of weeks 25-30 in JAR municipalities using the parameters of the Gaussian function was higher (P < 0.05) than that using the other functions. The mean forecast error for the Gaussian function was 14.9% in week 25 (RMSE was 0.21 t ha-1) and 5.1%-12.9% in weeks 26-30 (RMSE varied from 0.06 to 0.15 t ha-1) according to the 2013-2017 data. In weeks 31-32, the error was 5.0%-5.4% (RMSE was 0.07 t ha-1) using the Gaussian parameters and 7.4%-7.7% (RMSE was 0.09-0.11 t ha-1) for the DL function. When the method was applied to municipal districts of other soy-producing regions of the Russian Far East. RMSE was 0.14-0.32 t ha-1 in weeks 25-26 and did not exceed 0.20 t ha-1 in subsequent weeks.

TI  - Optical discrimination of emulsified oil in optically complex estuarine waters
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal estuaries, characterized by highly varying waters with complex optical properties, pose challenges for effective oil discrimination via optical remote sensing. In this study, an object-based spectra comparison (OBSC) approach was proposed to extract emulsified oil slicks from Balikpapan Bay, Indonesia, using optical imagery from Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and PlanetScope. The OBSC approach utilizes the spectral sig-natures of oil emulsion to develop emulsified oil index and normalized emulsified oil index to identify potentially emulsified oil objects from MSI and PlanetScope, respectively. Reflectance spectra of the potential objects were compared with those from dynamically-selected nearby waters to rule out false-positive detections, accounting for the varying water optical properties in the estuary. This OBSC approach performed well in extracting emulsified oil slicks from optical images. Moreover, multiple sensor capabilities for oil detection were compared, and requirements for detection and discrimination of oil spills in the coastal estuary environment were further discussed.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Lake storage change serves as a unique indicator of natural climate change on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). However, comprehensive lake storage data, especially for lakes smaller than 10 km(2), are still lacking in the region. In this dataset, we completed a census of annual relative lake volume (RLV) for 976 lakes, which are larger than 1 km(2), on the endorheic basin of the Tibetan Plateau (EBTP) during 1989-2019 using Landsat imagery and digital terrain models. Our method first identifies individual lakes, determines their analysis extents and calculates annual lake area from Landsat imagery. It then derives lake area-elevation relationship, estimates lake surface elevation, and calculates RLV. Validation and comparison with several existing datasets indicate our data are more reliable and comprehensive. Our study complements existing lake datasets by providing a complete and long-term lake water volume change data for the region.

TI  - Evaluation of a deep-learning model for multispectral remote sensing of land use and crop classification
T2  - CROP JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution deep-learning-based remote-sensing imagery analysis has been widely used in land-use and crop-classification mapping. However, the influence of composite feature bands, including complex feature indices arising from different sensors on the backbone, patch size, and predictions in transferable deep models require further testing. The experiments were conducted in six sites in Henan province from 2019 to 2021. This study sought to enable the transfer of classification models across regions and years for Sentinel-2A (10-m resolution) and Gaofen PMS (2-m resolution) imagery. With feature selection and up-sampling of small samples, the performance of UNet++ architecture on five backbones and four patch sizes was examined. Joint loss, mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), and epoch time were analyzed, and the optimal backbone and patch size for both sensors were Timm-RegNetY-320 and 256 x 256, respec-tively. The overall accuracy and F1 scores of the Sentinel-2A predictions ranged from 96.86% to 97.72% and 71.29% to 80.75%, respectively, compared to 75.34%-97.72% and 54.89%-73.25% for the Gaofen predictions. The accuracies of each site indicated that patch size exerted a greater influence on model per-formance than the backbone. The feature-selection-based predictions with UNet++ architecture and up -sampling of minor classes demonstrated the capabilities of deep-learning generalization for classifying complex ground objects, offering improved performance compared to the UNet, Deeplab V3+, Random Forest, and Object-Oriented Classification models. In addition to the overall accuracy, confusion matrices, precision, recall, and F1 scores should be evaluated for minor land-cover types. This study contributes to large-scale, dynamic, and near-real-time land-use and crop mapping by integrating deep learning and multi-source remote-sensing imagery (c) 2022 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

TI  - Assessing canopy nitrogen and carbon content in maize by canopy spectral reflectance and uninformative variable elimination
T2  - CROP JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing canopy nitrogen content (CNC) and canopy carbon content (CCC) of maize by hyperspectral remote sensing data permits estimating cropland productivity, protecting farmland ecology, and investi-gating the nitrogen and carbon cycles in the atmosphere. This study aimed to assess maize CNC and CCC using canopy hyperspectral information and uninformative variable elimination (UVE). Vegetation indices (VIs) and wavelet functions were adopted for estimating CNC and CCC under varying water and nitrogen regimes. Linear, nonlinear, and partial least squares (PLS) regression models were fitted to VIs and wavelet functions to estimate CNC and CCC, and were evaluated for their prediction accuracy. UVE was used to eliminate uninformative variables, improve the prediction accuracy of the models, and simplify the PLS regression models (UVE-PLS). For estimating CNC and CCC, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, based on red edge and NIR wavebands) yielded the highest correlation coeffi-cients (r > 0.88). PLS regression models showed the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) among all models. However, PLS regression models required nine VIs and four wavelet functions, increasing their complexity. UVE was used to retain valid spectral parameters and optimize the PLS regression models. UVE-PLS regression models improved validation accuracy and resulted in more accurate CNC and CCC than the PLS regression models. Thus, canopy spectral reflectance integrated with UVE-PLS can accurately reflect maize leaf nitrogen and carbon status. (c) 2022 Crop Science Society of China and Institute of Crop Science, CAAS.

TI  - A new method for tropospheric tomography using GNSS and Fengyun-4A data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) tropospheric tomography can reflect a three-dimensional distribu-tion of water vapour. However, the common ill-posed problem for GNSS tropospheric tomography needs to be addressed. The relatively newly launched Chinese Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) satellite water vapour data have a high spatiotemporal resolution and may be used to assist in resolving the ill-posed problem. In this study, a new tropospheric tomographic method using both GNSS and FY-4A data was proposed. Tomographic schemes for the new method with the coverage rate of GNSS sites (CRGS, which is defined as the ratio of the number of GNSS sites to the number of horizontal grids in the tropospheric tomography) of 0.2, 0.28, 0.36 and 0.44 were compared with traditional tomographic schemes using the same CRGS. Test results showed that adding FY-4A data, in addition to GNSS data, to the tomographic system could effectively increase the number of voxels crossed by signals, which benefits the ill-posed problem. When CRGS equated 0.28, the new method had the largest improvement compared with the traditional method, in which the mean of the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the water vapour density (WVD) was reduced from 2.44 and 1.38 g/m3 to 2.05 and 1.22 g/m3 using radiosonde and ERA5 data as the references, respectively. Statistical results showed that the new method that used both GNSS and FY-4A data outperformed the traditional method that only used GNSS data.

TI  - Integrated coastal subsidence analysis using InSAR, LiDAR, and land cover data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence is an important cause of relative sea-level rise along the Gulf Coast. There is a lack of effective monitoring of coastal subsidence with high accuracy and high spatial resolution for improving coastal risk assessment and mitigation. This study is the first attempt to integrate satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) methods to investigate the spatiotemporal pattern of coastal subsidence. The study area is around Eagle Point, Texas, a region known for its fast rate of relative sea-level rise in recent decades. From 2006 to 2011, the line-of-sight velocities were up to-33 mm/year based on ascending ALOS-1 PALSAR-1 images. From 2016 to 2021, the vertical velocities were up to-34 mm/ year based on ascending and descending Sentinel-1 images. Additional details of the subsidence pattern were revealed by incorporating the surface difference derived from 1-m airborne LiDAR results. Comparisons of the InSAR-derived velocities from image time series and the LiDAR-derived surface changes from time-lapsed ob-servations were conducted at different spatial levels with linkages to land cover patterns and topography. The results showed that local subsidence rates could vary significantly below the spatial resolution of InSAR results, indicating a valuable role of airborne LiDAR results in extending InSAR results to parcel and building levels and explaining subpixel uncertainties. Also, subsidence appeared to be stronger in vegetated areas than in developed areas and negatively correlated with surface imperviousness. The magnitude of subsidence was not correlated with elevation along selected transect lines. Overall, this study demonstrated the benefits of combining InSAR results with other geospatial datasets to characterize coastal subsidence. In particular, the high vertical accuracy of InSAR results and the high spatial resolution of airborne LiDAR results could be complementary, highlighting the necessity of multi-resolution data fusion to support studies on coastal flood vulnerability, infrastructure reliability, and erosion control.

TI  - Integrating remotely sensed water stress factor with a crop growth model for winter wheat yield estimation in the North China Plain during 2008-2018
T2  - CROP JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter wheat yield Accurate estimation of regional-scale crop yield under drought conditions allows farmers and agricultural agencies to make well-informed decisions and guide agronomic management. However, few studies have focused on using the crop model data assimilation (CMDA) method for regional-scale winter wheat yield estimation under drought stress and partial-irrigation conditions. In this study, we developed a CMDA framework to integrate remotely sensed water stress factor (MOD16 ET PET-1) with the WOFOST model using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for winter wheat yield estimation at the regional scale in the North China Plain (NCP) during 2008-2018. According to our results, integration of MOD16 ET PET-1 with the WOFOST model produced more accurate estimates of regional winter wheat yield than open-loop simulation. The correlation coefficient of simulated yield with statistical yield increased for each year and error decreased in most years, with r ranging from 0.28 to 0.65 and RMSE ranging from 700.08 to1966.12 kg ha(-1). Yield estimation using the CMDA method was more suitable in drought years(r = 0.47, RMSE = 919.04 kg ha(-1)) than in normal years (r = 0.30, RMSE = 1215.51 kg ha(-1)). Our approach performed better in yield estimation under drought conditions than the conventional empirical correlation method using vegetation condition index (VCI). This research highlighted the potential of assimilating remotely sensed water stress factor, which can account for irrigation benefit, into crop model for improving the accuracy of winter wheat yield estimation at the regional scale especially under drought conditions, and this approach can be easily adapted to other regions and crops.

M3  - Article
AB  - Trees play vital roles in urban space such as regulating temperature in a microclimatic environment, maintaining soil health, providing oxygen, and many direct and indirect human health benefits. The study evaluated the bioclimatic parameters of the proposed Neom geographical area for identifying the potential landscape for tree scaling linked to biodiversity conservation strategies. The potentially suitable ten spatial factors (slope; elevation: DEM, soil wetness; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index: Landsat data, aridity index, annual precipitation, annual temperature, potential evapotranspiration, the temperature of the coldest quarter, and temperature of the warmest quarter) were identified and brought into GIS modeling for integration based on AHP statistical methods. The hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi* statistic) was carried out for better understanding. The analysis revealed that approximately 22% (4948 km(2)) of the landscape has greater than 50% of potentiality for restoration of nature conservation goals linked to biodiversity, afforestation, and ecosystem services. The hotspot analysis manifested that 2596 km(2) (with a 99% of confidence level) has high suitability for biodiversity conservation goals if harnessed scientifically. Neom's proposed area needs one billion additional trees as carbon neutrality to accommodate one million persons in the future. This research is important because this is the first preliminary evaluation modeled in the GIS environment based on standard statistical methods for making outstanding synergic future strategies for the expansion of biodiversity conservation, and greenery projects within the proposed land area of Neom.

TI  - From satellite interferometry displacements to potential damage maps: A tool for risk reduction and urban planning br
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) is a consolidated tool for detecting and monitoring ground surface displacements. The availability of satellite data with free access policy and high monitoring capabilities (in terms of resolution and acquisition frequency) is increasing. Moreover, the first continental displacement map of Europe will be freely available in quarter one 2022 by the latest Copernicus Service, the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS). The EGMS will provide ground displacement maps, updated every year, delivering valuable information to a wide range of users, such as public or governmental institutions, industry, academia, and citizens. This vast amount of information needs semi-automatic tools and methodologies to derive user -oriented products that can be easily used by land use and urban planning decision-makers, who are often un-familiar with PSI. This work proposes a semi-automatic procedure to identify damage prone areas in urban environments from wide-area PSI displacement maps. The proposed method identifies the most significant Active Deformation Areas (ADAs) to calculate three products based on the displacement intensity gradient: the Gradient Intensity Map, the Gradient Vectors and Time Series, and the Potential Damage Map. These products allow identifying buildings and urban structures exposed to potential damage, which could be followed by a more detailed building-based vulnerability and risk assessment. The methodology has been applied to an area of the province of Granada (Andalucta, Spain) but it can be applied to any other urban environment where PSI displacement maps are available. To demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the proposed method, results are discussed in five coastal resorts (Cerro Gordo, Punta de la Mona, Marina del Este, Alfa Mar, and Monte de los Almendros), strongly affected by slope movements. The methodology allowed to derive 175 ADAs from about 200,000 measurement points. About 15% of the resulting area has been found to correspond to high or very high gradient intensity class, and 192 out of 633 buildings have been identified to be prone to moderate or high potential damage. A damage prediction test has been realized through Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, based on a damage inventory map derived from field surveys. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology to localize damaged or potentially damaged buildings, substantially reducing the time of analysis.

TI  - Beyond Serous: Treatment Options for Rare Endometrial Cancers
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Opinion statement Rare endometrial cancers are high-grade, aggressive malignancies which are often diagnosed at an advanced stage, and account for disproportionately more deaths than their more common low-grade counterparts. Standard of care includes a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Surgery consists of complete hysterectomy, and more recent evidence supports replacing a full lymphadenectomy with sentinel node mapping. Paclitaxel and carboplatin remain the mainstays of chemotherapy, while current studies incorporating immunotherapy will inform future practice. Whether and how to incorporate radiation remains controversial, and certain histologic subtypes, such as carcinosarcomas, may benefit from radiation more than others. Owing to their relative rarity, it is difficult to conduct clinical trials in this patient population, which has hindered the development of effective therapies for rare malignancies. Molecular profiling has offered insight into the pathogenesis of rare endometrial cancers, providing actionable targets for personalized therapy.

TI  - Onboard Pointing Error Detection and Estimation of Observation Satellite Data Using Extended Kalman Filter
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite communication is embellished constantly by providing information, ensuring security, and enables the communication among huge at a particular time efficiently. The satellite navigation helps in determining the people's location. Global development, natural disasters, change in climatic conditions, agriculture crop growth, etc., are monitored using satellite observation. Hence, the satellite includes detailed information data, and it must be protected confidentially. The field of the satellite is enhanced at an astonishing pace. Satellite data play an important role in this modern world; hence, the onboard-satellite data must secure through the proper selection of error detection and estimation schema. Lightweight deep learning algorithm based on Extended Kalman Filter (KFK) is proposed to detect and estimate onboard pointing error such as an error in attitude and orbit. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is widely used in the satellite system. EKF is utilized in this proposed model to detect the onboard pointing error such as attitude and orbit determination. An autonomous estimation of orbit position is possible through space-borne gravity. The information obtained through the observation of satellite data is compared with the accurate gravity model in detecting the error. The utilization of EKF reduces the dependence of the ground tracking system in satellite determination. The orbital altitude and orbital position are the most important challenges faced in the satellite determination system. The satellite model using the Extended Kalman Filter is an optimum method in estimating the orbital parameters. The errors in the linearization process are detected, and this can be overcome through the proper selection of linear expansion point with the EKF algorithmic model with the Jacobian matrix calculation. The results show that the EKF implementation helps in attaining better accuracy than other methodologies. Its contribution is enormous to many space missions, autonomous rendezvous and docking for manned and unmanned missions (e.g., ISS operations and beyond, in-orbit servicing, and in-orbit refueling), routine satellite OD operations, orbital debris removal systems, Space Situational Awareness (SSA) operations, and others.

TI  - Surgical complications following sentinel lymph node biopsy guided by γ-probe and methylene blue in 113 tumour-bearing dogs
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an accepted veterinary surgical procedure given the impact of early detection of nodal metastases on staging of several canine malignancies. This study aims at reporting the incidence and risk factors for surgical complications of SLNB in tumour-bearing dogs. A total of 113 client-owned dogs that underwent tumour excision and SLNB guided by gamma-probing and blue dye were retrospectively enrolled. Recorded variables included: signalment, location and number of extirpated lymphocenters and nodes, time for SLNB, histopathological status of excised nodes. Incidence of SLNB complications was calculated. They were classified as minor and major based on severity and required treatment, and as short-term (0-30 days) and long-term (31-90 days). Univariate analysis with generalized linear model with binomial error estimated the association between variables and incidence of SLNB complications. Significance was set at 5%. Median overall time for SLNB was 25 min. Surgeons excised one node in 38% of dogs and multiple nodes in 62% of cases, belonging to one (62%) or multiple (38%) lymphocenters. Metastases were detected in 45% of nodes. No intraoperative complications occurred. The overall incidence of postoperative complications of SLNB was 21,24%, the majority of which (91.67%) were minor. Only increasing dogs' weight was associated with an increased incidence of SLNB complications (p = .00976). Sentinel lymphadenectomy was associated with a relatively low incidence of complications, most of which were self-limiting. The low morbidity and previously reported impact on staging of SLNB justify its implementation to collect data for prognostic studies.

TI  - Placental pathology as a marker of brain injury in infants with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy
T2  - EARLY HUMAN DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) can lead to devastating consequences for the affected in-fant. Although therapeutic cooling benefits infants with moderate and severe HIE, differentiating mild from moderate-severe HIE may be challenging. The placenta reflects the fetal intrauterine environment and may reveal underlying processes that affect brain injury.Aim: To describe placental histopathology using the Amsterdam Placental Workshop Group Criteria in different grades of HIE.Study design: Retrospective cohort.Subjects: Infants admitted to a tertiary care neonatal intensive care unit with a diagnosis of HIE between 2011 and 2016.Outcome measure: Maternal and neonatal clinical variables and placental histopathology using the Amsterdam Placental Workshop Group Criteria were compared between mild and moderate-severe HIE. Mann-Whitney or t -test or chi 2 were performed for bivariate associations as appropriate. To explain the relationship between placental pathology and severity of HIE odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using lo-gistic regression models.Results: Of the 73 infants in the study, 23 had mild and 50 moderate-sever HIE. There was no difference in maternal and neonatal characteristics except for sentinel events which were higher in the moderate-severe group. On placental histopathology, acute inflammation, including fetal inflammatory reaction (FIR) were significantly higher in the moderate-severe group. After adjusting for confounders, FIR remained significantly associated with moderate-severe HIE, ORs 6.29, 95 % CI 1.5-25.Conclusion: Our study demonstrates FIR in the placenta is associated with severity of HIE.

TI  - In situ and satellite-based estimates of cloud properties and aerosol-cloud interactions over the southeast Atlantic Ocean
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In situ cloud probe data from the NASA ObseRvations of Aerosols above CLouds and their intEractionS (ORACLES) field campaign were used to estimate the effective radius (R-e), cloud optical thickness (tau), and cloud droplet concentration (N-c) for marine stratocumulus over the southeast Atlantic Ocean. The in situ R-e, tau, and N-c were compared with co-located Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrievals of R-e and tau and MODIS-derived N-c. For 145 cloud profiles, a MODIS retrieval was co-located with in situ data with a time gap of less than 1 h. On average, the MODIS R-e and tau (11.3 mu m and 11.7) were 1.6 mu m and 2.3 higher than the in situ R-e and tau with Pearson's correlation coefficients (R) of 0.77 and 0.73, respectively. The average MODIS N-c (151.5 cm(-3)) was within 1 cm(-3) of the average in situ N-c with an R of 0.90.The 145 cloud profiles were classified into 67 contact profiles where an aerosol concentration (N-a) greater than 500 cm(-3) was sampled within 100 m above cloud tops and 78 separated profiles where N-a less than 500 cm(-3) was sampled up to 100 m above cloud tops. Contact profiles had a higher in situ N-c (by 88 cm(-3)), higher tau (by 2.5), and lower in situ R-e (by 2.2 mu m) compared to separated profiles. These differences were associated with aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI), and MODIS estimates of the differences were within 5 cm(-3), 0.5, and 0.2 mu m of the in situ estimates when profiles with MODIS R-e>15 mu m or MODIS tau>25 were removed. The agreement between MODIS and in situ estimates of changes in R-e, tau, and N-c associated with ACI was driven by small biases in MODIS retrievals of cloud properties relative to in situ measurements across different aerosol regimes. Thus, when combined with estimates of aerosol location and concentration, MODIS retrievals of marine stratocumulus cloud properties over the southeast Atlantic can be used to study ACI over larger domains and longer timescales than possible using in situ data.

TI  - Monitoring dryland trees with remote sensing. Part B: Combining tree cover and plant architecture data to assess degradation and recovery of <i>Argania spinosa</i> woodlands of South Morocco
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The argan woodlands of South Morocco represent an open-canopy dryland forest with traditional silvopastoral usage that includes browsing by goats, sheep and camels, oil production as well as agricultural use. In the past, these forests have undergone extensive clearing, but are now protected by the state. However, the remaining argan woodlands are still under pressure from intensive grazing and illegal firewood collection. Although the argan-forest area seems to be overall decreasing due to large forest clearings for intensive agriculture, little quantitative data is available on the dynamics and overall state of the remaining argan forest. To determine how the argan woodlands in the High Atlas and the Anti-Atlas had changed in tree-crown cover from 1972 to 2018 we used historical black and white HEXAGON satellite images as well as recent WorldView satellite images (see Part A of our study). Because tree shadows can oftentimes not be separated from the tree crown on panchromatic satellite images, individual trees were mapped in three size categories to determine if trees were unchanged, had decreased/increased in crown size or had disappeared or newly grown. The current state of the argan trees was evaluated by mapping tree architectures in the field. Tree-cover changes varied highly between the test sites. Trees that remained unchanged between 1972 and 2018 were in the majority, while tree mortality and tree establishment were nearly even. Small unchanged trees made up 48.4% of all remaining trees, of these 51% showed degraded tree architectures. 40% of small (re-) grown trees were so overbrowsed that they only appeared as bushes, while medium (3-7 m crown diameter) and large trees (> 7 m) showed less degraded trees regardless if they had changed or not. Approaches like grazing exclusion or cereal cultivation lead to a positive influence on tree architecture and less tree-cover decrease. Although the woodland was found to be mostly unchanged 1972-2018, the analysis of tree architecture reveals that a lot of (mostly small) trees remained stable but in a degraded state. This stability might be the result of the small trees' high degradation status and shows the heavy pressure on the argan forest.

TI  - Interpretation of land use/land cover dynamics with the application of geospatial techniques in sarbari khad watershed of Himachal Pradesh, India
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) changes represent anthropogenic transformation of natural landscape. These changes are an important tool in developing strategies for the management of natural resources as well as monitoring environmental changes. LULC mapping and monitoring is required to understand the causes and consequences of over exploitation of natural resources such as land, soil, forest and water. By assessing the uses and misuses of resources and identifying the reasons for misuses, the measures for sustainable development of resources in the fragile Himalayan watersheds can be identified and implemented. The main objective of the present study is to assess the land use/land cover changes in the Sarbari Khad watershed of Kullu Valley. The Sarbari Khad watershed is part of Beas River basin. The changes in LULC have been detected by using remote sensing and GIS (Geographical Information System) techniques for a period of twenty-one years (2000-2021). The satellite images of the National European Space Agency Sentinal-2 of November, 2021 and LandSat-7 image of November 2000 were processed with the help of ERDAS Imagine (2015) and Arc View (3.2a) software. This study reveals that substantial amount of deforestation and snow cover retreat has occurred during this period of two decades due to anthropogenic activities such as expansion of agriculture, especially horticulture, tourism and infrastructure development.

TI  - Assessment of hydrological changes in inland water body using satellite altimetry and Landsat imagery: A case study on Tsengwen Reservoir
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: Tsengwen Reservoir, Taiwan. Study focus: Water level (WL) and water volume (WV) are important indicators for analyzing surface water resources. Satellite remote sensing enables continuous monitoring of inland water bodies in human-inaccessible areas. We integrate Landsat imagery and satellite altimetry to derive long-term (2003-2020) WL and WV variations of Tsengwen Reservoir. First, water area (WA) was extracted from Landsat imagery by Modified Normalized Difference Water Index method and a second-order regression model is proposed to recover the entire WA from cloud -covered images to enhance the data usage. Then, WAs and WLs provided from satellite altimetry are utilized to build a linear regression model which is used to transfer WA into WL. Finally, WV was computed based on the WA and WL. New hydrological insights for the region: Results showed that the usage rate of Landsat-8 imagery utilized for conversion from WA to WL can be increased from 23% to 43%. Moreover, the root -mean-square error of the difference of WLs between the estimates and a local gauge is 2.95-5.56 m, with correlation coefficients (CC) of 0.93-0.99. In addition, the derived WV variations and ground truth showed a good agreement with CC in 0.88-0.97. The results indicated that the integration of multi-source remote sensing technologies can effectively provide long-term hydrological parameters to assist administrative agencies with an appropriate plan for water re-sources management.

TI  - Identifying and evaluating suburbs in China from 2012 to 2020 based on SNPP-VIIRS nighttime light remotely sensed data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Suburbs, as bridges between urban areas and rural hinterlands, are areas with the most intense urban-rural conflicts and drastic land use changes in the urbanization process. Accurate identification and evaluation of suburbs are important to effectively break the urban-rural dichotomy, improve the utilization and management of land resources, and promote urban-rural integration and coordinated development. Previous suburb identi-fication studies have suffered from low identification efficiency owing to the influence of subjective factors, small scales, short time-series, and single data characteristics. Thus, we took China as experimental object, and attempted to identify suburbs from the Suomi National Polar-orbit Partnership's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (SNPP-VIIRS) nighttime light remotely sensed data using the K-means algorithm and subse-quent series of post-processing approaches. Thereafter, our study further evaluated the spatiotemporal dynamics and driving factors of suburb development. Accuracy verification results show that suburb identification based on SNPP-VIIRS data can identify more details than the existing urban area data and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System data. Compared with traditional mutation detection methods, the proposed method has the advantages of being fast, efficient, and less subjective. Furthermore, we found that China's suburbs present a fluctuation-growth trend, with the proportions increasing from 0.6% to 1.3% in the period 2012-2020. China's suburb development was mainly driven by the development of population density, GDP, and road network. Our study provides an innovative way to conduct a rapid, efficient, and large-scale and accurate suburb identification over a long time series, thereby facilitating the study of socio-environmental issues in the urbanization process. The annual series (2012-2020) of suburbs in China are available free of charge at https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/M5EED5.

TI  - Global burned area mapping from Sentinel-3 Synergy and VIIRS active fires
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - After more than two decades of successful provision of global burned area data the MODIS mission is near to its end. Therefore, using alternative images to generate moderate resolution burned area maps becomes critical to guarantee temporal continuity of these products. This paper presents the development of a hybrid algorithm based on Copernicus Sentinel-3 (S3) Synergy (SYN) data and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) 375 m active fires for global detection of burned areas. Using the synergistic and co-located measurements of OLCI and SLSTR instruments on board S3A and S3B, the SYN product offers global, near-daily surface reflectance data at 300 m for both sensors. Our algorithm relied on SYN shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands to compute a multi-temporal separability index that enhanced the burn signal. Active fires from the VIIRS sensor were used to generate spatio-temporal clusters for determining local detection thresholds. Active fires were filtered from those thresholds to obtain the seeds from which a contextual growing was applied to extract burned patches. The algorithm was processed globally for 2019 data to generate a new burned area product, named FireCCIS310. Based on a stratified random sampling, error estimates showed an important reduction of omission errors versus other global burned area products while keeping the commission errors at a similar level (Oe = 41.2% +/- 3.0%, Ce = 19.2% +/- 1.7%). The new FireCCIS310 dataset included 4.99 million km2 for the year 2019, which implied around 1 million more than the precursor FireCCI51 product, based on MODIS 250 m reflectance values. Temporal reporting accuracy was improved as well, detecting 53% of the burned pixels within a 0-1 day difference. Besides, the new product was much less affected by the border effects than FireCCI51, as a result of an improved active fire filtering process. The FireCCIS310 product is accessible through the CCI Open Data Portal (https://climate.esa.int/es/odp/#/dashboard, last accessed on July 2022).

TI  - Soil degradation detected by temporal satellite image in Sao Paulo state, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil degradation is a major challenge in the 21st Century. Tropical regions are having the strongest expansion in agricultural lands. Therefore, novel researches on the soil degradation process are imperative to prevent damage to social and environmental dynamics. The main goal of this research was to generate a Soil Degradation Index in a tropical region that includes the entire agricultural areas of the Sa similar to o Paulo State, Brazil, making use of the factors that can be directly related to it as different environmental indicators. The determination of the areas with exposed soil, based on Landsat time series data (1985-2019), was processed with the Geospatial Soil Sensing System methodology. Additionally, thematic maps of clay, cation exchange capacity and organic matter were generated from the calibration of pixels of Landsat images, taking into account surface soil samples (0-20 cm). The spatialization was performed using a random forest algorithm. The average precipitation was obtained for the period of analysis, using the CHIRPS dataset to generate the historical mean information about the years of study. The surface temperature was determined based on the Landsat 5 and 8 thermal bands. Using the elevation model, other terrain data were obtained, such as LS factor and Slope. The land use information was acquired from the Mapbiomas platform and reclassified into five categories of use. The k-means clustering al-gorithm was used to generate the Soil Degradation Index (SDI), which classified the values of the variables into five degradation categories: from 1, very low, to 5, very high. The model was validated using the OM infor-mation. There was an important relationship between the SDI and the spectral surface reflectance obtained by Landsat. Locations with less OM presented a higher degradation level. Integrating multitemporal remote sensing data and environmental variables proved to be effective to assist the SDI, which can monitor and improve the land use decision-making and public policies, in order to prevent economic and environmental issues.

TI  - Analysis of the Evolution of Sea Water Quality in the Spanish Coast from Satellite Images before and during a Confinement Period
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite imaging, a form of remote sensing, can be used to analyse water quality, which must be monitored for proper and sustainable environmental management. This paper studies the effect of a sea traffic reduction in the Alboran Sea (Spain), analysing the changes in water quality before (from February 3rd, 2020) and during (until June 22nd, 2020) a confinement period. This was an unprecedented event in modern times and brought an interesting opportunity to study dynamics when the human impact is reduced. The study of these dynamics and the concentration levels with little human effect is important for environmental conservation purposes. We applied already existing indices using ArcGIS and ACOLITE to determine the following environmental parameters: colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), suspended particulate matter (SPM), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and harmful algal blooms (HABs). Prequarantine concentration levels can reach up to 4 a(CDOM)440 (CDOM), 18 g/m(3) (SPM), and 100 mu g/L (Chl-a). Most prequarantine days presented an increment in either concentration level or distribution from the day before. The effects a sudden human impact has on an ecosystem which experimented reduced human influence for months were shown. On the day before the said impact (June 12th), three of the parameters were barely detected with concentration levels of mostly 2 a(CDOM)440 (CDOM), 6 g/m(3) (SPM), and 25 mu g/L (Chl-a), and sparse distribution. Afterwards (June 22nd), their levels went up to 4 a(CDOM)440 (CDOM), 14 g/m(3) (SPM), and 1000 mu g/L (Chl-a) and were distributed near the ports. The results presented in this study show that the main drivers of change when human impact was reduced were climatologic events (such as storms). Nevertheless, the importance of the human facto can be seen through the CDOM, SPM, and Chl-a plume near port areas observed the day after port activity was reactivated, June 22nd.

TI  - Examination of the Earthquake (Samos Island) in Izmir (30.10.2020) by Using Cors-Tr GNSS Observations and InSAR Data
T2  - KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Izmir, which is one of the biggest cities of Turkey and has the extensive tectonic features of the Western Anatolia region, has been struck in recent years due to its high seismic activity. In particular, the south of Izmir is one of the regions that has high seismic activity in the city, which is constrained by major fault zones. The earthquake of magnitude of a Mw 6.9 occurred 8 km north of Samos Island at a depth of 16 km on 30.10.2020, at 11:51:24 UTC (14:51:24 Local Time (LT)). It occurred on a 40-kilometer-long north-dipping normal fault zone in the Mediterranean between Greece's Samos Island and Turkey's Kusadasi Bay. Following the mainschock, a tsunami with a height of more than 1 meter occurred at Sigacik Bay, south of Izmir, and on the north side of Samos Island. This article focuses on the investigation of the Samos earthquake by utilizing both GNSS data and InSAR images, and the obtained results are given in this paper. GNSS data were processed by using CSRS-PPP Software as static and kinematic modes. After processing the GNSS data, the maximum displacements were observed at CESME and IZMIR CORS-TR points located in the north of the fault. Horizontal movements of 12 cm and 6 cm towards the north were obtained at CESME and IZMIR points, respectively. However, the amount of horizontal movements was less at DIDIM and AYDIN CORS-TR locations, which are located to the south of the fault. In addition to GNSS data, ESA Sentinel-1 SAR data was used in the InSAR procedure, and the displacements were clarified using the unwrapped interferogram. The interferogram revealed a 10 cm uplift in the west of the Island of Samos and a 10 cm subsidence in the Izmir region, on the north side of the fault, based on the InSAR data. The most striking feature of this study is that the earthquake that occurred near the island of Samos was reported by Gansas' study that the 3 GNSS points (SAMO, SAMU, and 093A) on the island of Samos are moving in a south direction and the largest displacement is about 36 centimetres south. However, in our study, the north direction is more prominent as the direction of movement at IZMIR and CESME points. The movement at the DIDIM point supports his work. In other words, the Samos Fault affected the points located in the north and south differently.

TI  - The polarizing impact of numeracy, economic literacy, and science literacy on the perception of immigration
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Immigrants might be perceived as a threat to a country's jobs, security, and cultural identity. In this study, we aimed to test whether individuals with higher numerical, scientific, and economic literacy were more polarized in their perception of immigration, depending on their cultural worldview orientation. We measured these variables in a representative sample of citizens in a medium-sized city in northern Italy. We found evidence that numerical, scientific, and economic literacy polarize concerns about immigration aligning them to people's worldview orientations. Individuals with higher numerical, economic, and scientific literacy were less concerned about immigration if they held an egalitarian-communitarian worldview, while they were more concerned about immigration if they held a hierarchical-individualistic worldview. On the contrary, individuals with less numerical, economic, and scientific literacy did not show a polarized perception of immigration. Results reveal that citizens with higher knowledge and ability presented a more polarized perception of immigration. Conclusions highlight the central role of cultural worldviews over information theories in shaping concerns about immigration.

TI  - Communicating the High Susceptible Zone of COVID-19 and its Exposure to Population Number through a Web-GIS Dashboard for Indonesia Cases
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Medical Geographic Information System (Medical GIS) application during the COVID19 pandemic crisis has become influential in communicating disease surveillance for health practitioners and society. The Johns Hopkins University has extensively used a well-known WebGIS dashboard to track the COVID-19 cases since January 22 and illustrates the location and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Unfortunately, the dashboard particularly for Indonesian cases is only represented by one point (dot map) placed on the centroid of the Indonesian archipelago. Further research can fill the gap in downscaling the geographical location data of COVID-19 cases to the cities or even the village level in Indonesia and communicating the susceptible zoning to society. We uplift the point COVID-19 cases data to susceptible zoning gathered from official COVID-19 government websites, process it using Geographic Information System analysis, and communicate it to society through a Web-GIS dashboard. Five datasets, i.e., population data, administrative boundary, Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery, COVID-19 cases geographic location, transportation infrastructure, and crowded places location, are used to analyze the susceptible area. Due to different standard data sources from each province in Indonesia, we only present provinces in Java Island with complete COVID-19 cases data on villages-scale. The technical challenges and future improvement in developing the national dashboard of Web-GIS-based susceptibility dashboard are also discussed. The dashboard information would further add some essential information for society to explore their zone status in adapting to the "New Normal" using the SICOVID-19 dashboard from their computers or gadgets during the pandemic crisis.

TI  - Behavior of Iron Tetraphenylsulfonato Porphyrin Intercalated into LDH and LSH as Materials for Electrocatalytic Applications
T2  - ELECTROCATALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Organic-inorganic hybrid materials were prepared by intercalation of iron 5,10,15,20 tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin complex into layered double hydroxides (ZnCr-FeTSPP LDH) and layered simple hydroxides (Zn-FeTSPP LSH) by coprecipitation. They have been characterized by ancillary techniques to compare their structural characteristics, their morphology and their ability to form films on conductive substrates in view of preparing modified electrodes for CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2ERR). The electrochemical behavior of intercalated FeTSPP was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) showing the role of the nature and pH of aqueous electrolyte solutions on the Fe-III/II signal. Evaluation of the CO2ERR of ZnCr-FeTSPP modified electrode was investigated by CV and preparative scale CO2 electrolysis in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. Whereas FeTSPP in the same electrolyte solution exhibits 18% of CO2 conversion to CO, once intercalated into ZnCr-LDH, there is no CO formation, only H-2 (FY = 75%). Using the ZnCr-NO3 modified electrode, without porphyrin, the same FY of H-2 was obtained. The study illustrates the problematic and the complexity of an attractive approach for the development of innovative hybrid catalysts for heterogeneous CO2ERR.

TI  - Cropland expansion, intensification, and reduction in Mato Grosso state, Brazil, between the crop years 2000/01 to 2017/18
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing populations require increased food production through increasing yields and expanding land use. Thus, agricultural production has a dialectical relationship with natural resource con-servation. South America has been the recent site of both intensification and areal expansion of crop production. The presented study investigates the dynamics of land use and land cover (LULC) in Mato Grosso state at two-year intervals for an 18-year period consisting of the 2000/01 and 2017/18 crop years. We used a stratified sampling approach and visual interpretation of satellite image time series data to obtain estimates of LULC extent and dynamics, including area of cropland expansion, intensification, and reduction. Cropland dynamics exhibited an overall increase in both extent and intensification. The cropland use area in Mato Grosso increased from 38,324 km2 (+/- 5618 km2) in 2000/01 to 97,394 km2 (+/- 9938 km2) in 2017/2018. For the Cerrado tropical woodland biome portion of Mato Grosso, the expansion of cropland areas was related to soy and corn prices. For the humid tropical forest biome of Amazonia, soy production and deforestation were found to not be directly correlated. The intensification in Mato Grosso was increased from 8142 km2 (+/- 1.39%) in the period from 2008/09 to 2010/11, to 30,487 km2 (+/- 2.56%) in the period from 2010/11 to 2012/13. Overall dynamics reflect public and private conservation policies, soy market, climate and technology factors that spur or inhibit increased production of commodity crops. The end result reflects Brazil's increasing role as a global com-modity crop producer.

TI  - Transfer-learning-based cloud detection for Zhuhai-1 satellite hyperspectral imagery
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral satellite can simultaneously obtain spectral information in 32 spectral bands and effectively obtain accurate information on land features through integrated hyperspectral observations of the atmosphere and land, while the presence of clouds can contaminate remote sensing images. To improve the utilization rate of hyperspectral images, this study investigates the cloud detection method for hyperspectral satellite data based on the transfer learning technique, which can obtain a model with high generalization capability with a small training sample size. In this study, for the acquired Level-1B products, the top-of-atmosphere reflectance data of each band are obtained by using the calibration coefficients and spectral response functions of the product packages. Meanwhile, to eliminate the data redundancy between hyperspectral bands, the data are downscaled using the principal component transformation method, and the top three principal components are extracted as the sample input data for model training. Then, the pretrained VGG16 and ResNet50 weight files are used as the backbone network of the encoder, and the model is updated and trained again using Orbita hyperspectral satellite (OHS) sample data to fine-tune the feature extraction parameters. Finally, the cloud detection model is obtained. To verify the accuracy of the method, the multi-view OHS images are visually interpreted, and the cloud pixels are sketched out as the baseline data. The experimental results show that the overall accuracy of the cloud detection model based on the Resnet50 backbone network can reach 91%, which can accurately distinguish clouds from clear sky and achieve high-accuracy cloud detection in hyperspectral remote sensing images.

TI  - Spatial downscaling of surface ozone concentration calculation from remotely sensed data based on mutual information
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate near surface ozone concentration calculation with high spatial resolution data is very important to solve the problem of serious ozone pollution and health impact assessment. However, the existing remotely sensed ozone products cannot meet the requirements of high spatial resolution monitoring. In this study, surface O-3 concentration (at 30 km spatial resolution) was extracted from the daily TROPOMI O-3 profile products. Meanwhile, this study improved the downscaling algorithm based on the mutual information and applied it to the mapping of surface O-3 concentration in China. Combined with the surface O-3 concentration data (with 5 km spatial resolution) obtained by using the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithm and AOD data (at 1 km resolution) from MODIS, the downscaling of TROPOMI ground O-3 concentration data from 30 km to 1 km has been achieved in this study. The downscaled ground O-3 concentration data were subsequently validated using an independent ground O-3 concentration dataset. The main conclusion of this study is that the mutual information entropy between the bottom layer data of the TROPOMI ozone profile (at 30 km resolution), LightGBM surface O-3 concentration data (at 5 km resolution), and MCD19A2 AOD data (at 1 km resolution) can accurately reduce the spatial resolution of ozone concentration in the ground layer. The downscaling procedure not only resulted in increase of the spatial resolution over the whole area but also significant improvements in precision with coefficient of determination (R (2)) increased from 0.733 to 0.823, mean biased error decreased from 7.905 mu g/m(3) to 3.887 mu g/m(3), and root-mean-square error decreased from 14.395 mu g/m(3) to 8.920 mu g/m(3) for ground O-3 concentration.

TI  - Long-term survival after sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection in pN0 breast cancer patients: a population-based study
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Findings from randomized clinical trials have shown that survival in patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN)-negative breast cancer is noninferior with SLN biopsy (SLNB) alone versus further axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). However, the long-term outcome of these two surgical approaches in pN0 breast cancer patients in real-world setting remains uncertain. Methods We included patients diagnosed with pathologically staged T1-2N0M0 breast cancer between 2000 and 2015 in surveillance, epidemiology, and end results 18-registry database. Patients were considered to have undergone SLNB alone if they had <= 5 examined lymph nodes (ELNs), and ALND if they had >= 10 ELNs. The outcomes included overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival. Propensity score analyses by weighting and matching and multivariable Cox regression analysis were performed to minimize treatment selection bias. Results We included 309,430 patients (253,501 SLNB and 55,929 ALND). In the weighted cohort, ALND was associated with significantly lower OS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.16) and BCSS (HR 1.16; 95% CI 1.10-1.22) compared with SLNB alone. Both the propensity score-matching model and multivariable Cox model demonstrated a survival benefit for SLNB when compared with ALND. Subgroup analyses for key variables did not change these findings. Conclusion We found statistically significant differences in OS and BCSS between SLNB and ALND, though the magnitude of these differences was small. Our findings further support that SLNB alone should be the standard of care for patients who do not have metastatic lymph nodes identified during breast cancer surgery.

TI  - Ultrasound contrast-enhanced patterns of sentinel lymph nodes: predictive value for nodal status and metastatic burden in early breast cancer
T2  - QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In the post-Z0011 era, sentinel lymph node (SLN) status and metastatic burden determine whether axillary management entails conservative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or radical axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in breast cancer patients. However, SLN status and metastatic burden cannot be evaluated preoperatively in clinical practice. This study explored the predictive value of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) patterns of SLN to assess the nodal status and metastatic burden in early breast cancer patients.Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 88 consecutive patients who were diagnosed with clinical T1-2N0 breast cancer between December 2020 and November 2021 at the Lanzhou University Second Hospital and scheduled for SLNB. Preoperative CEUS was performed to confirm the location and enhancement pattern of the SLN, and the conventional ultrasonic characteristics of the primary breast lesions and SLN were recorded. Intraoperative localized SLN and postoperative pathological results were used as the gold standard for comparison with preoperative ultrasound findings.Results: CEUS successfully identified at least 1 SLN in 88 patients, with a total of 118 SLNs identified in the entire cohort. Univariate analysis showed that lesion size, blood flow grade, SLN longitudinal diameter, cortical thickness, and enhancement pattern were significant predictive features of SLN metastasis. Further multiple regression analysis indicated that the enhancement pattern of the SLN was an independent risk factor for SLN metastasis, with a sensitivity and a specificity of 84.2% (32/38) and 80.0% (40/50), respectively. Meanwhile, the SLN enhancement pattern could predict the lymph node metastasis burden (P<0.001). In patients presenting with a type I (homogeneous enhancement) or type II (heterogeneous enhancement) SLN, 91.5% (65/71) had <= 2 positive SLNs, whereas in patients with a type III (no enhancement) SLN, 70.6% (12/17) had >2 metastatic nodes.Conclusions: The contrast-enhanced pattern of the SLN is an independent risk factor for SLN status. Patients presenting with a type I or type II SLN enhanced pattern are unlikely to have high-burden metastases detected at their final surgical treatment and omission of ALND may be appropriate.

TI  - Remote sensing of land change: A multifaceted perspective
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The discipline of land change science has been evolving rapidly in the past decades. Remote sensing played a major role in one of the essential components of land change science, which includes observation, monitoring, and characterization of land change. In this paper, we proposed a new framework of the multifaceted view of land change through the lens of remote sensing and recommended five facets of land change including change location, time, target, metric, and agent. We also evaluated the impacts of spatial, spectral, temporal, angular, and data-integration domains of the remotely sensed data on observing, monitoring, and characterization of different facets of land change, as well as discussed some of the current land change products. We recommend clarifying the specific land change facet being studied in remote sensing of land change, reporting multiple or all facets of land change in remote sensing products, shifting the focus from land cover change to specific change metric and agent, integrating social science data and multi-sensor datasets for a deeper and fuller understanding of land change, and recognizing limitations and weaknesses of remote sensing in land change studies.

TI  - Is a History of Optimal Staging by Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in the Era Prior to Adjuvant Therapy Associated with Improved Outcome Once Melanoma Patients have Progressed to Advanced Disease?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is important for staging in patients with primary cutaneous melanoma. Did having previously undergone SLNB also affect outcomes in patients once they have progressed to metastatic melanoma in the era prior to adjuvant therapy? Methods Data were retrieved from the Dutch Melanoma Treatment Registry, a prospectively collected, nationwide database of patients with unresectable stage IIIC or IV (advanced) melanoma between 2012 and 2018. Melanoma-specific survival (MSS) was compared between patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma, previously treated with a wide local excision (WLE) or WLE combined with SLNB as initial treatment of their primary tumor. Cox regression analyses were used to analyze the influence of different variables on MSS. Results In total, 2581 patients were included, of whom 1412 were treated with a WLE of the primary tumor alone and 1169 in whom this was combined with SLNB. At a median follow-up of 44 months from diagnosis of advanced melanoma, MSS was significantly longer in patients who had previously undergone SLNB {median 23 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 19-29) vs. 18 months (95% CI 15-20) for patients treated with WLE alone; p = 0.002}. However, multivariate Cox regression did not identify SLNB as an independent favorable prognostic factor for MSS after diagnosis of advanced melanoma. Conclusion Prior to the availability of adjuvant systemic therapy, once patients have unresectable stage IIIC or IV (advanced) melanoma, there was no difference in disease outcome for patients who were or were not previously staged with SLNB.

TI  - Studying the implementation of Zero Suicide in a large health system: Challenges, adaptations, and lessons learned
T2  - CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Suicide remains the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. Many patients presenting to healthcare settings with suicide risk are not identified and their risk mitigated during routine care. Our aim is to describe the planned methodology for studying the implementation of the Zero Suicide framework, a systemsbased model designed to improve suicide risk detection and treatment, within a large healthcare system.Methods: We planned to use a stepped wedge design to roll-out the Zero Suicide framework over 4 years with a total of 39 clinical units, spanning emergency department, inpatient, and outpatient settings, involving similar to 310,000 patients. We used Lean, a widely adopted a continuous quality improvement (CQI) model, to implement improvements using a centralize "hub" working with smaller "spoke" teams comprising CQI personnel, unit managers, and frontline staff.Results: Over the course of the study, five major disruptions impacted our research methods, including a change in The Joint Commission's safety standards for suicide risk mitigation yielding massive system-wide changes and the COVID-19 pandemic. What had been an ambitious program at onset became increasingly challenging because of the disruptions, requiring significant adaptations to our implementation approach and our study methods.Conclusions: Real-life obstacles interfered markedly with our plans. While we were ultimately successful in implementing Zero Suicide, these obstacles led to adaptations to our approach and timeline and required substantial changes in our study methodology. Future studies of quality improvement efforts that cut across multiple units and settings within a given health system should avoid using a stepped-wedge design with randomization at the unit level if there is the potential for sentinel, system-wide events.

TI  - Seasonal land-ice-flow variability in the Antarctic Peninsula
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent satellite-remote sensing studies have documented the multi-decadal acceleration of the Antarctic Ice Sheet in response to rapid rates of ice-sheet retreat and thinning Unlike the Greenland Ice Sheet, where historical, high-temporal-resolution satellite and in situ observations have revealed distinct changes in land-ice flow within intra-annual timescales, observations of similar seasonal signals are limited in Antarctica. Here, we use high-spatial- and high-temporal-resolution Copernicus SentineL-1A/B synthetic aperture radar observations acquired between 2014 and 2020 to provide the first evidence for seasonal flow variability of the land ice feeding George VI Ice Shelf (GVIIS), Antarctic Peninsula. Our observations reveal a distinct austral summertime (December-February) speed-up of similar to 0.06 +/- 0.005 m d(-1) (similar to 22 +/- 1.8 m yr(-1)) at, and immediately inland of, the grounding line of the glaciers nourishing the ice shelf, which constitutes a mean acceleration of similar to 15 % relative to baseline (time-series-averaged) rates of flow. These findings are corroborated by independent, optically derived velocity observations obtained from Landsat 8 imagery. Both surface and oceanic forcing mechanisms are outlined as potential controls on this seasonality. Ultimately, our findings imply that similar surface and/or ocean forcing mechanisms may be driving seasonal accelerations at the grounding lines of other vulnerable outlet glaciers around Antarctica. Assessing the degree of seasonal ice-flow variability at such locations is important for quantifying accurately Antarctica's future contribution to global sea-level rise.

AB  - Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence-guided surgery is a modality of intra-operative navigation that might support the surgeon with enhanced visualization of anatomical structures in real time. Over the last years, it has emerged as one of the most promising and rapidly developing technical innovations in surgery. The most popular current clinical applications include fluorescence cholangiography, bowel anastomotic perfusion assessment, fluorescence-guided lymphography for sentinel lymph-node identification and guided lymphadenectomy and the possible use in oncological surgery for the identification and localization of tumors and the diagnosis and treatment of peritoneal carcinosis. This paper provides an overview of the multiple fields of applications of ICG fluorescence-guided surgery in visceral and oncological surgery, discussing indications summarizing most recent and significative available literature and giving technical notes of use.

TI  - A comparative study on culture-specific and cross-cultural aspects of intercultural relations in Hungary, Serbia, Czech Republic, and Germany
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability, will, and belief that it is possible to deal effectively with members of other cultural/ethnic groups are still gaining importance all over the world. However, the majority of studies on intercultural relations focus on Western Europe and the USA, applying constructs and theories that replicate a western-centered worldview. As a consequence, it is unclear whether established measures for intergroup attitudes and intercultural competence may be applied in Eastern European countries and to what extent they display comparable ideas, thoughts, and feelings. The current study thus explores cross-cultural commonalities and differences in established measures of ethnic identity, prejudice, acculturation strategies, intercultural intelligence, and multicultural personality. Therefore, we compare the scale structure, difficulty, and sensitivity in samples from Germany and the Eastern European countries Hungary, Serbia, and the Czech Republic (etic-perspective), as well as the culture-specific conceptions of said concepts (emic-perspective). Results show that the investigated scales do not work comparably across German and Eastern European samples. Differences might be rooted in variations of underlying thinking patterns and connotations of single expressions. Those variations are likely to be related to the constant individual societal and historical developments of cultures, shaping the way individuals think and talk about cultural diversity. Future studies are encouraged to consider culture-specific and generalizable aspects of constructs when conducting cross-cultural research on intercultural relations.

TI  - Evaluation of exhaust air dust polymerase chain reaction as a supplement method for soiled bedding sentinel monitoring in specific pathogen free mouse facility using two different individually ventilated cage racks
T2  - LABORATORY ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Health monitoring is essential for ensuring animal health and reliable research results. Each animal facility should establish adequate health monitoring methods, and microbiological quality control should be implemented through regular health surveillance. Recently, specific pathogen free (SPF) mice have been housed in individually ventilated cage (IVC) racks in the majority of mouse facilities globally, and health monitoring is implemented using a soiled bedding sentinel (SBS). Even though SBS monitoring is a standard method, it has a limitation in that some pathogens are not sufficiently transmitted to the sentinel housed in the IVC. The exhaust air dust polymerase chain reaction (EAD PCR) method has been reported to be a reliable complementary method to SBS monitoring based on research findings. In Korea, health monitoring programs using EAD PCR have not yet been applied to laboratory animal facilities. The microbiological status of mouse colonies housed in the two IVC racks was compared using SBS and EAD PCR monitoring in our SPF mouse facility. Except for Helicobacter spp. and Staphylococcus aureus, the detection of 16 pathogens did not differ between the two methods. In the detection of Helicobacter spp., EAD PCR was found to be more sensitive than SBS. Helicobacter spp. were not found by SBS, whereas four S. aureus positive samples were detected by either SBS or EAD PCR test. According to our findings, EAD PCR can be used as a supplement to SBS monitoring. Moreover, EAD PCR can reduce the number of animals used, making it a 3R (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement)-consistent method.

TI  - A Scalable Partitioned Approach to Model Massive Nonstationary Non-Gaussian Spatial Datasets
T2  - TECHNOMETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nonstationary non-Gaussian spatial data are common in many disciplines, including climate science, ecology, epidemiology, and social sciences. Examples include count data on disease incidence and binary satellite data on cloud mask (cloud/no-cloud). Modeling such datasets as stationary spatial processes can be unrealistic since they are collected over large heterogeneous domains (i.e., spatial behavior differs across subregions). Although several approaches have been developed for nonstationary spatial models, these have focused primarily on Gaussian responses. In addition, fitting nonstationary models for large non-Gaussian datasets is computationally prohibitive. To address these challenges, we propose a scalable algorithm for modeling such data by leveraging parallel computing in modern high-performance computing systems. We partition the spatial domain into disjoint subregions and fit locally nonstationary models using a carefully curated set of spatial basis functions. Then, we combine the local processes using a novel neighbor-based weighting scheme. Our approach scales well to massive datasets (e.g., 2.7 million samples) and can be implemented in nimble, a popular software environment for Bayesian hierarchical modeling. We demonstrate our method to simulated examples and two massive real-world datasets acquired through remote sensing.

TI  - The role of secondary full lymphadenectomy for patients with early-stage endometrial cancer and isolated tumor cells detected on sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is a surgical technique with high accuracy in detecting metastases while limiting morbidity associated with full lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer. Recent retrospective data suggests that recurrence risk is low for patients with isolated tumor cells (ITCs). The objective of this study was to describe the pathologic findings, postoperative complications, and outcomes of endometrial cancer patients with ITCs who subsequently underwent a second surgical procedure, full lymph node dissection (LND) following initial staging surgery.All patients with clinically early stage endometrial cancer who underwent planned minimally invasive surgical staging with SLN biopsy demonstrating ITCs at a single institution from 1/1/2017 to 12/31/2020 were identified retrospectively.Six patients with endometrial cancer with ITC who subsequently underwent secondary full LND were iden-tified. Half of patients experienced postoperative complications within 30 days after LND, including persistent thigh numbness, a urinary tract infection, and a presyncopal episode. No patients had a change in stage as a result of subsequent full LND. One patient received no adjuvant therapy, while 83.3 % (5/6) received vaginal brachytherapy. One patient experienced distal recurrence six months after completing brachytherapy, while five remain without evidence of disease on most recent follow-up.In patients who underwent completion lymphadenectomy for ITCs identified during initial surgical staging for endometrial cancer, no additional lymph node metastatic disease was identified. This study supports current data there is a limited role for additional lymph node assessment in patients with early stage endometrial cancer with ITCs identified on SLN biopsy.

TI  - Evaluation of earth observation datasets for LST trends over India and its implication in global warming
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is crucial in surface energy balance, urban climatology, intensifying global change, ecological and environmental concerns. The present study examined the LST trends and spatio-temporal variation over India from 2002 to 2022. This includes comparison of LST for the summer and winter seasons over two decades. Secondly, the present study examined the LULC category wise LST variability during the day and night-time using MODIS (The Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived products. This study explored the feasibility of cloud computing for big data analysis for LST distribution in seven landuse categories over India, providing a conceptual response to global warming. Results showed the existence of spatial LST variation due to changes in land-use patterns and MODIS derived vegetation indices-NDVI. Daytime LST for the summer and winter seasons of 2002 was found to be 45.17 degrees C and 39.13 degrees C, respectively. Outcomes illustrate declining trends in range (LSTmin-LSTmax)for winter seasons, initially, it was observed as 56.29 degrees C for 2002 while later on it was observed to be 20.21 degrees C and 20.87 degrees C for 2021 and 2022 respectively. The LSTmin (summer) has shown an increasing trend towards upper LST values, from-3.01 degrees C to 12.21 degrees C from 2002 TO 2022. LSTmin_winter has shown a rising trend towards the upper LST values from-17.16 degrees C to 9.15 degrees C in 2022. The maximum LST for the DRs was observed to be 61.56 degrees C, followed by UR as 56.24 degrees C. The findings demonstrate that daytime LSTmin and LSTmax are found to be 19.50 degrees C to 56.24 degrees C for UR, 29.5 degrees C to 61.56 degrees C for DR, 19.24 degrees C to 54.08 degrees C for SAR,-21.1 degrees C to 0.05 degrees C for SCR and 15 degrees C to 32.18 degrees C for FHR. NDVI-LST (daytime, nighttime and diurnal tem-perature range) feature space generates an obtuse triangle and depicts a negative correlation of vegetation for a few LULC categories. The outcomes indicated that desert and snow regions have highest LSTmax followed by urban and semiarid regions during daytime. During the nighttime, desert and urban regions have the highest temperature followed by semi-arid and forest regions. The outcomes support the efficacy of earth observation datasets and help to facilitate a better understanding of LULC and its impact on regional climate.

TI  - Automatic Monitoring System for Seed Germination Test Based on Deep Learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Germination test is an irreplaceable step in seed selection and breeding. The current traditional germination test method must rely on experienced professional technicians to repeatedly classify and count the germination status of seeds and count the germination rate at different moments during the whole test process (usually takes 2 to 10 days). Currently, only the German seed germination detection system (Germination Scanalyzer) can solve this problem, but it is so expensive that it has not been practically promoted. In order to improve breeding efficiency, an automatic monitoring system for seed germination tests based on deep learning was designed. It includes a modified germination thermostat, connected with a three-dimensional movable camera bin with built-in camera; a multifunctional software system capable of online, offline, and sentinel mode monitoring; a dense distributed small target detection algorithm (DDST-CenterNet) for seed germination monitoring systems. The system test results show that the seed germination test automatic monitoring system is low cost, does not depend on the seed background, light, camera model, and other usage environments, and has high scalability. The DDST-CenterNet algorithm proposed in this paper can still maintain high accuracy and good stability in the process of seed target detection and classification as the number and density of seeds increase, which is suitable for a special application scenario of seed germination test. In addition, the algorithm has high computational efficiency and can give detection results at a frame rate of not less than 10fps, which can be used in practical applications.

TI  - Association of PM<sub>2.5</sub> With blood lipids and dyslipidaemia in a rural population of north-western china
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Evidence regarding the association between particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) and blood lipid levels is insufficient in the rural areas of developing countries. Few studies have estimated the role of PM2.5 in blood lipid levels. We investigated the relationship between long-term exposure to PM2.5, blood lipids, and dyslipidaemia in rural Chinese adults. Methods: Baseline data of 15,802 participants (aged 35-74 years) in the China Northwest Cohort-Ningxia Project were used in this study. PM2.5 levels were assessed using satellite remote sensing data in accordance with each participant's home address. Personally exposed PM2.5 was defined as the 3-year mean concentration prior to the baseline survey. Logistic and linear models were utilised to quantify the associations of PM2.5 with the prevalence of dyslipidaemia and with blood lipids, including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Results: The 3-year mean level of PM2.5 was 35.36 +/- 4.21 mu g/m(3). Every 1-mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 was related to an increase of 0.04% (95% CI: -0.44-0.53%) in TG and decreases of 0.37% (95% CI: 0.16-0.90%) in TC, 5.76% (95% CI: 5.32-6.21%) in LDL-C, and 0.89% (95% CI: 0.72-1.05%) in HDL-C. Every 1-mu g/m(3) increment in PM2.5 was related with a 4% (95% CI:3-5%) and 18% (95% CI:16-20%) higher risk of dyslipidaemia and hypoalphalipoproteinemia, respectively, and a decrease of 11% (95% CI:10-13%) in hyperbetalipoproteinemia. Sex, age, and BMI were adjusted for the relationships between PM2.5, blood lipids, and dyslipidaemia. Conclusion: Greater PM2.5 exposure was related to harmful changes in blood lipids and dyslipidaemia. Male, elderly, and overweight individuals may be more vulnerable to the negative effects of PM2.5.

TI  - A new drought index and its application based on geographically weighted regression (GWR) model and multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is the most widespread natural disaster in the world. How to monitor regional drought scientifically and accurately has become a hot topic for many scholars. In this paper, Geographically Integrated Dryness Index (GIDI) was integrated from an assortment source including Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) (as the dependent variable) based on geographically weighted regression method. Besides, the comprehensive drought situation and changing trends in China from 2001 to 2019 were also examined. The results showed that (1) GIDI has excellent performance in monitoring medium- and long-term droughts and the monitoring results shows 2003, 2016, and 2019 were relatively wet years, while 2007, 2009, and 2011 were major drought years, and spring and March were the most frequent droughts season and month, respectively, and (2) except for the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River and Northeastern China, which have a tendency to become wet, other places have a tendency to fluctuating dry. This study took advantage of simple and efficient methods to integrate existing indices to obtain a new index for monitoring a wider range of droughts, taking into account the physical mechanism of drought formation and the time scale of drought development, so it can scientifically evaluate the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of drought and changes.

TI  - Antecedent climatic conditions spanning several years influence multiple land-surface phenology events in semi-arid environments
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological processes are complex, often exhibiting non-linear, interactive, or hierarchical relationships. Furthermore, models identifying drivers of phenology are constrained by uncertainty regarding predictors, interactions across scales, and legacy impacts of prior climate conditions. Nonetheless, measuring and modeling ecosystem processes such as phenology remains critical for management of ecological systems and the social systems they support. We used random forest models to assess which combination of climate, location, edaphic, vegetation composition, and disturbance variables best predict several phenological responses in three dominant land cover types in the U.S. Northwestern Great Plains (NWP). We derived phenological measures from the 25-year series of AVHRR satellite data and characterized climatic predictors (i.e., multiple moisture and/or temperature based variables) over seasonal and annual timeframes within the current year and up to 4 years prior. We found that antecedent conditions, from seasons to years before the current, were strongly associated with phenological measures, apparently mediating the responses of communities to current-year conditions. For example, at least one measure of antecedent-moisture availability [precipitation or vapor pressure deficit (VPD)] over multiple years was a key predictor of all productivity measures. Variables including longer-term lags or prior year sums, such as multi-year-cumulative moisture conditions of maximum VPD, were top predictors for start of season. Productivity measures were also associated with contextual variables such as soil characteristics and vegetation composition. Phenology is a key process that profoundly affects organism-environment relationships, spatio-temporal patterns in ecosystem structure and function, and other ecosystem dynamics. Phenology, however, is complex, and is mediated by lagged effects, interactions, and a diversity of potential drivers; nonetheless, the incorporation of antecedent conditions and contextual variables can improve models of phenology.

Here, we showcase recent applications, identify best practices, discuss commonly invoked identifying assumptions and show how these can be tested. We discuss basic empirical issues and more advanced topics, including how to exploit the availability of panel data, models to explain heterogeneous treatment effects and extrapolation of local estimates. Moreover, we show how agricultural economists can leverage RDD in combination with remote sensing and environmental modelling. Finally, we highlight three areas of emerging opportunities and draw conclusions for research and policy.

TI  - Integrated Zeolite Based Carbon Paste Electrode for Sensitive Voltammetric Assay of Ticagrelor
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Herein, the construction and the electroanalytical applications of novel ticagrelor (TIC) voltammetric sensors were described. Integration of the working carbon paste electrodes with zeolite nanostructures showed a proper electrocatalytic activity toward oxidation of the TIC molecule. At the optimum measuring conditions, TIC showed an irreversible oxidation peak at 0.954 V with an assumed diffusion-reaction mechanism. Based on the electrochemical behavior at different pH and the scan rate values, the electrode reaction takes place through oxidation of the N Enamine of the ticagrelor moiety with the participation of one electron and one proton in agreement with the molecular orbital calculations. Calibration curves showed improved linearity (r = 0.9998) within the TIC concentration ranging from 8.8 to 1665 ng mL(-1) with LOD and LOQ values of 2.5 and 7.5 ng mL(-1), respectively. The introduced TIC voltammetric sensor exhibited improved performance with high measurement reproducibility and prolonged operational lifetime. The cited ZY/CPEs sensors were capable of simultaneous voltammetric determination of TIC in the existence of its degradation outcomes and expected interferents. The proposed voltammetric approach was suggested for the sensitive determination of ticagrelor in biological fluids and pharmaceutical samples with good recovery values in agreement with the spectrophotometric measurements.

T2  - SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The analysis of rainfall as an environmental factor that influences landscape dynamics is an important and ongoing topic of discussion. This discussion can be centred on the discovery of impacts caused by the increase or decrease in rainfall frequency and intensity. From this perspective, this study sought to analyse the rainfall variability in the Iguacu River basin, located in the State of Parana, southern Brazil. The main objective was focused on the temporal-spatial rainfall distribution in the study area and its interaction with landscape dynamics (different land uses). Precipitation data for the period 1988-2018 were obtained from the 'aguas Parana' Institute. To calculate the Concentration Index-CI values of the study area, data analysis was performed using the 'R' software with Climatol and Precindicon subroutines of the software, and analysis of Landsat 8 satellite images through ArcGIS. The results indicated that there was a well-defined spatial variability in the study area, as the CIs defined higher rainfall concentrations upstream from the river basin and lower rainfall concentrations downstream-implying that these processes may be strongly associated with land use.

TI  - REDD plus : The Opportunity for Sustainable Management in Zagros Forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+) projects aim to prevent deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions as a policy to combat climate changes. This article evaluates changes to the Zagros' Forest cover in 20 years and predicts the implications of implementing the REDD+ project in the next two decades. Using Landsat Forest cover maps and a logistic regression model the potential for forest cover transfer to non-forest regions was modeled to identify regions at risk of deforestation. A Markov chain was implemented to predict the changes. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) was employed for validation, and the Voluntary Carbon Standard (VCS) was utilized to model the REDD+ project baseline to predict the forest cover changes. The findings indicate, 37,809 hectares of forest cover were lost in the past 20 years and with this trend, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions will increase. However, implementing the REDD+ project can prevent the release of 1,714,534.13 tCO2e. Therefore, this deteriorating forest possesses the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by preventing deforestation, identifying deforestation-prone areas and implementing the REDD+ project utilizing the methodology presented. Climate change mitigation, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity protection are just a few of the benefits of REDD+ projects that can aid sustainable forest management

TI  - Characterization and corroboration of safety signals identified from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System, 2008-19: cross sectional study
T2  - BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To characterize potential drug safety signals identified from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), from 2008 to 2019, to determine how often these signals resulted in regulatory action by the FDA and whether these actions were corroborated by published research findings or public assessments by the Sentinel Initiative.Design Cross sectional study.Setting USA.Population Safety signals identified from the FAERS and publicly reported by the FDA between 2008 and 2019; and review of the relevant literature published before and after safety signals were reported in 2014-15. Literature searches were performed in November 2019, Sentinel Initiative assessments were searched in December 2021, and data analysis was finalized in December 2021.Main outcome measures Safety signals and resulting regulatory actions; number and characteristics of published studies, including corroboration of regulatory action as evidenced by significant associations (or no associations) between the drug related to the signal and the adverse event.Results From 2008 to 2019, 603 potential safety signals identified from the FAERS were reported by the FDA (median 48 annually, interquartile range 41-61), of which 413 (68.5%) were resolved as of December 2021 (372 of 399 (93.2%) signals >= 3 years old were resolved). Among the resolved safety signals, 91 (22.0%) led to no regulatory action and 322 (78.0%) resulted in regulatory action, including 319 (77.2%) changes to drug labeling and 59 (14.3%) drug safety communications or other public communications from the FDA. For a subset of 82 potential safety signals reported in 2014-15, a literature search identified 1712 relevant publications; 1201 (70.2%) were case reports or case series. Among these 82 safety signals, 76 (92.7%) were resolved, of which relevant published research was identified for 57 (75.0%) signals and relevant Sentinel Initiative assessments for four (5.3%) signals. Regulatory actions by the FDA were corroborated by at least one relevant published research study for 17 of the 57 (29.8%) resolved safety signals; none of the relevant Sentinel Initiative assessments corroborated FDA regulatory action.Conclusions Most potential safety signals identified from the FAERS led to regulatory action by the FDA. Only a third of regulatory actions were corroborated by published research, however, and none by public assessments from the Sentinel Initiative. These findings suggest that either the FDA is taking regulatory actions based on evidence not made publicly available or more comprehensive safety evaluations might be needed when potential safety signals are identified.

TI  - Towards Precise Drone-based Measurement of Elevation Change in Permafrost Terrain Experiencing Thaw and Thermokarst
T2  - DRONE SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Measuring ground elevation changes plays a crucial role in several environmental applications. For instance, permafrost soils undergo seasonal active layer freezing and thawing that causes cyclic elevation changes. Permafrost thaw can result in unidirectional ground subsidence, which may be gradual and uniform, or rapid and irregular in the case of thermokarst landforms such as slumps and degrading ice-wedges. Photogrammetric drone surveys have effectively characterized large (> 0.1 m) ground elevation changes resulting from thermokarst, yet many permafrost processes of interest lead to more subtle elevation changes. In this study, we assessed various drone-based surveying strategies for their precision to measure smaller (< 0.1 m) ground elevation changes to better characterize permafrost-driven surface dynamics. The strategies were compared by examining the short-term reproducibility of modeled elevation for 76 bare ground targets, derived from six repeat drone surveys captured under variable illumination. We found that the Phantom 4 RTK drone using direct georeferencing, combined with one fixed GCP, could reproduce elevations with a mean absolute deviation of 0.6 cm, suggesting a minimum level of change detection of 1.4 cm at 95% confidence. Drone-based methods for measuring permafrost elevation changes should be complementary to in situ and satellite-based (e.g. differential interferometric SAR) approaches.

TI  - Responses of sustainable development indicators to human activities and climate change in ecologically fragile areas of impoverished counties in China Case study of the Zijin Mountain area of Linxian: A national-level poor county
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES FORUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on Landsat MSS/TM/OLI (1975-2018), MODIS NDVI (2000-2015), and DMSP/OLS (1992-2013) multitemporal remote sensing data, as well as annual average precipitation and temperature data from meteorological stations (1980-2018) and SRTM DEM data, this study extracted information on climate change, human activity, and eco-environmental factors in the Zijin Mountain (ZJM) area of Shanxi Province, and then analyzed the spatiotemporal changes in ecological structure, landscape structure, and climate response. The results revealed that in the ZJM area some sustainable development indicators associated with human activity, ecology, climate, and landscape geography have changed. Specifically, over the 44-year period from 1975 to 2018, the urban and rural construction land area increased by 4.29 times; in the 22-year period from 1992 to 2013, the regional light index has increased by 26.9 times; in the past 32 years, that is, from 1987 to 2018, the average vegetation index of the entire basin increased by about 54.7%, the vegetation cover exhibited a gradual positive trend, and the land use types in the ZJM area were mainly converted from bare land to grassland or forest. Compared with 1987, the area of bare land decreased 32.5% by 2018, whereas the forest and grassland areas increased by 85.7% and 40.7%, respectively. In addition, over the 44-year period from 1975 to 2018, the road density increased by 8.57 times. The area affected by human activities, comprised roads, urban and rural construction land, and their buffer areas, accounted for 64.87% of the total study area. As a result, the fragmentation index of landscape patches has increased by 6.81 times since 1987. We conclude that in the ZJM area, the ecosystem type has transformed from an indigenous mountainous grassland to mountainous arid agriculture, and from an isolated habitat to a fragmented habitat.

TI  - The cultural sustainability in English as foreign language textbooks: Investigating the cultural representations in English language textbooks in China for senior middle school students
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the age of globalization, studies of cultural representations in foreign language textbooks take account of cultural sustainability. This article reports on a case study of cultural representations in two English language textbook series that are widely used in senior high schools in China. The study investigated whether the cultural representations in these textbooks contribute to the development of local cultural sustainability. Content analysis was employed to examine the texts used in these textbooks, with references to the synergy of the theoretical frameworks of cultural sustainability and world Englishes. The study results indicate that there is an imbalanced cultural representation with respect to the categories of international cultures and national culture in these textbooks. The results point to the cultures of the inner circle countries (BANA: Britain, Australasia, and North America) being predominant, while the representation of Chinese culture has a low profile. As these textbooks are an important learning and teaching resource in China, they have the potential to play a significant role in influencing learners' worldviews as they develop their understanding of different cultures. The imbalanced presentation of culture may in turn lead to a biased worldview where learners, rather appreciating cultural diversity, may instead discriminate against certain cultures. The implications for redressing the imbalance in cultural representation and cultural sustainability are discussed.

TI  - Digital mapping of soil pH and carbonates at the European scale using environmental variables and machine learning
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil pH and carbonates (CaCO3) are important indicators of soil chemistry and fertility, and the prediction of their spa-tial distribution is critical for the agronomic and environmental management. Digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques are widely accepted for the geospatial analysis of the soil properties. They are rapid and cost-efficient approaches that can provide quantitative prediction. However, the digital mapping of soil pH and CaCO3 are not well studied, es-pecially at a continental scale. In this research, we mapped the soil pH and CaCO3 at the European scale using multi -source environmental variables and machine learning approaches. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, terrain attributes, and climatic variables were considered. Meanwhile, nine machine learning algo-rithms, namely, three linear and six nonlinear models, were used for the spatial prediction of soil pH and CaCO3. The land use and cover area frame statistical survey (LUCAS) 2015 topsoil dataset provided by the European Soil Data Centre was utilised. The performances of different models were compared and analysed in terms of coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). Specifically, nonlinear machine learning models outperformed the linear ones, and extremely randomized trees (ERT) gave the most satisfactory result for soil pH (R2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.75, and RPD = 1.84) and CaCO3 (R2 = 0.53, RMSE = 93.49 g/kg, and RPD = 1.46). The results revealed that MODIS products and climatic variables were important in predicting soil pH and CaCO3. More-over, spatial distribution of soil pH and CaCO3 in Europe were mapped at 250 m resolution, and the areas with high CaCO3 content always showed high soil pH value.

TI  - Comparison of infections with respiratory syncytial virus between children and adults: a multicenter surveillance from 2015 to 2019 in Beijing, China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) among the population of all age categories in Beijing, China. Outpatients and inpatients with ARTI were enrolled from 35 sentinel hospitals in Beijing between March 2015 and February 2019. They were interviewed and their medical records were collected using a standardized form. Their respiratory specimens were collected and tested for the nucleic acid of RSV. The RSV-positive specimens were further genotyped into RSV-A and RSV-B groups. A total of 29,923 cases were included in this study. RSV was detected in 623 (2%, 623/29923) patients, with 391 (62.8%) genotypd as RSV-A, 126 (20.2%) as RSV-B, and 106 (17.0%) untyped. The RSV epidemic season usually occurred between October and March covering approximately 90% of annual RSV infections. The RSV-infected children aged < 5 years accounted for 52.2% of the total RSV infections with cough and fever as the most common manifestations. The RSV-infected elderly adults aged >= 60 years have the second largest proportion (25.2%) with dyspnea and lymphocytopenia as the most common manifestations and showed an elevated rate of hospitalization, an increased rate of ICU admission, an extended length of hospital stay, and an elevated mortality compared to the RSV-infected children. The RSV infections aged >= 60 years old, as the second largest population of the total annual RSV infections, usually developed worse outcomes than children and should be taken seriously.

TI  - A Quantitative and Qualitative Assessment of Frozen Section Diagnosis Accuracy and Deferral Rate Across Organ Systems
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Monitoring of frozen section diagnostic performance provides an important quality improvement measure. Methods Surgical specimens involving a frozen section diagnosis over a 3-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Glass slides were reviewed on cases with discordance. Discordance and deferral rates were calculated. Results Of 3,675 frozen section diagnoses included, 96 (2.7%) were discordant with the final diagnosis. Additionally, 114 frozen section diagnoses (3.1%) were deferred. The organ-specific discordance rates were lowest in breast and genitourinary specimens and highest for pancreas, lymph node, and gynecologic specimens. Deferral rates were highest in musculoskeletal, breast, and hepatobiliary cases and lowest in thyroid, parathyroid, and neuropathology cases. Discordance was explained by block-sampling error (45%), specimen-sampling error (27%), or interpretation error (27%). Discordant frozen section diagnoses from gynecologic specimens were responsible for 81% of specimen-sampling errors; frozen section diagnoses of lymph nodes, head and neck, and pancreas were responsible for 54% of interpretation errors; 51% of block-sampling errors involved lymph node evaluation for metastatic carcinoma. Conclusions Careful gross evaluation and microscopic examination of multiple levels should minimize specimen-sampling error and block-sampling error, respectively. Periodic review of accuracy and deferral rates may help reduce errors and improve the overall performance of this essential procedure.

TI  - A spectral three-dimensional color space model of tree crown health
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Protecting the future of forests in the United States and other countries depends in part on our ability to monitor and map forest health conditions in a timely fashion to facilitate management of emerging threats and disturbances over a multitude of spatial scales. Remote sensing data and technologies have contributed to our ability to meet these needs, but existing methods relying on supervised classification are often limited to specific areas by the availability of imagery or training data, as well as model transferability. Scaling up and operationalizing these methods for general broadscale monitoring and mapping may be promoted by using simple models that are easily trained and projected across space and time with widely available imagery. Here, we describe a new model that classifies high resolution (similar to 1 m(2)) 3-band red, green, blue (RGB) imagery from a single point in time into one of four color classes corresponding to tree crown condition or health: green healthy crowns, red damaged or dying crowns, gray damaged or dead crowns, and shadowed crowns where the condition status is unknown. These Tree Crown Health (TCH) models trained on data from the United States (US) Department of Agriculture, National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), for all 48 States in the contiguous US and spanning years 2012 to 2019, exhibited high measures of model performance and transferability when evaluated using randomly withheld testing data (n = 122 NAIP state x year combinations; median overall accuracy 0.89-0.90; median Kappa 0.85-0.86). We present examples of how TCH models can detect and map individual tree mortality resulting from a variety of nationally significant native and invasive forest insects and diseases in the US. We conclude with discussion of opportunities and challenges for extending and implementing TCH models in support of broadscale monitoring and mapping of forest health.

TI  - Dynamics of tip vortex flow over three dimensional hydrofoils by LDV measurements
T2  - OCEAN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tip vortices are observed downstream of the flow past the three-dimensional hydrofoils used in propeller, wind and tidal turbines and they largely determine the forces exerted on such structures. In this study, we present the Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) measurements in the flow past three-dimensional hydrofoils namely NACA 4412, NACA 16020, NACA 66(2)415 inclined at an angle of 10 degrees with respect to the free-stream velocity, U infinity. The three-dimensional hydrofoils have a semi-span, s = 60 mm, chord lengths, c = 48 mm, 60 mm & 80 mm which correspond to three aspect ratios, perpendicular to = 2.5, 2.0 & 1.5, respectively, at the chord length based Reynolds number, Re ranging from Re = 1.92 x 105 - 6.39 x 105. LDV measurements were performed at several coordinate points in zy-plane perpendicular to the stream-wise, x direction, measuring the mean stream-wise, u(z, y) and mean velocity component along the z-axis, w(z, y) together with the root-mean square of their fluctuations in the plane located at a stream-wise distance, x/c = 1.0. The swirling strength of the tip vortices are qualitatively evident from the measurements of z- velocity component field, w(z, y) for all the hydrofoils, at various aspect ratios and Reynolds numbers. It is observed that the magnitude of normalized axial velocity deficit, (u(z, y) - U infinity)/U infinity and normalized turbulent kinetic energy, TKE(z, y) are dependent on the type of hydrofoil, their aspect ratio, perpendicular to and the Reynolds number, Re. TKE within the region of the wake and vortex contain about 99% of the peak magnitude of TKE observed in the x/c = 1.0 plane. The vortex center, vortex position and vortex radius are shown to be dependant on the hydrofoil shape, aspect ratio and Reynolds number.

TI  - Matching land surface phenology with the phenology of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in the Kruger National Park, South Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology plays an important role in the inter-annual variability of Net Ecosystem Ex-change (NEE). However, the relationship between vegetation phenology and NEE is still largely unknown in the southern African region. The relatively recent availability of Eddy-Covariance (EC) flux towers in the region, which allow for measurements of the interactions between the ter-restrial biosphere and the atmosphere, have expanded our understanding of Carbon Flux Phenol-ogy (CFP), but the towers' spatial coverage and representation is still limited. By contrast, satel-lite-based measurements of terrestrial environments provide repeat global spatial coverage that offers a complimentary approach to flux tower estimates of phenology and NEE. This study there-fore aimed to investigate the relationship between Land Surface Phenology (LSP), calculated from FAPAR (Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation) derived from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and from MISR (Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-radiometer), and CFP using 18 years of EC flux data at the Skukuza flux tower site, Kruger Na-tional Park, South Africa. Cross-correlation results showed that there is a moderate association between NEE and FAPAR from both sensors (MISR-HR, R2 = 0.54; MODIS, R2 = 0.53) where FAPAR leads NEE by 8-days. Specifically, only the start of carbon uptake (SOSNEE) has a strong correlation with FAPAR derived start of season (SOSFAPAR). In this instance, MISR-HR FAPAR out-performed MODIS at estimating the SOSNEE dates (i.e., R2 = 0.61 and R2 = 0.28, respectively) and overall showed the least difference to CFP (Mean signed difference similar to 7-12 days). The find-ings show that MISR-HR FAPAR can be successfully used to approximate the SOSNEE as well as NEE. In summary, this study presents insight into the relationship between LSP and CFP that con-tributes to our understanding of how LSP can be used to assist monitoring of carbon dynamics in African savannas. Further investigation into the complicated nature of the interactions between environmental variables (e.g. rainfall, soil moisture, temperature, etc.) that influence both vege-tation and carbon dynamics will provide important insight into the potential of upscaling NEE es-timates.

TI  - Supraglacial lake expansion, intensified lake drainage frequency, and first observation of coupled lake drainage, during 1985-2020 at Ryder Glacier, Northern Greenland
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Along the Greenland Ice Sheet margin, supraglacial lakes store and redistribute ice sheet surface run off, and comprise an important potential hydrological link between the ice surface and the base, with ramifications for subglacial drainage systems and ice flow. As a consequence of increasing global mean surface air temperatures, these lakes have been predicted to expand further inland and to affect larger areas of the ice sheet. However, as contemporary dynamics of such supraglacial lake expansion are not well studied, any assessment of their future implications remains afflicted with uncertainty. Here, recent changes in supraglacial lake distribution and expansion, and in their drainage behavior and frequency, are presented for Ryder Glacier, Northern Greenland, as concluded from a remote sensing based analysis. The 35-year time span covered in the analysis allows for the detection of trends in lake processes and ice velocity, which otherwise were found to exhibit large inter-annual variability. It also reveals the first occurrence of a coupled lake drainage event in 2002. By linking supraglacial lake expansion, drainage modes, and drainage frequency to the efficiency of the subglacial drainage system and ice flow on seasonal and decadal timescales, a contribution is made to better understand the complexity of coupled glacio-hydrological processes, and to help reduce uncertainties in predictions of future mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet.

TI  - Orchestration and consolidation in corporate sustainability reporting. The legacy of the Corporate Reporting Dialogue
T2  - ACCOUNTING AUDITING & ACCOUNTABILITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - The paper uses theoretical conceptions of power and orchestration to analyse the role of the Corporate Reporting Dialogue on the global standardisation of sustainability reporting.Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts an interpretive approach and draws on a qualitative dataset derived from interviews, documentary analysis and observation.Findings - The paper traces how the Corporate Reporting Dialogue was orchestrated by the International Integrated Reporting Council, with the objective of aligning sustainability reporting standards, but moved to become a vehicle for orchestrating standards consistent with the recommendations of the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosure. Collaboration between the Dialogue's five most active bodies forged the blueprint adopted by the International Sustainability Standards Board's vision of sustainability reporting that prioritised reporting only on those socio-ecological issues deemed to materially affect future enterprise value.Originality/value - The paper explicates the role of collaborative initiatives in the standardisation of sustainability reporting and shows how these initiatives act as vehicles to subtly undermine the GRI position (presented as one standardiser amongst many whose vision appears as an outlier, despite its position as the dominant sustainability reporting standardiser), and establish the prioritisation of a sustainability reporting worldview based on investor-oriented enterprise value creation. The case also draws attention to the specific orchestrators involved in establishing this prioritisation, and reveals the influence of philanthropic foundations. In doing so, it extends our understanding of legitimacy generation in standard-setting by showing how collaborative initiatives offer private standardisers another means to generate input legitimacy for what, in this case, represented a vision of reporting at odds with most sustainability reporting practice. Finally, the paper extends the sites of power to collaborative initiatives and details the mechanisms through which covert power is exercised but also masked where orchestrators use convening power, funding and membership choices to define the boundaries of discussion by influencing who participates, what is on the agenda and what activity is undertaken. Rather than viewing standardisation as a simple pursuit of conquest between individual standardisers, the paper considers how collaboration provides the opportunity for assimilation.

TI  - Solar photovoltaic program helps turn deserts green in China: Evidence from satellite monitoring
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar energy is considered one of the key solutions to the growing demand for energy and to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Thanks to the relatively low cost of land use for solar energy and high power generation potential, a large number of photovoltaic (PV) power stations have been established in desert areas around the world. Despite the contribution to easing the energy crisis and combating climate change, large-scale construction and operation of PV power stations can change the land cover and affect the environment. However, few studies have focused on these special land cover changes, especially vegetation cover changes, which hinders understanding the effects of the extensive development of solar energy. Here, we used Continuous Change Detection and Classification -Spectral Mixture Analysis (CCDC-SMA) based on Landsat images to monitor changes in vegetation abundance before and after the PV power stations deployment. To reduce the interference of PV shading on vegetation abundance estimation, we improved the vegetation (VG) fraction from SMA and developed the Photovoltaics-Adjusted Vegetation (PAVG) fraction for vegetation abundance measurements in PV power sta-tions. Results show that PV power stations in China's 12 biggest deserts expanded from 0 to 102.56 km2 from 2011 to 2018, mainly distributed in the central part of north China. The desert vegetation in the deployment area of PV power stations presented a significant greening trend. Compared to 2010, the greening area reached 30.80 km2, accounting for 30% of the total area of PV power stations. Overall, the large-scale deployment of PV power stations has promoted desert greening, primarily due to government-led Photovoltaic Desert Control Projects and favorable climatic change. This study shows the great benefits of PV power stations in combating desertification and improving people's welfare, which bring sustainable economic, ecological and social prosperity in sandy ecosystems.

TI  - A preliminary evaluation of FY-4A visible radiance data assimilation by the WRF (ARW v4.1.1)/DART (Manhattan release v9.8.0)-RTTOV (v12.3) system for a tropical storm case
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite visible radiance data that contain rich cloud and precipitation information are increasingly assimilated to improve the forecasts of numerical weather prediction models. This study evaluates the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART, Manhattan release v9.8.0), coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (ARW v4.1.1) and the Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV, v12.3) package, for assimilating the simulated visible imagery of the FY-4A geostationary satellite located over Asia in an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) framework. The OSSE was performed for the tropical storm Higos that occurred in 2020 and contains multi-layer mixed-phase cloud and precipitation processes. The advantages and limitations of DART for assimilating FY-4A visible imagery were evaluated. Both single-observation experiments and cycled data assimilation (DA) experiments were performed to study the impact of different filter algorithms available in DART, variables being cycled, observation outlier thresholds, observation errors, and observation thinning.The results show that assimilating visible radiance data significantly improves the analysis of the cloud water path (CWP) and cloud coverage (CFC) from first-guess forecasts. The rank histogram filter (RHF) allows WRF to more accurately simulate CWP and CFC compared with the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) although it took roughly twice as long as the latter. By cycling both cloud and noncloud variables, specifying large outlier threshold values, or setting smaller observation errors without thinning of observations, WRF achieved a better simulation of CWP and CFC.With model integration, DA of the visible radiance data also generated a slightly positive impact on non-cloud variables as they were adjusted through the model dynamics and physics related to cloud processes. In addition, the DA improved the representation of precipitation. However, the impact on the rain rate is limited by the inabilities of the DA to improve cloud vertical structures and cloud phases. A negative impact of the DA on cloud variables was found due to the nature of the non-linear forward operator and the non-Gaussian distribution of the prior. Future works should explore faster and more accurate forward operators suitable for assimilating FY-4A visible imagery, techniques to reduce the non-linear and non-Gaussian errors, and methods to correct the location errors which correspond to the clouds underestimated by the first guess.

TI  - Possibilities of mapping neotectonic elements based on the interpretation of space images: A study of Fergana Depression
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - For the current geological mapping of individual territories, remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) technologies are widely used. Taking the Fergana depression as an example, this paper aims to determine the possibilities of using remote sensing materials for mapping structural and geomor-phological elements. Landsat-8 satellite imagery obtained on 11 spectral channels was used to highlight the decoding features. Fault zones, lineament zones, various uplifts, depressions, and structural material complexes of different ages were identified. Based on the in-depth analysis of geological and geophysical data, a geological schematic map of the Fergana depression was developed. Using geological landscape and automated methods for deciphering space images, the main neotectonic elements of the Fergana depression were identified: the southern step, northern marginal slope, central graben-syncline, flexure-fault zones, local anticlinal zones, individual uplifts/depressions, and local shear zones. The results show a neotectonic map of the study area, which can be used as a tectonic basis for prospecting, seismic zoning mapping, and geological engineering development.(c) 2022 Editorial office of Geodesy and Geodynamics.

TI  - Comparison of Six Empirical Methods for Multispectral Satellite-derived Bathymetry
T2  - MARINE GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB), an important technology in marine geodesy, is advantageous because of its wide coverage, low cost, and short revisit cycle. At present, several different kinds of SDB methods exist, and their inversion accuracy is affected by algorithm performance, band selection, and sample distribution, among other factors. But these factors have not been adequately quantified and compared. In the present study, we evaluate the performances and highlight the best scenarios for applying the six classical empirical methods including the log-transformed single band, band ratio (BR), Lyzenga polynomial (LP), support vector regression, third-order polynomial (TOP), and back propagation (BP) neural network. The results reveal that the number of training samples is important for the empirical SDB methods, and the TOP and BP methods need more training samples than other methods. Compared to the robust BR and LP methods, the TOP and BP methods can obtain high accuracy but are severely influenced by incomplete samples. In addition, experiments that prove the local minimum (poor robustness) problem of the BP method exist and cannot be ignored in the bathymetry field. The present study highlights the most suitable method for obtaining reliable SDB results and their applicability.

TI  - Adjustment of extreme wind speed in regional climate downscaling over southwestern South Atlantic
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we estimated near-surface wind speed 100-year return values over the southwestern South Atlantic Ocean, using present-day (1979-2018) simulations from the regional climate models (RCMs) WRF and RegCM4. Extreme wind events, associated with hazardous conditions over coastal and oceanic areas, must be well represented in numerical models for risk assessment, and few studies focused on the added value offered by RCMs to wind extremes. Events were selected with the peaks-over-threshold method and extremes were calculated by fitting peaks to a generalized Pareto distribution. For the assessment of model performance, we used the satellite-based dataset from the Cross-Calibrated Multi Platform (CCMP), which has great agreement with in situ observations. While modern reanalysis underestimated higher wind speed quantiles, the CCMP was able to represent these quantiles. Dynamical downscaling with the WRF (RegCM4) indicates an underestimation (overestimation) of wind speed for upper quantiles. To mitigate the effects of these differences in the extreme value estimate, we applied a linear adjustment in the simulated wind speed using the CCMP as reference. This application reduced the bias for higher wind speeds in simulations for all regions, except over the coastal area near Argentina and Uruguay, where downscaling already realistically represents extreme events. The spatial distribution of the simulated extremes is compatible with previous results based on reanalysis and satellite data, although with finer-scale structure, especially over the southern South Atlantic, a region frequently affected by cyclone occurrence and extreme near-surface winds. The extreme wind speed maps estimated for 100 years reflect these conditions with values reaching around 30 m center dot s(-1) in the area, even after the wind adjustment. Besides, the fine-scale features aggregate important new information related to extreme winds in the region, which is a relevant added value in the study of return values estimates.

T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health concern. Nowadays, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are considered emerging pollutants. This study followed the One Health framework, in which AMR surveillance in the environment, including in wild animals, is advisable to mitigate this problem. Here we investigated AMR associated with Eurasian otter, a semi-aquatic mammal considered an indicator of freshwater health. To do so, otter???s faecal resistome was characterized by a high-throughput qPCR array. This technique has a high-capacity of ARGs profiling. Additionally, we have assessed the antimicrobial susceptibility of two indicator bacteria, E. coli and Enterococcus spp, isolated from otter spraints and interpreted the results according to clinical and epide-miological cut-offs (ECOFFs).

TI  - Smoke emissions from the extreme wildfire events in central Portugal in October 2017
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decades, numerous large forest fires have been recorded in Portugal. On 15 and 16 October 2017, seven extreme wildfires events (EWEs) took place in the central region of Portugal. Aiming to contribute to the assessment of the smoke impact of these EWEs, this study estimates their atmospheric emissions using a bottom-up approach with high spatial and temporal resolution. To this end, fire data were used, such as ignition location and time, propagation, burned area, and fuel load and emission factors according to forest species. A particular fire - EWE in Lousa with a high fuel load - emitted similar to 50% of the sum of the emissions of the six other case studies. The spatial distribution of the EWE emissions indicates that fuel load is an important component of emissions estimation. The obtained results were compared with remote sensing data, showing good agreement in terms of total values. During these EWEs, particulate matter and carbon monoxide emissions were higher than Portuguese anthropogenic emissions in 2017. This approach contributes to the state of the art on forest fire emissions, reducing uncertainty and obtaining the best possible and detailed quantification of the temporal and spatial variability of EWE emissions.

TI  - Effect of precipitation on synthetic aperture radar hurricane wind field retrieval
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with all-weather observation capability is gradually being used for the high-resolution observation of hurricane. The extreme wind speed in hurricanes is retrieved by combining the co- and cross-polarized SAR signals. However, the heavy precipitation associated with hurricanes will seriously affect the retrieval of SAR sea surface wind speed. In this study, the effects of precipitation-related parameters and phenomena on wind speed retrieval under strong hurricane conditions were examined by using the data from co-located global precipitation measurement Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar, SAR on Sentinel-1 and Radarsat-2, and stepped frequency microwave radiometer. The results show that precipitation will increase the retrieval error of wind speed, and the effect of convective precipitation is more obvious than that of stratiform precipitation. When the wind speed is less than 30 m/s and the rain rate is less than 20 mm/h, the distribution of the melting layer has no obvious effect on SAR wind speed retrieval. Rain cells are mainly the product of convective precipitation and can also be produced when the storm top height is very low. An increase in the vertical-horizontal (VH) polarized normalized radar cross section (NRCS) in rain cells is usually greater than that of the vertical-vertical (VV) polarized NRCS because the sensitivity of the VH signal in a hurricane area is usually greater than that of the VV signal. When the rain rate is low, the difference between the retrieved wind speed inside and outside the rain cells is within the error range of hurricane wind speed retrieval. When the rain rate is further increased, the difference will exceed 10 m/s.

TI  - Tropospheric ozone retrieval by a combination of TROPOMI/S5P measurements with BASCOE assimilated data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new tropospheric ozone dataset based on TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)/Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) total ozone measurements combined with stratospheric ozone data from the Belgian Assimilation System for Chemical ObsErvations (BASCOE) constrained by assimilating ozone observations from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). The BASCOE stratospheric data are interpolated to the S5P observations and subtracted from the TROPOMI total ozone data. The difference is equal to the tropospheric ozone residual column from the surface up to the tropopause. The tropospheric ozone columns are retrieved at the full spatial resolution of the TROPOMI sensor (5.5x3.5 km2) with daily global coverage.Compared to the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications 2 (OMPS-MERRA-2) data, a global mean positive bias of 3.3 DU is found for the analysed period April 2018 to June 2020. A small negative bias of about -0.91 DU is observed in the tropics relative to the operational TROPOMI tropical tropospheric data based on the convective cloud differential (CCD) algorithm throughout the same period. The new tropospheric ozone data (S5P-BASCOE) are compared to a set of globally distributed ozonesonde data integrated up to the tropopause level. We found 2254 comparisons with cloud-free TROPOMI observations within 25 km of the stations. In the global mean, S5P-BASCOE deviates by 2.6 DU from the integrated ozonesondes. Depending on the latitude the S5P-BASCOE deviate from the sondes and between -4.8 and 7.9 DU, indicating a good agreement. However, some exceptional larger positive deviations up to 12 DU are found, especially in the northern polar regions (north of 70 degrees). The monthly mean tropospheric column and time series for selected areas showed the expected spatial and temporal pattern, such as the wave one structure in the tropics or the seasonal cycle, including a summer maximum, in the mid-latitudes.

TI  - Role of sentinel lymph node biopsy for oral squamous cell carcinoma: Current evidence and future challenges
T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been used across oncological specialties for prognostication, staging, and identification of occult nodal metastasis. Recent studies demonstrated the potential clinical utility of SLNB in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC). Elective neck dissection is the current standard of care in early management of OCSCC with depth of invasion greater than 2-4 mm; however, majority of patients ultimately do not have nodal disease on final pathology. SLNB is an alternative procedure widely adopted in early cancer management in many oncological subspecialities. Several considerations such as depth of invasion, nodal mapping, histopathology methods, operator variability, postoperative complications, and advancement in preoperative and intraoperative imaging technology can guide the appropriate application to SLNB in OCSCC. The aim of this review is to discuss the current evidence for SLNB in the treatment of early stage OCSCC, imaging technologies that support SLNB procedures, and studies that are currently underway.

TI  - Infection and transmission dynamics of Turkey arthritis reovirus in different age Turkeys
T2  - MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Turkey arthritis reovirus (TARV) has been established as a cause of lameness in meat type turkeys in the past decade. However, no information is available on the age susceptibility of TARV or its transmission dynamics. We conducted this study to determine the age at which turkey poults are susceptible to TARV infection and whether infected birds can horizontally transmit the virus to their non-infected pen mates (sentinels). Five groups of turkeys were orally inoculated with TARV (similar to 10(6) TCID50/ml) at 2, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of age (DOA). Two days after each challenge, four uninfected sentinel turkeys of equal age were added to the virus-inoculated groups. At one- and two-weeks post infection, turkeys from each group, including two sentinels, were euthanized followed by necropsy. Inoculated birds in all age groups had TARV replication in the intestine and gastrocnemius tendon with no statistically significant variation at p < 0.5. Furthermore, the inoculated birds at different age groups showed consistently high gastrocnemius tendon histologic lesion scores while birds in the 28-days-old age group had numerically lower lesion scores at 14 days post inoculation (dpi). The sentinels, in turn, also showed virus replication in their intestines and tendons and histologic lesions in gastrocnemius tendons. The findings indicate that turkeys at the age of 28 days or less are susceptible to infection with TARV following oral challenge. It was also found that TARV-infected birds could transmit the infection to naive sentinel turkeys of the same age.

TI  - Stable isotopes reveal that bottom-up omnivory drives food chain length and trophic position in eutrophic coastal ecosystems
T2  - ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In coastal marine food webs, food chain length and the distribution of trophic levels mediate the impacts of emerging threats such as overfishing, pollution, and climate change, through their effect on essential properties such as productivity, connectivity, and energy transfer efficiency. These two components of food web structure are therefore an essential element of ecosystem-based management; however, what drives them remains poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that high primary production drives lower trophic levels and shorter food chain length in coastal regions. Here, we evaluate this hypothesis on the British Columbia (BC) coast as this coastal marine ecosystem is comprised of regions with contrasting levels of primary production. We measured nitrogen stable isotopes from zooplankton, micronekton, and nekton collected from four of the main water bodies of southern BC during a survey completed in August of 2019. We used Sentinel-3 satellite data to determine overall production in each region across a 5-year climatology and during the 2019 season. Results showed that primary production varied significantly between the four regions and that increases in phytoplankton biomass were driven by increases in microphytoplankton. Nitrogen isotope data demonstrated a significant inverse relationship between a region's primary production and both total food chain length and trophic level in species sampled in multiple regions, but no change in the trophic structure of the zooplankton community across regions. Changes in species' trophic levels were therefore driven by shifts in the level of zooplanktivory. These results support a model of bottom-up omnivory driving coastal food web structure, where levels of primary production, specifically biomass of microphytoplankton, determine food chain length and the distribution of trophic levels. High microphytoplankton biomass supports a large biomass of large grazing zooplankton, which drive increases in omnivorous feeding behaviour among the micronekton and nekton.

AB  - Identifying critical habitats is challenging for a relatively rare species like green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris), which spends most of its life at sea. We used a fixed array and an autonomous underwater vehicle (Slocum glider) as monitoring platforms to detect acoustically tagged green sturgeon in the coastal ocean. For 1 month in 2018 during spring (May) and again in fall (September-October), both methods were used simultaneously to detect sturgeon bearing uniquely coded transmitters. For the fixed array, nine acoustic receivers were interspersed with three sentinel transmitters along a single line of latitude off Winchester Bay, OR. For the glider, two 3-week deployments were completed along the coast of Oregon from nearshore to the 200-m depth contour. For both deployments, the glider flew a zig-zag course southward as it profiled the water column and collected water quality information. Tagged green sturgeon and sentinel transmitters were successfully detected by both the fixed array and the glider. The fixed array provided indications of onshore and offshore movement, while the glider indicated along-shore movement. Although more green sturgeon were detected by the fixed array, the glider provided information on potential sturgeon aggregation areas. In addition, this application of the underwater glider may provide a unique opportunity for public engagement, teaching, and outreach.

TI  - Coastal transgression and regression from 1980 to 2020 and shoreline forecasting for 2030 and 2040, using DSAS along the southern coastal tip of Peninsular India
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explains the multi-decadal shoreline changes along the coast of Kanyakumari from 1980 to 2020. The shorelines are extracted from the Landsat images to estimate the shoreline dynamics and future predictions using Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). By the estimation of End Point Rate (EPR) and Linear Regression Rate (LRR), it is quantified that the maximum erosion is 5.01 m/yr (EPR) and 6.13 m/yr (LRR) consistently with the maximum accretion of 3.77 m/yr (EPR) and 3.11 m/yr (LRR) along the entire coastal stretch of 77 km. The future shoreline predicted using the Kalman filter forecasted that Inayam, Periyakattuthurai and Kodimunai are highly prone to erosion with a shift of 170 m, 157 m and 145 m by 2030 and 194 m, 182 m and 165 m by 2040 towards the land. Also, the western coast is highly prone to erosion and it is predicted that certain villages are prone to loss of economy and livelihood. The outcome of this study may guide the coastal researchers to understand the evolution and decision -makers to evolve with alternative sustainable management plans in the future.(c) 2022 Editorial office of Geodesy and Geodynamics.

TI  - Mapping forest and site quality of planted Chinese fir forest using sentinel images
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Normally, forest quality (FQ) and site quality (SQ) play an important role in evaluating actual and potential forest productivity. Traditionally, these assessment indices (FQ and SQ) are mainly based on forest parameters extracted from ground measurement (forest height, age, density, forest stem volume (FSV), and DBH), which is labor-intensive and difficult to access in certain remote forest areas. Recently, remote sensing images combined with a small number of samples were gradually applied to map forest parameters because of the various advantages of remote sensing technology, such as low cost, spatial coverage, and high efficiency. However, FQ and SQ related to forest parameters are rarely estimated using remote sensing images and machine learning models. In this study, the Sentinel images and ground samples of planted Chinese fir forest located in the ecological "green-core" area of Changzhutan urban cluster, were initially employed to explore the feasibility of mapping the FQ and SQ. And then, four types of alternative variables (backscattering coefficients (VV and VH), multi-spectral bands, vegetation indices, and texture characteristics) were extracted from Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2A images, respectively. After selecting variables using a stepwise regression model, three machine learning models (SVR, RF, and KNN) were employed to estimate various forest parameters. Finally, the FQ of the study region was directly mapped by the weights sum of related factors extracted by the factor analysis method, and the SQ was also extracted using mapped forest height and age. The results illustrated that the accuracy of estimated forest parameters (DBH, H, and Age) was significantly higher than FSV, FCC, and Age and the largest and smallest rRMSEs were observed from FSV (0.38-0.40) and forest height (0.20-0.21), respectively. Using mapped forest parameters, it also resulted that the rRMSEs of estimated FQ and SQ were 0.19 and 0.15, respectively. Furthermore, after normalization and grading, the grades of forest quality were mainly concentrated in grades I, II, and III in the study region. Though the accuracy of mapping FQ and SQ is limited by the saturation phenomenon, it is significantly proved that using machine learning models and Sentinel images has great potential to indirectly map FQ and SQ.

TI  - Spatio-temporal snow cover change in the early twenty-first century using improved MODIS dataset: a case study of District Hunza, Pakistan
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has a massive influence on cryosphere around the globe, particularly in the Hindukush, Karakoram, and Himalayan (HKH) region which is jeopardizing water resources of the region. Thus, keeping this problem in mind the study was conducted using improved MODIS snow cover product for District Hunza to extract snow cover area (SCA) from 2003 to 2018. ASTER GDEM data was utilized to correlate the topographic parameters (elevation, slope, and aspect) with SCA. Mean monthly and annual rainfall and temperature data were acquired from climate research unit (CRU) to examine the impact of climate change on SCA. The results indicated that District Hunza has a declining trend of SCA on a monthly and annual time scale because mean monthly and annual temperature is increasing with a rate of 0.31 degrees C and 0.10 degrees C, respectively while precipitation is decreasing with a rate of - 2.90 mm/month and - 5.73 mm/year. High seasonal variability has been observed in SCA due to variations in temperature and precipitation. Maximum snow cover area is observed in elevation zone 3-zone 5 in accumulation period while in depletion period maximum SCA is observed in zone 4 and zone 5. The highest snow cover area was observed in slope zone 3 and zone 4 while Northeast and North facing slope aspect has also maximum amount of snow. Monthly, annual, and seasonal SCA has been correlated with climatic parameters and strong relationship has been observed between them. The conclusion can be drawn from this study that increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation are contributing to SCA melting, which can cause flood and water scarcity in downstream regions.

TI  - Two long-period transiting exoplanets on eccentric orbits: NGTS-20 b (TOI-5152 b) and TOI-5153 b
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. Long-period transiting planets provide the opportunity to better understand the formation and evolution of planetary systems. Their atmospheric properties remain largely unaltered by tidal or radiative effects of the host star, and their orbital arrangement reflects a different and less extreme migrational history compared to close-in objects. The sample of long-period exoplanets with well-determined masses and radii is still limited, but a growing number of long-period objects reveal themselves in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data.Aims. Our goal is to vet and confirm single-transit planet candidates detected in the TESS space-based photometric data through spectroscopic and photometric follow-up observations with ground-based instruments.Methods. We used high-resolution spectrographs to confirm the planetary nature of the transiting candidates and measure their masses. We also used the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) to photometrically monitor the candidates in order to observe additional transits. Using a joint modeling of the light curves and radial velocities, we computed the orbital parameters of the system and were able to precisely measure the mass and radius of the transiting planets.Results. We report the discovery of two massive, warm Jupiter-size planets, one orbiting the F8-type star TOI-5153 and the other orbiting the G1-type star NGTS-20 (=TOI-5152). From our spectroscopic analysis, both stars are metal rich with a metallicity of 0.12 and 0.15, respectively. Only TOI-5153 presents a second transit in the TESS extended mission data, but NGTS observed NGTS-20 as part of its mono-transit follow-up program and detected two additional transits. Follow-up high-resolution spectroscopic observations were carried out with CORALIE, CHIRON, FEROS, and HARPS. TOI-5153 hosts a planet with a period of 20.33 days, a planetary mass of 3.26(-0.17)(+0.18) Jupiter masses (M-j), a radius of 1.06(-0.04)(+0.04)R(J), and an orbital eccentricity of 0.091(-0.02)(6)(+0.024). NGTS-20 b is a 2.98(-)(0.)(15)(+0.16) M-J planet with a radius of 1.07(-0.0)(4)(+0.04) R-J on an eccentric (0.432(-0.023)(+0.023)) orbit with an orbital period of 54.19 days. Both planets are metal enriched and their heavy element content is in line with the previously reported mass-metallicity relation for gas giants.Conclusions. Both warm Jupiters orbit moderately bright host stars, making these objects valuable targets for follow-up studies of the planetary atmosphere and measurement of the spin-orbit angle of the system.

TI  - Analysis and Evaluation of Ecological Environment Monitoring Based on PIE Remote Sensing Image Processing Software
T2  - JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous improvement of people's demand for ecological environment quality, the research on ecological environment monitoring, analysis and evaluation had been paid more and more attention by relevant departments and personnel. Because the images collected by remote sensing technology were many and multi-source, the features extracted from remote sensing images using traditional methods had been difficult to meet the needs of related industry applications. Therefore, this paper made use of the advantages of PIE remote sensing image processing software in data analysis and processing, and put forward the research on ecological environment monitoring, analysis and evaluation methods. Firstly, on the basis of summarizing the concepts and related problems of ecological environment, this paper analyzed the processing methods of remote sensing data sources of ecological environment, and explained the evaluation standards and common methods of ecological environment. Secondly, the composition of PIE remote sensing image processing technology system and its application advantages were described, the common indicators and analysis methods of ecological environment monitoring were given, and the index system and model of ecological environment comprehensive evaluation were established. Finally, through the analysis of experimental cases, the results showed that the ecological environment monitoring analysis and evaluation method proposed in this paper was feasible. Compared with the traditional methods, the method proposed in this paper could objectively evaluate the ecological environment. This paper can not only provide support for the analysis and processing of remote sensing image data, but also provide an important reference for the application of remote sensing technology in the field of ecological environment.

TI  - Role of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Clinically Node Negative Carcinoma Penis - a Prospective Study
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nodal metastasis is a strong prognostic indicator in carcinoma penis, with 25% difference in 5-year cancer-specific survival among node negative and node positive patients. This study aims to assess efficacy of SLNB in identifying occult nodal metastasis (seen in 20-25% of cases), thus avoiding morbidity of prophylactic groin dissection in rest. Study was conducted between June 2016 and December 2019 on 42 patients (84 groins). Primary outcomes assessed were sensitivity, specificity, false negative rates, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) compared to superficial inguinal node dissection (SIND). Secondary outcomes were to know prevalence of nodal metastasis, sensitivity, specificity, false negative rates, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) of frozen section study, and ultrasonography (USG) compared to histopathological examination (HPE) and to evaluate false negative results of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Patients with impalpable inguinal nodes were subjected to USG and FNAC of suspicious nodes. Only those with non-suspicious USG/negative FNAC were included. Patients who were node positive, had prior chemotherapy/radiotherapy/prior groin surgery, or medically unfit for surgery were excluded. Dual-dye technique was used to identify sentinel node. Superficial inguinal dissection was done in all cases and both specimens were subject to frozen section. If >= 2 nodes were involved on frozen section, ilioinguinal dissection was done. SLNB had sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 100%, respectively. There were no false negative results of frozen section study among 168 specimens. Ultrasonography had sensitivity of 50%, specificity of 48.75%, PPV of 4.65%, NPV of 95.12%, and accuracy of 48.81%. We had 2 false negative results of FNAC. Sentinel node biopsy with frozen section study when done in properly selected cases using dual-dye technique in high volume centers by experienced professionals is a very reliable tool in establishing the nodal status, thereby facilitating need directed treatment, thus prevent either over/under treatment.

TI  - Understanding the changes of optically active substances (OACs) in Hulun Lake in the past 35 years and its indication to the degradation of aquatic ecology
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake eutrophication and ecological degradation are among the most serious environmental problems in the world and identifying changes in key water quality parameters and associated drivers is critical for lake man-agement. Optically active substances (OACs) are important water quality indicators that affect lake water ecology and evaluate lake eutrophication. Climate change and human activities are important factors driving the changes of OACs in lakes. Understanding how and why OACs varies in long-term trend in response to different influencing factors and its driving mechanism is needed to understand. In this study, based on the Landsat series satellite data, this study investigated the historical changes of OACs in Hulun Lake, quantitatively explained the response relationship of OACs to meteorological, hydrological and human activity elements, and discussed their indicative role in the degradation of water ecology. The results showed that during 1986-2020, OACs had obvious periodic changes; from 1986 to 1999, Chla, CDOM and TSM are relatively stable at lower values; during 2000-2009, the concentration of total suspended matter (TSM) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) increased, and the concentration of chlorophyll a (Chla) decreased; during 2010-2020 The annual TSM and CDOM concentration decreased, and the Chla concentration increased. The results showed that among the hy-drometeorological and anthropogenic variables selected to explain changes in the OAC, gross domestic product (GDP) is the key factor influencing changes in the OACs, explaining 39.3%, 71.8% and 60.6% of the changes in Chla, CDOM and TSM, respectively. Air temperature (AT) can explain 24.0% of the variation in Chla, evapo-transpiration (Eva) can explain 19.1% and 5.52% of the variation in CDOM and TSM, and precipitation (P) can explain 13.8% and 7.5% of the variation in Chla and TSM. Water level is an important pathway affecting OACs in Hulun Lake, explaining 50.7% of the variation in CDOM, 48.0% of the variation in TSM and 23.1% of the variation in Chla. Warming and drought in the Hulun Lake basin and human activities ultimately lead to changes in OACs. Finally, a pattern diagram to assess the degree of ecological degradation of lake was proposed. This study has substantial implications to monitor and assess the ecological degradation status of lake and maintain the sustainable development of lakes in cold and arid regions.

TI  - Monitoring and analysis of desertification surrounding Qinghai Lake (China) using remote sensing big data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is one of the most serious ecological environmental problems in the world. Monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of desertification is crucial for its control. The region around Qinghai Lake, in the northeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China, is a special ecological function area and a climate change sensitive area, making its environmental conditions a great concern. Using cloud computing via Google Earth Engine (GEE), we collected Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS, and MODIS Albedo images from 2000 to 2020 in the region around Qinghai Lake, acquired land surface albedo (Albedo), and normalized vegetation index (NDVI) to build a remote sensing monitoring model of desertification. Our results showed that the desertification difference index based on the Albedo-NDVI feature space could reflect the degree of desertification in the region around Qinghai Lake. GEE offers significant advantages, such as massive data processing and long-term dynamic monitoring. The desertification land area fluctuated downward in the study area from 2000 to 2020, and the overall desertification status improved. Natural factors, such as climate change from warm-dry to warm-wet and decreased wind speed, and human factors improved the desertification situation. The findings indicate that desertification in the region around Qinghai Lake has been effectively controlled, and the overall desertification trend is improving.

T2  - JOURNAL OF STATISTICS AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is a vital issue that affects day-to-day lives. It is observed that throughout the world, there is an instant need to overcome the monster of pollution. According to statistics, most of the polluted cities in the world are in India. This poses a serious need of the hour for the Indian scientists, engineers, and authorities as a whole to fight and reduce it as much as possible. The time has come when one needs to plan their outside activities on pollution levels and air quality status. Air Quality Index (AQI) varies daily; hence it is difficult to predict future trends for the same. The current study proposed a machine learning-based model that uses sensors, past/present pollutants concentration data, and satellite data to predict air pollution in the regions in India. We emphasize the fact that other than measurable pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, etc.); meteorological data like wind, temperature, and fire are also important factors in determining pollution. The model uses Long Short-Term Memory, which is the state-of-the-art technique used for time series prediction. The model could predict the concentration of the pollutants and calculate the AQI for the areas where data was available for the near future. The Root Mean Square Error on test data is 54. The results are quite promising and future model can be made, taking this as a base model. An inexpensive prediction technique can greatly help the administration in mitigating pollution.

TI  - A hybrid remote sensing approach for estimating chemical oxygen demand concentration in optically complex waters: A case study in inland lake waters in eastern China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Chemical oxygen demand concentration (CCOD) is widely used to indicate the degree of organic pollution of lakes, res-ervoirs and rivers. Mastering the spatiotemporal distribution of CCOD is imperative for understanding the variation mechanism and controlling of organic pollution in water. In this study, a hybrid approach suitable for Sentinel 3A/ Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) data was developed to estimate CCOD in inland optically complex waters embedding the interaction between CCOD and the absorption coefficients of optically active constituents (OACs). Based on in-situ sampling in different waters, the independent validations of the proposed model performed satisfac-torily in Lake Taihu (MAPE = 23.52 %, RMSE = 0.95 mg/L, and R2 = 0.81), Lake Qiandaohu (MAPE = 21.63 %, RMSE = 0.50 mg/L and R2 = 0.69), and Yangtze River (MAPE = 29.34 %, RMSE = 0.83 mg/L, and R2 = 0.64). In addition, the approach not only showed significant superiority compared with previous algorithms, but also was suitable for other common satellite sensors equipped same or similar bands. The hybrid approach was applied to OLCI images to retrieve CCOD of Lake Taihu from 2016 to 2020 and reveals substantial interannual and seasonal var-iations. The above results indicate that the proposed approach is effective and stable for studying spatiotemporal dy-namic of CCOD in optically complex waters, and that satellite-derived products can provide reliable information for lake water quality management.

TI  - Improving GPP estimates by partitioning green APAR from total APAR in two deciduous forest sites
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-photosynthetic components within a forest ecosystem account for a large proportion of the canopy but are not involved in photosynthesis. Therefore, the accuracy of gross primary production (GPP) estimates is expected to improve by removing these components. However, their influence in GPP estimations has not been quantitatively evaluated for deciduous forests. Several vegetation indices have been used recently to estimate the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by photosynthetic components (FAPAR(green)) for partitioning APAR(green) (photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by photosynthetic components). In this study, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) estimated FAPAR(green) and to separate the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by photosynthetic components (APAR(green)) from total APAR observations (APAR(total)) at two deciduous forest sites. The eddy covariance-light use efficiency (EC-LUE) algorithm was employed to evaluate the influence of non-photosynthetic components and to test the performance of APAR(green) in GPP estimation. The results show that the influence of non-photosynthetic components have a seasonal pattern at deciduous forest sites, large differences are observed with normalized root mean square error (RMSE*) values of APAR(green)-based GPP and APAR(total)-based GPP between tower-based GPP during the early and end stages, while slight differences occurred during peak growth seasons. In addition, daily GPP estimation was significantly improved using the APAR(green)-based method, giving a higher coefficient of determination and lower normalized root mean square error against the GPP estimated by the APAR(total)-based method. The results demonstrate the significance of partitioning APAR(green) from APAR(total) for accurate GPP estimation in deciduous forests.

TI  - Shannon Entropy-based urban spatial fragmentation to ensure sustainable development of the urban coastal city: A case study of Semarang, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the extent to which the Shannon Entropy Index (H) can be used to ensure ur-ban growth sustainability by measuring the spatial dispersion pattern of a built-up area. The Shannon Entropy Index was calculated based on the proximities to the city center (HCC) and the main road (HMR), which divide the study area into 17 zones. Data from Landsat 5-TM Imagery 2011 and Landsat 8-OLI Imagery 2016 and 2021 were used to extract urban built-up areas through image classification using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithm and measure their growth over time. The results show the normalized Shannon Entropy Index for the proximi-ties to the city center (HCC ') and the main road (HMR '). HCC ' was found to be 0.93 in 2021 and increased by 0.44 during 2011-2021, while HMR ' was recorded to be 0.68 in 2021 and increased by 0.27 during 2011-2021, indicating that urban development in Semarang City has become in-creasingly fragmented. Among the 17 existing zones, the peri-urban areas of southeast part zones in Semarang (III-BP and IV-AP) were found to have the largest relative Shannon Entropy Index (H') of 0.98 and 0.96, respectively, indicating that this area is developing irregularly and spread-ing out compared to the city center, which is unsustainable built-up area growth. We call for an integrated space utilization control strategy between the city center and the peri-urban area. Our study demonstrates the capacity of using the Shannon Entropy Index to detect potential areas of unsustainable development in a coastal city with diverse development dynamics, which can also be applied in other coastal cities to prevent unsustainable development.

TI  - Simulating the potential forest ranges in an old land: the case for Turkey's forests
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The central aim of this study is to estimate the current potential distribution of Turkey's forests and their composition in absence of anthropogenic landcover change, and in this manner to contribute to past studies on the distribution of European forest taxa by filling an important spatial gap. For our simulations, we used high resolution climate data from ERA5-Land and a process based dynamic regional to global vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS), for which we modified the original European tree species list to match the climatic sensitivities that the species in turn exhibit throughout their natural ranges in Turkey, alternating between subspecies where necessary. This is the first application of LPJ-GUESS for the entire country using high resolution climate data. We defined the climatic tolerances for the model of three conifer species with wide distribution in Turkey: Pinus nigra, Pinus brutia, and Cedrus libani. We first identified relative bioclimatic tolerances of species for Turkey by way of comparing their current recorded distributions to ERA5-Land reanalysis data using observation data from the General Directorate of Forestry of Turkey, and later through ensemble runs with LPJ-GUESS we finetuned their parameters. Finally, we compared simulated net primary production to MODIS remote sensing observation estimates. In general, LPJ-GUESS captured the natural distribution ranges of different forest taxa, especially after the introduction of three additional species native to Turkey, highlighting competition for resources. Due to probable regional acclimatization of species, our final set of parameters for the different plant functional types offers a suitable alternative for future studies.

TI  - Structured Reporting: An Intervention to Improve Procedure Documentation in Breast Imaging
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To evaluate intervention of structured reporting after wrong-site surgery that occurred after localization of an incorrect breast biopsy marker. Methods An IRB-exempt retrospective database review identified patients who underwent core-needle biopsy of a breast lesion from July 1, 2014 to July 1, 2020. They were divided into three cohorts: 2014 pre-intervention/pre-sentinel, 2017 pre-intervention/post-sentinel, and 2019 post-intervention of structured reports. One hundred reports per cohort were reviewed for documentation of marker and shape. Statistical analysis was performed with mixed-effects logistic regression model and chi-squared test with P Results The 2014 cohort consisted of 100 patients with 122 biopsies. Twenty-seven (22.1%) were excluded: 5/122 (4.1%) lesion resolution, 22/122 (18.0%) no documentation whether marker was/was not placed. Of the 95 biopsies remaining, 4/95 (4.2%) had no marker placed, 62/95 (65.3%) reported marker only, and 29/95 (30.5%) reported marker and shape. In the 2017 cohort, 100 patients underwent 108 biopsies. Four/108 (3.7%) were excluded: lesion resolution. Of the 104, 10/104 (9.6%) had no marker placed, 22/104 (21.2%) reported marker only, and 72/104 (69.2%) reported marker and shape. In the 2019 cohort, 100 patients underwent 114 biopsies. Two/114 (1.8%) were excluded: lesion resolution. Of the 112, 3/112 (2.7%) had no marker placed, 3/112 (2.7%) reported marker only, and 106/112 (94.6%) reported marker and shape. The predicted probability of both marker placement and shape described were statistically greater for 2019 compared to the other cohorts (P < 0.05). Conclusion Using structured reports facilitates and improves documentation of breast biopsy markers and may potentially reduce the risk of medical errors.

TI  - A census from heaven: Unraveling the potential of deep learning and Earth Observation for intra-urban population mapping in data scarce environments
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban population distribution maps are vital elements for monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals, appropriately allocating resources such as vaccination campaigns, and facilitating evidence-based decision making. Typically, population distribution maps are derived from census data from the region of interest. Nevertheless, in several low-and middle-income countries, census information may be unreliable, outdated or unsuitable for spatial analysis at the intra-urban level, which poses severe limitations in the development of urban population maps of adequate quality. To address these shortcomings, we deploy a novel framework utilizing multisource Earth Observation (EO) information such as Sentinel-2 and very-high-resolution Pleiades imagery, openly available building footprint datasets, and deep learning (DL) architectures, providing end -to-end solutions to the production of high quality intra-urban population distribution maps in data scarce contexts. Using several case studies in Sub-Saharan Africa, namely Dakar (Senegal), Nairobi (Kenya) and Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), our results emphasize that the combination of DL and EO data is very potent and can successfully capture relationships between the retrieved image features and population counts at fine spatial resolutions (100 meter). Moreover, for the first time, we used state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods to predict population distributions in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi (R2 = 0.39, 0.60) that did not require national census or survey data from Kenya or Tanzania, but only a sample of training locations from Dakar. The DL architecture is based on a modified ResNet-18 model with dual-streams to analyze multi-modal data. Our findings have strong implications for the development of a new generation of urban population products that are an output of end-to-end solutions, can be updated frequently and rely completely on open data.

TI  - Modeling leaf area index using time-series remote sensing and topographic data in pure Anatolian black pine stands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We aimed to map and analyze LAI by using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 time series and the corresponding ground measurements collected in pure Anatolian black pine [Pinus nigra J.F. Arnold ssp. pallasiana (Lamb.) Holmboe] stands within seven-month (from June to December) period. A total of 30 sample plots were selected and seven-month changes of LAI values were determined through hemispherical photography for each sample plot. Remote sensing (reflectance values and vegetation indices obtained from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) and topographic (elevation, aspect, and slope) data were used to model the LAI for each month using multiple linear regression (MLR) method. Additionally, the data for all months were combined and modeled. In this case, autoregressive modeling techniques were used to solve the temporal autocorrelation problem. Our study indicated that the models developed from Sentinel-2 give more successful results than Landsat 8 on monthly LAI models. The most successful models were obtained in June by using the reflectance values (R-adj(2) = 0.39, RMSE = 0.3138 m(2) m(-2)), reflectance values-topographic data (R-adj(2) = 0.59 RMSE = 0.3174 m(2) m(-2)), vegetation indices-topographic data (R-adj(2) = 0.82, RMSE = 0.2126 m(2)m(-2)), and reflectance values-vegetation indices-topographic data (R-adj(2) = 0.93, RMSE =0.1060 m(2)m(-2)). Among the autoregressive modeling techniques, the highest success was obtained with the Landsat 8 OLI using the moving average (2) procedure (R-2 =0.56). This study is significant that it is the first to analyze the monthly effect on LAI modeling and mapping in pure Anatolian black pine stands using both reflectance values, vegetation indices, and topographic data.

TI  - Modeling on microclimatic variation of land surface temperature and vegetation cover at Rangpur City in Bangladesh
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation cover are essential in all environmental aspects. Understanding the spatiotemporal variation of LST and vegetation abundance is beneficial to investigate the microclimate studies of an urban area. In urban areas, vegetation is an essential element in flourishing microclimate and outdoor thermal consolation. Due to unplanned rapid urbanization and lack of proper management, the vegetation cover in Rangpur City Corporation (RpCC) are decline day by day. The vegetation covers are declined in fast-growing city like RpCC and it is leading to more sensible heat than the normal heat flux. This study focused on the relationship between LST and vegetation cover of the RpCC area of different periods and how they affect the regional microclimate. Through this research has also been evaluate the impacts of reducing the vegetation cover on the microclimate conditions in the study area. To fulfil the aim of the study, satellite imageries of the year 2021 (Operational Landsat), 2017 (Operational Landsat), 2009 and (Thematic mapper), 2000 (Thematic mapper) were processed using ArcGIS 10.5 software. From the satellite imageries, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and LST have been estimated to show the relation between LST and vegetation in RpCC and ANN (Artificial neural network) model was developed to predict the value of LST and NDVI after 7 years, particularly to the year 2028 based on datasets from 2000 to 2021. The linear regression analysis provides the inverse relationship between LST and vegetation in the study area that explains that due to urban growth materials, the amount of vegetation has been decreased, leading to increased surface temperature during 2000-2021. The developed ANN model using obtained data sets of LST and NDVI of RpCC predicts that the value of LST and NDVI till the year 2028 will not be changed so much compared to the previous 21 years (2000-2021). The highest LST may occur 32.71 degrees c in the year 2028 whereas the predicted highest NDVI value has been observed 0.57 which is not so sufficient in controlling LST in the city. However, more amount forestation is needed to minimize the effects of LST to make the city comfortable for the inhabitants including flora and fauna and others process as well like as cultivation, fishing, farming, etc.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we aim to reveal the most accurate method for soil moisture (SM) retrieving. Based on the synergistic use of Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2), the most popular Machine Learning (ML) techniques in addition to the Water Cloud Model (WCM) are evaluated. Experiments were carried out at two different sites Dar Dhaoui and Chammakh, located in an arid region in the south of Tunisia between 2015 and 2017. The input data includes the in-situ measurements, dual-polarized S-1A backscattering coefficients (sigma(o)(VV)sigma(o)(VH)), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from S-2A images. The experiment results revealed that Random Forest Regression (RFR), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and WCM described accuracy almost identical to Pearson correlation (r) 0.85 where CNN is the best over them. Teacher-Student (TS) with r 0.96 and Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) 0.80% remains the most accurate method for SM retrieving.

TI  - Are the Sundarbans, the World's largest mangroves region under threat?-An ecosystem-based geospatial approach to assess changes past, present, and future in relation to natural and human-induced factors
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The World's most extensive mangrove region, the Sundarbans ecosystem, is highly biodiverse but severely stressed. Past, present, and future potential changes in Sundarbans mangroves have been assessed from multi-temporal satellite data of 1980, 2000, and 2020, elevation data, and topographical maps using geospatial techniques, digital shoreline analysis system, land change modelling, and ground truth verification. The mangrove loss was 16,025 ha between 1980 and 2020 and is predicted to be 22,286 ha between 2020 and 2050. Major changes were observed in mangroves, waterbodies, mudflats, agriculture, and aquaculture. The shoreline change by endpoint rate indicated the erosion rate by 5.81 m yr(-1) in 2000-2020 compared to -0.90 m yr(-1) in 1980-2000. The weighted linear regression indicated the average erosion and accretion rate of -5.96 m-yr (-1) and 4.92 m yr(-1), respectively, with erosion in 76% of transects and accretion in the remaining 24% between 1980 and 2020. A sea-level rise by 1 m will inundate 17,486 ha of mangroves. The finding revealed the dynamic nature of mangroves, past and expected future loss, the severely eroding transects, hotspots, and the consequences of mangrove loss on depending the population. As fringe mangroves will be at greater risk, speedy measures are needed to stabilize the highly eroding regions.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Present study investigates the role of aerosol types in modulating warm cloud microphysics over the north Indian Ocean using long-term (2006-2016) satellite and re-analysis data. Analysis of well-mixed aerosol and marine warm cloud layers observed from daily co-located Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite over northern Indian Ocean revealed the occurrence of reverse Twomey effect in warm clouds having liquid water path (LWP) less than 75 g m(-2). Such clouds are found to occur under a rather stable (Estimated Inversion Strength (EIS) > 2) and dry atmospheric conditions (Free Tropospheric Humidity (FTH) < 40%). Analysis of estimated cloud-top entrainment index (ECTEI) and cloud-top entrainment instability (CTEI) quantitatively suggested that entrainment of dry air can have a significant role in reversing the first indirect effect. Further, investigation on the role of various aerosol types in well mixed clouds revealed that dust aerosols have predominant role in reversing the Twomey effect over the north Indian Ocean.

TI  - Mapping the spatial distribution of aboveground biomass of tea agroforestry systems using random forest algorithm in Barak valley, Northeast India
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The tea agroforestry system has great economic potential by supporting livelihood and food security while advancing ecological services by sequestering a large amount of carbon. Despite a large area under tea cultivation in India, little has been studied on the spatial distribution of aboveground biomass (AGB) of the tea agroforestry systems. Hence, the present study aims to map the spatial distribution of AGB of tea agroforestry systems in Barak valley, Assam, northeast India, by integrating Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and field inventory data using a random forest (RF) algorithm. The study reveals 330.69 km(2) area under tea cultivation in Barak valley which is 4.78% of the total geographical area of the region. The predicted AGB of tea agroforestry systems ranged from 30 to 124 Mg ha(-1) with a mean AGB of 75 Mg ha(-1). It was observed that RF could effectively predict the AGB (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 7.50 Mg ha(-1), and %RMSE = 9.94%) with a set of five optimized spectral variables, viz., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Infrared Index, Normalized Difference Water Index and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index derived from Sentinel-2 satellite data. The study provided a cost-effective approach, with freely available satellite data, algorithm, and software for effectively mapping the spatial distribution of AGB of tea agroforestry system. The approach adopted in the present study can be followed to map and monitor the carbon stock of agroforestry systems for better management.

TI  - How does land use cover change affect hydrological response in the Atlantic Forest? Implications for ecological restoration
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Water availability is influenced by climate conditions and physical characteristics such as topography, soil type, and land use and cover. The Atlantic Forest has a long deforestation history and shows a climatic and environmental gradient that results in natural vegetation diversity driven mainly by water availability and local conditions. Therefore, Atlantic Forest ecoregions are expected to show a natural variability of water responses and different hydrological effects caused by land-use cover change. In this study, we compared the hydrological response among 11 Atlantic Forest ecoregions in areas of native vegetation and pasture, using CHIRPS rainfall data, evapotranspiration by the MOD16A2 product of the MODIS satellite and water surplus calculated by the 19-year mass balance for 712 sampling points. The parameter "m", which can be considered a proxy for local hydrological responsiveness, was calculated by equations based on the Budyko framework and varied between 1.2 and 3.6 in the biome. In 10 of the 11 ecoregions, the parameter "m" in native vegetation was statistically higher than in the pasture, and in the REST, ECOT, SEMI, STEP, and PARK ecoregions this difference was more pronounced. For all ecoregions, the R/P ratio was inversely proportional to the parameter "m", but there were different levels of variation among them. In wetter and drier areas, there is less variation in the water surplus, while the greatest variations occurred in areas where the PET/P ratio is 1.5. In conclusion, the parameter "m" of native vegetation and pasture varies in different Atlantic Forest ecoregions. The results of each ecoregion regarding hydrological response and implications for water yield can be used to understand and plan changes in land use for water production.

TI  - Peripheral neuropathies associated with DNA repair disorders
T2  - MUSCLE & NERVE
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Repair of genomic DNA is a fundamental housekeeping process that quietly maintains the health of our genomes. The consequences of a genetic defect affecting a component of this delicate mechanism are quite harmful, characterized by a cascade of premature aging that injures a variety of organs, including the nervous system. One part of the nervous system that is impaired in certain DNA repair disorders is the peripheral nerve. Chronic motor, sensory, and sensorimotor polyneuropathies have all been observed in affected individuals, with specific physiologies associated with different categories of DNA repair disorders. Cockayne syndrome has classically been linked to demyelinating polyneuropathies, whereas xeroderma pigmentosum has long been associated with axonal polyneuropathies. Three additional recessive DNA repair disorders are associated with neuropathies, including trichothiodystrophy, Werner syndrome, and ataxia-telangiectasia. Although plausible biological explanations exist for why the peripheral nerves are specifically vulnerable to impairments of DNA repair, specific mechanisms such as oxidative stress remain largely unexplored in this context, and bear further study. It is also unclear why different DNA repair disorders manifest with different types of neuropathy, and why neuropathy is not universally present in those diseases. Longitudinal physiological monitoring of these neuropathies with serial electrodiagnostic studies may provide valuable noninvasive outcome data in the context of future natural history studies, and thus the responses of these neuropathies may become sentinel outcome measures for future clinical trials of treatments currently in development such as adeno-associated virus gene replacement therapies.

TI  - Dolphins and sea turtles may host zoonotic parasites and pathogenic bacteria as indicators of anthropic pressure in the Gulf of Taranto (Northern Ionian Sea, Central-Eastern Mediterranean Sea)
T2  - VETERINARY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of protozoan parasites Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. such as the pathogenic bacteria Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli was molecularly investigated in the following free ranging species of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus) as well as loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and green (Chelonia mydas) sea turtles living in the Gulf of Taranto (Mediterranean Sea). Out of forty-one investigated individuals belonging to the 4 species, 13 (31.7%) were positive to one or more pathogens and zoonotic G. duodenalis assemblage A, Cryptosporidium parvum and S. enterica were identified in striped dolphins, loggerhead and green sea turtles. In this work, the presence of these opportunistic pathogens has been investigated in fecal samples of free ranging dolphin and sea turtle species for the first time. Moreover, this is the first record of C. parvum in loggerhead sea turtles. These results may provide baseline data for the potential role of cetaceans and sea turtles as potential sentinel species for zoonotic and terrestrial pathogens in the marine environment.

TI  - Comparing Satellite and Ground-Based Measurements of Environmental Suitability for Vector Mosquitoes in an Urban Landscape
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure to mosquito-borne diseases is influenced by landscape patterns and microclimates associated with land cover. These influences can be particularly strong in heterogeneous urban landscapes where human populations are concentrated. We investigated how land cover and climate influenced abundances of Ae. albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) and Cx. quinquefasciatus (Say) (Diptera: Culicidae) in Norman, Oklahoma (United States). From June-October 2019 and May-October 2020 we sampled mosquitoes along an urban-rural gradient using CO2 baited BG Sentinel traps. Microclimate sensors at these sites measured temperature and humidity. We mapped environmental variables using satellite images from Landsat, Sentinel-2, and VIIRS, and the CHIRPS rainfall dataset. We also obtained meteorological data from the closest weather station. We compared statistical models of mosquito abundance based on microclimate, satellite, weather station, and land cover data. Mosquitoes were more abundant on trap days with higher temperature and relative humidity. Rainfall 2 wk prior to the trap day negatively affected mosquito abundances. Impervious surface cover was positively associated with Cx. quinquefasciatus and tree cover was negatively associated with Ae. albopictus. Among the data sources, models based on satellite variables and land cover data had the best fits for Ae. albopictus (R-2 = 0.7) and Cx. quinquefasciatus (R-2 = 0.51). Models based on weather station or microclimate data had weaker fits (R-2 between 0.09 and 0.17) but were improved by adding land cover variables (R-2 between 0.44 and 0.61). These results demonstrate the potential for using satellite remote sensing for mosquito habitat analyses in urban areas.

TI  - Do higher-quality nighttime lights and net primary productivity predict subnational GDP in developing countries? Evidence from the Philippines
T2  - ASIAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime lights (NTL) data from satellites are a useful proxy for local economic activity in developing countries where economic data are sparse. Yet most analyses use the flawed DMSP NTL data, a poor proxy for GDP in less densely populated and highly agricultural rural areas. In this article, we augment a novel NTL dataset of the newer and better VIIRS NTL data with more ubiquitous remotely sensed data, namely, net primary productivity (NPP) and land cover, and we test whether these satellite data predict subnational GDP in both urban and rural sectors of the Philippines. The results confirm that the higher-quality VIIRS NTL data predict urban economic activity sufficiently well for both light-intense and dimly lit regions but still do not explain rural economic activity very well. The use of croplands NPP as an intensive measure of agricultural productivity, however, dramatically improves the performance of land cover as a proxy. We demonstrate that remotely sensed data can be useful in various applications, including evaluating the long-run dynamics of province-level GDP growth, the local impact of natural disasters, and the effects of infrastructure projects at the city and municipal levels. Such applications point toward the need for empirical analysis of growth at finer scales of aggregation.

TI  - COVID-19 strict lockdown impact on urban air quality and atmospheric temperature in four megacities of India
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has forced to lockdown entire India starting from 24th March 2020 to 14th April 2020 (first phase), extended up to 3rd May 2020 (second phase), and further extended up to 17th May 2020 (third phase) with limited relaxation in non-hotspot areas. This strict lockdown has severely cur-tailed human activity across India. Here, aerosol concentrations of particular matters (PM) i.e., PM10, PM2.5, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3) and ozone (O3), and associated temperature fluctuation in four megacities (Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai) from different regions of India were investigated. In this pandemic period, air temperature of Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai has decreased about 3 degrees C, 2.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C and 2 degrees C respectively. Compared to previous years and pre-lockdown period, air pollutants level and aerosol concentration (-41.91%,-37.13%,-54.94% and-46.79% respectively for Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai) in these four megacities has improved drastically during this lockdown period. Emission of PM2.5 has experienced the highest decrease in these megacities, which directly shows the positive impact of restricted vehicular movement. Restricted emissions produce encouraging results in terms of urban air quality and temper-ature, which may encourage policymakers to consider it in terms of environmental sustainability.(c) 2022 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

TI  - Tectonic geomorphology-based modeling reveals dominance of transpression in Taxila and the contiguous region in Pakistan: implications for seismic hazards
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping active tectonic features remains a critical step in understanding earthquake hazards and producing reliable and scientifically robust maps. The mapping is often combined with seismological, geological, geodetic, and structural datasets to improve the overall quality of the maps. However, site response analysis is usually not connected with a typical active tectonic mapping exercise, which is a significant problem in improving earthquake hazard mapping. The motivation of the present study is to demonstrate the robustness of methodology where mapping of active tectonic features is combined with the site response analysis, thus mapping the earthquake sources and the seismic amplification potential of the region. Initially, tectonic geomorphological mapping was done by manually tracing the evidence of faulting, including the topographic breaks, earthquake ruptures, ridge crests, deflected streams, triangular facets, and so on. The cross-cutting relationships between the faults and the Holocene sedimentary deposits differentiate active from inactive fault zones. However, older faults that do not reach the surface can also be active; therefore, to address the limitations, we have combined tectonic geomorphological mapping with the seismological, geological, geodetic, and earthquake centroid moment tensor (CMT) solutions data. The first segment of the study utilizes satellite imagery to produce the best quality tectonic geomorphological maps. The second part of the study evaluates the site response parameters such as fundamental frequency (f(0)), H/V amplitude (A(0)), and soft sediment thickness (H) by acquiring, processing, and interpreting ambient noise data within the urban settlements of Taxila city. The results reveal that the study area is part of the compressional bend formed by the fault interactions between the Tarbela and the Jhelum fault zones. The mapped faults are mainly similar to NE-SW-trending oblique reverse faults that show a component of a sinistral strike-slip sense of movement. Our conceptual modeling illustrated by 3D cartoons shows that fault restraining bend structural configuration explains the unusual topographic highs such as Margala Hills, suggesting significant sinistral strike-slip motion along the mapped faults. The ambient noise data show a variable f(0), A(0) and soft sediment thickness, thus attesting to the site's potential susceptibility to amplification in a significant earthquake, which poses a severe threat to the growing urbanization and population in the region. The findings from the study provide a platform for a detailed analysis of early earthquake hazards and disaster forecasting.

TI  - Innovative approach to lymphadenectomy in breast sarcoma
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymphatic dissemination is thought to be a rare event in breast sarcomas. The decision to perform axillary clearance is challenging. In our prospective cohort, we aimed to evaluate the frequency and factors determining lymph node (LN) involvement in breast sarcomas, with the aim of proposing a decision tree/algorithm for the realization of LN clearance in breast sarcomas. Patients and methods > Fourty-five women were surgically treated for breast sarcomas from 1982 to 2020. Angiosarcomas and other sarcomas were compared in terms of LN involvement, recurrence, and mortality.Results > Twenty-three patients underwent axillary lymphadenectomy. Initial LN involvement was diagnosed in one case of D2-40 positive, primary angiosarcoma for which preoperative imaging detected a suspicious LN confirmed by preoperative histology. Among the 22 patients who had no initial axillary lymphadenectomy, two patients with D2-40 positive angiosarcoma had recurrent cancer in LN (internal mammary group in 1 and homolateral axilla in 1). The average follow-up in the overall population was 6.2 years (+/- 8.3). The cohort's overall recurrence rate was 33% (15/45) and the time of recurrence after initial surgery was on average 2.4 years (+/- 3.1). For the three patients with LN metastases, time to recurrence after surgery was 3.7 years (+/- 4.5). There was no significant difference in the overall recurrence rate depending on whether or not lymphadenec-tomy was initially performed (respectively 26% vs 41% OR = 1.11, P = 0.29). Discussion/Conclusion > Systematic axillary clearance leads to overtreatment in breast sarcomas. A decision tree, including radiological examination of the axilla, histological type of sarcoma, and D2-40 positivity, could be a decision aid in the choice of axillary clearance.

TI  - Misogyny and Gender Role Straight-Jackets: A Psychoanalytic Perspective
T2  - PSYCHOANALYTIC INQUIRY
M3  - Article
AB  - In patriarchal societies, misogyny buttresses a worldview of male superiority, insuring its stability and continuation. Straight-jacketed gender expectations stem from the asymmetrical gender roles and resonate powerfully within the unconscious life of individuals and of their cultures. The subtle or direct enforcement of these gender roles creates a dilemma for both men and women, who are left struggling and confused about the ways in which they may not conform to cultural expectations, while others flaunt their superiority at surpassing the societal norms. I describe three analysands who wrestled with the experiences of rigidly employed gender norms within their families. The misogyny in analysands A and B was eventually understood to be related to aggressive and rigid gender expectations, and to the fantasies about each gender, held by their parents. The prominent internalized misogyny seen in female analysand D was similarly understood.

TI  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) pollution monitoring with sentinel-5P satellite imagery over during the coronavirus pandemic (case study: Tehran)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the economic challenges facing developing countries is the cost of tackling air pollution and improving its quality. In this study, we propose a comparative analysis of the tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) column spatial configuration over Tehran between pandemic conditions and normal conditions, based on the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus Sentinel-5P products. Comparison of the time series of nitrogen dioxide obtained from Sentinel-5P data showed that NO2 levels in 2020 were between 4 x 10(-5) and 6 x 10(-5) mol/m(2), while in 2019 the amount of nitrogen dioxide many times exceeded 6 x 10(-5) mol/m(2). Based on the data obtained from Sentinel-5P, the northern, north-eastern, and central regions of Tehran were registered as the most polluted areas in terms of nitrogen dioxide. The results showed that due to the change of normal conditions in 2019 to quarantine conditions due to coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) in 2020, the density of tropospheric NO2 columns decreased, which is due to the temporary restriction of industrial activities, traffic, and population density. The correlation analysis between ground dataand data from Sentinel-5P provided encouraging values with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.58 (2019) and 0.61 (2020), and the amount of nitrogen dioxide in 2020 decreased by 6% compared to 2019.

TI  - Evaluation of the performance of GaoFen-7 laser altimeter data for ground elevation retrieval over vegetated areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gao Fen-7 (GF-7) satellite employs a laser altimeter to provide the global measurement of ground elevation. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of GF-7 laser altimeter data in ground elevation retrieval over vegetated areas. First, GF-7 waveforms were processed to obtain the ground elevation. Second, we verified the ground elevation accuracy using airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Finally, we analysed the influence of various factors (e.g., slope, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), vegetation height) on ground elevation estimation. Results showed that the lowest Gaussian peak best represents the ground elevation, with root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean error of 2.30 m and 0.28 m, respectively. The laser 1 performs better than laser 2 in ground elevation retrieval as indicated by the lower RMSE. The ground elevation accuracy differed significantly across various land cover types and showed a pattern of lower estimation accuracy with more complex vertical structure. Additionally, results also indicated that the ground elevation accuracy decreased with increasing slope, vegetation height and vegetation coverage but increased with increasing SNR. Overall, our study found that GF-7 laser altimeter data have a strong capability to retrieve the ground elevation over vegetated areas.

TI  - Use of geospatial tools to predict the risk of contamination by SARS-CoV-2 in urban cemeteries
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban cemeteries are increasingly surrounded by areas of high residential density as urbanization continues world-wide. With increasing rates of mortality caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, urban vertical cemeteries are experiencing interments at an unprecedented rate. Corpses interred in the 3rd to 5th layer of vertical urban cemeteries have the potential to contaminate large adjacent regions. The general objective of this manuscript is to analyze the reflectance of altimetry, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) in the urban cemeteries and neighbouring areas of the City of Passo Fundo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. It is assumed that the population residing in the vicinity of these cemeteries may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 contamination through the displacement of microparticles carried by the wind as a corpse is placed in the burial niche or during the first several days of subsequent fluid and gas release through the process of decomposition. The reflectance analyses were performed utilizing Landsat 8 satellite images applied to altimetry, NDVI and LST, for hypothetical examination of possible displacement, transport and subsequent deposition of the SARSCoV-2 virus. The results showed that two cemeteries within the city, cemeteries A and B could potentially transport SARS-CoV-2 of nanometric structure to neighboring residential areas through wind action. These two cemeteries are located at high relative altitudes in more densely populated regions of the city. The NDVI, which has been shown to control the proliferation of contaminants, proved to be insufficient in these areas, contributing to high LST values. Based on the results of this study, the formation and implementation of public policies that monitor urban cemeteries is suggested in areas that utilize vertical urban cemeteries in order to reduce the further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.(c) 2021 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

TI  - Identification of soil type in Pakistan using remote sensing and machine learning
T2  - PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil study plays a significant role in the cultivation of crops. To increase the productivity of any crop, one must know the soil type and properties of that soil. The conventional soil type identification, grid sampling and hydrometer method require expert intervention, more time and extensive laboratory experimentation. Digital soil mapping, while applying remote sensing, offers soil type information and has rapidity, low cost, and spatial resolution advantages. This study proposes a model to identify the soil type using remote sensing data. Spectral data of the Upper Indus Plain of Pakistan Pothwar region and Doabs were acquired using fifteen Landsat eight images dated between June 2020 to August 2020. Bare soil images were obtained to identify the soil type classes Silt Loam, Loam, Sandy Loam, Silty Clay Loam and Clay Loam. Spectral data of band values, reflectance band values, corrective reflectance band values and vegetation indices are practiced studying the reflectance factor of soil type. Regarding multi-class classification, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine are two popular techniques used in the research community. In the present work, we used these two techniques aided with Logistic Model Tree with 10-fold cross-validation. The classification with the best performance is achieved using the spectral data, with an overall accuracy of 86.61% and 84.41% for the Random Forest and Logistic Model Tree classification, respectively. These results may be applied for crop cultivation in specific areas and assist decision-makers in better agricultural planning.

TI  - Laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery for early gastric cancer: Perspective for actual practice
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Early gastric cancer (EGC) has a desirable prognosis compared with advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The surgical concept of EGC has altered from simply emphasizing radical resection to both radical resection and functional preservation. As the mainstream surgical methods for EGC, both endoscopic resection and laparoscopic resection have certain inherent limitations, while the advent of laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) has overcome these limitations to a considerable extent. LECS not only expands the surgical indications for endoscopic resection, but greatly improves the quality of life (QOL) in EGC patients. This minireview elaborates on the research status of LECS for EGC, from the conception and development of LECS, to the tentative application of LECS in animal experiments, then to case reports and retrospective clinical studies. Finally, the challenges and prospects of LECS in the field of EGC are prospected and expounded, hoping to provide some references for relevant researchers. With the in-depth understanding of minimally invasive technology, LECS remains a promising option in the management of EGC. Carrying out more related multicenter prospective clinical researches is the top priority of promoting the development of this field in the future.

TI  - Identification of soybean based on Sentinel-1/2 SAR and MSI imagery under a complex planting structure
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soybeans, as the major global oil seed crops, are among the large-scale agricultural products imported into China. In this way, the accurate identification of their growing areas is the basis for agricultural decision-making and planting structure adjustment, which are of great significance to the national food security. Currently, there is insufficient research on the identification of soybean, using remote sensing, under complex agricultural planting structures. In this paper, Guoyang County, a typical soybean-producing region in the north of Anhui Province, China, was selected as the study area, and then the multi-temporal Sentinel-1/2 (S-1/2) microwave and optical multispectral data were integrated to obtain the spatial distribution of the planting areas, via a stepwise hierarchical extraction strategy. Considering the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance, August 18 (i.e., the early pod setting stage) was correspondingly determined as more appropriate for soybean extraction, compared with other time phases. For this purpose, a set of rules were established to eliminate the non-cropland pixels, and the total distribution of the field vegetation was derived accordingly. In total, 30 candidate features (viz. 10 spectral bands, 11 vegetation indices, 4 texture features, and 5 microwave polarization features) were selected, and their importance was evaluated based on the ReliefF algorithm. With the support of the typical cover type samples, the weight assessment method for the ReliefF feature was further bundled with three machine-learning (ML) algo-rithms, namely, the random forest (RF), the back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and the support vector machine (SVM), to single out the optimum subset of the features for soybean identification. The results finally revealed that the ReliefF-RF model outperformed the other two. With nine optimum features, Kappa coefficient also reached up to 0.77-0.85. Furthermore, the extraction accuracy produced by the optimum subset of the features was significantly greater than the original 10 spectral bands (Kappa coefficient of 0.75-0.84), albeit slightly lower than the effect of the total 30 features (Kappa coefficient of 0.78-0.85).

TI  - Validation, analysis, and comparison of MISR V23 aerosol optical depth products with MODIS and AERONET observations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The latest Multi-angle Imaging Spectro Radiometer (MISR) Version (V) 23 aerosol optical depth (AOD) products were released, with an improved spatial resolution of 4.4 km, providing an unprecedented opportunity for the refined regional application. To ensure the reliability of their applications and build a scientific reference for the further optimization, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive evaluation, especially for the unique size-resolved AOD products: small-size AOD (AOD(S), representing the contribution of fine-mode aerosols), medium-size AOD (AOD(M)), and large-size AOD (AODL), and AOD(M+L) represents the AOD part of coarse-mode aerosols. AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection (C) 6.1 aerosol products from 2001 to 2020 are utilized for the validation, analysis, and inter-comparison, considering three spatial scales and four key factors. In general, MISR V23 aerosol products show a good accuracy compared with AERONET. The best performance for all AOD products appears in forest units (the highest R similar to 0.93, data percentage within Expected Error bounds, %EE > 93), related to the inactive human activity and dark underlying surface. Dependences of retrieval deviations illustrate that the performance of MISR AOD deteriorates as aerosol loading increases. Namely, with the increase of aerosols, total AOD (AOD(T)) and AOD(S) show increasing negative deviations, while increasing positive deviations are observed for AOD(M+L). This suggests that the Empirical Orthogonal Functions do not perform well in this situation, since numerous aerosol particles can obstruct the underlying reflection and reduce the surface spectral contrast. In addition, AOD(T) and AOD(S) often exhibit anomalous positive deviations in areas with low vegetation cover, such as deserts, revealing that MISR will overestimate aerosol content over bright surfaces and in environments dominated by coarse-mode particles. The above findings not only deepen the understanding of MISR aerosols products from multiple perspectives, but also provide useful information for the product improvement.

TI  - The association between wind speed and the risk of injuries among preschool children: New insight from a sentinel-surveillance-based study
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Injuries among preschool children are an important public health concern worldwide. Significant gaps remain in understanding the potential impact of wind speed on injuries among preschoolers. We aimed to clarify the association and its variation across subgroups to capture the vulnerability features.Methods: Using a case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression model, we compared the exposure to wind speed right before the injury events (case period) with that of control periods to determine the excess rate (ER) of in-jury on each of 0-3 lag days in Guangzhou, 2016-2020.Results were also stratified by sociodemographic characteris-tics of patients, basic characteristics of injury events, and clinical features of injuries to identify the most vulnerable subgroups of preschoolers. Results: Higher wind speed was significantly associated with an increased risk of injuries among preschoolers on lag 0, reaching an ER of 2.93 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.87, 5.03), but not on other lag days. The results of the stratified analyses showed that children under 3-year-old (3.41 %; 95 % CI = 0.36, 6.55), boys (3.66 %; 95 % CI = 1.04, 6.35), and non-locally registered children (3.65; 95 % CI = 0.02, 7.40) were more prone to wind-related injuries. Falls (2.67 %; 95 % CI = 0.11, 5.30) were the main cause of wind-related injuries, and taking transportation was the main activity when injuries occurred (13.16 %; 95 % CI = 4.45, 22.60). Additionally, injuries involving build-ings/grounds/obstacles (4.69 %; 95 % CI = 1.66, 7.81) and the occurrence of sprain/strain (7.60 %; 95 % CI = 0.64, 15.04) showed a positive association with wind speed.Conclusions: Higher wind speed was associated with a significantly elevated rate of injuries among preschoolers with-out delayed effects, where children under 3-year-old, boys, and non-locally registered subgroups were more suscepti-ble to wind-related injuries. This study may provide new insights for refining the prevention measures against wind -related injuries among preschoolers.

TI  - A Critique of the Philosophical Presuppositions of Cognitive Psychology
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES IN CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the historical interaction of science and philosophy, empirical science has used cumulative research to shed new light on how the science of philosophy understands fundamental scientific issues. As an effort of self-renewal, the initial impetus for the birth of cognitive science was dialogue among disciplines, with a view to making it possible to unlock the mysteries of cognition. In other words, cognitive science was to pave the way for fundamentally updating the philosophical premises of the science of mind or even making possible a new scientific worldview. As a branch of cognitive science, psychology was to have contributed to the renovation of the ontological, methodological and scientific worldview of cognitive science through its unique interpretation of human nature. However, in the course of the development of cognitive science and psychology, psychology has failed to employ its disciplinary endeavors to renew the ontology, methodology and values of the philosophical foundations of cognitive science, and has also failed to contribute to the promotion of cognitive science. On the contrary, cognitive science's mechanistic worldview and positivist methodology are the sole determinants of the background of cognitive science that shapes psychology's model of development-that is, cognitive psychology (if one sees cognitive psychology as a concrete manifestation of the interaction of cognitive science and psychology). This study examines cognitive psychology's ontological, methodological and value presuppositions and scientific worldview and reflects on the blind and passive nature of the discipline's development. Moreover, from a history of science perspective, it considers how the development of this discipline can contribute to the renewal of scientific concepts in the philosophy of science through the interaction of the mature natural sciences and philosophy and thence provide possibilities for handling the relationship between psychology and philosophy in psychology's future development.

TI  - Manipulation and generation of synthetic satellite images using deep learning models
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Generation and manipulation of digital images based on deep learning (DL) are receiving increasing attention for both benign and malevolent uses. As the importance of satellite imagery is increasing, DL has started being used also for the generation of synthetic satellite images. However, the direct use of techniques developed for computer vision applications is not possible, due to the different nature of satellite images. The goal of our work is to describe a number of methods to generate manipulated and synthetic satellite images. To be specific, we focus on two different types of manipulations: full image modification and local splicing. In the former case, we rely on generative adversarial networks commonly used for style transfer applications, adapting them to implement two different kinds of transfer: (i) land cover transfer, aiming at modifying the image content from vegetation to barren and vice versa and (ii) season transfer, aiming at modifying the image content from winter to summer and vice versa. With regard to local splicing, we present two different architectures. The first one uses image generative pretrained transformer and is trained on pixel sequences in order to predict pixels in semantically consistent regions identified using watershed segmentation. The second technique uses a vision transformer operating on image patches rather than on a pixel by pixel basis. We use the trained vision transformer to generate synthetic image segments and splice them into a selected region of the to-be-manipulated image. All the proposed methods generate highly realistic, synthetic, and satellite images. Among the possible applications of the proposed techniques, we mention the generation of proper datasets for the evaluation and training of tools for the analysis of satellite images.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variation of Land Surface Temperature Retrieved from FY-3D MERSI-II Data in Pakistan
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of land surface temperature (LST) encompasses both surface energy balance and land surface activities. The study of climate change greatly benefits from an understanding of the geographical and temporal fluctuations of LST. In this study, we utilized an improved version of the TFSW algorithm to retrieve the LST from the Medium resolution spectral imager II (MERSI-II) data for the first time in Pakistan. MERSI-II is a payload for the Chinese meteorological satellite Fengyun 3D (FY-3D), and it has the capability for use in various remote sensing applications such as climate change and drought monitoring, with higher spatial and temporal resolutions. Once the LSTs were retrieved, accuracy of the LSTs were investigated. Later, LST datasets were used to detect the spatiotemporal variations of LST in Pakistan. Monthly, seasonal, and annual datasets were utilized to detect increasing and decreasing LST trends in the regions, with Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope estimator tool. In addition, we further revealed the long-term spatiotemporal variations of LST by utilizing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) LST observations. The cross-validation analysis shows that the retrieved LST of MERSI-II was more consistent with the MODIS MYD11A1 LST product compared to the MYD21A1. The spatial distribution of LSTs demonstrates that the mean LST exhibits a pattern of spatial variability, with high values in the southern areas and low values in the northern areas; there are areas that do not follow this trend, possibly due to reasons of elevation and types of land cover also influencing the LST's spatial distribution. The annual mean LST trend increases in the northern regions and decreases in the southern regions, ranging between -0.013 and 0.019 degrees C/year. The trend of long-term analysis were also consistent with MERSI-II, excepting region II, with increasing effects. This study will be helpful for various environmental and climate change studies.

TI  - Methodology for Lidar Monitoring of Biomass Burning Smoke in Connection with the Land Cover
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lidar measurements of 11 smoke layers recorded at Magurele, Romania, in 2014, 2016, and 2017 are analyzed in conjunction with the vegetation type of the burned biomass area. For the identified aerosol pollution layers, the mean optical properties and the intensive parameters in the layers are computed. The origination of the smoke is estimated by the means of the HYSPLIT dispersion model, taking into account the location of the fires and the injection height for each fire. Consequently, for each fire location, the associated land cover type is acquired by satellite-derived land cover products. We explore the relationship between the measured intensive parameters of the smoke layers and the respective land cover of the burned area. The vegetation type for the cases we analyzed was either broadleaf crops or grasses/cereals. Overall, the intensive parameters are similar for the two types, which can be associated with the fact that both types belong to the broader group of agricultural crops. For the cases analyzed, the smoke travel time corresponding to the effective predominant vegetation type is up to 2.4 days.

TI  - Population decline of Gulf pipefish (<i>Syngnathus scovelli</i>) in a subtropical estuary: ecosystem changes and habitat loss
T2  - MARINE BIODIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal lagoons and other estuarine habitats are increasingly exposed to the negative effects of growing human populations with associated intensifications in nutrient loading, harmful algal blooms, pollution, and habitat degradation. We examined population dynamics of Gulf pipefish Syngnathus scovelli in estuarine waters of the Indian River Lagoon, on the Atlantic coast of Florida. Substantial declines in abundance of this sentinel species were concurrent with significant losses of seagrass habitat associated with ongoing harmful algal blooms, and other perturbations during the study period spanning from 1998 to 2018. Moderate declines in S. scovelli were observed with early downward trends in seagrasses ahead of the onset of the precipitous seagrass reductions observed. The massive decline of seagrass habitats in the Indian River Lagoon in recent years had negative influences and was directly linked to population declines we observed in the S. scovelli population. Lack of seagrass habitat essential to this and related syngnathid species may reduce optimum seagrass-associated prey, increase predation by lack of appropriate cover, and increase energetic costs which may be realized through reduced growth rates and potential reproductive impairment. Identification and monitoring of population trends of S. scovelli and related sentinel fish species allow for early implementation of management actions that reduce the impact of anthropogenic pressures on the services that estuarine systems provide to the fishes and fisheries they support.

TI  - Natural Enemies and Biological Control of Stink Bugs (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) in North America
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Stink bugs are important pests of many crops in the US, including row crops, vegetables, and tree fruits and nuts. Most stink bug management relies on broad-spectrum, disruptive insecticides with high human and environmental risks associated with them. These issues and increasing pesticide resistance in stink bugs are forcing pest managers to explore safer and more sustainable options. Here, we review the natural enemies of stink bugs in the US, noting that the egg and the late nymphal and adult stages of stink bugs are the most commonly attacked by parasitoids, whereas eggs and young nymphs are the stages most commonly attacked by predators. The effectiveness of stink bugs' natural enemies varies widely with stink bug species and habitats, influencing the biological control of stink bugs across crops. Historically, biological control of stink bugs has focused on the introduction of exotic natural enemies against exotic stink bugs. Conservation and augmentation methods of biological control have received less attention in the US, although there may be good opportunities to utilize these approaches. We identify some considerations for the current and future use of biological control for stink bugs, including the potential for area-wide management approaches.

TI  - Flood Inundation Modeling by Integrating HEC-RAS and Satellite Imagery: A Case Study of the Indus River Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are brutal, catastrophic natural hazards which affect most human beings in terms of economy and life loss, especially in the large river basins worldwide. The Indus River basin is considered as one of the world's large river basins, comprising several major tributaries, and has experienced severe floods in its history. There is currently no proper early flood warning system for the Indus River which can help administrative authorities cope with such natural hazards. Hence, it is necessary to develop an early flood warning system by integrating a hydrodynamic model, in situ information, and satellite imagery. This study used Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) to predict river dynamics under extreme flow events and inundation modeling. The calibration and validation of the HEC-RAS v5 model was performed for 2010 and 2015 flood events, respectively. Manning's roughness coefficient (n) values were extracted using the land use information of the rivers and floodplains. Multiple combinations of n values were used and optimized in the simulation process for the rivers and floodplains. The Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD09A1, and MOD09GA products were used in the analysis. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI1 (MNDWI1), and MNDWI2, were applied for the delineation of water bodies, and the output of all indices were blended to produce standard flood maps for accurate assessment of the HEC-RAS-based simulated flood extent. The optimized n values for rivers and floodplains were 0.055 and 0.06, respectively, with significant satisfaction of statistical parameters, indicating good agreement between simulated and observed flood extents. The HEC-RAS v5 model integrated with satellite imagery can be further used for early flood warnings in the central part of the Indus River basin.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aras Dam Lake is a strategic aquatic ecosystem in Iran and there are reports of toxic phytoplankton blooms in this reservoir. This study was performed to determine the effect of meteorological variables on the formation and expansion of toxic phytoplankton communities in Aras dam reservoir. The data of this project have been obtained using field studies and satellite data (MODIS and Sentinel-2). Sampling to determine the composition of phytoplankton communities in the area was carried out seasonally in two time periods from 2003 to 2014, and environmental assessments were also performed based on meteorological and satellite data over an 18-year period (2003-2020). The Chlorophyll-a content was obtained from MODIS and correlated with meteorological data. The statistical analysis showed that the highest coefficient of determination is related to the correlation of chlorophyll-a and Evaporation (R-2 =0.86). Also, the relative root mean square error is equal to 18%, 18.1% and 21.2% for the chlorophyll-a -SST, chlorophyll-a -wind and chlorophyll-a -Evaporation relations, respectively. Moreover, in a supplementary study, correlation between the chlorophyll-a content with selected meteorological variables including evaporation, wind speed and water surface temperature were investigated seasonally. The results showed that the trend of changes in chlorophyll-a content with three considered variables are parabolic functions and chlorophyll-a-Evp (R-2 =0.86, MAPE =15.2%) model indicates better performance. The results also showed that the eutrophication rate of the reservoir during lockdown period increased in comparison with the same time at pre-pandemic period, which can be related to increase of incoming waste loads in this reservoir.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 restrictions on air quality and surface urban heat island effect within the main urban area of Urumqi, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus in 2019 (COVID-19) posed a serious global threat. However, the reduction in man-made pollutants during COVID-19 restrictions did improve the ecological environment of cities. Using multi-source remote sensing data, this study explored the spatiotemporal variations in air pollutant concentrations during the epidemic prevention and control period in Urumqi and quantitatively analyzed the impact of different air pollutants on the surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) within the study area. Urumqi, located in the hinterland of the Eurasian continent, northwest of China, in the central and northern part of Xinjiang was selected as the study area. The results showed that during COVID-19 restrictions, concentrations of air pollutants decreased in the main urban area of Urumqi, and air quality improved. The most evident decrease in NO2 concentration, by 77 +/- 1.05% and 15 +/- 0.98%, occurred in the middle of the first (January 25 to March 20, 2020) and second (July 21 to September 1, 2020) COVID-19 restriction periods, respectively, compared with the corresponding period in 2019. Air pollutant concentrations and the SUHIIs were significantly and positively correlated, and NO2 exhibited the strongest correlation with the SUHIIs. We revealed that variations in the air quality characteristics and thermal environment were observed in the study area during the COVID-19 restrictions, and their quantitative relationship provides a theoretical basis and reference value for improving the air and ecological environment quality within the study area.

TI  - Spatial Gap-Filling of GK2A Daily Sea Surface Temperature (SST) around the Korean Peninsula Using Meteorological Data and Regression Residual Kriging (RRK)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing can measure large ocean surface areas, but the infrared-based sea surface temperature (SST) might not be correctly calculated for the pixels under clouds, resulting in missing values in satellite images. Early studies for the gap-free raster maps of satellite SST were based on spatial interpolation using in situ measurements. In this paper, however, an alternative spatial gap-filling method using regression residual kriging (RRK) for the Geostationary Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-2A (GK2A) daily SST was examined for the seas around the Korean Peninsula. Extreme outliers were first removed from the in situ measurements and the GK2A daily SST images using multi-step statistical procedures. For the pixels on the in situ measurements after the quality control, a multiple linear regression (MLR) model was built using the selected meteorological variables such as daily SST climatology value, specific humidity, and maximum wind speed. The irregular point residuals from the MLR model were transformed into a residual grid by optimized kriging for the residual compensation for the MLR estimation of the null pixels. The RRK residual compensation method improved accuracy considerably compared with the in situ measurements. The gap-filled 18,876 pixels showed the mean bias error (MBE) of -0.001 degrees C, the mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.315 degrees C, the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.550 degrees C, and the correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.994. The case studies made sure that the gap-filled SST with RRK had very similar values to the in situ measurements to those of the MLR-only method. This was more apparent in the typhoon case: our RRK result was also stable under the influence of typhoons because it can cope with the abrupt changes in marine meteorology.

TI  - Eddy Induced Cross-Shelf Exchanges in the Black Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cross-shelf exchanges in the Black Sea were investigated using remote sensing data and an ocean circulation model to which an eddy-tracking algorithm and Lagrangian particle tracking model was applied. An anticyclonic eddy in 1998 and a cyclonic eddy in 2000 were investigated in detail. Eddy-induced cross-shelf transport of low salinity and high Chl-a waters reached a maximum in the presence of filaments associated with these eddies. The daily mean volume transport by the eddies was comparable with the previously documented transport by eddies of similar size in the north-western shelf region. Lagrangian particle tracking results showed that 59% of particles initially released over the shelf were transported offshore within 30 days by the 1998 anticyclone and 27% by the 2000 cyclone. The net volume transport across the Black Sea shelf-break reached the maxima in winter, coinciding with the increase in wind stress curl and mean kinetic energy that is a measure of the intensity of the boundary current. Ekman transport directly influences the cross-shelf exchanges in the surface layer. The south-eastern Black Sea is presented as an important area for cross-shelf transport. The total cross-shelf transport can be divided into its "large-scale" and "eddy-induced" components. Eddy-induced transport was 34% and 37% of the total cross-shelf transport (1998-2014) in the Black Sea in the off-shelf and on-shelf directions, respectively, but these values ranged between 25% and 65% depending on the eddy activity over time.

TI  - Banana Mapping in Heterogenous Smallholder Farming Systems Using High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery and Machine Learning Models with Implications for Banana Bunchy Top Disease Surveillance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Banana (and plantain, Musa spp.), in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), is predominantly grown as a mixed crop by smallholder farmers in backyards and small farmlands, typically ranging from 0.2 ha to 3 ha. The crop is affected by several pests and diseases, including the invasive banana bunchy top virus (BBTV, genus Babuvirus), which is emerging as a major threat to banana production in SSA. The BBTV outbreak in West Africa was first recorded in the Benin Republic in 2010 and has spread to the adjoining territories of Nigeria and Togo. Regular surveillance, conducted as part of the containment efforts, requires the identification of banana fields for disease assessment. However, small and fragmented production spread across large areas poses complications for identifying all banana farms using conventional field survey methods, which is also time-consuming and expensive. In this study, we developed a remote sensing approach and machine learning (ML) models that can be used to identify banana fields for targeted BBTV surveillance. We used medium-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Sentinel 2A satellite imagery, and high-resolution RGB and multispectral aerial imagery from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to develop an operational banana mapping framework by combining the UAV, SAR, and Sentinel 2A data with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithms. The ML algorithms performed comparatively well in classifying the land cover, with a mean overall accuracy (OA) of about 93% and a Kappa coefficient (KC) of 0.89 for the UAV data. The model using fused SAR and Sentinel 2A data gave an OA of 90% and KC of 0.86. The user accuracy (UA) and producer accuracy (PA) for the banana class were 83% and 78%, respectively. The BBTV surveillance teams used the banana mapping framework to identify banana fields in the BBTV-affected southwest Ogun state of Nigeria, which helped in detecting 17 sites with BBTV infection. These findings suggest that the prediction of banana and other crops in the heterogeneous smallholder farming systems is feasible, with the precision necessary to guide BBTV surveillance in large areas in SSA.

TI  - Desertification prediction with an integrated 3D convolutional neural network and cellular automata in Al-Muthanna, Iraq
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is a major environmental issue all over the world, and Al-Khidhir district, Al-Muthanna, in the south of Iraq is no exception. In mapping, assessing, and predicting desertification, remote sensing and geospatial solutions (spatial analysis, machine learning) are crucial. During 1998-2018, this study employed satellite images from Landsat TM, ETM +, and OLI to map and predict desertification in the Al-Khidhir district. The year 2028 was chosen as the target date. Prediction models were constructed using a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) and cellular automata (CA) techniques. In addition to the historical land cover maps, the model incorporated desertification indicators identified as important in the study, including geology, soil type, distance from waterways, elevation, population density, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Several accuracy metrics were used to evaluate the models, including overall accuracy (OA), average accuracy (AA), and the Kappa index (K). The simulated and actual land cover maps from 1998 and 2008 were used to evaluate the desertification prediction models. The 3D CNN model outperforms the typical 2D CNN for both the 2008 and 2018 images, according to the results. For the 2008 image, the 3D CNN model achieved 89.675 OA, 69.946 AA, and 0.781 K, while the 2018 image achieved 91.494 OA, 75.138 AA, and 0.770 K. The 2D CNN model performed a little worse than the 3D CNN model. The results of the change assessment showed that between 1998 and 2008, agricultural land was the dominant class (39%, 47.4%, respectively). The bare land, however, was the most dominant class in 2018, accounting for 46.6% of the total, compared to 26.2% for agricultural land. The spatial distribution characteristics of desertification in the Al-Khidhir, in the year 1998, were prevalent in the area's south (25.9%). In the following 10 years, desertification has spread to the surrounding territories. In the year 2008, desertification increased in the north of the study area (50.8%). Unless the local administration of Al-Khidhir district establishes desertification control strategies, this study suggests that the extent of bare land could expand in 2028 (54.1%).

TI  - Vegetation Monitoring and Post-Fire Recovery: A Case Study in the Centre Inland of Portugal
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are a major environmental issue that have an impact on land degradation. Remote sensing spectral indices provide valuable information for short-term mitigation and rehabilitation after wildfires. A study area in the Centre inland of Portugal occupied with Maritime pine and Eucalypts forests and affected by wildfires in 2003, 2017 and 2020 was used. The aims of the study were twofold: (1) to compute the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and with forest inventory data derivate a Maritime pine production model, differentiate evergreen coniferous forests (e.g., Maritime pine), evergreen broadleaved forests (e.g., Eucalypts), and shrubland, and monitor vegetation and its post-fire recovery; and (2) to compute the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) difference between pre-fire and post-fire dates for burn severity levels assessment. The plots of a previous forest inventory were used to follow the NDVI values in 2007 and from 2020 to 2022. An aerial coverage in 2007 and the Sentinel-2 imagery in 2020-2022 were used. Linear models fitted maritime pine production with the transformed NDVI by age, showing a fitting efficiency of 60%. The stratification of cover types by stand development stage and fire occurrence was possible using the NDVI time curve, which also showed the impact of fire and of low precipitation. Cover types were ranked by decreasing NDVI values as follows: mature Eucalypts plantations, young Maritime pine regeneration, mature Maritime pine, young Eucalypts plantations, Strawberry tree shrubland, Eucalypts plantations post-fire, Maritime pine post-fire, tall shrubland, and short shrubland. Vegetation post-fire recovery was lower in higher burn severity level areas. Maritime pine areas have lost their natural regeneration capability due to the wildfires' short cycles. Spectral indices were effective tools to differentiate cover types and assist in the evaluation of forest and shrubland conditions.

TI  - Monitoring and Mapping Vegetation Cover Changes in Arid and Semi-Arid Areas Using Remote Sensing Technology: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Vegetation cover change is one of the key indicators used for monitoring environmental quality. It can accurately reflect changes in hydrology, climate, and human activities, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. The main goal of this paper is to review the remote sensing satellite sensors and the methods used for monitoring and mapping vegetation cover changes in arid and semi-arid. Arid and semi-arid lands are eco-sensitive environments with limited water resources and vegetation cover. Monitoring vegetation changes are especially important in arid and semi-arid regions due to the scarce and sensitive nature of the plant cover. Due to expected changes in vegetation cover, land productivity and biodiversity might be affected. Thus, early detection of vegetation cover changes and the assessment of their extent and severity at the local and regional scales become very important in preventing future biodiversity loss. Remote sensing data are useful for monitoring and mapping vegetation cover changes and have been used extensively for identifying, assessing, and mapping such changes in different regions. Remote sensing data, such as satellite images, can be obtained from satellite-based and aircraft-based sensors to monitor and detect vegetation cover changes. By combining remotely sensed images, e.g., from satellites and aircraft, with ground truth data, it is possible to improve the accuracy of monitoring and mapping techniques. Additionally, satellite imagery data combined with ancillary data such as slope, elevation, aspect, water bodies, and soil characteristics can detect vegetation cover changes at the species level. Using analytical methods, the data can then be used to derive vegetation indices for mapping and monitoring vegetation.

TI  - Comparison of Freshwater Mussels <i>Unio tumidus</i> and <i>Unio crassus</i> as Biomonitors of Microplastic Contamination of Tisza River (Hungary)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Unio crassus and Unio tumidus mussels were collected at four sampling sites in the Tisza River (Hungary) to investigate their applicability as sentinel species for the biomonitoring of microplastic contamination. Since mussels, as filter feeders, are able to ingest particles only below a physically defined size, it was expected that their sentinel role in rivers is restricted to small particles, including fibers or microfibers. This assumption was confirmed by our results, as fibers were detected as the dominant particles in all the 80 mussel samples investigated. The length and diameter of the fibers changed in the size range of 20-1000 mu m and 10-75 mu m, respectively. The number of fibers in the individuals originating from the same sampling site was nearly two times higher in Unio tumidus than in Unio crassus and amounted to 2.7-4.9 and 5.2-8.3 items/individual. The fiber/g soft tissue ratio between these species could be characterized by a factor of three. After applying Raman spectrometry, mostly indigo-dyed polyethylene terephthalate and cellulose-based fibers, as well as a few larger (200 um) polyamide fragments, were identified. The microplastic particles stored temporarily by mussels provide only restricted qualitative information on the microplastic load of the Tisza River, and as our observations confirmed, the sampling efficiency of these 'living sampling devices' is highly species-specific.

TI  - Comparison of Accelerated Versions of the Iterative Gradient Method to Ameliorate the Spatial Resolution of Microwave Radiometer Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the enhancement of the spatial resolution of microwave radiometer measurements is addressed by contrasting the accuracy of a gradient-like antenna pattern deconvolution method with its accelerated versions. The latter are methods that allow reaching a given accuracy with a reduced number of iterations. The analysis points out that accelerated methods result in improved performance when dealing with spot-like discontinuities; while they perform in a similar way to the canonical gradient method in case of large discontinuities. A key application of such techniques is the research on global warming and climate change, which has recently gained critical importance in many scientific fields, mainly due to the huge societal and economic impact of such topics over the entire planet. In this context, the availability of reliable long time series of remotely sensed Earth data is of paramount importance to identify and study climate trends. Such data can be obtained by large-scale sensors, with the obvious drawback of a poor spatial resolution that strongly limits their applicability in regional studies. Iterative gradient techniques allow obtaining super-resolution gridded passive microwave products that can be used in long time series of consistently calibrated brightness temperature maps in support of climate studies.

TI  - Land Use Land Cover Change Analysis for Urban Growth Prediction Using Landsat Satellite Data and Markov Chain Model for Al Baha Region Saudi Arabia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use Land Cover Change (LULCC) and urban growth prediction and analysis are two of the best methods that can help decision-makers for better sustainable management and planning of socioeconomic development in the countries. In the present paper, the growth of urban land use was analyzed and predicted in all districts of the El Baha region (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) based on high-resolution Landsat, 5, 7, and 8 satellite imagery during the period of study between 1985-2021. Using remote sensing techniques, the LULCC were obtained based on the maximum likelihood classification (MLC), where the geographic information system (GIS) had been used for mapping LULCC classes. Furthermore, Markov cellular automata (MCA) in Idrisi TerrSet was applied for assessing the future growth of urban land use between 2021-2047. The findings of the LULCC analysis based on the MLC indicate great socioeconomic development during the study period and that the urban expansion was at the expense of rangeland, forest and shrubland, and barren land and sand areas, with the contribution of each in the built-up area estimated to be around 9.1% (179.7 km(2)), 33.4% (656.3 km(2)) and 57.5% (1131.5 km(2)), respectively. The simulation of the future LULCC period 2021-2047 revealed a loss in rangeland, forest and shrubland, and barren land and sand by 565, 144 and 105 km(2), respectively, where rangeland is the most influenced, its land cover will decrease from 4002 to 3437 km(2). From the obtained results based on MCA, urban growth is predicted to be large and it is estimated at around 2607 km(2) until the year 2047 with a net increase of 811 km(2). The results obtained from this study may provide information to help decision-makers to implement efficient practices for future planning and management of the growth of urban land use, especially Saudi vision 2030.

TI  - Assessing the niche of <i>Rhododendron arboreum</i> using entropy and machine learning algorithms: role of atmospheric, ecological, and hydrological variables
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Species distribution models (SDMs) have been used extensively in the field of landscape ecology and conservation biology since its origin in the late 1980s. But there is still a void for a universal modeling approach for SDMs. With recent advancements in satellite data and machine learning algorithms, the prediction of species occurrence is more accurate and realistic. Presently, four machine learning and regression-based algorithms, namely, generalized linear model, maximum entropy, boosted regression tree, and random forest (RF) are used to model the geographical distribution of Rhododendron arboreum, which is economically and medicinally important species found in the fragile ecosystem of Himalayas. To establish complex relation between the occurrence data and regional climatic and land use parameters, several satellite products, namely, MODIS, Sentinel-5p, GPM, ECOSTRESS, and shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM), are acquired and used as predictor variables to the different SDM algorithms. The performance evaluation has been conducted using the area under curve (AUC), which showed the best result for Maxent (AUC = 0.871) and poor result was observed for RF (AUC = 0.755) among all. The overall prediction confirmed the distribution of Rhododendron arboreum in the mid to high altitudes of central and southern parts of the Garhwal Division. We provide crucial evidence that combining multisatellite products using machine learning algorithms can provide a much better understanding of species distribution that can eventually help the researchers and policymakers to take the necessary step toward its conservation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data on tropospheric methane and dynamical permafrost model simulations were used to analyze the methane emission in the subaquatic permafrost on the East Siberian Arctic shelf. The hypothesis of potential methane release from the dissociation of submarine gas hydrates was studied. It was demonstrated that the methane emission on the Arctic shelf is governed mainly by geological factors and is not related to contemporary climate change. Numerical experiments with the INM-CM48 Earth system model showed that there is no feedback between the methane emission on the shelf and global air temperature. A conceptual model of methane emission on the East Siberian Arctic shelf was developed.

AB  - Method for determination of tealeaf plucking date with cumulative air temperature and Photosynthetically Active Radiation: PAR which is provided by the remote sensing satellites: Terra/MODIS and Aqua/MODIS is proposed. Also, a confirmation of thermal environment at the intensive study tea farm areas with Landsat-9 TIR (Thermal Infrared) image is conducted. Through a regressive analysis between the harvested tealeaf quality and the cumulative air temperature and PAR at the intensive study areas, it is found that there is a highly reliable relation between both. Also, an importance of air temperature environment at the sites is confirmed with Landsat-9 TIR image.

M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence is a phenomenon that can exacerbate the impacts of tidal floods in coastal areas, such as disrupting citizen activities, and submerging settlements and public facilities. Therefore, research on tidal floods and their relation to land subsidence was widely studied in coastal areas of Indonesia. However, this study has not yet been carried out in the Pontianak, a dense urban area located in the Kapuas River Delta, West Kalimantan Province. This study aims to analyze the impacts of land subsidence on tidal floods in the city for disaster mitigation and long-term urban planning. We calculated the land subsidence by applying the DInSAR technique to Sentinel-1A imagery. Then, tidal floods were simulated by integrating the DELFT3D hydrodynamic and HEC-RAS hydraulic models. The results showed that the output water level of the DELFT3D model has good agreement with the observation data, which the Nash Sutcliffe Model Efficiency Coefficient (NSE) is 0.83. Furthermore, the maximum land subsidence in Pontianak is +/- 1.03 cm/year, where the highest subsidence (between 0.48 -1.03 cm/year) covers about 28.54% of the total area. Our results showed that shallow inundated areas (water depth less than 0.5 meters) decreased by 23.6%, while deep inundated areas (water depth more than 0.5 meters) increased by 16.9% over the next 50 -year. Overall, the depth of the tidal floods within Pontianak that occur in the future will increase by 0.03-0.4 meters and varied in across locations. These analysis results can guide the local water manager in designing a mitigation plan.

TI  - Declining Basal Motion Dominates the Long-Term Slowing of Athabasca Glacier, Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, glaciers are shrinking in response to climate change, with implications for global sea level rise as well as downstream ecosystems and water resources. Sliding at the ice-bed interface (basal motion) provides a mechanism for glaciers to respond rapidly to climate change. While the short-term dynamics of glacier basal motion (<10 years) have received substantial attention, little is known about how basal motion and its sensitivity to subglacial hydrology changes over long (>50 year) timescales-this knowledge is required for accurate prediction of future glacier change. We compare historical data with modern estimates from field and satellite data at Athabasca Glacier and show that the glacier thinned by 60 m (-21%) over 1961-2020. However, a concurrent increase in surface slope results in minimal change in the average driving stress (-6 kPa and -4%). These geometric changes coincide with relatively uniform slowing (-15 m a(-1) and -45%). Simplified ice modeling suggests that declining basal motion accounts for most of this slow down (91% on average and 46% at minimum). A decline in basal motion can be explained by increasing basal friction resulting from geometric change in addition to increasing meltwater flux through a more efficient subglacial hydrologic system. These results highlight the need to include time-varying dynamics of basal motion in glacier models and analyses. If these findings are generalizable, they suggest that declining basal motion reduces the flux of ice to lower elevations, helping to mitigate glacier mass loss in a warming climate.

TI  - A new phenology-based method for mapping wheat and barley using time-series of Sentinel-2 images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, various techniques have been developed to generate crop-type maps based on remote sensing data. Wheat and barley are two major cereal crops cultivated as the first and fourth largest grain crops across the globe. The variations in spectral temporal profile of both crops are generally insignificant at small scales and therefore the two crops are phenologically fairly clearly separated; however, at large scale areas the variance of phenological parameters increases for both crops due to the effects of various climatic and orographic factors which adversely influences discrimination of wheat and barley. Additionally, wheat and barley are usually cultivated as both spring and winter or early and late season crops in some areas, making it more difficult to distinguish them. Therefore, developing a new method based on remote sensing data for effective discrimination of wheat and barley is an important necessity in the field of precision agriculture. To this end, this research presents a new phenology-based method to discriminate barley from wheat. In this study, Sentinel-2 (S2) time-series data of a study site in Iran (Markazi) and two sites in the USA (Idaho and North California), are employed. Spectral reflectance values of wheat and barley are examined during the growing season and a new spectral-temporal feature is successfully developed for automatic identification of the barley heading date. The Relief-f algorithm is then employed to select appropriate spectral features of S2 to distinguish wheat from barley at the heading date. Finally, generated spectral features at the heading date are used as input to Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) to produce barley and wheat maps. The Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy (OA) obtained for the three study sites are more than 0.67 and 76%, respectively. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of remote sensing data to identify the phenological growth stages of barley and distinguish it successfully from wheat.

TI  - Flood Susceptibility Mapping Using Remote Sensing and Integration of Decision Table Classifier and Metaheuristic Algorithms
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is one of the most prevalent types of natural catastrophes, and it can cause extensive damage to infrastructure and the natural environment. The primary method of flood risk management is flood susceptibility mapping (FSM), which provides a quantitative assessment of a region's vulnerability to flooding. The objective of this study is to develop new ensemble models for FSM by integrating metaheuristic algorithms, such as genetic algorithms (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and harmony search (HS), with the decision table classifier (DTB). The proposed algorithms were applied in the province of Sulaymaniyah, Iraq. Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data satellite images were used for flood monitoring (on 27 July 2019), and 160 flood occurrence locations were prepared for modeling. For the training and validation datasets, flood occurrence data were coupled to 1 flood-influencing parameters (slope, altitude, aspect, plan curvature, distance from rivers, land cover, geology, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), rainfall, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)). The certainty factor (CF) approach was used to determine the spatial association between the effective parameters and the occurrence of floods, and the resulting weights were employed as modeling inputs. According to the pairwise consistency technique, the NDVI and altitude are the most significant factors in flood modeling. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was used to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of ensemble models. The DTB-GA model was found to be the most accurate (AUC = 0.889), followed by the DTB-PSO model (AUC = 0.844) and the DTB-HS model (AUC = 0.812). This research's hybrid models provide a reliable estimate of flood risk, and the risk maps are reliable for flood early-warning and control systems.

TI  - Characterizing Global Patterns of Mangrove Canopy Height and Aboveground Biomass Derived from SRTM Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies have been done using remotely sensed data to produce global mangrove height and biomass maps; however, little is known about the worldwide pattern of mangroves in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres that corresponds to their height and biomass. The objective of this study was to investigate whether there is a specific pattern that can be seen between northern and southern mangroves according to height and biomass. Based on an empirical model, we processed Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) elevation data in combination with 450 field data points to produce a global mangrove height map and its corresponding aboveground biomass (AGB) per hectare at 30 m spatial resolution. We also refined the global mangrove area maps and provided a set of equations to determine the maximum mangrove height at any given latitude. Results showed that 10,639,916 ha of mangroves existed globally in the year 2000, with a total AGB of 1.696 Gt. Even though the areal coverage of mangroves was higher in the Northern Hemisphere, the total mangrove AGB was higher in the Southern Hemisphere. The majority of mangroves in both hemispheres were found to be between 6 and 8 m tall, although height distribution differed in each hemisphere. The global mangrove height equation for northern and southern mangroves produced from this study can be used by relevant stakeholders as an important reference for developing an appropriate management plan for the sustainability of the global mangrove ecosystem.

TI  - The Karakoram Anomaly: Validation through Remote Sensing Data, Prospects and Implications
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Millions of people rely on river water originating from snow- and ice-melt from basins in the Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalayas (HKH). One such basin is the Upper Indus Basin (UIB), where the snow- and ice-melt contribution can be more than 80%. Being the origin of some of the world's largest alpine glaciers, this basin could be highly susceptible to global warming and climate change. Field observations and geodetic measurements suggest that in the Karakoram Mountains, glaciers are either stable or have expanded since 1990, in sharp contrast to glacier retreats that are prevalently observed in the Himalayas and adjoining high-altitude terrains of Central Asia. Decreased summer temperature and discharge in the rivers originating from this region are cited as supporting evidence for this somewhat anomalous phenomenon. This study used remote sensing data during the summer months (July-September) for the period 2000 to 2017. Equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs) for July, August and September have been estimated. ELA trends for July and September were found statistically insignificant. The August ELA declined by 128 m during 2000-2017 at a rate of 7.1 m/year, testifying to the Karakoram Anomaly concomitant with stable to mass gaining glaciers in the Hunza Basin (western Karakoram). Stable glaciers may store fresh water for longer and provide sustainable river water flows in the near to far future. However, these glaciers are also causing low flows of the river during summer months. The Tarbela reservoir reached three times its lowest storage level during June 2019, and it was argued this was due to the low melt of glaciers in the Karakoram region. Therefore, using remote sensing data to monitor the glaciers' health concomitant with sustainable water resources development and management in the HKH region is urgently needed.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and climate dynamics have a pronounced impact on water resources, biodiversity, land degradation, and productivity at all scales. Thus, in this study, we present the spatio-temporal dynamics of land use change and climate aiming to provide a scientific evidence about gains and losses in major land use categories and associated drivers and significancy and homogeneity of climate change. To this end, Landsat images and historical climate data have been used to determine the dynamics. In addition, population census data and land use policy have been considered to assess the potential drivers of land use change. The spatio-temporal land use dynamics have been evaluated using transition matrix and dynamics index. Likewise, shifts in the climate data were analyzed using change point analysis and three homogenous climate zones have been identified using principal component analysis. The results show that, from 1989 to 2019, the areal percentage of agricultural land increased by 27.5%, settlement by 0.8%, and barren land 0.4% while the natural vegetation, wetland, water body, and grass land decreased by 24.5%, 1.6%, 0.5%, and 2.1%, respectively. The land use dynamics have been stronger in the first decade of the study period. An abrupt shift of climate has occurred in the 1980s. In the last four decades, rainfall shows a not significant decreasing trend. However, a significant increasing trend has been observed for temperature. Rapid population growth, agricultural expansion policy, and climate variability have been identified as the underlying drivers of land use dynamics.

TI  - Estimating Aboveground Forest Biomass Using Radar Methods
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest biomass dynamics in boreal forests has a significant effect on global carbon cycles. Biomass estimates provide insight into the carbon balance of forest vegetation in Siberia. This paper discusses the methods used in modern studies (2010-2021) to estimate aboveground forest biomass on the basis of radar remote sensing data. Biomass estimation methodologies are described, including field data collection, data preprocessing, and modeling of relationships between remote sensing (RS) data and biomass. In terms of forest biomass estimation, radar sensing has limited capabilities determined by the characteristics of the survey equipment and parameters of studied forest stands. Modern studies combine optical and radar RS data to estimate forest biomass more accurately using regression models, machine learning, and special techniques (BIOMASAR, SWCM, and MaxEnt). Vegetation optical depth values estimated on the basis of microwave surveys make it possible to solve the saturation problem hindering the estimation of large amounts of biomass. It is difficult to compare the accuracy of biomass estimation methods due to the lack of uniform approaches to experimental and error computation procedures. Errors in biomass estimates produced on the basis of optical and radar data vary considerably (similar to 25% on average). The small amount of reference field data complicates biomass estimations in boreal forests of Siberia. It is believed that the application of machine learning algorithms to remote sensing data collected by the Sentinel-1 and ALOS-PALSAR satellites will make it possible to estimate the biomass of boreal forests with a high spatial resolution.

TI  - Early Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Epidemic Waves: Lessons from the Syndromic Surveillance in Lombardy, Italy
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated the performance of the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) model for comparing two families of predictors (i.e., structured and unstructured data from visits to the emergency department (ED)) for the early detection of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic waves. The study included data from 1,282,100 ED visits between 1 January 2011 and 9 December 2021 to a local health unit in Lombardy, Italy. A regression model with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) error term was fitted. EWMA residual charts were then plotted to detect outliers in the frequency of the daily ED visits made due to the presence of a respiratory syndrome (based on coded diagnoses) or respiratory symptoms (based on free text data). Alarm signals were compared with the number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. Overall, 150,300 ED visits were encoded as relating to respiratory syndromes and 87,696 to respiratory symptoms. Four strong alarm signals were detected in March and November 2020 and 2021, coinciding with the onset of the pandemic waves. Alarm signals generated for the respiratory symptoms preceded the occurrence of the first and last pandemic waves. We concluded that the EWMA model is a promising tool for predicting pandemic wave onset.

TI  - Sensitivity Analysis of 1,3-Butadiene Monitoring Based on Space-Based Detection in the Infrared Band
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere is of great significance for reducing chemical pollution, warning of fires, and improving air quality. Among the VOCs, 1,3-butadiene is essential to monitor as a carcinogenic environmental pollutant. The space-based detection of 1,3-butadiene was made possible by recently development of infrared detection satellites and advances in spectroscopic techniques. In this work, based on the demand for space-based infrared detection of 1,3-butadiene, a modeling method of Earth background radiance characteristics coupled with remote sensing data and physical model is proposed, which can effectively simulate the Earth background radiance field distribution under any atmospheric conditions. Specifically, infrared spectral radiance of 1,3-butadiene was simulated from absorption cross-section data. Further, combined with the radiative transfer model and atmospheric profiles of satellite sensor data, such as temperature, pressure, and H2O and O-3 mixing ratio, the atmospheric transmittance and atmospheric background radiance are simulated. Finally, infrared space-based detection of 1,3-butadiene is simulated by coupling Earth background radiance and the detectability is analyzed and discussed by using signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR). The results show that 1,3-butadiene has an absorption effect in space-based infrared detection. The detectability of the narrow band 9.8-10.0 mu m and 10.9-11.1 mu m is better than that of the wide band 9.0-12.0 mu m, and 10.9-11.1 mu m is a better detection band for 1,3-butadiene than other bands. This paper provides a method for the space-based infrared detection of 1,3-butadiene. It also provides a reference for selecting the appropriate band for the detector.

TI  - Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data to Detect Irrigation Events: Riaza Irrigation District (Spain) Case Study
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the use of high resolution (similar to 100 m) surface soil moisture (SSM) maps to detect irrigation occurrences, in time and space. The SSM maps have been derived from time series of Copernicus Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) observations. The analysis focused on the Riaza irrigation district in the Castilla y Leon region (Spain), where detailed information on land use, irrigation scheduling, water withdrawal, meteorology and parcel borders is available from 2017 to 2021. The well-documented data basis has supported a solid characterization of the sources of uncertainties affecting the use of SSM to map and monitor irrigation events. The main factors affecting the irrigation detection are meteo-climatic condition, crop type, water supply and spatial and temporal resolution of Earth observation data. Results indicate that approximately three-quarters of the fields irrigated within three days of the S-1 acquisition can be detected. The specific contribution of SSM to irrigation monitoring consists of (i) an early detection, well before vegetation indexes can even detect the presence of a crop, and (ii) the identification of the irrigation event in time, which remains unfeasible for vegetation indexes. Therefore, SSM can integrate vegetation indexes to resolve the irrigation occurrences in time and space.

TI  - AGO Recommendations for the Surgical Therapy of Breast Cancer: Update 2022
T2  - GEBURTSHILFE UND FRAUENHEILKUNDE
M3  - Article
AB  - The recommendations of the AGO Breast Committee on the surgical therapy of breast cancer were last updated in March 2022 (www.ago-online.de). Since surgical therapy is one of several partial steps in the treatment of breast cancer, extensive diagnostic and oncological expertise of a breast surgeon and good interdisciplinary cooperation with diagnostic radiologists is of great importance. The most important changes concern localization techniques, resection margins, axillary management in the neoadjuvant setting and the evaluation of the meshes in reconstructive surgery. Based on meta-analyses of randomized studies, the level of recommendation of an intraoperative breast ultrasound for the localization of non-palpable lesions was elevated to "++". Thus, the technique is considered to be equivalent to wire localization, provided that it is a lesion which can be well represented by sonography, the surgeon has extensive experience in breast ultrasound and has access to a suitable ultrasound device during the operation. In invasive breast cancer, the aim is to reach negative resection margins ("no tumor on ink"), regardless of whether an extensive intraductal component is present or not. Oncoplastic operations can also replace a mastectomy in selected cases due to the large number of existing techniques, and are equivalent to segmental resection in terms of oncological safety at comparable rates of complications. Sentinel node excision is recommended for patients with cN0 status receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy after completion of chemotherapy. Minimally invasive biopsy is recommended for initially suspect lymph nodes. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients with initially 1-3 suspicious lymph nodes and a good response (ycN0) can receive the targeted axillary dissection and the axillary dissection as equivalent options.

TI  - Application of e-TOPSIS for Ground Water Potentiality Zonation using Morphometric Parameters and Geospatial Technology of Vanvate Lui Basin, Mizoram, NE India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Morphometric analysis is the mathematical analysis of a watershed. Groundwater storage is directly related to the morphometry of a watershed. Remote sensing and GIS gives an opportunity for the scientific and empirical investigation towards groundwater potentiality. The utilization of RS/GIS for scientific investigation into ground water potentiality is quite innovative for the hilly state of Mizoram of India, which faces acute water shortage during the winter season. Vanvate Lui basin of Mizoram was thus chosen for the present study. It is an important source of water for a significant number of rural villages like Zote, Chhipphir, and Lungmovi. The present study analyzed the groundwater potentiality of Vanvate lui basin and undertook groundwater potentiality zonation of Vanvate lui basin using eTOPSIS model. eTOPSIS is an intregated knowledge-based multi-criteria decision-making model assimilating TOPSIS objective weighting method and Shannon Entropy. Areal, relief and linear morphometric aspects of Vanvate lui basin were extracted from ALOS PALSAR DEM for conducting MCDM. It was found that sub-basins 1, 6, 8 and 2 have high potentiality for groundwater storage. Similar, studies were also done on the Donor basin adjacent to the study area for model validation. After applying e-TOPSIS in the Donor basin, it was found that the result of the study matches the groundwater data of Donor basin as provided by the PHE department, Mizoram. The zones found to be under high potential of groundwater in the sub-basins 14, 9, 2, 11, 6 and 5 are the ones where the ground water depth is less than 70 meters as measured by the ground water department of Mizoram state. The present study will help the policymakers, village governance system, district development authorities and P.W.D of Mizoram to take proper steps towards developing the rural life quality, identifying suitable groundwater storage and ensuring proper steps towards watershed management. It is hoped that the research work will help in mitigating the water scarcity problem of the study area during the dry winter season.

TI  - Using multiple linear regression to analyze changes in forest area: the case study of Akdeniz Region
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest area losses are one of the most significant changes in land cover. These losses negatively affect ecosystems and cause severe economic and social life problems. It is necessary to monitor the process carefully and analyze the effects well to minimize all these negative effects in forest land losses and improve the development in urban areas positively. It is of great importance that these analyses are carried out quickly and accurately in terms of developing the natural environment. In this study, the effects that cause forest losses in the Mediterranean Region over the years are examined with the data obtained with the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Within the scope of the study, the changes in forest areas in the Mediterranean Region between 2004 and 2019 have been examined by considering many factors. In the study, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), precipitation, temperature, land surface temperature, aerosol optical depth, ozone, fire, urban areas, and population data were obtained with GEE. The data obtained were analyzed statistically, and the factors affecting the losses in forest areas the most were determined.

TI  - Comparison of Land Use Land Cover Classifiers Using Different Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate land use land cover (LULC) classification is vital for the sustainable management of natural resources and to learn how the landscape is changing due to climate. For accurate and efficient LULC classification, high-quality datasets and robust classification methods are required. With the increasing availability of satellite data, geospatial analysis tools, and classification methods, it is essential to systematically assess the performance of different combinations of satellite data and classification methods to help select the best approach for LULC classification. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the LULC classification performance of two commonly used platforms (i.e., ArcGIS Pro and Google Earth Engine) with different satellite datasets (i.e., Landsat, Sentinel, and Planet) through a case study for the city of Charlottetown in Canada. Specifically, three classifiers in ArcGIS Pro, including support vector machine (SVM), maximum likelihood (ML), and random forest/random tree (RF/RT), are utilized to develop LULC maps over the period of 2017-2021. Whereas four classifiers in Google Earth Engine, including SVM, RF/RT, minimum distance (MD), and classification and regression tree (CART), are used to develop LULC maps for the same period. To identify the most efficient and accurate classifier, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient for each classifier is calculated throughout the study period for all combinations of satellite data, classification platforms, and methods. Change detection is then conducted using the best classifier to quantify the LULC changes over the study period. Results show that the SVM classifier in both ArcGIS Pro and Google Earth Engine presents the best performance compared to other classifiers. In particular, the SVM in ArcGIS Pro shows an overall accuracy of 89% with Landsat, 91% with Sentinel, and 94% with Planet. Similarly, in Google Earth Engine, the SVM shows an accuracy of 87% with Landsat 8 and 92% with Sentinel 2. Furthermore, change detection results show that 13.80% and 14.10% of forest areas have been turned into bare land and urban class, respectively, and 3.90% of the land has been converted into the urban area from 2017 to 2021, suggesting the intensive urbanization. The results of this study will provide the scientific basis for selecting the remote sensing classifier and satellite imagery to develop accurate LULC maps.

TI  - Planform Changes in the Lower Mahaweli River, Sri Lanka Using Landsat Satellite Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Major development projects along rivers, like reservoirs and other hydraulic structures, have changed not only river discharges but also sediment transport. Thus, changes in river planforms can be observed in such rivers. In addition, river centerline migrations can be witnessed. The Mahaweli River is the longest in Sri Lanka, having the largest catchment area among the 103 major river basins in the country. The river has been subjected to many development projects over the last 50 years, causing significant changes in the river discharge and sediment transport. However, no research has been carried out to evaluate the temporal and spatial changes in planforms. The current seeks to qualitatively analyze the river planform changes of the Lower Mahaweli River (downstream to Damanewewa) over the past 30 years (from 1991 to 2021) and identify the major planform features and their spatiotemporal changes in the lower Mahaweli River. Analyzing the changes in rivers requires long-term data with high spatial resolution. Therefore, in this research, remotely sensed Landsat satellite data were used to analyze the planform changes of Lower Mahaweli River with a considerably high resolution (30 m). These Landsat satellite images were processed and analyzed using the QGIS mapping tool and a semi-automated digitizing tool. The results show that major changes in river Mahaweli occurred mainly in the most downstream sections of the selected river segment. Further, the river curvature was also comparatively high downstream of the river. An oxbow lake formation was observed over time in the most downstream part of the Mahaweli River after 2011. Centerline migration rates were also calculated with the generated river centerlines. It was found that the rates were generally lower than about 30 m per year, except for at locations where river meandering was observed. The main limitations of this study were the possible misclassifications due to the resolution of images and obstructions caused by cloud cover in the Landsat images. To achieve more accurate estimates, this study could be developed further with quantitative mathematical analysis by also considering the sediment dynamics of the Mahaweli River.

TI  - SWAT_DA: Sequential Multivariate Data Assimilation-Oriented Modification of SWAT
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Multivariate data assimilation (DA), a novel way to couple big data with land surface models, was extensively employed in forecasting-reanalyzing systems (FRSs), for example, ECMWF and GLDAS. Meanwhile, most (distributed) hydrological models, like soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), have not been equipped with straightforward ways to link to DA algorithms. Therefore, it is one of the main barriers to utilizing such hydrological models in FRSs. This paper deals with multivariate DA into SWAT (DA-SWAT), which is complicated since the original model does not provide full access to the models' initial conditions (ICs) at the hydrologic response unit (HRU) scale. The preceding DA-SWAT works commonly used an integrated approach in which the DA and SWAT codes were implemented in the same programming environment. We discuss how this approach complicates and prevents the application of DA-SWAT in multivariate, multimodel, and multisensor systems. Accordingly, we proposed a new approach for DA-SWAT by which SWAT can be perfectly linked with any DA algorithm of interest coded in any desired programming environment. Our framework utilizes input/output text files to access ICs and to link DA with SWAT. Moreover, we designed some univariate and multivariate scenarios for assimilating in situ streamflow measurement and MODIS's snow cover fraction (SCF) data, which has not yet been focused on in the SWAT calibration context. Results show that compared to the univariate assimilation of streamflow (SCF), the multivariate assimilation mitigates the equifinality problem and more accurately estimates SCF (streamflow) by improving NS and PBIAS measures with the differences of 0.4 (0.86), 12% (64%), respectively.

TI  - An evaluation of different approaches which use Google Street View imagery to ground truth land degradation assessments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Member states of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification are required to report on the proportion of land that is degraded in their countries, a requirement that is also tied into the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). National land degradation assessments are often conducted with the use of remote sensing data which are not always ground truthed. Google Street View (GSV) provides high resolution, panoramic imagery across large parts of the world that has the potential to be used to ground truth land degradation assessments. We apply three different methodologies (visual interpretation of GSV images, GSV image classification and vegetation index extraction) to derive vegetation cover estimates from Google Street View imagery for the Hardeveld bioregion of the Succulent Karoo biome in South Africa. Visual estimates of cover best predict known habitat condition values (adjusted R-2 = 0.86), whilst estimates derived from an unsupervised classification of GSV images also predict habitat condition relatively well (adjusted R-2 = 0.52). These results show the potential for using GSV imagery, and other large collections of ground-level landscape photographs, as a rough ground-truthing tool, especially in instances where more traditional ground-truthing approaches are not possible.

TI  - Geological mapping and mining prospecting in the Aouli inlier (Eastern Meseta, Morocco) based on remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS)
T2  - CHINA GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat 8 Oli, ASTER, and Sentinel 2A satellite images processing was used to map geological formations, lineaments and hydrothermal alteration minerals in the Aouli inlier, as a case study to illustrate the application of digital images processing and Geographic Information System (GIS) in geological mapping and mining prospecting. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to the Landsat images allowed good lithological discrimination and contributed to the updating of available geological maps. The Automatic lineament extraction from Sentinel images revealed the main tectonic structures affecting Aouli inlier. The ratio bands (b5+b7)/b6 and the false color composite (b4/b6, b2/b1, b3/b2) allowed the hydrothermal alteration minerals mapping from Aster images. Combined with available geological data and field observations, the satellite derived data were integrated and analyzed in a GIS software to establish mining prospecting guides. The results showed that the anomaly zones are intimately linked to NNE -SSW and NW -SE oriented faults and to highly fractured areas developing argillic and Fe rich alterations. Verified via field survey, this approach was successfully applied to the Aouli inlier to rapidly target potential areas to be explored in the tactical phase. This provides a model for future prospecting efforts for similar mineral deposits in other areas. (c) 2022 China Geology Editorial Office.

TI  - Hybrid meta-heuristic machine learning methods applied to landslide susceptibility mapping in the Sahel-Algiers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are considered as one among many phenomena jeopardizing human beings as well as their constructions. To prevent this disastrous problem, researchers have used several approaches for landslide susceptibility modeling, for the purpose of preparing accurate maps marking landslide prone areas. Among the most frequently used approaches for landslide susceptibility mapping is the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method. However, the effectiveness of ANN methods could be enhanced by using hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, which are scarcely applied in landslide mapping. In the current study, nine hybrid metaheuristic algorithms, genetic algorithm (GA)-ANN, evolutionary strategy (ES)-ANN, ant colony optimization (ACO)-ANN, particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ANN, biogeography based optimization (BBO)-ANN, gravitational search algorithm (GHA)-ANN, particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithm (PSOGSA)-ANN, grey wolves optimization (GWO)-ANN, and probability based incremental learning (PBIL)-ANN have been used to spatially predict landslide susceptibility in Algiers' Sahel, Algeria. The modeling phase was done using a database of 78 landslides collected utilizing Google Earth images, field surveys, and six conditioning factors (lithology, elevation, slope, land cover, distance to stream, and distance to road). Initially, a gamma test was used to decrease the input variable numbers. Furthermore, the optimal inputs have been modeled by the mean of hybrid metaheuristic ANN techniques and their performance was assessed through seven statistical indicators. The comparative study proves the effectiveness of the co-evolutionary PSOGSA-ANN model, which yielded higher performance in predicting landslide susceptibility compared to the other models. Sensitivity analysis using the step-by-step technique was done afterward, which revealed that the distance to the stream is the most influential factor on landslide susceptibility, followed by the slope factor which ranked second. Lithology and the distance to road have demonstrated a moderate effect on landslide susceptibility. Based on these findings, an accurate map has been designed to help land-use managers and decision-makers to mitigate landslide hazards.

TI  - Review of the assessment framework for Atlantic cod in NAFO 3Pn4RS: Fishery independent surveys.
T2  - Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat Research Document
M3  - Article
AB  - Fisheries and Oceans Canada in the Quebec region undertook in 2021-2022 a review of the assessment framework for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) 3Pn4RS Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stock in the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence. A review of assessment inputs, including information on reported and non-reported fishery catches, tagging information and fishery independent monitoring results took place in the spring of 2021. The principal objective of the present document was to review the availability, duration and quality of fishery independent survey indices and information for the stock. In doing so, we considered how these sources of information contribute to understanding population dynamics, via trends in abundance, demographic composition and mortality rates. Several advances were made as part of the review and which are expected to improve the quality of the assessment. First, the principal age-disaggregated indices obtained from a bottom-trawl research vessel survey were extended back in time from 1990 to 1984 by analyzing and applying results of a comparative fishing experiment that allowed to calibrate the series for the vessel used in the early years of the survey. This extends the time series to before the period when the stock collapsed. Second, a single coherent set of age-disaggregated indices for a Sentinel bottom trawl survey was obtained by combining two sets of indices covering different periods of years. Third, data from a winter survey that ran in the 1980s and 1990s and which had been disregarded were found to produce useful information on the age-composition for the cod stock over the 1983-1994 period. Fourth, results from historical surveys conducted in the 1950s and 1960s, the period during which trawls were introduced into the fishery and landings increased considerably, were found to provide useful estimates of mortality rates, notably an estimate of an upper bound for the natural morality rate. Fifth, an overhaul of the methods used to estimate age-disaggregated indices of abundance from the Sentinel fixed gear program resulted in the creation of three independent sets of indices, two based on longline catches and one based on gillnet catches. The overhaul was motivated by several issues that had arisen over time with the traditionally used catch-rate standardization approach. Overall, the revised indices provide a coherent picture of stock dynamics, including very similar trends across indices in the estimated rate of total mortality. Furthermore, the extension of information on the stock to the 1950s and abundance indices to the 1980s prior to stock collapse, is likely to provide a more accurate picture of the historical size and productivity of the stock, which in turn should allow for the establishment of more pertinent reference points for its management.

TI  - On (in)validating environmental models. 2. Implementation of a Turing-like test to modelling hydrological processes
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Part 1 of this study discussed the concept of using a form of Turing-like test for model evaluation, together with eight principles for implementing such an approach. In this part, the framing of fitness-for-purpose as a Turing-like test is discussed, together with an example application of trying to assess whether a rainfall-runoff model might be an adequate representation of the discharge response in a catchment for predicting future natural flood management scenarios. It is shown that the variation between event runoff coefficients in the record can be used to create some limits of acceptability that implicitly take some account of the epistemic uncertainties arising from lack of knowledge about errors in rainfall and discharge observations. In the case study it is demonstrated that the model used cannot be validated in this way across all the range of observed discharges, but that behavioural models can be found for the peak flows that are the subject of interest in the application. Thinking in terms of the Turing-like test focusses attention on the critical observations needed to test whether streamflow is being produced in the right way so that a model is considered as fit-for-purpose in predicting the impacts of future change scenarios. As is the case for uncertainty estimation in general, it is argued that the assumptions made in setting behavioural limits of acceptability should be stated explicitly to leave an audit trail in any application that can be reviewed by users of the model outputs.

TI  - Study on the Evolution Law of Surface Landscape Pattern in Earthquake-Stricken Areas by Remote Sensing: A Case Study of Jiuzhaigou County, Sichuan Province
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquakes not only cause the destruction of surface buildings and a large number of casualties, but also have an important impact on regional land-use change. Timely understanding of land cover and its changes before and after earthquakes is of great scientific significance for studying the restoration and reconstruction of the natural ecosystem and the sustainable development of the social economy in disaster areas. At present, there are few studies on land cover changes before and after earthquakes in the earthquake-stricken areas, especially the quantitative assessment of land cover changes before and after earthquakes at the micro scale of landscape spatial distribution. Therefore, this article is based on remote sensing data and uses an earthquake in Jiuzhaigou, Sichuan, as an example. By calculating the land-use degree comprehensive index and its rate of change, the transfer matrix of land-use, quantitative expression methods of the landscape via the landscape pattern index are analyzed from the points of view of the spatial-temporal evolution law of the landscape pattern of land cover before and after the earthquake. The experimental results showed that the area of forest, cropland, shrub. and grassland types in the study area changed greatly, and the area of grassland types in Shuanghe Township changed most obviously, as they increased from 6.57 km(2) in 2015 to 7.43 km(2), and then decreased to 6.21 km(2) in 2020. During the earthquake recovery period, the comprehensive index of land-use degree for most towns in the study area showed an upward trend, and the land cover types were improved. After 2017, the PD and LSI of the study area showed a downward trend, among which the bare land type changed greatly, with the PD value decreasing from 0.38 in 2017 to 0.21 in 2020, and the LSI value decreasing from 58.29 in 2017 to 40.69 in 2020. This indicates that the degree of landscape fragmentation and the spatial heterogeneity of the land surface in the study area are reduced in the later stage of earthquake recovery. After 2017, the AI value of the study area showed an upward trend, and the AI value of the bare land type increased from 63.97 in 2017 to 78.25 in 2020, indicating that the connectivity between landscape patches in the study area was enhanced in the later stage of the earthquake. This also reflects that the ecological environment of the study area gradually showed a good trend in the later stage of the earthquake. The results of this paper not only reveal the spatial-temporal evolution of land cover in Jiuzhaigou County before and after the earthquake, but also help the relevant national decision-making departments to formulate corresponding policies and measures.

TI  - Synthetic Aperture Radar Doppler Tomography Reveals Details of Undiscovered High-Resolution Internal Structure of the Great Pyramid of Giza
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A problem with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is that due to the poor penetrating action of electromagnetic waves inside solid bodies, the capability to observe inside distributed targets is precluded. Under these conditions, imaging action is provided only on the surface of distributed targets. The present work describes an imaging method based on the analysis of micro-movements on the Khnum-Khufu Pyramid, which are usually generated by background seismic waves. The obtained results prove to be very promising, as high-resolution full 3D tomographic imaging of the pyramid's interior and subsurface was achieved. Khnum-Khufu becomes transparent when observed in the micro-movement domain. Based on this novelty, we have completely reconstructed internal objects, observing and measuring structures that have never been discovered before. The experimental results are estimated by processing series of SAR images from the second-generation Italian COSMO-SkyMed satellite system, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Characterization of Fire Using MODIS Data (2000-2020) in Colombia
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a process of disturbance of natural ecosystems that can be used for land management and soil preparation for agricultural purposes, but can also drastically affect biodiversity and the distribution and abundance of species by changing land use and altering the microclimate. The analysis of data on thermal anomalies has become a valuable tool for the study of places with low monitoring of the occurrence of fires. In this study, information from the MODIS sensor was used to analyze the spatio-temporal distribution of fires in the five natural regions of Colombia (Caribbean, Andean, Pacific, Orinoquia, and Amazon) in the period of 2000-2020. Nevertheless, MODIS fire hotspots present some difficulties in estimating the magnitude of fire activity, due the relations between active fires and burned areas, which are not constant in space and time. The method used in this work consisted to performance an inter-annual and intra-annual analysis of thermal anomalies data and identifying the incidence of temperature in the occurrence of fires. The fire density (defined as the number of fires per unit area) and the fire trends over the study period were also analyzed. Inter-annual fire peaks were recorded in 2004 (8.21%) and 2007 (8.04%), and three main fire hotspots were identified in the Orinoquia, Andean, and Caribbean regions. Moreover, 87% of fire peaks were observed in the dry season (December-March). On the other hand, the highest incidence of thermal anomalies occurred in the Orinoquia region (83409 +/- 185 fires), and the highest incidence of fires per unit area was recorded in the Andean region (0.162 +/- 0.086 fires-km(2)-year). Fire activities varied strongly according to region and year over the study period. Significant correlations were observed between temperature and fire density in the Andean (Rho = 0.7506), Pacific (Rho = 0.7364), and Caribbean (Rho = 0.5571) regions. Thus, temperature seem to be a driver of fire density in these regions.

TI  - Long-Term Cancer Recurrence Rates following Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy: A 10-Year Follow-Up Study
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Despite the increased use of nipple-sparing mastectomies, there are limited data examining long-term cancer recurrence rates in these patients. The objective of this study was to analyze breast cancer recurrence in patients who underwent therapeutic nipple-sparing mastectomy with a median of 10 years of follow-up.Methods: All patients undergoing nipple-sparing mastectomy at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed temporally to obtain a median of 10 years of follow-up. Patient demographic factors, mastectomy specimen pathologic findings, and oncologic outcomes were analyzed. Univariate analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for locoregional recurrence.Results: One hundred twenty-six therapeutic nipple-sparing mastectomies were performed on 120 patients. The most frequently observed tumor histology included invasive ductal carcinoma (48.4 percent) and ductal carcinoma in situ (38.1 percent). Mean tumor size was 1.62 cm. Multifocal or multicentric disease and lymphovascular invasion were present in 31.0 percent and 10.3 percent of nipple-sparing mastectomy specimens, respectively. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 84.9 percent of nipple-sparing mastectomies,and 17.8 percent were positive. The rate of positive frozen subareolar biopsy was 7.3 percent (n = 82) and that of permanent subareolar pathology was 9.5 percent (n = 126). The most frequently observed pathologic tumor stages were stage I (44.6 percent) and stage 0 (33.9 percent). The incidence of recurrent disease was 3.17 percent per mastectomy and 3.33 percent per patient. On univariate analysis, no demographic, operative, or tumor-specific variables were independent risk factors for locoregional recurrence.Conclusions: Overall recurrence rates are low in patients undergoing nipple-sparing mastectomy at a median follow-up of 10-years. Close surveillance should remain a goal for patients and their providers to promptly identify potential recurrence.

TI  - Size characteristics of asbestiform fibers in lung tissue of animals that grazed in areas rich in ophiolitic outcrops in Central Calabria (Southern Italy)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In Calabria (Southern Italy) naturally occurring asbestos (NOA) mainly occurs in the ophiolitic sequences cropping in the Mount Reventino area. The most common type of asbestos detected was the amphibole tremolite; fibrous antigorite and minor chrysotile were also found. The development of asbestos-related diseases depends on, among other things, the morphological characteristics of fibers, length and width, affecting the durability of asbestos fibers in the lung. In this work fifteen lung samples of sheep, goats and wild boars, grazing around the Mount Reventino area were collected and asbestos fibers analysed. Observed fibers (357), of which 97 % were tremolite and 3 % antigorite fibers, were grouped according to species, grazing area and age of the animals. The aim of this work was to highlight any differences among the groupings and to compare our size results with data in literature related to exposed populations. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) highlighted a positive correlation between tremolite fiber length and width and revealed groupings in terms of animal age. The Kruskal-Wallis test showed statistically significant differences between fiber mean widths in young and old animals. 63 % observed asbestiform fibers were longer than 5 mu m and 7 % of the fibers were longer than 20 mu m (critical fiber length connected to the frustrated phagocytosis by the macrophage). Fibers conforming to the Stanton Hypothesis size (predictor of the carcinogenic potency of fibers) were 1 %. Our size parameters of fibers detected in the animal lungs were in fairly good agreement with literature data for human asbestos exposure to tremolite.These results confirmed that an animal-sentinel system could be used to monitor the natural background of the airborne breathable fibers exposure. In addition, the size correlation of animal-human breathed fibers could be useful to study their potential toxicity. Additional data are necessary for improving the agreement with human exposure data.

T2  - Indian Journal of Agricultural Research
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Land-use and land-cover (LULC) change is among the dynamic environmental and ecological factors for monitoring and facilitating the developmental strategies to balance conservation and conflict of resource uses. This study aimed to analyze LULC changes that have occurred during 1988-2018 and its prediction for 2040-2060 periods.Methods: LULC changes were analyzed using geographic information system Landsat and predicted by CA-Markov model.Result: The results of this study confirmed that cultivated-land and rural- settlement, bare-land, built-up- area and waterbody have increased at an annual rate of 23.1, 2.2, 0.8 and 1.1 ha/year but forestland, bushland and grassland have decreased at an annual rate of 14.4, 4.1 and 8.7 ha/year, respectively. It is projected that the increase in cultivated-land, bare- land, built-up-area and waterbody but decreases the forestland, grassland and bushland. Expansion of agriculture and deforestation showed increasing trend on both previous and predicted LULC changes with upcoming expansion of bare-land due to major driving factor of population growth. Thus, well integrated landscape planning and reliable predictions for future LULC are needed to reduce the deterioration of environment.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Dynamics of Evapotranspiration in the Podkamennaya Tunguska River Basin
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrological role of forest communities dominating in the Podkamennaya Tunguska basin has been assessed by their contribution to the total evaporation in the watershed area based on the landscape differentiation of the region. We have used evapotranspiration parameters obtained by remote sensing data from MODIS Global Evapotranspiration Project (MOD16 ET), which takes into account the climatic data of the studied area, the types of the terrestrial surface, and the diversity of the landcover. The studies show that the evapotranspiration of the specified classes of forest vegetation is characterized by significant variability both in space and with time. The variability of evapotranspiration from year to year is primarily related to changes in meteorological parameters and the leaf index. The evaporation variability in space is determined by general climatic characteristics of the research area and different species composition of forest stands. The analysis of data reveals the tendency to a decrease in the annual evapotranspiration in the Podkamennaya Tunguska basin from 2000 to 2014. A comparative analysis of evapotranspiration trends with those in air temperature and precipitation confirms that the evapotranspiration decrease is related to changes in climatic conditions in the studied area. It is revealed that the landscape structure of watersheds may be used to indicate the processes forming evapotranspiration as an important component of the water balance, as well as to determine the hydrologically significant boundaries of landscapes. The assessment of evaporation from the land surface based on remote sensing data (product MOD16 ET) may be used for water balance calculations in watersheds of various sizes, particularly in the absence of a runoff database.

TI  - THE BATTLE OF TOPONYMS: TOPONYMIC REVERSION IN THE BEGINNINGS OF THE CITY OF BELO HORIZONTE
T2  - HUMANIDADES & INOVACAO
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to analyze the process of toponymic reversion in the City of Belo Horizonte carried out by Municipal Law no. 182, of October 13, 1919. The analysis was based on the taxonomic models of toponymy by Dick (1990) and Seabra (2016). It was tested the hypothesis that the reversion was motivated by the fact that the previous changes in the city's toponymy, between 1908 and 1918, did not conform to the patterns of place names attribution of Aarao Reis in the city planning in 1895. It was argued that the hypothesis proceeds due to the innovation of honoring a public figure linked to the area of science with Municipal Law n degrees 127, of April 3, 1917, a type of pratice that still did not exist in the system of 1895. However, it was also possible to identify an ideological clash, related to the worldview of those involved, with opposition between the academic and the political.

TI  - Assessment and Calibration of ERA5 Severe Winds in the Atlantic Ocean Using Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we analyze the surface winds of ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis in the Atlantic Ocean. The first part addresses a reanalysis validation, studying the spatial distribution of the errors and the performance as a function of the percentiles, with a further investigation under cyclonic conditions. The second part proposes and compares two calibration models, a simple least-squares linear regression (LR) and the quantile mapping method (QM). Our results indicate that ERA5 provides high-quality winds for non-extreme conditions, especially at the eastern boundaries, with bias between -0.5 and 0.3 m/s and RMSE below 1.5 m/s. The reanalysis errors are site-dependent, where large RMSE and severe underestimation are found in tropical latitudes and locations following the warm currents. The most extreme winds in tropical cyclones show the worst results, with RMSE above 5 m/s. Apart from these areas, the strong winds at extratropical locations are well represented. The bias-correction models have proven to be very efficient in removing systematic bias. The LR works well for low-to-mild wind intensities while the QM is better for the upper percentiles and winds above 15 m/s-an improvement of 10% in RMSE and 50% for the bias compared to the original reanalysis is reported.

TI  - Information Extraction and Prediction of Rocky Desertification Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rock desertification has become the third most serious ecological problem in western China after desertification and soil erosion. It is also the primary environmental problem to be solved in the karst region of southwest China. Karst landscapes in China are mainly distributed in southwest China, and the area centered on the Guizhou plateau is the center of karst landscape development in southern China. It has a fragile ecological environment, and natural factors and human activities have influenced the development of stone desertification in the karst areas to different degrees. In this paper, Dafang County, Guizhou Province, was selected as the study area to analyze the effect of the decision tree and multiple linear regression model on stone desertification and to analyze the evolution characteristics of stone desertification in Dafang County from 2005 to 2020. The FLUS model was applied to predict and validate the stone desertification information. The results show that the overall accuracy of multiple linear regression extraction of stone desertification is 70%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.69; the overall accuracy of decision tree extraction of stone desertification is 60%, and the Kappa coefficient is 0.521. The multiple linear regression stone desertification extraction model is more accurate than the traditional decision tree classification. The overlay analysis of stone desertification and slope, elevation, slope direction and vegetation cover showed that stone desertification was more distributed between 1300-1900 m in elevation; stone desertification decreased gradually with the increase in slope; each grade of stone desertification was mainly distributed in the range of 5 to 25 degrees in slope, which might be related to human activities. The FLUS model was used to predict the accuracy of 2015 data in the region and project the changes in stone desertification area in 2035 under a conventional scenario and an ecological protection scenario in the region to provide a new reference for predicting stone desertification.

TI  - Building Information Modelling (BIM) Capabilities in the Design and Planning of Rural Settlements in China: A Systematic Review
T2  - LAND
M3  - Review
AB  - With rural revitalization being established as the national policy in China, the environmental quality and residential comfort of rural settlements has received widespread attention from the whole society in China. However, due to the over-exploitation of resources and the uneven development between urban and rural in China, the environmental conditions and residential experience in rural settlements in China are still relatively backward. To prompt the environmental quality and residential comfort of rural settlements in China, it is necessary to optimize the planning and design of rural settlements in China. As a multi-function method, Building Information Modeling (BIM) can significantly contribute to the planning and design of rural settlements in China. To optimize the environmental quality and residential experience in rural settlements in China, this study is developed to perform a systematic literature review of the BIM capabilities in the design and planning phase of rural settlements in China. To achieve this aim, the PRISMA protocol was used to perform this systematic review. The review and discussion of this study were conducted between June 2022 and September 2022. In this study, Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus were adopted as the main databases, and 189 articles were reviewed. Through this systematic review, it can be identified that BIM capabilities have significant advantages in the following aspects of the design and planning of rural settlements in China: Data storage and management; 3D modeling and visualization; Disaster prevention and environmental analysis; Cost estimation and optimization. Furthermore, through the discussion and analysis of research results, it can be concluded that BIM capabilities can perform their benefits in the rural settlements' design and planning through their following characteristics: knowledge management, simulation, and modeling. Based on the research results, it can be identified that knowledge management capabilities in BIM can effectively provide information support and knowledge assistance throughout the design and planning phase of rural settlements in China. BIM's simulation and modeling capabilities can simulate and demonstrate the rural environment and their internal structures in rural settlements' design and planning phase to achieve their environmental optimization, residential comfort improvement, clash detection, disaster prevention, and expenditure reduction. Moreover, the challenge and future directions of BIM capabilities in the design and planning phase of rural settlements in China are discussed and analyzed. This study can effectively promote and optimize the BIM utilization in the design and planning phase of rural settlements in China, to better enhance their environmental quality and residential experience.

TI  - Spatially Non-Stationary Relationships between Changing Environment and Water Yield Services in Watersheds of China's Climate Transition Zones
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of water-related ecosystem services and the mechanisms influencing them is essential for optimizing ecosystem governance and maintaining watershed sustainable development. However, the complex and undiscovered interplay between human activities and natural factors underpins the solutions to the water scarcity and flooding challenges faced by climate transition zone basins. This study used a multiple spatial-scale analysis to: (i) quantify the spatial and temporal variations of the water yield ecosystem service (WYs) of the Wei River Basin (WRB) from 2000 to 2020 using the InVEST model and remote sensing data; and (ii) look at how human activities, climate, topography, and vegetation affect the WYs at the climate transition zone sub-catchment scale using the geographical detector model and multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR). The conclusive research reveals that there would be a gradual increase in WYs between the years 2000 and 2020, as well as a distinct and very different spatial aggregation along the climatic divide. The average yearly precipitation was shown to be particularly linked to the water yield of the WRB. The interplay of human, climatic, plant, and terrain variables has a substantially higher influence than most single factors on the geographical differentiation of WYs. Bivariate enhancement and non-linear enhancement are the most common types of factor interactions. This shows that there are significant interactions between natural and human variables. Our study shows that precipitation and temperature are the main factors that cause WYs in the semi-arid zone. In the semi-humid zone, precipitation and vegetation are the key controlling factors that cause WYs. We provide new perspectives for understanding and optimizing ecosystem management by comparing the drivers of WYS in sub-basins with different climatic conditions. Based on the findings, we recommend that particular attention should be paid to ecosystem restoration practices in watersheds in climatic transition zones.

TI  - Trace and rare earth elements in excreta of two species of marine mammals from South Shetland Islands, Antarctica
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Pinnipeds are sentinel species for marine pollution, but their role as vectors of trace elements (TEs) or rare earth elements (REEs) to ecosystems has been poorly studied. The present study tested pinniped feces for 61 elements, including REEs. Feces of adult seals (Mirounga leonina, Hydrurga leptonyx) from Fildes Bay, King George Island, Antarctica, were analyzed by ICP-MS. TEs varied by several orders of magnitude across the suite examined herein, with Fe, Al, Zn, Mn, HgII and Sr as the top six in both species. Of the REEs, Ce, Dy, Er, Eu, Gd, Ho, La, Lu, Nd, Pr, Sc, Sm, Tb, Y and Yb were found consistently in all samples and ranged from 0.935 to 0.006 mu g g(-1) d.w. The results show that both species act as biovector organisms of TEs and REEs through feces in remote environments, whose actual impacts and long-term fate need further exploration.

TI  - A Calculation Model for Ground Surface Temperature in High-Altitude Regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a major parameter in the energy balance of the ground surface, temperature represents the level of exchange of energy and moisture between the ground and air. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has the permafrost region with the highest altitude and the largest area in low-middle latitude of the world. The variation in ground surface temperature has an impact on the existence and development of the permafrost. Therefore, the analysis of the ground surface temperature in the QTP is significant to reflect the energy exchange in permafrost regions. This paper collected solar radiation data and calculated the conversion coefficient from total solar radiation to long-wave radiation of the ground surface on different underlying surfaces. The ground surface temperature was inversely calculated and modified based on the reception of solar radiation on different underlying surfaces. A simplified calculation model of ground surface temperature was built to reflect the ground surface temperature on different underlying surfaces of the QTP. The calculation results were compared with MODIS and showed good fitness, providing a systematic and reliable method for calculating the ground surface temperature on the QTP. The above model plays a significant role in the estimation of soil moisture, ground surface energy and water balance.

TI  - Optimized Software Tools to Generate Large Spatio-Temporal Data Using the Datacubes Concept: Application to Crop Classification in Cap Bon, Tunisia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of a changing climate, monitoring agricultural systems is becoming increasingly important. Remote sensing products provide essential information for the crop classification application, which is used to produce thematic maps. High-resolution and regional-scale maps of agricultural land are required to develop better adapted future strategies. Nevertheless, the performance of crop classification using large spatio-temporal data remains challenging due to the difficulties in handling huge amounts of input data (different spatial and temporal resolutions). This paper proposes an innovative approach of remote sensing data management that was used to prepare the input data for the crop classification application. This classification was carried out in the Cap Bon region, Tunisia, to classify citrus groves among two other crop classes (olive groves and open field) using multi-temporal remote sensing data from Sentinel- 1 and Sentinel-2 satellite platforms. Thus, we described the new QGIS plugin "Model Management Tool (MMT)". This plugin was designed to manage large Earth observation (EO) data. This tool is based on the combination of two concepts: (i) the local nested grid (LNG) called Tuplekeys and (ii) Datacubes. Tuplekeys or special spatial regions were created within a LNG to allow a proper integration between the data of both sensors. The Datacubes concept allows to provide an arranged array of time-series multi-dimensional stacks (space, time and data) of gridded data. Two different classification processes were performed based on the selection of the input feature (the obtained time-series as input data: NDVI and NDVI + VV + VH) and on the most accurate algorithm for each scenario (22 tested classifiers). The obtained results revealed that the best classification performance and highest accuracy were obtained with the scenario using only optical-based information (NDVI), with an overall accuracy OA = 0.76. This result was obtained by support vector machine (SVM). As for the scenario relying on the combination of optical and SAR data (NDVI + VV + VH), it presented an OA = 0.58. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of the new data management tool in organizing the input classification data. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of optical data to provide acceptable classification performance especially for a complex landscape such as that of the Cap Bon. The information obtained from this work will allow the estimation of the water requirements of citrus orchards and the improvement of irrigation scheduling methodologies. Likewise, many future methodologies will certainly rely on the combination of Tuplekeys and Datacubes concepts which have been tested within the MMT tool.

TI  - U-Net for Taiwan Shoreline Detection from SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and global warming lead to changes in the sea level and shoreline, which pose a huge threat to island regions. Therefore, it is important to effectively detect the shoreline changes. Taiwan is a typical island, located at the junction of the East China Sea and the South China Sea in the Pacific Northwest, and is deeply affected by shoreline changes. In this research, Taiwan was selected as the study area. In this research, an efficient shoreline detection method was proposed based on the semantic segmentation U-Net model using the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of Taiwan island. In addition, the batch normalization (BN) module was added to the convolution layers in the U-Net architecture to further improve the generalization ability of U-Net and accelerate the training process. A self-built shoreline dataset was introduced to train the U-Net model and test its detection efficiency. The dataset consists of a total of 4029 SAR images covering all coastal areas of Taiwan. The training samples of the dataset were annotated by morphological processing and manual inspection. The segmentation results of U-Net were then processed by edge detection and morphological postprocessing to extract the shoreline. The experimental results showed that the proposed method could achieve a satisfactory detection performance compared with the related methods using the data provided by the Ministry of the Interior of Taiwan from 2016 to 2019 for different coastal landforms in Taiwan. Within a 5-pixel difference between the detected shoreline and the ground truth data, the F1-Meaure of the proposed method exceeded 80%. In addition, the potential of this method in shoreline change detection was validated with a sandbar located on the southwestern coast of Taiwan. Finally, the entire shoreline of Taiwan has been described by the proposed approach and the detected shoreline length was close to the actual length.

TI  - Landsat Data Based Prediction of Loblolly Pine Plantation Attributes in Western Gulf Region, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The suitability of using Landsat sensor variables to predict key stand attributes, including stand average dominant/codominant tree height (HT), mean diameter at breast height (DBH), the number of trees per hectare (NT), basal area per hectare (BA), and stand density index (SDI), of intensively managed loblolly pine plantations in the Western Gulf Region at the plot/stand level was assessed. In total, thirty Landsat sensor variables including six original bands, three vegetation indices, three Tasseled Cap transformed indices, and eighteen texture measure variables were used as predictors. Field data of 125 permanent plots located across east Texas and western Louisiana were used as reference data. Individual trees of those plots were measured at plot establishment (referred to as the first cycle measurement; average about 4.5 years old) and remeasured in three-year intervals (the second cycle measurement at approximately seven years old and the third cycle measurement at approximately 10 years old). Thus, field reference data represent stand development from open- (first cycle) to closed-canopy (third cycle). Models to predict stand HT, DBH, NT, BA, and SDI were developed by cycle using multiple linear regression (MLR) and also random forests (RF) methods. Results indicated that the first cycle stands HT, DBH, BA, and SDI were well predicted using the Landsat sensor variables with R-2 > 0.7 and low RMSEs. These relationships weakened with stand age, although still moderate with R-2 being around 0.45 for the second cycle measurement and became practically useless (R-2 < 0.30) for the third cycle measurement. For NT, no meaningful models were achieved regardless of the measurement cycle. The MLR and RF models were comparable in accuracy and had similar key predictors. Overall, the shortwave infrared bands, red band, and wetness index were the most important predictors, but their dominance declined with the cycle. Texture measure variables were relatively less important but a trend of increasing their importance with cycle was noted. Results show promise for operationally predicting stand variables for young pine plantations, an age class that typically presents significant challenges using conventional forest measurement methodologies. Potential methods to further improve model accuracy and how to use the results within the context of pine plantation management planning in the region were discussed.

TI  - Classifying Vegetation Types in Mountainous Areas with Fused High Spatial Resolution Images: The Case of Huaguo Mountain, Jiangsu, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study tested image fusion quality aiming at vegetation classification in the Kongquegou scenic location on the southern slope of Huaguo Mountain in Lianyungang, Jiangsu Province, China. Four fusion algorithms were used to fuse WorldView-2 multispectral and panchromatic images: GS (Gram-Schmidt) transform, Ehlers, Wavelet transform, and Modified IHS. The fusion effect was evaluated through visual comparison, quantitative index analysis, and vegetation classification accuracy. The study result revealed that GS and Wavelet transformation produced higher spectral fidelity and better-quality fusion images, followed by Modified IHS and Ehlers. In terms of vegetation classification, for the Wavelet transform, both spectral information and adding spatial structure provided higher accuracy and displayed suitability for vegetation classification in the selected area. Meanwhile, although the spectral features obtained better classification accuracy using the Modified IHS, adding spatial structure to the classification process produced less improvement and a lower robustness effect. The GS transform yielded better spectral fidelity but relatively low vegetation classification accuracy using spectral features only and combined spectral features and spatial structure. Lastly, the Ehlers method's vegetation classification results were similar to those of the GS transform image fusion method. Additionally, the accuracy was significantly improved in the fused images compared to the multispectral image. Overall, Wavelet transforms showed the best vegetation classification results in the study area among the four fusion algorithms.

TI  - Estimation of Evapotranspiration and Soil Water Content at a Regional Scale Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The timely and accurate estimation of soil water content (SWC) and evapotranspiration (ET) is of great significance in drought estimation, irrigation management, and water resources comprehensive utilization. The unsupervised classification was used to identify the crops in the region. Based on MOD16A2 and the meteorological data, a SEBS model was used to estimate the ET in the Jiefangzha Irrigation Field from 2011 to 2015. Based on the crop water stress index (CWSI), the SWC in 2014 was retrieved and verified with the measured SWC on different underlying surfaces (sunflower, corn, wheat, and pepper). The results showed that: (1) The positional accuracy of maize, sunflower, wheat, and pepper are 0.81, 0.80, 0.90, and 0.82, respectively; (2) The annual ET from 2011 to 2015 presented well the spatial distribution of the ET within the field; (3) The validation results of the estimated SWC on the underlying surface of wheat and sunflower showed a good robustness, the R-2 was 0.748 and 0.357, respectively, the RMSE was 2.61% and 2.309%, respectively, and the MAE was 2.249% and 1.975%, respectively. However, for maize and pepper with more irrigation times, the SWC estimation results, based on the CWSI were poor, indicating that the method was more sensitive to soil drought and suitable for the crop SWC estimation with less irrigation and drought tolerance. The results can provide a reference for the agricultural water resources management and the irrigation forecast at a regional scale.

TI  - Spatio-temporal correlation between human activity intensity and land surface temperature on the north slope of Tianshan Mountains
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on the spatio-temporal correlation between the intensity of human activities and the temperature of earth surfaces is of great significance in many aspects, including fully understanding the causes and mechanisms of climate change, actively adapting to climate change, pursuing rational development, and protecting the ecological environment. Taking the north slope of Tianshan Mountains, located in the arid area of northwestern China and extremely sensitive to climate change, as the research area, this study retrieves the surface temperature of the mountain based on MODIS data, while characterizing the intensity of human activities thereby data on the night light, population distribution and land use. The evolution characteristics of human activity intensity and surface temperature in the study area from 2000 to 2018 were analyzed, and the spatio-temporal correlation between them was further explored. It is found that: (1) The average human activity intensity (0.11) in the research area has kept relatively low since this century, and the overall trend has been slowly rising in a stepwise manner (0.0024 center dot a(-1)); in addition, the increase in human activity intensity has lagged behind that in construction land and population by 1-2 years. (2) The annual average surface temperature in the area is 7.18 degrees C with a pronounced growth. The rate of change (0.02 degrees C center dot a(-1)) is about 2.33 times that of the world. The striking boost in spring (0.068 degrees C center dot a(-1)) contributes the most to the overall warming trend. Spatially, the surface temperature is low in the south and high in the north, due to the prominent influence of the underlying surface characteristics, such as elevation and vegetation coverage. (3) The intensity of human activity and the surface temperature are remarkably positively correlated in the human activity areas there, showing a strong distribution in the east section and a weak one in the west section. The expression of its spatial differentiation and correlation is comprehensively affected by such factors as scopes of human activities, manifestations, and land-use changes. Vegetation-related human interventions, such as agriculture and forestry planting, urban greening, and afforestation, can effectively reduce the surface warming caused by human activities. This study not only puts forward new ideas to finely portray the intensity of human activities but also offers a scientific reference for regional human-land coordination and overall development.

TI  - Activity and Kinematics of Two Adjacent Freeze-Thaw-Related Landslides Revealed by Multisource Remote Sensing of Qilian Mountain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in temperatures and changing precipitation patterns resulting from climate change are accelerating the occurrence and development of landslides in cold regions, especially in permafrost environments. Although the boundary regions between permafrost and seasonally frozen ground are very sensitive to climate warming, slope failures and their kinematics remain barely characterized or understood in these regions. Here, we apply multisource remote sensing and field investigation to study the activity and kinematics of two adjacent landslides (hereafter referred to as "twin landslides") along the Datong River in the Qilian Mountains of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. After failure, there is no obvious change in the area corresponding to the twin landslides. Based on InSAR measurements derived from ALOS PALSAR-1 and -2, we observe significant downslope movements of up to 15 mm/day within the twin landslides and up to 5 mm/day in their surrounding slopes. We show that the downslope movements exhibit distinct seasonality; during the late thaw and early freeze season, a mean velocity of about 4 mm/day is observed, while during the late freeze and early thaw season the downslope velocity is nearly inactive. The pronounced seasonality of downslope movements during both pre- and post-failure stages suggest that the occurrence and development of the twin landslide are strongly influenced by freeze-thaw processes. Based on meteorological data, we infer that the occurrence of twin landslides are related to extensive precipitation and warm winters. Based on risk assessment, InSAR measurements, and field investigation, we infer that new slope failure or collapse may occur in the near future, which will probably block the Datong River and cause catastrophic disasters. Our study provides new insight into the failure mechanisms of slopes at the boundaries of permafrost and seasonally frozen ground.

TI  - Characteristics of Ozone Pollution and the Impacts of Related Meteorological Factors in Shanxi Province, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on environmental monitoring data and meteorological observation data of the Chinese major energy province, Shanxi, from 2015 to 2020, using the satellite remote sensing data of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder Instrument (AIRS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) in 2017, we analyzed the characteristics of surface ozone (O-3) pollution and its correlation with meteorological factors, as well as the vertical distribution of O-3 in typical pollution cities in Shanxi Province. The results showed that surface O-3 became the primary pollutant in Shanxi. Surface O-3 has shown a zonal distribution with a high level in the south and a low level in the north region since 2017. Surface O-3 pollution was severe in 2019, and the maximum daily 8 h running average of O-3 (MDA8 O-3) decreased, but annual mean O-3 in northern and central regions showed a slow rising trend in 2020. Comprehensive analyses of the influence of meteorological factors on surface O-3 indicated that O-3 pollution in Linfen, Yuncheng and Taiyuan was mainly caused by local photochemical reactions, while that in Jincheng, Xinzhou, Lvliang and Yangquan resulted from regional transports. O-3 volume mixing ratios (VMR) in the middle and lower troposphere generally increased with altitude, peaking at 120 ppbv at approximately 400 hPa. The positive vertical gradient of O-3 in the boundary layer was obvious in Taiyuan in summer and significant in the surface layer in Taiyuan and Linfen during winter and spring, which was associated with greater atmospheric dynamic stability and suppressed vertical mixing. Due to the lack of direct detection of O-3 in the lower troposphere in this region, O-3 vertical distribution retrieved by satellite observation is critical for the study of vertical mixing and transport of local O-3, as well as its regional transport characteristics.

TI  - Tree Species Classification Based on Fusion Images by GF-5 and Sentinel-2A
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystem detection and assessment usually requires accurate spatial distribution information of forest tree species. Remote sensing technology has been confirmed as the most important method for tree species acquisition, and space-borne hyperspectral imagery, with the advantages of high spectral resolution, provides a better possibility for tree species classification. However, the present in-orbit hyperspectral imager has proved to be too low in spatial resolution to meet the accuracy needs of tree species classification. In this study, we firstly explored and evaluated the effectiveness of the Gram-Schmidt (GS) Harmonic analysis fusion (HAF) method for image fusion of GaoFen-5 (GF-5) and Sentinel-2A. Then, the Integrated Forest Z-Score (IFZ) was used to extract forest information from the fused image. Next, the spectral and textural features of the fused image, and topographic features extracted from DEM were selected according to random forest importance ranking (Mean Decreasing Gini (MDG) and Mean Decreasing Accuracy (MDA)), and imported into the random forest classifier to complete tree species classification. The results showed that: comparing some evaluation factors such as information entropy, average gradient and standard deviation of the fused images, the GS fusion image was proven to have a higher degree of spatial integration and spectral fidelity. The random forest importance ranking showed that WBI, Aspect, NDNI, ARI2, FRI were more important for tree species classification. Both the classification accuracy and kappa coefficients of the fused images were significantly greatly improved when compared to those of original GF-5 images. The overall classification accuracy ranged from 61.17% to 86.93% for different feature combination scenarios, and accuracy of the selected method based on MDA achieved higher results (OA = 86.93%, Kappa = 0.85). This study demonstrated the feasibility of fusion of GF-5 and Sentinel-2A images for tree species classification, which further provides good reference for application of in-orbit hyperspectral images.

TI  - Interactions of Biosphere and Atmosphere within Longleaf Pine Restoration Areas
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Longleaf pine forests are economically and culturally valued ecosystems in the southeastern United States. Efforts to restore the longleaf pine ecosystem have risen dramatically over the past three decades. Longleaf pine restoration generally involves varying degrees of forest harvesting and frequent applications of prescribed fire. Thus, it is important to understand their interactions with the atmosphere on a large scale. In this study, we analyzed 14 parameters of aerosols, gasses, and energy from three areas with longleaf pine restoration (named Bladen in eastern NC, Escambia in southern AL and northern FL, and Kisatchie in central LA, USA) from 2000 to 2021 using multiple satellites. Averaged across the areas, the monthly aerosol optical depth at 483.5 nm was about 0.022, and the monthly aerosol single scattering albedo was 0.97. Black carbon column mass density averaged 7.46 x 10(-7) kg cm(-2) across these areas, but Kisatchie had a higher monthly dust column mass density (2.35 x 10(-4) kg cm(-2)) than Bladen or Escambia. The monthly total column ozone and CO concentration averaged about 285 DU and 135 ppbv across the three areas. Monthly SO2 column mass density was significantly higher in Bladen (4.42 x 10(-6) kg cm(-2)) than in Escambia and Kisatchie. The monthly surface albedo in Escambia (0.116) was significantly lower than in the other areas. The monthly total cloud area fraction averaged about 0.456 across the three areas. Sensible and latent heat net flux and Bowen ratios significantly differed among the three areas. Bowen ratio and total cloud area fraction were not significantly correlated. Net shortwave of the forest surface averaged about 182.62 W m(-2) across the three areas. The monthly net longwave was much lower in Bladen (-90.46 W m(-2)) than in Escambia and Kisatchie. These results provide the baseline information on the spatial and temporal patterns of interactions between longleaf pine forests under restoration and the atmosphere and can be incorporated into models of climate change.

TI  - Marine Oil Spill Detection from SAR Images Based on Attention U-Net Model Using Polarimetric and Wind Speed Information
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of marine trade, marine oil pollution is becoming increasingly severe, which can exert damage to the health of the marine environment. Therefore, detection of marine oil spills is important for effectively starting the oil-spill cleaning process and the protection of the marine environment. The polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) technique has been applied to the detection of marine oil spills in recent years. However, most current studies still focus on using the simple intensity or amplitude information of SAR data and the detection results are not reliable enough. This paper presents a deep-learning-based method to detect oil spills on the marine surface from Sentinel-1 PolSAR satellite images. Specifically, attention gates are added to the U-Net network architecture, which ensures that the model focuses more on feature extraction. In the training process of the model, sufficient Sentinel-1 PolSAR images are selected as sample data. The polarimetric information from the PolSAR dataset and the wind-speed information of the marine surface are both taken into account when training the model and detecting oil spills. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better performance than the traditional methods, and taking into account both the polarimetric and wind-speed information, can indeed improve the oil-spill detection results. In addition, the model shows pleasing performance in capturing the fine details of the boundaries of the oil-spill patches.

TI  - Characterizing the Long-Term Landscape Dynamics of a Typical Cloudy Mountainous Area in Northwest Yunnan, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed knowledge of landscape dynamics is crucial for many applications, from resource management to ecosystem service assessments. However, identifying the spatial distribution of the landscape using optical remote sensing techniques is difficult in mountainous areas, primarily due to cloud cover and topographic relief. Our study uses stable classification samples from mountainous areas to investigate an integrated approach that addresses large volumes of cloud-cover data (with associated data gaps) and extracts landscape time series (LTS) with a high time-frequency resolution. We applied this approach to map LTS in a typical cloudy mountainous area (Erhai watershed in northwestern Yunnan, China) using dense Landsat stacks, and then we also used the classified results to investigate the spatial-temporal landscape changes in the study area at biennial intervals. The overall accuracy of the landscape classification ranged from 81.75% to 88.18%. The results showed highly dynamic processes in the landscape throughout the study period. Forest was the main land cover type, covering approximately 39.19% to 41.68% of the total study area. Alpine meadow showed fluctuating trends, with a net loss of 11.22% and an annual reduction rate of -0.4%. Shrub cover increased by 1.26%, and water bodies showed a small decrease in area, resulting in an overall net change of -0.03%. Built-up land and farmland areas continued to expand, and their annual growth rates were 1.52% and 1.06%, respectively. Bare land showed the highest loss, with a net change of 228.97 km(2). In the Erhai watershed, all the landscape classes changed or transitioned into other classes, and a substantial decrease in bare land occurred. The biennial LTS maps allow us to fully understand the spatially and temporally complex change processes occurring in landscape classes; these changes would not be observable at coarse temporal intervals (e.g., 5-10 years). Our study highlights the importance of increasing the temporal resolution in landscape change studies to support sustainable land resource management strategies and integrate landscape planning for environmental conservation.

TI  - Integrating Remote Sensing and Spatiotemporal Analysis to Characterize Artificial Vegetation Restoration Suitability in Desert Areas: A Case Study of Mu Us Sandy Land
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major barriers to hindering the sustainable development of the terrestrial environment is the desertification process, and revegetation is one of the most significant duties in anti-desertification. Desertification deteriorates land ecosystems through species decline, and remote sensing is becoming the most effective way to monitor desertification. Mu Us Sandy Land is the fifth largest desert and the representative area under manmade vegetation restorations in China. Therefore, it is essential to understand the spatiotemporal characteristics of artificial desert transformation for seeking the optimal revegetation location for future restoration planning. However, there are no previous studies focusing on exploring regular patterns between the spatial distribution of vegetation restoration and human-related geographical features. In this study, we use Landsat satellite data from 1986 to 2020 to achieve annual monitoring of vegetation change by a threshold segmentation method, and then use spatiotemporal analysis with Open Street Map (OSM) data to explore the spatiotemporal distribution pattern between vegetation occurrence and human-related features. We construct an artificial vegetation restoration suitability index (AVRSI) by considering human-related features and topographical factors, and we assess artificial suitability for vegetation restoration by mapping methods based on that index and the vegetation distribution pattern. The AVRSI can be commonly used for evaluating restoration suitability in Sandy areas and it is tested acceptable in Mu Us Sandy Land. Our results show during this period, the segmentation threshold and vegetation area of Mu Us Sandy Land increased at rates of 0.005/year and 264.11 km(2)/year, respectively. Typically, we found the artificial restoration vegetation suitability in Mu Us area spatially declines from southeast to northwest, but eventually increases in the most northwest region. This study reveals the revegetation process in Mu Us Sandy Land by figuring out its spatiotemporal vegetation change with human-related features and maps the artificial revegetation suitability.

TI  - A Convolutional Neural Network for Large-Scale Greenhouse Extraction from Satellite Images Considering Spatial Features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning-based semantic segmentation technology is widely applied in remote sensing and has achieved excellent performance in remote sensing image target extraction. Greenhouses play an important role in the development of agriculture in China. However, the rapid expansion of greenhouses has had a series of impacts on the environment. Therefore, the extraction of large-scale greenhouses is crucial for the sustainable development of agriculture and environmental governance. It is difficult for existing methods to acquire precise boundaries. Therefore, we propose a spatial convolutional long short-term memory structure, which can fully consider the spatial continuity of ground objects. We use multitask learning to improve the network's ability to extract image boundaries and promote convergence through auxiliary loss. We propose a superpixel optimization module to optimize the main-branch results of network semantic segmentation using more precise boundaries obtained by advanced superpixel segmentation techniques. Compared with other mainstream methods, our proposed structure can better consider spatial information and obtain more accurate results. We chose Shandong Province, China, as the study area and used Gaofen-1 satellite remote sensing images to create a new greenhouse dataset. Our method achieved an F1 score of 77%, a significant improvement over mainstream semantic segmentation networks, and it could extract greenhouse results with more precise boundaries. We also completed large-scale greenhouse mapping for Shandong Province, and the results show that our proposed modules have great potential in greenhouse extraction.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Change of Urban Ecologic Environment Quality Based on RSEI-Taking Meizhou City, China as an Example
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - An ecological index that is constructed based on remote sensing images can enable a rapid evaluation of the quality of the urban ecological environment and can provide a scientific basis for the construction of urban ecological civilization. Taking Meizhou City, in Guangdong in China, as a study area, based on the Landsat TM/OLI and MODIS remote sensing data, this paper extracts the total primary productivity (GPP), land surface temperature (LST), humidity component (Wetness), and bare soil index (SI), which represent the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) evaluation indicators. The greenness, heat, humidity, and dryness in the indicators are used to characterize the quality of the regional ecological environment and its change characteristics. The results show that: (1) the high-quality areas of ecological environment in the study area are increasing, and the proportion of high-grade RSEI areas has increased from 61.7% to 66.2%. (2) About 26.3% of the area in the study area has an optimized ecological environment quality. (3) The correlation between POI and each index is significant, among which GPP and LST have a high correlation with RSEI, while POI and RSEI have a moderately negative correlation. (4) MODIS data are suitable for regional ecological environmental quality assessments. In the future, research on RSEI data sources and processing efficiency and the spatiotemporal changes of ecological quality and environmental factors can be strengthened, and the sustainable development of ecological protection and urban construction planning can be explored.

TI  - Carbon Sink Performance Evaluation and Socioeconomic Effect of Urban Aggregated Green Infrastructure Based on Sentinel-2A Satellite
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aggregated green infrastructure is the only element that has a relatively concentrated and well-functioning carbon sink in the city. It plays an important role in achieving carbon neutrality in urban areas with dense functions and scarce carbon sink resources. However, in contrast to other regions, aggregated green infrastructure carbon sink performance is more influenced by socioeconomic activities in urban centres. There is a lack of research on the impact between carbon sink performance and socioeconomic activities at the urban scale. In this study, we evaluated the carbon sink performance (i.e., carbon sink and location entropy) of aggregated green infrastructure and its interaction with socioeconomic activities at the urban scale based on Sentinel-2A satellite. The results showed that: (1) Aggregate green infrastructures with high carbon sink performance have significant aggregation characteristics in urban areas. (2) Aggregated green infrastructure with poor carbon sink performance tended to be surrounded by dense socioeconomic activities. Our study provides a new approach to the assessment of carbon sink performance of aggregated green infrastructure at the urban scale. More importantly, we make a new attempt to assess the association between carbon sink performance and socioeconomic activities of urban aggregated green infrastructure. These results point to a new direction for the realization of carbon neutrality in cities.

TI  - DeepForest: Novel Deep Learning Models for Land Use and Land Cover Classification Using Multi-Temporal and -Modal Sentinel Data of the Amazon Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) mapping is a powerful tool for monitoring large areas. For the Amazon rainforest, automated mapping is of critical importance, as land cover is changing rapidly due to forest degradation and deforestation. Several research groups have addressed this challenge by conducting local surveys and producing maps using freely available remote sensing data. However, automating the process of large-scale land cover mapping remains one of the biggest challenges in the remote sensing community. One issue when using supervised learning is the scarcity of labeled training data. One way to address this problem is to make use of already available maps produced with (semi-) automated classifiers. This is also known as weakly supervised learning. The present study aims to develop novel methods for automated LULC classification in the cloud-prone Amazon basin (Brazil) based on the labels from the MapBiomas project, which include twelve classes. We investigate different fusion techniques for multi-spectral Sentinel-2 data and synthetic aperture radar Sentinel-1 time-series from 2018. The newly designed deep learning architectures-DeepForest-1 and DeepForest-2-utilize spatiotemporal characteristics, as well as multi-scale representations of the data. In several data scenarios, the models are compared to state-of-the-art (SotA) models, such as U-Net and DeepLab. The proposed networks reach an overall accuracy of up to 75.0%, similar to the SotA models. However, the novel approaches outperform the SotA models with respect to underrepresented classes. Forest, savanna and crop were mapped best, with F1 scores up to 85.0% when combining multi-modal data, compared to 81.6% reached by DeepLab. Furthermore, in a qualitative analysis, we highlight that the classifiers sometimes outperform the inaccurate labels.

TI  - Squalls and Tornadoes over the European Territory of Russia on May 15, 2021: Diagnosis and Modeling
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Peculiarities were studied of formation of severe convective events, including a long-lived squall and several tornadoes observed over the European territory of Russia on May 15, 2021. The event became one of the most destructive in the forest zone of the region over the past 35 years, with the total area of stand-replacing windthrows exceeding 152 km(2). The event was formed at a relatively low moisture content, but other conditions were exceptionally favorable for the formation of strong squalls and tornadoes characterized by a combination of high convective instability and strong wind shear. This resulted in the formation of several supercells and a mesoscale convective complex. The characteristics of cloud systems that caused squalls and tornadoes were analyzed based on satellite and radar data. Several characteristic signatures were identified at the cloud top, including long-lived overshooting tops that coincide with the area of destruction. The maximum reflectivity in some clusters exceeded 60 dBZ, the presence of a mesocyclone was noted in the radial velocity field during the tornado generation. Numerical experiments were performed to reproduce the event using the WRF regional atmospheric model with different initial conditions, which, however, cannot be considered successful.

TI  - Winter Ice Dynamics in a Semi-Closed Ice-Covered Sea: Numerical Simulations and Satellite Data
T2  - FLUIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The White Sea is a small shallow sea covered by ice in winter. There are very few numerical models of this sea. For the ice-free sea, much data has been collected, but for winter only a small amount (satellite data only). We use our finite-element numerical model Jasmine and satellite data to trace the ice advection and exchange between parts of the White Sea. The aim of the investigation is to adjust the model to adequately reproduce the White Sea ice dynamics. By comparing satellite data on sea-ice concentration with the model prediction, we show that the model describes sea-ice dynamics well, and use it to estimate ice flow from bays to the middle part of the sea and ice exchange through the narrow strait. Ice exchange between neighbouring parts of the sea is shown to be intensive, with large dispersion compared to the time-mean, and bays are shown to be ice producers, while the Gorlo straight is shown to accept ice. We demonstrate that the model is a tool that can be used to better understand the winter regime of the sea.

TI  - Effect of Land Use/Cover Change on Soil Wind Erosion in the Yellow River Basin since the 1990s
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - "Ecological conservation and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin" is one of the fundamental national strategies related to national food security and ecological security in China. Evaluating the impact of land use/cover change (LUCC) on soil erosion is valuable to improving regional ecological environments and sustainable development. This study focused on the Yellow River Basin and used remote sensing data, the soil wind erosion modulus (SWEM) calculated with the revised wind erosion equation (RWEQ), to analyze the impact of regional scale LUCC from 1990 to 2018 on soil wind erosion. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The total area of cultivated land, grass land, and unused land decreased, with a total reduction of 11,038.86 km(2); total areas of forest land and built-up areas increased, increased by 2746.61 and 8356.77 km(2), respectively, with differences within the region in these LUCC trends at different periods. From 1990 to 2000, the area of cultivated land increased by 1958.36 km(2) and built-up land area increased by 1331.90 km(2). The areas of forestland, grass land, water area, and unused land decreased. From 2000 to 2010, the area of cultivated land and grass land decreased by 4553.77 and 2351.39 km(2), respectively, whereas the areas of forestland and built-up land significantly increased. From 2010 to 2018, the area of cultivated land and grass land continued to decrease, and the area of built-up land continued to increase. (2) Since the 1990s, the SWEM has generally declined (Slope(1990-2018) = -0.38 t/(ha center dot a)). Total amount of wind erosion in 2018 decreased by more than 50% compared with the amount in 1990. During this period, the intensity of wind erosion first increased and then decreased. In terms of the SWEM, 90.63% of the study area showed a decrease. (3) From 1990 to 2018, LUCC reduced the total amount of soil wind erosion by 15.57 million tons. From 1990 to 2000, the conversion of grass land/forest land to cultivated land and the expansion of desert resulted in a significant increase in soil wind erosion. From 2000 to 2018, the amount of soil wind erosion decreased at a rate of about 1.22 million tons/year, and the total amount of soil wind erosion decreased by 17.8921 million tons. During this period, the contribution rate of ecological programs (e.g., conversion of cultivated land to forest land and grass land, ecological engineering construction projects, etc.) to reduction of regional soil wind erosion was 59.13%, indicating that ecological programs have a positive role in reducing soil wind erosion intensity. The sustainable development of the ecological environment of the Yellow River Basin should be continued through strengthening ecological restoration and protection, to further consolidate gains made in this fragile ecosystem. This study provides scientific and technological support and relevant policy recommendations for the sustainable development of the Yellow River ecosystem under global change.

TI  - Large Mammary Paget Disease without Underlying Breast Carcinoma
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Mammary Paget disease is an uncommon type of breast cancer. Redness, scaling, and thickness involving the nipple and areola are common clinical symptoms. Invasive breast cancer was found in nearly 90% of these patients. Only a few cases of mammary Paget disease with no underlying cancer have been described, with a better prognosis. Treatment options include wide excision or mastectomy. However, if the lesion is very extensive, breast reconstruction may be required. We reported a rare case of extensive Paget disease in a 65-year-old woman who had a 7-year history of a 14 x 19 cm progressively enlarging erythematous scaling lesion that covered her entire left breast. No evidence of related malignancy or metastatic lesion was seen. A left mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy and immediate pedicled transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap reconstruction was chosen. There is uncertainty about axillary node metastasis since multiple enlarged and palpable left axillary lymph nodes were seen. She had axillary lymph node dissection instead. A histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of Paget disease of the nipple in the absence of underlying breast cancer and there was no evidence of axillary lymph node metastasis. This article emphasizes the need to pay close attention to diagnosis, progression, and treatment of the disease.

TI  - Detecting land surface water changes in the Upper Mzingwane sub-catchment using remotely sensed data
T2  - AQUA-WATER INFRASTRUCTURE ECOSYSTEMS AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, water is acknowledged as indispensable. It is essential for both human life and environmental needs. However, surface water resources are threatened by human and climatic influences, which may result in changes in size and density. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the normalised difference water index (NDWI), modified normalised difference water index (MNDWI) and automated water extraction index (AWEI) in detecting land surface water changes using Landsat satellite data. The results showed that the AWEI performed considerably better than the MNDWI and NDWI for extracting water surface area in the Upper Mzingwane sub-catchment, with an overall accuracy of 0.93 and a kappa coefficient of 0.82. The MNDWI and NDWI had overall accuracy/kappa values of 0.88/0.74 and 0.89/0.73, respectively. The AWEI can enhance surface water features while effectively suppressing or eliminating pollution and noise from surrounding vegetation and muddy soil. NDWI/MDWI water information is often mixed with pollution noise, vegetation and muddy soil, overestimating the area of water. All the applied indices indicate a progressive loss in the surface area of the water bodies in the sub-catchment. The decrease in water surface area could be a result of degradation, as it coincided with a decrease in vegetation cover and an increase in degraded areas. Future research needs to investigate the hydrological response of the sub-catchment to the potential influence of climate, variability, change, and land use land cover (LULC) changes.

T2  - Anesthesia and pain medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sustained interest is needed in the characteristics of critical incidents in pediatric anesthesia and related changes, for determining the causes and degree of potential harm; this will also improve the quality of medical care. This study aimed to analyze the incidence of critical incidents recorded in 2014-2019, and to compare them with those in 2008-2013.METHODS: Critical incidents associated with pediatric anesthesia, including cardiac arrest, recorded in a voluntary departmental reporting system between January 2014 and December 2019 were compared with those reported between January 2008 and August 2013 using chi-square test.RESULTS: We identified 295 (0.55%) critical incidents from 53,541 cases of pediatric anesthesia (3,471 cardiothoracic surgeries); this is consistent with the previously reported incidence of 0.46%. Among the critical incidents, the incidences of adverse events, sentinel event, near miss case and no-harm events were 93.9%, 1.7%, 0%, and 6.1% in 2014-2019, whereas those were 98.3%, 2.6%, 1.7%, and 0% in 2008-2013 (P = 0.023, 0.686, 0.080, and < 0.001, respectively). Cardiac arrest accounted for 25 (8.5%) cases of the 295 critical events, which significantly lower than that previously reported (18.3%; P = 0.020). Human factor-related events accounted for 61.0% of all critical incidences; this was similar to the previous data (58.5%).CONCLUSIONS: Over six years, there has been no significant difference in the total incidence of critical events. Despite the decrease in the incidence of serious critical events, perioperative care in pediatric anesthesia can be further improved.

TI  - Application of Machine Learning in Forecasting the Impact of Mining Deformation: A Case Study of Underground Copper Mines in Poland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Open access to SAR data from the Sentinel 1 missions allows analyses of long-term ground surface changes. The current data-acquisition frequency of 12 days facilitates the continuous monitoring of phenomena such as volcanic and tectonic activity or mining-related deformations. SAR data are increasingly also used as input data in forecasting phenomena on the basis of machine learning. This article presents the possibility of using selected machine learning algorithms in forecasting the influence of underground mining activity on the ground surface. The study was performed for a mining protective area with a surface of over 500 km(2) and located in western Poland. The ground surface displacements were calculated for the period from November 2014 to July 2021, with the use of the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) method. The forecasts were performed for a total of 22 identified subsidence troughs. Each of the troughs was provided with two profiles, with a total of more than 10,000 identified points. The selected algorithms served to prepare 180-day displacement forecasts. The best results (significantly better than the baseline) were obtained with the ARIMA and Holt models. Linear models also provided better results than the baseline and their performance was very good at up to 2 months forecasting. Tree-based models including their sophisticated ensemble versions: bagging (Random Forest, Extra Trees) and boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Gradient Boosting, Hist Gradient Boosting) cannot be used for this type of predictions since Decision Trees are not able to extrapolate and thus are not a valid stand-alone tool for forecasting in this type of problems. A combination of satellite remote sensing data and machine learning facilitated both the simultaneous quasi-permanent monitoring of ground surface displacements and their forecasting in a relatively long time period.

TI  - Identification of Paddy Varieties from Landsat 8 Satellite Image Data Using Spectral Unmixing Method in Indramayu Regency, Indonesia
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Indramayu Regency is the highest rice producer in West Java province, Indonesia. According to the Central Statistics Agency (BPS), in 2021, rice production in 2020 reached 1,365,435.39 tons of GKG (milled dry grain). Technological developments in the food sector produce various kinds of premium quality rice and rice varieties resistant to climate change, such as Ciherang, Inpari 32 HDB and IR 64. The regular monitoring of specific rice varieties over large areas effectively maintains the quality and quantity of rice production. This study used remote sensing data to monitor rice conditions and distribution based on the spectral unmixing method. The spectral unmixing method was used to identify the percentage of the presence of a pure object in a pixel. The results obtained in this study were images of the endmember fractions of rice varieties and areas of dominant rice varieties used in the Indramayu district. The dominant variety detected with the processing results was the Inpari 32 HDB variety, with an area of 30,738.64 hectares. In comparison, varieties other than Inpari 32 HDB were also detected in several areas in the Indramayu district, with an area of 12,192.68 hectares.

AB  - This article explores the characteristic features of simple hunter-gatherer societies. It is less interested in the empirical diversity of such foraging groups and their respective peculiarities than in their shared structural characteristics. First and foremost, it focuses on how these societies refrained from systematic stockpiling and on the general equality among their members. The contribution starts by discussing the evolution of simple hunter-gatherer societies but concentrates on reconstructing the entanglement and structural integration of their strategies for subsistence, their social structure, and worldview. It does not aim at presenting new empirical findings, but at developing a structural or rather sociologically elementary description of this type of social organization.

TI  - Systematic Review of Parotid Gland Sarcomas: Multi-Variate Analysis of Clinicopathologic Findings, Therapeutic Approaches and Oncological Outcomes That Affect Survival Rate
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Primary sarcomas of the parotid gland are rare malignancies of mesenchymal origin for which there is no generally well-defined treatment guideline. The aim of this study was to analyze, through the review of the literature, the factors affecting the prognosis of patients with primary sarcoma of the parotid gland. Size/extension at the diagnosis and the sarcoma's histotype were the most important prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis showed that surgery performed on the tumor was the only parameter affecting long-term survival. In particular, total parotidectomy with preservation or, in the most advanced cases, with the sacrifice of facial nerve should be performed at any age independently of tumor histology. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature of sarcoma of the parotid gland in order to analyze the main factors affecting survival rate. A systematic literature review was performed between January 1990 to November 2021, and 88 patients affected by parotid gland sarcomas were included. The most common histological types were Rhabdomyosarcoma and Synovial Sarcoma. From our review, it emerges that primary sarcomas of the parotid glands are locally aggressive but show low tendency to metastasize to the lymph nodes of the neck and that surgery (i.e., total or radical parotidectomy) is the main approach for their treatment. The global overall survival (OS) is 52% at 5 years and 34.1% at 10 years. The OS for T1, T2, T3, T4 tumor at 5 years of follow up is 80.0%, 66.5%, 56.7% and 33.3%, respectively. Size/extension at the diagnosis and the sarcoma's histotype are the most important prognostic factors. Multivariate analysis showed that surgery (total or radical parotidectomy) performed on the tumor (p = 0.0008) was the only parameter that significantly affected the OS. Among the other variables, age (younger), use of adjuvant therapy and lymph node metastasis showed borderline significative values (p = 0.05). Our analysis suggests that, when a primitive parotid sarcoma is diagnosed, total or radical parotidectomy should be performed at any age independent of tumor histology. Because regional lymph node metastases from parotid sarcomas are uncommon, alternative strategies (e.g., close follow-up by imaging and evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes) should be pursued before lymph node (selective/radical) dissection.

TI  - A Methodology for National Scale Coastal Landcover Mapping in New Zealand
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite earth observation data has become fundamental in efforts to map coastal change at large geographic scales. Research has generally focussed on extracting the instantaneous waterline position from time-series of satellite images to interpret long-term trends. The use of this proxy can, however, be uncertain because the waterline is sensitive to marine conditions and beach gradient. In addition, the technique disregards potentially useful data stored in surrounding pixels. In this paper, we describe a pixel-based technique to analyse coastal change. A hybrid rule-based and machine learning methodology was developed using a combination of Sentinel multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar composite imagery. The approach was then used to provide the first national-scale pixel-based landcover classification for the open coast of New Zealand. Nine landcover types were identified including vegetation, rock, and sedimentary classes that are common on beaches (dark sand, light sand, and gravel). Accuracy was assessed at national scale (overall accuracy: 86%) and was greater than 90% when normalised for class area. Using a combination of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar data improved overall accuracy by 14% and enhanced the separation of coastal sedimentary classes. Comparison against a previous classification approach of sandy coasts indicated improvements of 30% in accuracy. The outputs and code are freely available and open-source providing a new framework for per-pixel coastal landcover mapping for all regions where public earth observation data is available.

TI  - Predicting and Mapping Potential Fire Severity for Risk Analysis at Regional Level Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite being a natural ecological process, wildfires are dramatic events that, accelerated by global change, could negatively affect ecosystem services depending on their severity level. However, because of data processing constraints, fire severity has been mostly neglected in risk analysis (especially at regional levels). Indeed, previous studies addressing fire severity focused mainly on analyzing single fire events, preventing the projection of the results over large areas. Although, building and projecting robust models of fire severity to integrate into risk analysis is of main importance to best anticipate decisions. Here, taking advantage of free data-processing platforms, such as Google Earth Engine, we use more than 1000 fire records from Western Italy and Southern France in the years 2004-2017, to assess the performance of random forest models predicting the relativized delta normalized burn ratio (rdNBR) used as proxy of fire severity. Furthermore, we explore the explanatory capacity and meaning of several variables related to topography, vegetation, and burning conditions. To show the potentialities of this approach for operational purposes, we projected the model for one of the regions (Sardinia) within the study area. Results showed that machine learning algorithms explain up to 75% of the variability in rdNBR, with variables related to vegetation amount and topography being the most important. These results highlight the potential usefulness of these tools for mapping fire severity in risk assessments.

AB  - Introduction. The Italian version of the Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI) may help assess shoulder function in patients with shoulder problems, especially athletes.Objective. Translate and cross-culturally adapt UEFI into Italian; veri-fy UEFI validity and reliability in professional and amateur athletes with upper limb musculoskeletal disorders, shoulder, in particular. Methods. This study was conducted with 150 participants with musculoskele-tal disorders of the upper limb. UEFI, the short version of the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scale (Quick DASH), the Shoulder Pain and Disabil-ity Index, and the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) were administered. Acceptability was assessed in terms of refusal rate, rates of missing respons-es, and administration time; test-retest reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach's alpha coefficient, and validity was assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficients.Results. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the UEFI on test and retest were alpha = 0.979 and alpha = 0.985, respectively. The average measure ICC was 0.917. The UEFI score demonstrated strong negative correlations with SPADI total score (-0.636), Quick DASH score (-0.685), and SF-36 score (-0.327).Conclusions. The Italian version of UEFI is acceptable, valid, and reliable.

TI  - Deforestation Detection in the Amazon Using DeepLabv3+Semantic Segmentation Model Variants
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon rainforest spreads across nine countries and covers nearly one-third of South America, being 69% inside Brazilian borders. It represents more than half of the remaining tropical forest on Earth and covers the catchment basin of the Amazon river on which 20% of the surface fresh water on the planet flows. Such an ecosystem produces large quantities of water vapor, helping regulate rainfall regimes in most of South America, with strong economic implications: for instance, by irrigating crops and pastures, and supplying water for the main hydroelectric plants in the continent. Being the natural habitat of one-tenth of the currently known species, the Amazon also has enormous biotechnological potential. Among the major menaces to the Amazon is the extension of agricultural and cattle farming, forest fires, illegal mining and logging, all directly associated with deforestation. Preserving the Amazon is obviously essential, and it is well-known that remote sensing provides effective tools for environmental monitoring. This work presents a deforestation detection approach based on the DeepLabv3+, a fully convolutional deep learning model devised for semantic segmentation. The proposed method extends the original DeepLabv3+ model, aiming at properly dealing with a strong class imbalanced problem and improving the delineation quality of deforestation polygons. Experiments were devised to evaluate the proposed method in terms of the sensitivity to the weighted focal loss hyperparameters-through an extensive grid search-and the amount of training data, and compared its performance to previous deep learning methods proposed for deforestation detection. Landsat OLI-8 images of a specific region in the Amazon were used in such evaluation. The results indicate that the variants of the proposed method outperformed previous works in terms of the F1-score and Precision metrics. Additionally, more substantial performance gains were observed in the context of smaller volumes of training data. When the evaluated methods were trained using four image tiles, the proposed method outperformed its counterparts by approximately +10% in terms of F1-score (from 63% to 73%); when the methods were trained with only one image tile, the performance difference in terms of F1-score achieved approximately +18% (from 49% to 67%).

TI  - Dynamics of forest conversion and climate trends in the Madeira river basin
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Madeira River basin is an example of an important portion of the Amazon region that is characterized by a high rate of conversion of forest into pastures and urban centers, evidencing an accelerated transformation in land cover and use with significant anthropic activity over the last three decades, which configures a potential impact in terms of modifying the climate behavior of the region. The present work seeks to analyze, in the Madeira River basin, the hydroclimatic impacts through the study of the variability of the two main components of the water balance and the energy balance at the scale of a watershed, namely precipitation and evapotranspiration, with additional emphasis on the temperature, which has served as a world reference to specify and demarcate changes in climate, given its space-time dynamics of anthropic occupation. More specifically, the occupancy history was initially analyzed using MODIS images for the period 2001-2013. In addition, precipitation data from the CHIRPS satellite product (1981-2017), evapotranspiration data determined by the SSEBop algorithm (2002-2017) via the sensor that produces the MODIS image and surface temperature of the MODIS satellite product (2001-2017) were examined, being such information treated as geospatial variables distributed in the study area. An extensive evaluation study regarding the identification of the presence or not of linear hydroclimatic trends in the Madeira River basin was carried out using the Mann-Kendall test. Although some trends were captured in the analyzed time series, the results obtained also showed that, given the limited database currently available, there is not necessarily a direct and clear relationship between the effect of human occupation and the climate regime of the basin, in contrast to the scientific framework recommended worldwide warning of climate change in the Anthropocene. In part, the high climate variability in the study region imposes limits with respect to clearly understand and separate the signals that can be attributed to the change in land cover and use from the signals associated with climate change that act on broader spatio-temporal scales. In this sense, new studies on monitoring hydrometeorological and hydroclimatic phenomena with corresponding measurements at different scales should be encouraged to better understand the processes of aggregation and disaggregation of the physical mechanisms acting at the scale of a watershed.

TI  - Secular Trends in Global Tides Derived From Satellite Radar Altimetry
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that tides are subject to considerable changes on secular time scales. However, these studies rely on sea level observations from tide gauges that are predominantly located in coastal and shelf regions and therefore, the large-scale patterns remain uncertain. Now, for the first time, satellite radar altimetry (TOPEX/Poseidon & Jason series) has been used to study worldwide linear trends in tidal harmonic constants of four major tides (M-2, S-2, O-1, and K-1). This study demonstrates both the potential and challenges of using satellite data for the quantification of such long-term changes. Two alternative methods were implemented. In the first method, tidal harmonic constants were estimated for consecutive 4-year periods, from which the linear change was then estimated. In the second method, the estimation of linear trends in the tidal constants of the four tides was integrated in the harmonic analysis. First, both methods were assessed by application to tide gauge data that were sub-sampled to the sampling scheme of the satellites. Thereafter the methods were applied to the real satellite data. Results show both statistically significant decreases and increases in amplitude up to 1 mm/year and significant phase changes up to similar to 0.1 deg/year. The level of agreement between altimeter-derived trends and estimates from tide gauge data differs per region and per tide.

TI  - Impacts of temperature-rainfall and land use/land cover changes on the hydrological regime in the Muhuri River basin, Northeast India
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to assess the impact of temperature-rainfall (TR) and land use/land cover (LULC) on the hydrological regime of a forested watershed. The authors consulted meteorological, hydrological, and remote sensing data in this research work. The study applied statistical techniques like regression and analysis of variation (ANOVA), which have been used to analyze the variability of TR and LULC and their impact on the hydrological regime of the river. To analyze the variability, the whole study period (1986-2016) was divided into two phases, i.e., 1986-2000 (Phase I) and 2001-2016 (Phase II). The statistical analyses proved that within the study period, water discharge, water level, hydraulic radius, and flow velocity experienced variation significantly (p value < 0.05) except for wetted perimeter (p value > 0.05). All the variables have decreased considerably in the second phase of the study period, i.e., in the 2001-2016 periods. Moreover, phase-wise seasonal analysis proved that the variations during monsoon and non-monsoon are lacking and prominent, respectively. The response of hydraulic variables to temperature-rainfall proved that the hydraulic variables had an insignificant correlation (R = 0.15 to 0.41) with the annual and the monsoon rainfall, while significant relation (R = - 0.26 to 0.78) was observed with the non-monsoon rainfall and temperature (maximum and minimum). There was a significant variation (p value 0.00) of LULC change in both phases. Statistical analyses proved that among the two phases of the study, the mean value of the forest class decreased significantly (from 550.37 to 425.67 km(2)). In contrast, rubber plantations increased extensively (from 21.36 to 128.36 km(2)) in comparison to the other LULC classes. Statistical analysis proved that the LULC change is very much responsible for the hydrological modifications rather than the rainfall.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen-3, the first high-resolution C-band multipolarization synthetic aperture radar satellite from China, has been in orbit for 5 years. It is significant for evaluating the positioning accuracy of Gaofen-3 products and determining the possibility of improvement. In this study, 338 Gaofen-3 images for six imaging modes from 16 test fields in China were selected, and 363 ground control points were used as independent checkpoints to verify positioning accuracy. The test results show that the average positioning accuracy of the six modes in the slant range direction was between - 27.52 and - 17.32 m. The average positioning accuracy of the six modes in the azimuth direction was between - 17.21 and 2.4 m. The comparative experiments under the same imaging conditions demonstrate that the on-orbit state of Gaofen-3 is relatively stable. The internal electronic delay of the instrument and the azimuth "bistatic error" of the Gaofen-3 image rational function location model have not been eliminated. There is room for further improvement in the positioning accuracy of the Gaofen-3 standard product. (c) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Terrestrial Water Storage Dynamics: Different Roles of Climate Variability, Vegetation Change, and Human Activities across Climate Zones in China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding terrestrial water storage (TWS) dynamics and associated drivers (e.g., climate variability, vegetation change, and human activities) across climate zones is essential for designing water resources management strategies in a changing environment. This study estimated TWS anomalies (TWSAs) based on the corrected Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity satellite data and derived driving factors for 214 watersheds across six climate zones in China. We evaluated the long-term trends and stationarities of TWSAs from 2004 to 2014 using the Mann-Kendall trend test and Augmented Dickey-Fuller stationarity test, respectively, and identified the key driving factors for TWSAs using the partial correlation analysis. The results indicated that increased TWSAs were observed in watersheds in tropical and subtropical climate zones, while decreased TWSAs were found in alpine and warm temperate watersheds. For tropical watersheds, increases in TWS were caused by increasing water conservation capacity as a result of large-scale plantations and the implementation of natural forest protection programs. For subtropical watersheds, TWS increments were driven by increasing precipitation and forestation. The decreasing tendency in TWS in warm temperate watersheds was related to intensive human activities. In the cold temperate zone, increased precipitation and soil moisture resulting from accelerated and advanced melting of frozen soils outweigh the above-ground evapotranspiration losses, which consequently led to the upward tendency in TWS in some watersheds (e.g., Xiaoxing'anling mountains). In the alpine climate zone, significant declines in TWS were caused by declined precipitation and soil moisture and increased evapotranspiration and glacier retreats due to global warming, as well as increased agriculture activities. These findings can provide critical scientific evidence and guidance for policymakers to design adaptive strategies and plans for watershed-scale water resources and forest management in different climate zones.

TI  - Modelling MODIS Land Surface Temperature Change in Antarctica from 2000 to 2019 Using Cubic Spline Model
T2  - Chiang Mai University Journal of Natural Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) data derived from the satellite is increasingly required to supplement the limited weather stations for assessing temperature trends in Antarctica. This study analyses the LST based on data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard NASA's satellite length from 2000 to 2019 at a systematic 108 sub-regions. Antarctica was divided into 12 regions, each consisting of 9 sub-regions. A cubic spline model adjusted for seasonal patterns and the autoregressive process adjusted for time series correlation. Change in LST in sub-regions was estimated by fitting the simple linear model, while cycle and acceleration were estimated using cubic spline models. Multivariate regression adjusted for spatial correlation and was used to estimate the LST increase in regions. The seasonal patterns for all 108 sub-regions were found to be quite similar. Out of 108 sub-regions, only 30 had statistically significant decreasing trends. The 12 regions showed that most temperature trends decreased, although only 5 regions were statistically significant. The results for the entire Antarctic continent showed a statistically significant decrease and a 95% confidence interval ranging from - 0.668 to -0.068 degrees C per decade.

TI  - Genitourinary melanoma: An overview for the clinician
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Genitourinary (GU) melanoma is a rare presentation of melanoma accounting for approximately 0.5% of all melanomas. GU melanomas include primary melanomas of the vulva, vagina, uterine cervix, ovary, penis, scrotum, urethra, bladder, ureter, and kidney. These melanomas are often diagnosed in advanced stages and stigma is thought to contribute to delays in presentation. As the likely diagnosing provider, it is imperative that dermatologists, urologists, and gynecologists are aware of these uncommon sites of presentation. While there have been major advances in the treatment of melanomas as a whole in the last 10 years, their applications to GU melanomas have often been overlooked. GU melanomas have not been included in many of the major phase III clinical trials which brought contemporary advanced treatments to market and the prognoses for GU melanomas remain poor. Due to the rarity of GU melanomas, much of the literature provides generalized recommendations across multiple different organs affected by GU melanomas or omits certain topics, making it difficult to appreciate the fundamentals of the individual presentations. This review aimed to provide background information on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the different sites of GU melanomas and categorize data specific to the presentation, staging, treatment, and prognosis of each type of GU melanoma to guide the clinician. It was also meant to encourage a multidisciplinary approach to the management of these patients as it spans the expertise of surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologist, dermatologists, urologists, and gynecologists.

TI  - Medium-Resolution Mapping of Evapotranspiration at the Catchment Scale Based on Thermal Infrared MODIS Data and ERA-Interim Reanalysis over North Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate quantification of evapotranspiration (ET) at the watershed scale remains an important research challenge for managing water resources in arid and semiarid areas. In this study, daily latent heat flux (LE) maps at the kilometer scale were derived from the two-source energy budget (TSEB) model fed by the MODIS leaf area index (LAI), land surface temperature (LST) products, and meteorological data from ERA-Interim reanalysis from 2001 to 2015 on the Tensift catchment (center of Morocco). As a preliminary step, both ERA-Interim and predicted LE at the time of the satellite overpass are evaluated in comparison to a large database of in situ meteorological measurements and eddy covariance (EC) observations, respectively. ERA-Interim compared reasonably well to in situ measurements, but a positive bias on air temperature was highlighted because meteorological stations used for the evaluation were mainly installed on irrigated fields while the grid point of ERA-Interim is representative of larger areas including bare (and hot) soil. Likewise, the predicted LE was in good agreement with the EC measurements gathered on the main crops of the region during 15 agricultural seasons with a correlation coefficient r = 0.70 and a reasonable bias of 30 W/m(2). After extrapolating the instantaneous LE estimates to ET daily values, monthly ET was then assessed in comparison to monthly irrigation water amounts provided by the local agricultural office added to CRU precipitation dataset with a reasonable agreement; the relative error was more than 89% but the correlation coefficient r reached 0.80. Seasonal and interannual evapotranspiration was analyzed in relation to local climate and land use. Lastly, the potential use for improving the early prediction of grain yield, as well as detecting newly irrigated areas for arboriculture, is also discussed. The proposed method provides a relatively simple way for obtaining spatially distributed daily estimates of ET at the watershed scale, especially for not ungauged catchments.

TI  - Fire in Mexican grassy-pine ecosystems
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Aims Fire is an important factor contributing to the diversity of many ecosystems. Unfortunately, misconceptions about fire frequently guide policies, threating fire-prone ecosystems whose persistence depends on such disturbance. In this paper, we highlight the importance of fire, both current and in recent history, in grassy-pine ecosystems of Mexico and clarify why it is important to understand the role of fire in such ecosystems. We also consider evidence on current fire regimes and management practices, and how they may be impacting different grassy-pine ecosystems. Results We propose a classification of pine ecosystems that acknowledges their huge differences in terms of climate, structure, and composition. Three of these communities have frequently open canopies with grassy understories: pinon woodlands, tropical savannas (Pinus oocarpa savannas) and subalpine woodlands. The majority of the grassy-pine communities are pinon woodlands, mostly in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental. Tropical savannas represent a small proportion of the total, distributed in the plains near the Pacific coast. Subalpine woodlands have the smallest area. Conclusions The lack of recognition in Mexico of the diversity of pine-dominated ecosystems as different types of vegetation with contrasting characteristics and dynamics has resulted in fragmentary information on their natural fire regimes. Evidence suggests that frequent fires may have shaped Mexican grassy-pine ecosystems. Nevertheless, evidence for pinon woodlands is still inconclusive and there may be a large variability in the natural fire regime between sites. Satellite data suggest that current fire frequency in grassy-pine ecosystems is lower than the natural one, and that it increased in recent years just as the budgets for fighting fires diminished in the country. It thus seems that misguided fire suppression policies have strongly altered natural fire regimes.

TI  - Wind turbine wakes can impact down-wind vegetation greenness
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global wind energy has expanded 5-fold since 2010 and is predicted to expand another 8-10-fold over the next 30 years. Wakes generated by wind turbines can alter downwind microclimates and potentially downwind vegetation. However, the design of past studies has made it difficult to isolate the impact of wake effects on vegetation from land cover change. We used hourly wind data to model wake and non-wake zones around 17 wind facilities across the U.S. and compared remotely-sensed vegetation greenness in wake and non-wake zones before and after construction. We located sampling sites only in the dominant vegetation type and in areas that were not disturbed before or after construction. We found evidence for wake effects on vegetation greenness at 10 of 17 facilities for portions of, or the entire growing season. Evidence included statistical significance in Before After Control Impact statistical models, differences >3% between expected and observed values of vegetation greenness, and consistent spatial patterns of anomalies in vegetation greenness relative to turbine locations and wind direction. Wakes induced both increases and decreases in vegetation greenness, which may be difficult to predict prior to construction. The magnitude of wake effects depended primarily on precipitation and to a lesser degree aridity. Wake effects did not show trends over time following construction, suggesting the changes impact vegetation greenness within a growing season, but do not accrue over years. Even small changes in vegetation greenness, similar to those found in this study, have been seen to affect higher trophic levels. Given the rapid global growth of wind energy, and the importance of vegetation condition for agriculture, grazing, wildlife, and carbon storage, understanding how wakes from wind turbines impact vegetation is essential to exploit or ameliorate these effects.

TI  - Poyang Lake Wetland Classification Using Time-Series ENVISAT ASAR Data and Beijing-1 Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Beijing-1 and ENVISAT ASAR images were used to classify wetland aquatic macrophytes in terms of their plant functional types (PFTs) over the Poyang Lake region, China. Speckle noise filtering, systematic sensor calibration within the same polarization or between different polarizations, and accurate geo-registration were applied to the time-series SAR data. As a result, time-series backscattering data, which is described as permittivity curves in this paper, were obtained. In addition, time-series indices, described as phenological curves, were derived from Beijing-1 time-series images in the classification experiment. Based on these two curves, a rule-based classification strategy was developed to extract wetland information from the combined SAR and optical data. In the rule-based wetland classification method, DEM data, submersion time index, temporal Beijing-1 images, time-series normalized difference vegetation index (TSNDVI) images, principal component analysis (PCA), and temporal ratio of ASAR time-series images were used. In addition, a decision tree-based method was used to map the wetlands. Conclusions include the following: (1) after the preprocessing of ASAR data, it was possible to satisfactorily separate different aquatic plant functional types; (2) hydrophytes from different PFTs exhibited distinct phenological, structural, moisture, and roughness characteristics due to the impact of the annual inundation of Poyang Lake wetland; and (3) more accurate results were obtained with the rule-based method than the decision tree (DT) method. Producer's and user's accuracy calculated from test samples in the classification results indicate that the DT method can potentially be used for mapping aquatic PFTs, with overall producer's accuracy exceeding 80% and higher user's accuracy for aquatic bed wetland PFTs. A comparison of producer's and user's accuracy from the rule-based classification increased from 3 to 12% and 7 to 26%, respectively, for different aquatic PFTs.

TI  - A Field-Data-Aided Comparison of Three 10 m Land Cover Products in Southeast Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To study global and regional environment protection and sustainable development and also to optimize mapping methods, it is of great significance to compare three existing 10 m resolution global land cover products in terms of accuracy: FROM-GLC10, the ESRI 2020 land cover product (ESRI2020), and the European Space Agency world cover 2020 product (ESA2020). However, most previous validations lack field collection points in large regions, especially in Southeast Asia, which has a cloudy and rainy climate, creating many difficulties in land cover mapping. In 2018 and 2019, we conducted a 56-day field investigation in Southeast Asia and collected 3326 points from different places. By combining these points and 14,808 other manual densification points in a stratified random sampling, we assessed the accuracy of the three land cover products in Southeast Asia. We also compared the impacts of the different classification standards, the different sample methods, and the different spatial distributions of the sample points. The results show that in Southeast Asia, (1) the mean overall accuracies of the FROM-GLC10, ESRI2020, and ESA2020 products are 75.43%, 79.99%, and 81.11%, respectively; (2) all three products perform well in croplands, forests, and built-up areas; ESRI2020 and ESA2020 perform well in water, but only ESA2020 performs well in grasslands; and (3) all three products perform badly in shrublands, wetlands, or bare land, as both the PA and the UA are lower than 50%. We recommend ESA2020 as the first choice for Southeast Asia's land cover because of its high overall accuracy. FROM-GLC10 also has an advantage over the other two in some classes, such as croplands and water in the UA aspect and the built-up area in the PA aspect. Extracting the individual classes from the three products according to the research goals would be the best practice.

TI  - Learning-Enhanced Adaptive Robust GNSS Navigation in Challenging Environments
T2  - IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is the widely used technology when it comes to outdoor positioning. But it has severe limitations with regard to safety-critical applications involving unmanned autonomous systems. Namely, the positioning performance degrades in harsh propagation environment such as urban canyons. In this letter we propose a new algorithm for GNSS navigation in challenging environments based on robust statistics. M-estimators showed promising results in this context, but are limited by some fixed hyper-parameters. Our main idea is to adapt this parameter, for the Huber cost function, to the current environment in a data-driven manner. Doing so, we also present a simple yet efficient way of learning with satellite data, whose number may vary over time. Focusing the learning problem on a single parameter enables to efficiently learn with a lightweight neural network. The generalization capability and the positioning performance of the proposed method are evaluated in multiple contexts scenarios (open-sky, trees, urban and urban canyon), with two distinct GNSS receivers, and in an airplane ground inspection scenario. The maximum positioning error is reduced by up to 68% with respect to M-estimators.

TI  - <i>Leptospira</i> spp. Prevalence in Cats from Southern Italy with Evaluation of Risk Factors for Exposure and Clinical Findings in Infected Cats
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease, but feline leptospirosis is rarely reported. This study aimed at investigating Leptospira spp. prevalence in cats from southern Italy, evaluating risk factors, clinical findings and laboratory data associated with infection. The serum of 112 cats was investigated by microscopic agglutination test (MAT), detecting anti-Leptospira antibodies against 14 pathogenic serovars. Blood and urine samples were tested by a real-time polymerase chain reaction targeting the lipL32 gene of pathogenic Leptospira. Antibodies against serovars Poi, Bratislava, Arborea, Ballum, Pomona and Lora were detected in 15.3% (17/111) of cats (titers range: 20-320). Leptospira spp. DNA was found in 3% (4/109) of blood and 9% (10/111) of urine samples. The spring season was the only risk factor for urinary Leptospira DNA shedding. Laboratory abnormalities significantly associated and/or correlated with Leptospira spp. positivity were anemia, monocytosis, neutrophilia, eosinopenia, increased alanine aminotransferase activity, hypoalbuminemia and hyperglobulinemia. In the investigated areas, cats are frequently infected by Leptospira spp. and can represent an additional reservoir or sentinel for a risk of infection. Moreover, some laboratory changes could be compatible with a pathogenic effect of Leptospira spp. in the feline host.

TI  - The Spatial-Temporal Differentiation of Aerosol Optical Properties and Types in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region Based on the Ecological Functional Zones
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosol pollution has seriously affected the ecological environment and human health in recent years. There are great differences in aerosol optical properties and types due to the influence of environmental conditions, meteorology, industrial and agricultural activities, and other factors of each ecological functional zones. Using MODIS aerosol products (including MCD19A2 and MODO4_3K), this study discussed the temporal and spatial distribution of aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom wavelength index (AE) and aerosol types in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH region) based on the ecological functional zones from 2015 to 2020. The results showed as follows: (1) The AOD in BTH region showed an obviously spatial pattern of low in the north and high in the south, while the spatial pattern of AE was opposite to that of AOD. In addition, the dominant aerosol type of the north part was clean aerosol, the dominant aerosol type of the middle part was biomass burning or urban-industrial aerosol, while that of the other part was mixed aerosols. (2) The seasonal changes of AOD and AE indexes in each ecological functional area had obvious seasonal changes, and the AOD and AE values were highest in summer. At the same time, the proportion of biomass combustion or urban industrial aerosol was the highest in summer. (3) The ecological functional areas with fewer human activities were dominated by clean aerosols, with lower AOD and higher AE value. The ecological functional areas dominated by cities were dominated by mixed aerosols, with higher AOD. The ecological functional areas dominated by agriculture and heavy industry were dominated by biomass combustion or urban industrial aerosols, with the largest AOD. (4) Compared with 2015, the average AOD of each ecological functional area decreased significantly to 2020, and biomass combustion or urban industrial aerosols changed to mixed aerosols.

TI  - Seasonal and Diurnal Variation of Land Surface Temperature Distribution and Its Relation to Land Use/Land Cover Patterns
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface urban heat island (SUHI) affects the quality of urban life. Because varying urban structures have varying impacts on SUHI, it is crucial to understand the impact of land use/land cover characteristics for improving the quality of life in cities and urban health. Satellite-based data on land surface temperatures (LST) and derived land use/cover pattern (LUCP) indicators provide an efficient opportunity to derive the required data at a large scale. This study explores the seasonal and diurnal variation of spatial associations from LUCP and LST employing Pearson correlation and ordinary least squares regression analysis. Specifically, Landsat-8 images were utilized to derive LSTs in four seasons, taking Berlin as a case study. The results indicate that: (1) in terms of land cover, hot spots are mainly distributed over transportation, commercial and industrial land in the daytime, while wetlands were identified as hot spots during nighttime; (2) from the land composition indicators, the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) showed the strongest influence in summer, while the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) exhibited the biggest impact in winter; (3) from urban morphological parameters, the building density showed an especially significant positive association with LST and the strongest effect during daytime.

TI  - A Data Fusion Method for Generating Hourly Seamless Land Surface Temperature from Himawari-8 AHI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High temporal resolution and spatially complete (seamless) land surface temperature (LST) play a crucial role in numerous geoscientific aspects. This paper proposes a data fusion method for producing hourly seamless LST from Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) data. First, the high-quality hourly clear-sky LST was retrieved from AHI data by an improved temperature and emissivity separation algorithm; then, the hourly spatially complete China Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) LST was calibrated by a bias correction method. Finally, the strengths of the retrieved AHI LST and bias-corrected CLDAS LST were combined by the multiresolution Kalman filter (MKF) algorithm to generate hourly seamless LST at different spatial scales. Validation results showed the bias and root mean square error (RMSE) of the fused LST at a finer scale (0.02 degrees) were -0.65 K and 3.38 K under cloudy sky conditions, the values were -0.55 K and 3.03 K for all sky conditions, respectively. The bias and RMSE of the fused LST at the coarse scale (0.06 degrees) are -0.46 K and 3.11 K, respectively. This accuracy is comparable to the accuracy of all-weather LST derived by various methods reported in the published literature. In addition, we obtained the consistent LST images across different scales. The seamless finer LST data over East Asia can not only reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of LST during different seasons, but also exactly present the diurnal variation of the LST. With the proposed method, we have produced a 0.02 degrees seamless LST dataset from 2016 through 2021 that is freely available at the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center. It is the first time that we can obtain the hourly seamless LST data from AHI.

AB  - Surgery remains the single most effective treatment for breast cancer but coincident with a deeper understanding of tumor biology and advances in multidisciplinary care (encompassing breast imaging, systemic adjuvant therapy, radiotherapy, and genomics) continues to de-escalate, supported by strong level I data. We have moved from mastectomy to breast conservation, and from routine axillary dissection to sentinel lymph node biopsy to selective omission of axillary node staging altogether. We have further de-escalated through consensus over margin width in breast conservation, through improvements in neoadjuvant therapy, and by demonstrating no benefit for upfront surgery in patients with stage IV disease. For patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, reconservation surgery and reirradiation are promising. Cell cycle and immune checkpoint inhibitors, when added to conventional systemic therapy, have now moved beyond stage IV disease to phase III trials in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings, promising even further de-escalation of surgery. Finally, with genomic profiling we are moving away from the primacy of axillary node status for prognostication and into a new era allowing prediction of response to therapy.

TI  - Longitudinal Study on Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-<i>E. coli</i> in Sentinel Mallard Ducks in an Important Baltic Stop-Over Site for Migratory Ducks in Germany
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious global health threat with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales as the most critical ones. Studies on AMR in wild birds imply a possible dissemination function and indicate their potential role as sentinel animals. This study aimed to gain a deeper insight into the AMR burden of wild waterfowl by sampling semi-wild mallard ducks used as sentinels and to identify if AMR bacteria could be recommended to be added to the pathogens of public health risks to be screened for. In total, 376 cloacal and pooled fecal samples were collected from the sentinel plant over a period of two years. Samples were screened for ESBL-carrying E. coli and isolates found further analyzed using antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing. Over the sampling period, 4.26% (16/376) of the samples were positive for ESBL-producing E. coli. Bla(CTX-M-1) and bla(CTX-M-32) were the most abundant CTX-M types. Although none of the top global sequence types (ST) could be detected, poultry-derived ST115 and non-poultry-related STs were found and could be followed over time. The current study revealed low cases of ESBL-producing E. coli in semi-wild mallard ducks, which proves the suitability of sentinel surveillance for AMR detection in water-associated wildlife.

TI  - Route Plans for UAV Aerial Surveys according to Different DEMs in Complex Mountainous Surroundings: A Case Study in the Zheduoshan Mountains, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and error-free digital elevation model (DEM) data are a basic guarantee for the safe flight of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) during surveys in the wild, especially in moun-tainous areas with large topographic undulations. Existing free and open-source DEM data gen-erally cover large areas, with relatively high spatial resolutions (similar to 90, 30, and even 12.5 m), but they do not have the advantage of timeliness and cannot accurately reflect current and up-to-date topographical information in the survey area. UAV pre-scanning missions can provide highly accurate and recent terrain data as a reference for UAV route planning and ensure security for subsequent aerial survey missions; however, they are time consuming. In addition, being limited to the electric charge of the UAV, pre-scanning increases the human, financial, and time consumption of field missions, and it is not applicable for field aerial survey missions in reality, unless otherwise specified, especially in harsh environments. In this paper, we used interferometric synthetic aper-ture radar (InSAR) technology to process Sentinel-1a data to obtain the DEMs of the survey area, which were used for route planning, and other free and open-source DEMs were also used for flightline plans. The digital surface models (DSMs) were obtained from the structure of the UAV pre-scan mission images, applying structure for motion (SfM) technology as the elevation reference. Comparing the errors between the InSAR-derived DEMs and the four open-source DEMs based on the reference DSM to analyze the practicability of flight route planning, the results showed that among the four DEMs, the SRTM DEM with a spatial resolution of 30 m performed best, which was considered as the first reference for UAV route plans when the survey area in complex mountainous regions is covered with a poor or inoperative network. The InSAR-derived DEMs from the Sentinel-1 images have great potential value for UAV flight planning, with a large perpendicular baseline and short temporal baseline. This work quantitatively analyzed the errors among the different DEMs and provided a discussion regarding UAV flightline plans based on external DEMs. This can not only effectively reduce the manpower, materials, and time consumption of field operations, improving the efficiency of UAV survey tasks, but it also broadens the use of InSAR technology. Furthermore, with the launch of high-resolution SAR satellites, InSAR-derived DEMs with high spatial and temporal resolutions provide an optimistic and credible strategy for UAV route planning with small errors.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Pattern of Ecosystem Pressure in Countries Along the Belt and Road: Combining Remote Sensing Data and Statistical Data
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Building a Green Silk Road by integrating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is one of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) visions, but the BRI faces enormous challenge that is the conflict between economic development and ecological sustainability. Understanding the current scale and trend of the impact of human activities on the ecosystem is the preliminary work to ensure that human activities do not exceed the ecological carrying capacity under the BRI. This study evaluated the ecosystem pressure in countries along the Belt and Road (B&R) from 2000-2017 based on the supply-consumption balance relationship of ecological resources. Net primary productivity (NPP) is taken as the measure of ecological resources, and the supply level and consumption intensity of ecological resources is estimated based on remote sensing data and statistical data, respectively. Results show that thirteen countries with over-consumed ecological resources concentrated in the West Asia/Middle East. Although the intensity of the ecological resource consumption correlated with ecological resource endowments, the ecosystem pressure was determined by social development dependence on the ecological resources at the same ecological resource endowments level. Nearly 80% of countries along the B&R suffered from significantly increased (P < 0.05) ecosystem pressure during 2000-2017, since most of the countries along the B&R were developing countries, and their economic development was highly dependent on ecological resources. Some West Asia/Middle East countries successfully mitigated the ecosystem pressure by importing feed for livestock. Likewise, the Southeast Asian islands benefitted from the import of agricultural products. The results highlight that the BRI should reduce the dependence of social development demands on local ecological resources by international trade for ensuring the increasing ecosystem pressure trend within the ecological carrying capacity.

TI  - The Effect of Controlled Tile Drainage on Growth and Grain Yield of Spring Barley as Detected by UAV Images, Yield Map and Soil Moisture Content
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Controlled tile drainage (CTD) practices are a promising tool for improving water balance, water quality and increasing crop yield by raising shallow groundwater level and capillary rise due to drainage flow retardation. We tested the effect of CTD on growth and grain yield of spring barley, at a study site in central Bohemia using vegetation indices from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Tile drainage flow was slowed by fixed water level control structures that increased soil moisture in the surrounding area according to the terrain slope. Vegetation indices based on red-edge spectral bands in combination with near-infrared and red bands were selected, of which the Normalized Red Edge-Red Index (NRERI) showed the closest relationships with shoot biomass parameters (dry biomass, nitrogen concentration and uptake, nitrogen nutrition index) from point sampling at the tillering stage. The CTD sites showed significantly more biomass using NRERI compared to free tile drainage (FTD) sites. In contrast, in the period prior to the implementation of CTD practices, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery did not demonstrate higher biomass based on NRERI at CTD sites compared to FTD sites. The grain yields of spring barley as determined from the yield map also increased due to CTD (by 0.3 t/ha, i.e., by 4%). The positive impact of CTD on biomass development and grain yield of spring barley was confirmed by the increase in soil moisture at depths of 20, 40 and 60 cm compared to FTD. The largest increase in soil water content of 3.5 vol% due to CTD occurred at the depth of 40 cm, which also had a higher degree of saturation of available water capacity and the occurrence of crop water stress was delayed by 14 days compared to FTD.

TI  - Investigating Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data Efficiency in Studying the Temporal Behavior of Wheat Phenological Stages Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop monitoring is critical for sustaining agriculture, preserving natural resources, and dealing with the effects of population growth and climate change. The Sentinel missions, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, provide open imagery at a high spatial and temporal resolution. This research aimed (1) to evaluate the temporal profiles derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time series data in deducing the dates of the phenological stages of wheat from germination to the fully mature plant using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) JavaScript interface and (2) to assess the relationship between phenological stages and optical/ SAR remote sensing indices for developing an accurate phenology estimation model of wheat and extrapolate it to the regional scale. Firstly, the temporal profiles derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 remote sensing indices were evaluated in terms of deducing the dates of the phenological stages of wheat. Secondly, the remote sensing indices were used to assess their relationship with phenological stages using the linear regression (LR) technique. Thirdly, the best performing optical and radar remote sensing indices were selected for phenological stage prediction. Fourthly, the spatial distribution of wheat in the TIP region was mapped by performing a Random Forest (RF) classification of the fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, with an overall accuracy of 95.02%. These results were used to characterize the growth of wheat on the TIP regional scale using the Temporal Normalized Phenology Index (TNPI) and the predicted models. The obtained results revealed that (1) the temporal profiles of the dense time series of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 indices allowed the dates of the germination, tillering, jointing heading, maturity, and harvesting stages to be determined with the support of the crop calendar. (2) The TNPIincrease and TNPIdecrease revealed that the declining part of the NDVI profile from NDVIMax, to NDVIMin2 revealed higher TNPI values (from 0.58 to 1) than the rising part (from 0.08 to 0.58). (3) The most accurate models for predicting phenological stages were generated from the WDVI and VH-VV remote sensing indices, having an R-2 equal to 0.70 from germination to jointing and an R-2 equal to 0.84 from heading to maturity.

TI  - Pure Mucinous Breast Carcinoma With a Favorable Tumor Biology and Clinical Outcomes
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BREAST HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: A few studies suggest that mucinous breast carcinoma (MBC) is a rare breast carcinoma with good prognostic features. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate biological features and clinicopathological characteristics of pure mucinous breast carcinoma (PMBC) to determine clinical outcome in PMBC. Materials and Methods: The data of 87 patients diagnosed with PMBC between November 2004 and February 2022 were retrospectively analyzed in terms of clinicopathological and demographic characteristics, management, and outcome.Results: The majority of the patients in this study were female, with a median (range) age of 63 (28-90) years. Out of 87 patients, 60 had breast conserving surgery, 27 had a mastectomy, 58 had sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and 24 had axillary dissection due to a positive SLNB or clinical axilla. Due to age and comorbidities, five patients were not suitable for axillary surgery. The median largest tumor diameter was 23 (5-100) mm. Only 23 patients (26.4%) received adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas almost all patients received hormone therapy. The median duration of follow-up was 53 (6-207) months. There was no local or systemic recurrence in any of the patients. Only 10 patients (11.5%) died from non-cancer causes during the follow-up and treatment period. In this study, tumor diameter was significantly higher in grade II/III tumors (p = 0.039) and in patients under the age of 50 (p = 0.027). Furthermore, lymph node metastasis was statistically significantly more likely in patients under the age of 50 (60% versus 40%, p = 0.013). Patients who had not received chemotherapy or radiotherapy tended to be older than 50 years (p = 0.002).Conclusion: In this study, the majority of patients were in the luminal subgroups with excellent prognosis and low incidences of lymph node metastasis. As a result, PMBC has favorable tumor biology. We believe that minimal axillary surgery would be the most appropriate approach during patient treatment, due to the low rate of lymph node involvement and favorable prognosis in PMBC patients.

TI  - Assessment of Iran's Mangrove Forest Dynamics (1990-2020) Using Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests distributed along the coast of southern Iran are an important resource and a vital habitat for species communities and the local people. In this study, accurate mapping and spatiotemporal change detection were conducted on Iran's mangroves for three decades, using the Landsat imagery available for the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. Four general vegetation indices and eight mangrove-specific indices were employed for mangrove mapping in three study sites. Additionally, six important landscape metrics were implemented to quantify the spatiotemporal alteration of the mangrove forests during the study period. Our results showed the robustness of the submerged mangrove recognition index (SMRI), validated as the most effective index (F1-score >= 0.89), which was used for mangrove identification within all nine sites. The mangrove area of southern Iran was estimated at approximately 13,000 ha in 2020, with an overall increase of 2313 ha over the whole period. A similar trend could be observed for both the landscape connectivity and complexity. Our results revealed that a stronger connectivity and higher complexity could be detected in most sites, while there was increased fragmentation and a weaker connection in some locations. This study provides an accurate map of Iran's mangrove forests over time and space.

TI  - Optimization of Remote Sensing Image Segmentation by a Customized Parallel Sine Cosine Algorithm Based on the Taguchi Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Affected by solar radiation, atmospheric windows, radiation aberrations, and other air and sky environmental factors, remote sensing images usually contain a large amount of noise and suffer from problems such as non-uniform image feature density. These problems bring great difficulties to the segmentation of high-precision remote sensing image. To improve the segmentation effect of remote sensing images, this study adopted an improved metaheuristic algorithm to optimize the parameter settings of pulse-coupled neural networks (PCNNs). Using the Taguchi method, the optimal parallelism scheme of the algorithm was effectively tailored for a specific target problem. The blindness in the design of the algorithm parallel structure was effectively avoided. The superiority of the customized parallel SCA based on the Taguchi method (TPSCA) was demonstrated in tests with different types of benchmark functions. In this study, simulations were performed using IKONOS, GeoEye-1, and WorldView-2 satellite remote sensing images. The results showed that the accuracy of the proposed remote sensing image segmentation model was significantly improved.

TI  - Changes of Inundation Frequency in the Yellow River Delta and Its Response to Wetland Vegetation
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal changes of inundation frequency in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) have profound influences on sustainable ecological protection and are also closely relevant to economic development scarcity on the coast of China. However, long-term changes of inundation frequency have remained poorly characterized. Using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform, this study processed Landsat images to explore inundation frequency changes from 1990 to 2020 in the YRD. The results indicated that (1) The existing water index combining the classification results based on the MLM (Maximum Likelihood Method) is suitable for the mapping of the long-term water bodies, especially in the coastal regions; (2) The inundation frequency showed a clearly uneven temporal-spatial distribution. The low inundation area (LIA) is mainly intertidal natural wetlands with a declining trend, while the high inundation area (HIA) is dominated by constructed wetlands with a rising trend; (3) The use frequency of artificial ponds determines the inundation frequency of the constructed wetland. The industry development has gradually matured, causing the inundation frequency from dispersion to concentration in the constructed wetland; and (4) In the natural wetland, the LIA have increased since 2010 and have accounted for 30% in 2020. The large-scale appearance of LIA occurs with the emergence of high vegetation abundance. Spartina alterniflora salt marshes with strong reproductive ability and high abundance lead to the difficulty of wetland flooding and reduce the inundation frequency.

TI  - Evaluation of Arctic Sea Ice Drift Products Based on FY-3, HY-2, AMSR2, and SSMIS Radiometer Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Different radiometer sensors have different frequencies, spatial resolutions, and time resolutions, which lead to inconsistencies in ice drift products retrieved by radiometer sensors. Based on the continuous maximum cross-correlation method, in this paper, we used China's FY-3 and HY-2 satellite radiometer data to generate sea ice drift products; we further evaluated the consistency between them and sea ice drift products retrieved from AMSR2 and SSMIS satellite radiometer data, which could help in future retrieval accuracies of more radiometer sea ice drift products. The results show that ice drift products with good reliability can be obtained by retrievals using 37 and 89 GHz channels of FY-3 and HY-2 radiometer bright temperature data. Compared with the buoy data, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the 37 GHz HY-2 sea ice drift product (at an interval of 6 days) were 1.40 cm/s and 7.31 degrees for speed and direction, respectively, and the relative errors (REs) were 5.78% and 6.44%, respectively. The RMSEs of the 37 GHz FY-3 sea ice drift product were 0.77 cm/s and 6.49 degrees for speed and direction, respectively, and the REs were 4.38% and 9.23%, respectively. Moreover, comparisons between sea ice drift vectors derived from AMSR2 and SSMIS satellites showed good quantitative agreement.

TI  - Lithological classification by PCA-QPSO-LSSVM method with thermal infrared hyper-spectral data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the accuracy and operation efficiency of lithological classification using a thermal infrared airborne hyper-spectral imager (TASI) data, an innovative combinatorial algorithm (PCA-QPSO-LSSVM) based on principal component analysis (PCA), quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO), and least-squares support vector machines (LSSVM) is proposed. After pre-processing, the emissivity data was extracted from TASI data, and 27 types of lithological units were selected in comparison with the measured spectrum and Johns Hopkins University spectrum library. The PCA was used for statistical analysis, and the appropriate n principal components were selected instead of the original 32 bands of TASI emissivity data. Based on the LSSVM classification algorithm, the improved QPSO algorithm was used to optimize the regularization parameter. and the kernel function s2 in the classification process. Finally, test samples selected from TASI data were classified by PCA-QPSO-LSSVM. The results show that, compared with the traditional LSSVM algorithm, PCA-QPOS-LSSVM has a higher recognition accuracy and greater operation efficiency. The field verification of the study area was carried out in LiuYuan town, GanSu province, China, and the accuracy of the field verification was 74.36% for the classification result, which is more consistent with the actual lithological distribution compared with the LSSVM algorithm. However, there are some flaws in this paper, such as the low classification accuracy in Moyite and plauenite. In general, The PCA-QPSO-LSSVM algorithm is a practical algorithm for lithological classification of TASI data. (c) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB  - The accuracy of land crop maps obtained from satellite images depends on the type of feature selection algorithm and classifier. Each of these algorithms have different efficiency in different conditions; therefore, developing a suitable strategy for combining the capabilities of different algorithms in preparing a land crop map with higher accuracy can be very useful. The objective of this study was to develop a fusion-based framework for improving land crop mapping accuracy. First, the features were retrieved using the Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2, and Landsat-8 imagery. Then, training data and various feature selection algorithms including recursive feature elimination (RFE), random forest (RF), and Boruta were used for optimal feature selection. Various classifiers, including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and RF, were implemented to create maps of land crops relying on optimal features and training data. After that, in order to increase the result accuracy, maps of land crops derived from several scenarios were fused using a fusion-based voting strategy at the level of decision, and new maps of land crops and classification uncertainty maps were prepared. Subsequently, the performance of different scenarios was evaluated and compared. Among the feature selection algorithms, RF accuracy was higher than RFE and Boruta. Moreover, the efficiency of RF was higher than SVM and ANN. The overall accuracy of the voting scenario was higher than all other scenarios. The finding of this research demonstrated that combining the features' capabilities extracted from sensors in different spectral ranges, different feature selection algorithms, and classifiers improved the land crop classification accuracy.

TI  - Characteristics of lymph node stations/basins metastasis and construction and validation of a preoperative combination prediction model that accurately excludes lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To explore the candidate indications for function-preserving curative gastrectomy and sentinel lymph node navigation surgery in early gastric cancer (EGC).Methods: The clinicopathological data of 561 patients with EGC who underwent radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer at Peking University Cancer Hospital from November 2010 to November 2020 with postoperative pathological stage pT1 and complete examination data, were collected. Pearson's Chi-square test was used and binary logistic regression was employed for univariate and multivariate analyses. Combined analysis of multiple risk and protective factors for lymph node metastasis (LNM) of EGC was performed. A negative predictive value (NPV) combination model was built and validated.Results: LNM occurred in 85 of 561 patients with EGC, and the LNM rate was 15.15%. NPV for LNM reached 100% based on three characteristics, including ulcer-free, moderately well differentiation and patient <65 years old or tumor located at the proximal 1/3 of the stomach. Regarding lymphatic basin metastasis, multivariate analysis showed that the metastatic proportion of the left gastric artery lymphatic basin was significantly higher in male patients compared with female patients (65.96% vs. 38.89%, P<0.05). The proportion of right gastroepiploic artery lymphatic basin metastasis in patients with a maximum tumor diameter >2 cm was significantly greater than that noted in patients with a maximum tumor diameter <= 2 cm (60.78% vs. 28.13%, P<0.05).Conclusions: Characteristics of lymph node stations/basins metastasis will facilitate precise lymph node resection. The NPV for LNM reaches 100% based on the following two conditions: young and middle-aged EGC patients, well-differentiated tumors, and without ulcers; or well-differentiated tumors, without ulcers, and tumors located in the proximal stomach. These findings can be used as the recommended indications for function -preserving curative gastrectomy and sentinel lymph node navigation surgery.

TI  - Comparison of Physical-Based Models to Measure Forest Resilience to Fire as a Function of Burn Severity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We aimed to compare the potential of physical-based models (radiative transfer and pixel unmixing models) for evaluating the short-term resilience to fire of several shrubland communities as a function of their regenerative strategy and burn severity. The study site was located within the perimeter of a wildfire that occurred in summer 2017 in the northwestern Iberian Peninsula. A pre- and post-fire time series of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery was acquired to estimate fractional vegetation cover (FVC) from the (i) PROSAIL-D radiative transfer model inversion using the random forest algorithm, and (ii) multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA). The FVC retrieval was validated throughout the time series by means of field data stratified by plant community type (i.e., regenerative strategy). The inversion of PROSAIL-D featured the highest overall fit for the entire time series (R-2 > 0.75), followed by MESMA (R-2 > 0.64). We estimated the resilience of shrubland communities in terms of FVC recovery using an impact-normalized resilience index and a linear model. High burn severity negatively influenced the short-term resilience of shrublands dominated by facultative seeder species. In contrast, shrublands dominated by resprouters reached pre-fire FVC values regardless of burn severity.

TI  - Accurate Estimation of Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> Concentration in the Coastal Areas of the Ebro Delta (NW Mediterranean) Using Sentinel-2 and Its Application in the Selection of Areas for Mussel Aquaculture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral satellite remote sensing imagery, together with appropriate modeling, have been proven to provide chlorophyll-a maps that are useful to evaluate the suitability of coastal areas for carrying out shellfish aquaculture. However, current approaches used for chlorophyll-a estimation in very shallow coastal areas often fail in their accuracy. To overcome this limitation, an algorithm that provides an accurate estimation of chlorophyll-a concentration in the coastal areas of the Ebro delta (North Western Mediterranean) using atmospherically corrected Sentinel 2 (S2) remote sensing reflectances (Rrs) has been calibrated and validated. The derived chlorophyll-a maps created have been used in a dynamic carrying capacity model that covers areas from very rich waters inside the embayment to the more oligotrophic waters in the open sea. The use of carrying capacity models is recommended to evaluate the potential of marine coastal areas for bivalve mollusk aquaculture. In this context, the depletion of chlorophyll-a is an indicator of negative environmental impact and thus a continuous monitoring of chlorophyll-a is key. The proposed methodology allows estimation of chlorophyll-a concentration from Sentinel-2 with an accuracy higher than 70% in most cases. The carrying capacity and the suitability of the external areas of the Ebro delta have been determined. The results show that these areas can hold a significant mussel production. The methodology presented in this study aims to provide a tool to the shellfish aquaculture industry.

TI  - CAPITALISM IS ENDING, BUT "PREHISTORY" IS NOT?
T2  - MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article attempts to answer the question: is the description of Modernity in terms of "capitalism" justified? The author shows that during the history of the 20th-21st centuries, the pictures of capitalism drawn by theorists got more and more atypical elements. Among these are the theories of imperialism, dependent development, a single industrial society, and especially the world-system analysis. Also noteworthy is the description "modern" applied to the societies of this period. A situation has arisen where many phenomena fit into the concept of "capitalism", or "capitalism with numerous prefixes". Thus, "capitalism" in various guises becomes "too much". Eventually, capitalism itself has come down to the universal phenomena of violence, inequality and exploitation. The productivity of discussing modernity in a paradigm revolving around the notion of "capitalism" is becoming less and less obvious. Too wide range of practices has become associated with "capitalism with prefixes", which forced a number of researchers to refuse to identify modernity with capitalism in favor of various concepts based on retro-metaphors ("neo-feudalism"). Numerous concepts of "post-capitalism" have also emerged. The author substantiates that at the theory layer, the difference between the types of what is still interpreted as "capitalism" or already as "post-capitalism" does not have a qualitative character. Of all the aforesaid, the marxian concept of human "prehistory" becomes relevant as a more universal paradigmatic frame for comprehending modern trends. Therefore, the concept of communism will still remain a worldview horizon that gives a meaning to this "prehistory". In a situation where capitalism ends, but "prehistory" does not, this will make it possible to single out social relations that determine the "prehistory" nature by themselves, and not through the prism of denouncing or apologizing (which is "capitalism" initially) of their political discourses.

TI  - Effect of Competitive Status and Experience on Heart Rate Variability Profiles in Collegiate Sprint-Swimmers
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Flatt, AA, Hornikel, B, Nakamura, FY, and Esco, MR. Effect of competitive status and experience on heart rate variability profiles in collegiate sprint-swimmers. J Strength Cond Res 36(10): 2898-2904, 2022-Interindividual differences in training history may be a determinant of heart rate variability (HRV) profiles in collegiate sprint-swimmers and may account for differences observed between elite and subelite athletes. We therefore compared HRV profiles among national-level and conference-level sprint-swimmers while accounting for individual swim-training history. Twenty-eight short-distance swimmers (18 men and 10 women) recorded postwaking HRV throughout a 4-week standardized training period. The 4-week mean ((M)) and coefficient of variation ((CV), a marker of daily fluctuation) were calculated for resting heart rate (RHR) and the natural logarithm of the root mean square of successive differences (LnRMSSD). Swimmers were categorized as national-level (n = 12) or conference-level (n = 16) competitors. Years of competitive experience was documented for each individual to index training history. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. No sex-related differences were observed for any variables (p > 0.05). LnRMSSD(M) (effect size [ES] = 0.95), LnRMSSD(CV) (ES = -1.18), RHRCV (ES = -1.05), and competitive experience (ES = 1.23) differed between status groups (p < 0.05). Accounting for multicollinearity between competitive experience and LnRMSSD variables (p < 0.05), competitive experience remained associated with LnRMSSD(M) (r = 0.44, p = 0.02). With competitive experience included as a covariate, differences in LnRMSSD(M) between status groups disappeared (p > 0.05, ES = 0.31). National-level swimmers exhibit higher and more stable LnRMSSD than that of their conference-level teammates throughout standardized training. Differences in trend characteristics were attributed to training age. This information may assist practitioners with interpreting interindividual differences in HRV profiles throughout training periods among a mixed roster of athletes.

TI  - River extraction from Gaofen-1 Satellite images combined with relative total variation and stroke width transform
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extraction of rivers from remote sensing images is crucial for understanding the utilization of water resources. Because rivers have similar and consistent widths in a consistent range of remote sensing images, the stroke width transform (SWT) algorithm has a good effect on river extraction. However, the algorithm is susceptible to the influence of features around the river. A river extraction method combining relative total variation (RTV) and SWTwas proposed to obtain river area information with high accuracy. First, the near-infrared channel of the image was selected as the input and the RTV model was used for texture smoothing and edge enhancement. Thereafter, the image edge map calculateds by the Canny operator was used as the input of the SWT to obtain the stroke width map. Subsequently, the connectivity components were labeled, and a specific filter was constructed according to the geometric characteristics of the river to filter out nonriver noise. The retained connected components were filled with holes, and a highly accurate river basin map was generated. In this study, six images of rivers flowing through four different landforms, including woodland, urban, mountainous, and cultivated land, were captured by the Gaofen-1 satellite for validation and comparison analysis. The experimental results demonstrated that the method's completeness, accuracy, and extraction quality in this study could be maintained above 95%. Compared with the mainstream methods of the Otsu method, normalized difference water index, U-Net, and direct use of the SWT algorithm, the method in this study is significantly better in terms of extraction effect and algorithm stability. This can effectively improve the accuracy of river segmentation. (c) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring of Changes in Lake Aquatic Vegetation before and after the Removal of the Fence Based on Sentinel-2: A Case Study in Lake Futou, Hubei Province
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquatic vegetation is an important component and main primary producer of lake ecosystems and plays an important role in improving water quality and maintaining biodiversity, which is critical to diagnosing the health of aquatic ecosystems in shallow lakes. It is therefore important to accurately obtain information on dynamic changes and spatial-temporal distribution of aquatic vegetation. Based on the Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing images from 2016-2022, we studied the feasibility of using remote sensing technology to monitor the spatial-temporal changes of aquatic vegetation before and after the removal of the fence, taking Futou Lake in Hubei Province as a case study. Two vegetation indices, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Index (SAVI) were applied to identify the open water and the aquatic vegetation through two threshold determination methods, Otsu algorithm and manual division threshold method. The results show that: (1) the classification based on the NDVI and manual division threshold method performs the best, with the overall classification accuracy of 94.44% and the Kappa coefficient of 85.23%. (2) The growth of aquatic vegetation is divided into stages, the first stage is enclosing culture, and the distribution of aquatic vegetation is less in 2016-2017, all around 10 km(2). The second stage is after the removal of the fence, the distribution area of aquatic vegetation in 2018 is on an upward trend, and in 2019-2022 it is growing rapidly. (3) Spatially, the aquatic vegetation was mainly distributed at the former fence, specifically in the northeastern and southwestern waters of the Futou Lake and it spread to the core area of the lake, probably due to the elevation of the siltation of the lake bottom. (4) Potamogeton crispus and Trapa are the dominant species, the peak of the distribution range in Futou Lake occurs in 2021 with an area of about 50.89 km(2), which needs to be controlled moderately. (5) The area covered by Potamogeton crispus in the Futou Lake has increased significantly, probably due to the siltation and accumulation of nutrients in the Futou Lake caused by the history of purse seine farming.

AB  - Whereas a selective yet representative sample of Anglo-American scholarship undermines its own intentions to explain Gadamer's language-ontology and theory of time by confusing the ground of beings with beings, Cheng and Gadamer explain how a transformation in human existence allows for a temporalization of Being in time that incorporates the subjectivity of the human subject. This argument draws on the dual structure of their cosmogenic worldview in the source and origins of their traditions (Lao Zi/Heraclitus) and has implications for Cheng's organistic model of causality: It depends on mechanical causation to understand things in themselves.
